If it wasn\u2019t for them, Yu IlHan definitely would have died. Just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if it didn\u2019t die, the dungeon\u2019s exit wouldn\u2019t have opened, and if so, we would have died as well. So it\u2019s us who should be thanking you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that Kang HaJin had a very stiff head and didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, but he didn\u2019t say it out loud. Instead, he spoke while picking up the black magic stone and Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s relics.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can take this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Momentarily, Kang HaJin\u2019s eyebrows twitched, but he couldn\u2019t say \u2018that\u2019s a bit too\u2026\u2026\u2019 now, since that would be going against his words. Honestly, it wouldn\u2019t be exaggerated to say that Yu IlHan had killed it all by himself, so Kang HaJin eventually decided to clearly give up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, YuNa would probably not be against it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa didn\u2019t object it either. Instead, she demanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me your numberrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao, I got rejected again! Even though I\u2019m so pretty! Even though I\u2019m the prettiest in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was definitely beautiful. Since it was Yu IlHan, who would not eye anyone below an angel, who acknowledged that, it could be said that her appearance was exceptional.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the order of sequence: whether she became like that since she was blessed by the Goddess of Beauty, or whether she was blessed because she was pretty; but she was beautiful to the point that he could realize that she wasn\u2019t blessed by the Goddess of Beauty for nothing.</p><br/><p>He also understood why she was so proud of her appearance. Although, honestly, he felt unpleasant about it.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan rejected even her even more because of her confidence, and confirmed with Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there anything else that I need to do in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There should be, but not now. We all need rest. You worked very hard so you should rest now. The rest will be taken care of by us, as we should be responsible for this in the first place.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in my opinion, I think it will become even more dangerous if your powers are restricted again doing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yu IlHan\u2019s sharp opinion, Erta replied while smiling helplessly.</p><br/><p>[In fact, I\u2019m worried about that as well. We will probably seal the dungeon itself using Heaven\u2019s power, and will probably give out quests to humans later. To those like you, who have exceptional ability.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ended up laughing.</p><br/><p>However, to blame her for anything, she worked very hard today, so he decided to shut his mouth. Erta also seemed to have felt his consideration as she quietly lay on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out togetherrrr. You won\u2019t reject that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already left the party. His passive concealment would probably activate again when they arrive in Korea, so he should be able to leave them. As such, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t bother rejecting that.</p><br/><p>He had already finished his business here anyway. Splitting up here was instead more annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will drink beer with MiRae, when I go back to Korea!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, drink with us toooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, I keep getting rejected today.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Na YuNa didn\u2019t seem to be tired at all, as she kept chatting. If acting childish was her secret to her beauty, then he wouldn\u2019t really want to imitate that.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t feel so bad about her screaming \u2018kyak kyak\u2019 from time to time, so Yu IlHan looked at that scene with a faint smile. With the thought that she might miss Yu IlHan\u2019s figure if she kept chatting loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is your naaame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>To think that she called out to him when his concealment seemed like it would activate in just a few more moments, was that a simple coincidence? Just why does this woman show a completely different side to her at completely unexpected times\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became a little nervous. Whether she knew that or not, Na YuNa continued speaking with an innocent voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked Feyta before, but she said she\u2019ll die if she tells me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I definitely don\u2019t want an angel cobra twist!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s beyond the level where you should put an \u2018angel\u2019 in front of it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While retorting blandly to Feyta, Yu IlHan thought for a moment. The one he thought about was Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>First, it was a clear fact that Kang MiRae and these two belonged to the same group. Moreover, from Na YuNa\u2019s chatters, he could judge that they were friends. Since Kang HaJin had the same surname, it was likely that he and Kang MiRae were kins.</p><br/><p>They will defniitely talk about Yu IlHan with her, and Kang MiRae should be able to think up of Yu IlHan the moment they mention concealment, spear, and Korean. It\u2019s not that Yu IlHan was being arrogant. It\u2019s just that there are no strong people with those characteristics on Earth right now, other than him.</p><br/><p>In other words, there\u2019s no meaning in hiding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa, such a cool name!\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was the first to say that so nonchalantly as soon as she heard his name. The best social butterfly of social butterflies, the queen of social butterflies was here.</p><br/><p>Honestly, he didn\u2019t feel that bad hearing that, but his strong resolve that loners cannot associate with social butterflies made him calm.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Kang HaJin was looking at him as if looking at a strange human. Even he, who grew up with Na YuNa from their toddler age, had his heart pound sometimes, when looking at her, but he could feel that Yu IlHan was rejecting Na YuNa honestly.</p><br/><p>He really wished that that wouldn\u2019t provoke Na YuNa\u2019s challenging mind. She always looked clumsy, but exactly due to that, it was unknown what she would do. Fortunately, as she was more interested in making herself look pretty rather than a man, it would be alright to not assume the worst\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to back down so much. I won\u2019t eat youuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re too close, it makes me unpleasant and hot so go away a little further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, Na YuNa seemed like she enjoyed the conversation with Yu IlHan. Well, she might feel new about Yu IlHan\u2019s reactions, who was different to other men, since other men either exaggeratedly close, or exaggeratedly wild.</p><br/><p>New things bring with it, joy, but there was a limit to that. If there was no reaction, she was bound to get bored with it eventually. Just what kind of charm would she feel to someone who keeps rejecting her? Seeing Na YuNa giggling so much, Kang HaJin\u2019s worries indeed seemed like it would end as worries.</p><br/><p>They could escape the dungeon soon, but amazingly, in front of the dungeon, a few angels were waiting, fully armed.</p><br/><p>Seeing those stiff expressions, they already seemed to know what happened inside the dungeon.</p><br/><p>[Erta.]</p><br/><p>A female angel wearing an armor of light, at their front, called Erta\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>[Report.](armored angel)</p><br/><p>[I understand.](Erta)</p><br/><p>From Erta\u2019s polite speech, it seemed that that angel was in a higher position than Erta. Yu IlHan looked at Feyta, wondering why they didn\u2019t call out to her even though she suffered through the same thing, and she replied in a small voice.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because I\u2019m a newbie.](Feyta)</p><br/><p>[Quiet.](armored angel)</p><br/><p>[Hik.](Feyta)</p><br/><p>Erta and the armored angel seemed to converse for a while before they turned their heads towards Yu IlHan. The armored angel spoke.</p><br/><p>[Human Yu IlHan, it seems difficult to rewards you immediately.](armored angel)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, okay. You can give it to me after you finish work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head when he heard the word \u2018reward\u2019, before he realized that it was for saving Erta.</p><br/><p>Definitely, since Erta got seen, he couldn\u2019t attack it first with a strong attack, and that made the battle a little disadvantageous. However, it wasn\u2019t like he wanted a reward while he was saving Erta, so Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t think of that until he heard the word \u2018reward\u2019.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what you are thinking about with this matter, but this incident is very important even to Heaven. For a more accurate story, we will borrow Erta for a little.](armored angel)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then\u2026\u2026 Everyone gather. We will now proceed with sealing the dungeon temporarily.](armored angel)</p><br/><p>[Yes!]</p><br/><p>With just one heavy line from the armored angel, all the angels in that area gathered at the front of vortex-entrance. Yu IlHan fell into thought while seeing the entrance to the dangerous dungeon being closed.</p><br/><p>Is this kind of dungeon the only in this place? Perhaps, won\u2019t these kind of dungeons keep appearing in the future? Perhaps, someone\u2019s will had played a role in this dungeon? If so, what for?</p><br/><p>The thought that started from a hypothesis kept chaining on until it scattered away like smoke. This thought was impossible to come to a conclusion in the first place, nor was there a need to come to one.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gripped his fist while thinking back to Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s smile that he saw at her last moments.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less of what\u2019s going on. He would only become stronger in order to survive. He had no plans in shivering in fear of the things that have not even occurred yet.</p><br/><p>The temporary sealing of the dungeon was over. The angels only stopped emitting their power only after they saw that the vortex of the dungeon decreased and eventually became a metallic gate.</p><br/><p>[With this incident, Earth has become the world with the most variables, where God\u2019s power is especially not effective. According to that, the angels assigned to Earth will increase in the future.]</p><br/><p>While he was quietly looking at the dungeon\u2019s entrance, Yu IlHan could hear an angel\u2019s voice in his ears.</p><br/><p>When he looked back, amazingly, he could see the armored angel, who kept her stiff attitude all this time, smiling slightly with the corner of her mouth slightly raised.</p><br/><p>[Lita really seemed to want to see you. It was painful to endure her hysteria until now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought of the things he thought when fighting Reta Kar\u2019iha alone, and his face became a little red. It was fortunate that he was covering his face with a mask.</p><br/><p>No, rather than that, just how much does this poor angel talk about Yu IlHan to the other angels to the point that the angels that Yu IlHan meets talk about Lita!?</p><br/><p>While he was thinking that, at one moment, Yu IlHan realized what the armored angel was implying and widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cW, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then, Yu IlHan, I wish you luck in your future. I will send Erta back as soon as the business is done.]</p><br/><p>[Feyta, you come too.]</p><br/><p>[Wait, I need to prote\u2026\u2026 Uwaaa!]</p><br/><p>The angels vanished in an instant. Taking back his hand he stretched towards the armored angel, Yu IlHan grumbled quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSneaky\u2026 She should have told me to the end if she was going to at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re very friendly with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Kang HaJin, who was stiff throughout the entire incident since he was overwhelmed by the angels\u2019 auras, became surprise yet again after looking at Yu IlHan\u2019s attitude. Now, he was even tired of feeling inferior to him.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no way Yu IlHan would know of that, so he could only make a vague smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back nooow. HaJin-oppa, IlHan-oppaaaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who simply wouldn\u2019t understand the situation ended the situation and pulled on the two\u2019s clothes. Kang HaJin sighed in defeat, and Yu IlHan felt electrified due to the power of social butterfly queen after hearing the change in her way of calling him, and cut her off with the power of a loner king.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have no plans in becoming close with you, so don\u2019t call me so closely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who became to enjoy Yu IlHan\u2019s reactions, kept talking to him until they got on the airplane at the airport. Of course, Yu IlHan escape them since he had to stowaway, so she could only hope for another meeting.</p><br/><p>Although, it was unknown when that meeting would come.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin dong idiotic things trying to take back his pride. Did you know? Many smart and wise people ruin their work due to pride.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s AT field was strong!</p><br/><p>Thanks for waiting. (T/N: Guess who appears in the next chapter, though, it\u2019s quite obvious)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Last chapter for a while\u2026 due to exams\u2026</p><br/><p>Fresh out of my brain yet again!

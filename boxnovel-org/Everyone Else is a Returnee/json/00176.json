However, Yu IlHan\u2019s parents, and the ones who had close ties with him, were at a loss what to do.</p><br/><p>And once, Kang MiRae received a comm. The person? The person she feared the most right now in the world, Yu IlHan\u2019s mother Kim YeSeul. Extremely nervously, Kang MiRae went to meet her with Na YuNa and Yumir accompanying them.</p><br/><p>But a beautiful lady who looked less than 30 of years age, was the one who greeted them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you, Mr. Yu IlHan\u2019s older sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my. Hoho, does it look like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, you aren\u2019t!? I\u2019m very sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae acquired points from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo my IlHan didn\u2019t contact you ladies either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, other than the periodic signals\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae suspected that Yu IlHan\u2019s family would know something about him, but Kim YeSeul was in the same situation as her. Rather, she probably looked for Kang MiRae because she wanted to hear about Yu IlHan\u2019s situation from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoney, he didn\u2019t call, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean call. When a man does something big\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul looked towards Yu YongHan who came back from working at Vanguard, with a \u2018maybe he knows\u2019 gaze, but the answer was disappointing. Kang MiRae finally noticed Yu YongHan and was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, so you were here. I\u2019m very sorry\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*. Don\u2019t worry about it. My presence becomes very thin from time to time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae thought that blood was indeed very thick, but then also thought about how she had to acknowledge Yumir as Yu IlHan\u2019s son, and shook her head. Kim YeSeul looked at Kang MiRae with a mysterious sense of satisfaction, and tapped her shoulders with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe comms are coming, and if it\u2019s IlHan, he\u2019ll do fine, so don\u2019t worry about it so much. Aren\u2019t you really busy as well? I see you on TV all the time. Don\u2019t you work in the front lines?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN, no. That was all thanks to Mr. IlHan, and I have nothing to\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words are pretty too. And this guy, he was going on and on about how he wasn\u2019t confident\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s smile became thicker; and it widened yet again after seeing the figure of Na YuNa who was hugging Yumir in her arms, next to Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>Her son had talent! To think about it, although the blood of Yu YongHan was running inside him, half of the blood was hers!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes. Do you want to have a meal before you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, in fact, I have to go clean up the aftermath of the previous gate\u2026.. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Rather than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kang MiRae titled her head, Kim YeSeul asked her in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, from what I saw on TV, you wield lightning rather well. Are you well-versed in magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I do have some degree of confidence\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my. How talented of you. Magic is a hard thing to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026.. I\u2019m nothing compared to Mr. IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae was undermining her ability, but when evaluating, there was really no need to compare herself with others.</p><br/><p>There were only two types of people that didn\u2019t look strange even when they did something so evil, and those were mothers who compared her own son with a friend\u2019s, or lovers who compared oneself with the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you want to come here for a second? I have something to show you. I can\u2019t comprehend this with my eyes, so I want to listen to another person\u2019s opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u2026\u2026 Does mother use magic as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul nodded with a flower-blooming smile on her face. Only she would know if that was due to Kang MiRae calling her \u2018mother\u2019 or because she was proud of her ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, would you like to come inside this room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was there a need to switch locations? Confused, Kang MiRae followed her. Of course, Na YuNa and Yumir also followed them inside.</p><br/><p>The place they headed to was the bedroom. Even though that room had to be an ordinary room inside a household, the moment Kim YeSeul closed the door and closed the curtains, a strange mana started to circulate. Kang MiRae intuitively felt that it was a type of a barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to do this outside. No matter how I look at it, higher existences were involved with this. But at least inside here, there\u2019s no worry of information leaking out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she heard that, Kang MiRae felt shivers. Barrier? Avoiding the watch of higher existences?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even she did not have the confidence to make such a barrier. No, not only that, no mages she had met until now could deploy a barrier of this caliber.</p><br/><p>Of course, she must have used an artifact to help\u2026. wait, an artifact? She was in possession of an artifact that could deploy such a high-level barrier? Did Yu IlHan make it? But he didn\u2019t look like he was aware of Kim YeSeul\u2019s ability\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>While Kang MiRae fell into confusion from just a fragment of Kim YeSeul\u2019s abilities, Kim YeSeul took out a staff from nowhere and lightly swung it. With that, the air split apart and a crack appeared. It was interspatial storage.</p><br/><p>Interspatial storage!?</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have it inside here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae gave up judgement. Until now, she just thought that Yu IlHan was a mutant, but that wasn\u2019t the case. His DNA was inherited!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, you don\u2019t have to be so nervous. This has already lost its power as a magic formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic\u2026\u2026. formation\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s voice contained a strong sense of doubt, but Kim YeSeul didn\u2019t mind that and flicked her staff. With that, a thick, red something came out from the crack in the air, very, very slowly.</p><br/><p>That, which was originally intact, was a dead magic formation now that it had lost the core power, and was completely sealed inside a strong magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul made a difficult smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a little awkward for me to say this, this was ridiculously strong. Although I can use magic well, theoretical stuff like this is not my expertise. Do you understand it, miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae was about to answer that she didn\u2019t know anything about such a horrifying item, but she could indeed understand some of the characters engraved on the formation.</p><br/><p>And, this was something she had seen from an extreme minority of Yu IlHan\u2019s crafts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I think I can understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae replied while gritting her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like mother\u2026\u2026. has come across the schemes of a fallen angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae succeeded in discovering a portion of the characters that were etched on Yu IlHan\u2019s wings, Ruin Calling.</p><br/><p>When Kang MIRae asked about Ruin Calling in the past, Yu IlHan nonchalantly replied to her that he referenced a magic language that is used by higher existences. What that meant, that this matter, had something to do with the Army of Brilliant Light, who were composed of those that were once angels.</p><br/><p>From how the Army of Brilliant Light had teamed up with the Destruction Demon Army before, they were probably scheming something together this time as well. However, the most frustrating thing was that she did not know what they planned to do with this magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was in the world mother was connected to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it was in a really secretive place as well. Ehem\u2026.. I was only able to find it because I can wield magic well. It would have been hard for anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo mother is saying\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if, there are copies of these in other worlds? The world I resided in was relatively peaceful without any interference from the higher existences. However, ever since I found this item, I thought that there may be things like these in other worlds as well, and that if this was true, those magic formations were not made to endanger those native to each of the worlds, but rather, it was targeted at the people from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul had a much smarter head than the useless angels. It was plenty amazing that she had found and nullified the magic formation, but she had already reached a conclusion with just a single magic formation!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, to prove my hypothesis, I need to see if there are similar magic formations in other worlds or not. That\u2019s why I called you here. I can trust you from how you worked with my son from the past, and you are quite exceptional yourself as a mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that the situation looked urgent, Kang MiRae\u2019s cheeks reddened. Kim YeSeul laughed as though she didn\u2019t have any intentions on hiding her thoughts. It was even more funny that Kang MiRae didn\u2019t acknowledge that fact.</p><br/><p>While the hidden expert at delusions, Kim YeSeul, spent an enjoyable time judging her potential daughter-in-law, Yumir and Na YuNa also had a look at the formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is an enormous amount of mana in this. It\u2019s similar to the mana used by the angel-noonas.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s an evil aura. What would be a way to cause harm on Earth by making magic formations in other worlds~?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move first. It won\u2019t be too late to come to conclusions then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The biggest problem with this matter was that they did not know who to trust. It was obvious that there were traitors among the angels, but they couldn\u2019t come up with any potential candidate angels to discuss this with. In the first place, the only two angels they considered allies were Erta and Liera. And right now, they were with Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>This would have been solved instantly if Yu IlHan was here \u2013 thought Kang MiRae and she sighed before slapping her own cheeks. She had just decided to not rely on him, but she instinctively looked for him! When did she become so weak?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t trust the higher existences. We need to move ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. With Mir in the mix, we\u2019d be able to do it~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir had mastered concealment not long ago. With his concealment specializing in party concealment, there was nothing for them to fear. Moreover, it would be quite a site to look at once the skill evolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, mother. Is it possible that you can lend us your\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll help. I brought up this topic, I can\u2019t be left out now, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae sighed in relief when she heard that. With such a strong mage as her ally, really, there was nothing to be afraid of! With Mir\u2019s power in the mix, she thought that they might perhaps be able to go against higher existences.</p><br/><p>If there was one question, it was about how such a strong person stayed unknown until now\u2026.. as if having read her thoughts, Kim YeSeul scratched her cheeks and laughed cutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t participate in anything until now, I guess I can fill a little of my son\u2019s place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah. If Mr. IlHan was here these kinds of trivial matters would\u2026.. Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae punished herself for the 2nd time. Then spoke with swollen cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll depart as soon as you\u2019re comfortable with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine at any time, but what about you, missy? You have a lot to do right now.</p><br/><p>Replied Kim YeSeul, but Kang MiRae shook her head without even thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that we may end up with an irreversible situation if we left this magic formation alone. There is a priority to everything. Although other things are important\u2026\u2026 I feel that this must come at the top.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear. Your shoulders will break at that rate. Such a beautiful lady, who does not have a life of her own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m different from MiRae! I\u2019m fine as long as my friends are good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little too much, little lady. Hm, I\u2019m thinking of something in between the two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa sunk. So the reason Yu IlHan could reject Na YuNa outright was because he took after his mother! Thinking that this household was really charming, Na YuNa burned in passion, as Kang MiRae smacked her on the forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince mother said it was alright, then let\u2019s go right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going with four, without HaJin-oppa this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this four-person combo would be much stronger. And my brother needs to look after the Lightning God clan while we aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poor Kang HaJin was receiving a poor evaluation even in places where he wasn\u2019t present. Kim YeSeul laughed while listening to their conversation, and hugged Yumir.</p><br/><p>The reason she decided to move for real, was because of him. Yumir was the best helper in moving while avoiding the watchful gaze of others.</p><br/><p>As Yumir was well-endowed in looking cute in the eyes of older ladies, he rubbed his cheeks on her naturally. Really, he was a weapon of mass destruction, not incomparable to the scale of Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Mir. You must protect this grandma well, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019ll protect grandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be more persuasive if Kim YeSeul was called Yumir\u2019s older sister with Kim YeSeul becoming younger by the day, but Kang MiRae and Na YuNa decided not to retort on that.</p><br/><p>Instead, they decided to take more care of their skins in the future. It would be a little sad if Yu IlHan said they looked older than his mom!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae does quite well, including seeing through the true head of the household!</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s loss, yet again.</p><br/><p>In fact, if Yu IlHan was there, the higher existences wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything properly. Now, he just disappeared, but now his mother is up!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>As you see from the title, and this chapter, I think that we won\u2019t be getting MC for a while.</p><br/><p>Well, he does appear at the end of next chapter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

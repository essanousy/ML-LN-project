Although its origins were unknown, the spear was made from an ancient metal. Just looking at it was enough for anyone to tell that it was a God-ranked artifact.</p><br/><p>[The light that clads you. It is a mere coating that will peel off with a few scratches!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting claim.\u201d</p><br/><p>But what was more interesting was the God ranked artifact he was holding. It wasn\u2019t like he only had one God-ranked artifact despite being the God\u2019s deputy, and he was also the de-facto leader of the Four Great Archangels\u2026 Though, he did have to be cautious about the God ranked artifact\u2019s power\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoops. Why are you in such a rush\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A spear of flames and a spear of metal clashed in midair. Like how Michael\u2019s fire didn\u2019t work against Yu IlHan, Yu IlHan\u2019s own fire was not 100% effective against an angel that manipulated fire. As a result, the first clash was a draw\u2026\u2026 or so it seemed.</p><br/><p>[!?]</p><br/><p>Michael was about to step back after exchanging light blows, but he found himself unable to take a step back, leading to a look of confusion. His could not withdraw his spear after the clash.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>From the outside, it looked like they were having a friendly conversation. Michael\u2019s expression stiffened fearfully.</p><br/><p>[What did you do?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan pulled his flaming spear towards him, the metallic spear slid to his hands as well. This was not just any Epic or Chaos rank, but a God-ranked one! Michael couldn\u2019t let it be stolen and desperately pulled on it, and as a result, even his body was flung forward. Yu IlHan\u2019s cold and sharp kick hit him squarely on the chest.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kugh!]</p><br/><p>[Lord Michael!]</p><br/><p>If it was the lower existence Yu IlHan of before, he couldn\u2019t possibly deal any damage to Michael with a light kick, but right now he was a ruler-class being with a level that surpassed 500. With a single kick containing God Force, Michael\u2019s body was pushed across the air, and the God-ranked spear fell into Yu IlHan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>[Do you think physically taking it away will make it yours?!!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is a splendid spear. It inflicts the enemy with a wound that cannot be cured, and the wounds caused by this will never stop bleeding\u2026\u2026 and the one that is acknowledged as master of this weapon can heal himself by injuring others. Isn\u2019t this quite the vicious weapon for an angel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan swung it a few times to read the records from it, and struck it into the Flamesoul Dragon body without hesitation. Was he trying to harm himself?</p><br/><p>Michael was shocked at the scene, but became speechless the next moment. The God-ranked artifact was sucked into the armor while giving rise to ripples, as if it was being thrown into a pond.</p><br/><p>[Yu, IlHan\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the spear he was holding slightly changed in shape. The spear body became a little longer, and a special insignia was engraved on the blade. Michael immediately realized what this meant. He subconsciously groaned.</p><br/><p>[No way\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s not true. That cannot possibly happen.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. Time to test it out, I guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>This time, it was Yu IlHan\u2019s turn. Without having to speak anything, Yumir roared out and flapped his wings, giving rise to a volley of flames! The moment Yu IlHan \u2018wished\u2019 to be in front of the enemy, he appeared in front of the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuh\u2026\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>With firm movements, Yu IlHan lashed out with his spear. Michael proved that he wasn\u2019t God\u2019s deputy for nothing and dodged before Yu IlHan could even reach him, but Yu IlHan\u2019s spear wasn\u2019t just a simple physical attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The skill, Transcendent Trajectory, has become level 9.]</p><br/><p>With numerous techniques fusing into one with the Spear of Untraceable Trajectory and the Great Cosmos-severing Spear as the foundation, it had reborn into a trajectory that surpassed cause and effect, space, and fate. That was why the name was \u2018Transcendent Trajectory\u2019.</p><br/><p>It was not avoidable by dodging, nor was it defensible by blocking, undetectable by sight, nor could it be heard by listening.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kuu\u2026\u2026 Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>The moment a line that only the Supreme can make, was drawn, A burst of white blood scattered from Michael\u2019s chest even though he was far away from Yu Ilhan.</p><br/><p>Endlessly.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t tell me, you really copied the artifact\u2026\u2026 It was what the LORD gave me!]</p><br/><p>[Lord Michael!]</p><br/><p>Raphael couldn\u2019t just stay still and used his power on him. The unparalleled ability of healing shrouded Michael. However, Yu IlHan only laughed.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not stopping. Lord Michael\u2019s blood is\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 Kugh, obviously. The power of a God ranked artifact cannot be ignored by you, Raphael, or even me.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan once again rushed towards Michael and swung his spear. Michael knew that it was useless to dodge, instead summoning another artifact to meet it head on, but the artifact was instantly crushed and another injury appeared on his body. Michael held back his groan, but Raphael couldn\u2019t endure anymore. A spear of wind appeared in his hands.</p><br/><p>[Impudent being. How dare you covet the authority of Heaven just because you became a little stronger!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, come at me. You won\u2019t be able to recover so easily like last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>Yumir cried along with Yu IlHan\u2019s intent. The wind generated from his body made the fire burning on Yu IlHan\u2019s armor stronger. The resonance between the two deepened, and the already gigantic spear became even more threatening.</p><br/><p>[Raphael! Do not let your guard down!]</p><br/><p>[Lord Michael, please rest! We cannot turn tail in front of the devil when we serve the only LORD!]</p><br/><p>[Raphael!]</p><br/><p>A devil, eh. It finally came to that. Yu IlHan made a bitter smile while watching Raphael who was flying with the help of wind and with his partially ripped wings. He really looked like a holy angel on God\u2019s orders, making him feel like he really was playing the role of a devil.</p><br/><p>However, if he had to acquire the title of devil just because he wanted to become strong in order to survive.</p><br/><p>He\u2019ll gladly take it.</p><br/><p>[O Father, bless my every steps! Bestow me the power to defeat the devil!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHhp.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was no time to think about anything. Yu IlHan gripped onto his spear in order to strike back.</p><br/><p>[Hah!]</p><br/><p>However, someone appeared behind him just before he clashed with Raphael. It was none other than Keshein, the 1st Battalion Commander of the Destruction Demon Army. However, Yu IlHan only slashed once. Though, in fact, he just didn\u2019t have the time to attack both forward and back.</p><br/><p>[Kugh\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Kihigh!]</p><br/><p>Raphael clenched his teeth to block it, but Keshein made a smile of victory. It was worth it to come here! Weakening the Heaven\u2019s Army, and he shall become stronger! He felt like he could see the future filled with destruction and bliss.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>It was a very precise moment, and everyone here knew of Keshein\u2019s strength, so it was no wonder that the higher existences there thought that Yu IlHan\u2019s rampage will finally come to a stop. However, the results betrayed all of their imaginations.</p><br/><p>[K, ugh\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Kigh!]</p><br/><p>Even though there was only a single strike that swept through the air, there were two wounds. Raphael couldn\u2019t block Yu IlHan\u2019s spear and was shot away while spurting blood from his chest, while Keshein fell down before his claws could reach Yu IlHan\u2019s head as his neck was perforated multiple times before he could reach him. Yu IlHan\u2019s slash and piercing attacks were realized in two different directions at once.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the records of Lv 588 Keshein.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 525. 10 Strength, 5 Agility, 5 Health, 10 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Transcendent Trajectory, has become level 13.]</p><br/><p>[Aah, how can-]</p><br/><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even listen to Raphael\u2019s final words and mercilessly struck his spear into his forehead. The spear pierced through his brain and that was it.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 585 Raphael.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 530. 8 Strength, 7 Agility, 5 Health, 5 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Declaration, has become level 19.]</p><br/><p>The numerous higher existences residing in that world were momentarily awestruck, they didn\u2019t understand what had happened and just watched on with dumbfounded expressions. However, after Keshein and Raphael\u2019s corpses were sucked into Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory, they finally realized that the two had met their deaths.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dad, I levelled up a lot again!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Mir.\u201d</p><br/><p>The father and son exchanged smiles that didn\u2019t fit in this situation and praised each other, and this scene looked very out-of-place to the onlookers. In fact, it looked very vicious and fearful as well. They felt as if the entire world had been frozen and was broken into pieces.</p><br/><p>[Even Keshein and Raphael were\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[One of the Four Great Archangels\u2026\u2026 died?]</p><br/><p>[The 1st Battalion Commander of the Destruction Demon Army, was so easily\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his head. While everyone retreated a step back in fear, only Michael, who had to witness the death of Raphael right in front of his eyes, despaired.</p><br/><p>[Dammit, DAMMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s as if, that being is\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Everyone was paying attention to Yu IlHan. However, their gazes were now fundamentally different from how they viewed him before.</p><br/><p>Hostility from the angels and wrath from fallen angels, desire from the Destruction Demon Army and pleasure from the Garden of Sunset. The four specific emotions before had now changed to just one.</p><br/><p>[We cannot do anything about that being.]</p><br/><p>[We need to run. Run!]</p><br/><p>It was a sense of admiration and a deep, overwhelming wave of horror.</p><br/><p>[Run.]</p><br/><p>[Before he closes all the paths from this world.]</p><br/><p>[Why is Lord Satan only watching?]</p><br/><p>[He is one that will enjoy even this. This is a world that is connected to the Netherworld. He must be enjoying watching whether this transcender will take over or just abandon this world.]</p><br/><p>[Retreat. We cannot get in his way.]</p><br/><p>[Run.]</p><br/><p>The Garden of Sunset and the Army of Brilliant Light were the first to move. The Garden of Sunset didn\u2019t participate in this seriously in the first place, and the Army of Brilliant Light immediately opted to retreat after seeing that Satan didn\u2019t react to this.</p><br/><p>[Lord Michael.]</p><br/><p>[Lord Michael!]</p><br/><p>Michael raised his head a little after that. The angels scattered around the world had all come back and were looking at him. Yu IlHan was just watching him without attacking for some reason, and Michael knew precisely why he did so, which made him more angry.</p><br/><p>However, despite that.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026We will retreat.]</p><br/><p>[Yes, sir.]</p><br/><p>The angels all started disappearing as if they had waited for that order to come down. Even those fanatics realized the difference in power.</p><br/><p>Michael watched as they all returned, and when he was the only one left, he finally raised his head to glare at Yu IlHan. Feeling the boiling mana inside him, Yu IlHan leaked out a laugh.</p><br/><p>[The LORD shall punish you for your sins.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really curious, but are you going to die if God tells you to?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If such is the will of God. And according to the same will, you shall definitely die.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd God really said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Michael disappeared without giving an answer. Then, the ones left were Yu IlHan, Yumir and the remnants of the Destruction Demon Army forces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys still here? Wanna fight even though you know you\u2019ll die? Well, I guess that\u2019s your raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the next moment that a completely unexpected answer was given to him.</p><br/><p>[Our boss wants to meet you!]</p><br/><p>[The Fifth! Let us go to Elo Katra together!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had just finished off their 1st Battalion Commander Keshein, and a little before that, he had killed and revived Heli\u00e8na into one of his subordinates. The leader of Destruction Demon Army shouldn\u2019t really like him that much. However, they did some really interesting things.</p><br/><p>[He won\u2019t kill you! He won\u2019t fight you either!]</p><br/><p>[The greatest service since the creation of the Destruction Demon Army! The boss likes you!]</p><br/><p>[He wants to play with you! He wants to play!]</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan had just awakened and became a transcender not long ago, the enemy was a super strong being who had surpassed the boundaries of a higher existence and transcended god knows how long ago before he did. If he just followed their invitation blindly like a lost sheep, he didn\u2019t know what sort of situation he would end up in. However, Yu IlHan just laughed and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was no idiot. He was thinking about just one thing right now.</p><br/><p>-What kind of artifacts are there in Elo Katra?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

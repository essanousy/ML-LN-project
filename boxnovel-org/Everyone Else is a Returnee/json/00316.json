Tell the others to give me the fragments of higher metals if they get any.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, when an Overflow occurred on Earth and Yamata no Orochi struck the Kantou region of Japan, it was one of the most dangerous things he had to be on the lookout for, but right now that Yu IlHan and the majority of his companions had become higher existences, Overflows were nothing much to deal with.</p><br/><p>It was just that collecting the harkanium that was absorbed and mutated inside the Overflow monsters were a little bothersome! Of course, the Dareu monster-extermination quest was still underway so they should return quite soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cDareu really has become big. Ugh, I wish I could just look around everywhere in detail and clean them all up\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how fast you are, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Then, scatter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan launched five Traps of Restoration into the air with his reply. With the Declaration skill, those five were scattered to various places throughout Dareu. After that, he activated the \u2018carpet\u2019 to check on the condition of the Traps of Destructions already scattered throughout Dareu and changed the locations of a few.</p><br/><p>That was it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it\u2019s starting now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Traps of Restoration scattered throughout Dareu all resonated at once to suppress the power of the Traps of Destruction. Even the already created dungeons were broken and returned to the original state. The monsters freed from the dungeons (they were mostly weak and dumb to be caught in them) were confused for a moment but all ran after feeling the aura of war in the center of Dareu. Like that, all Traps of Destruction in the continent paused and awaited reactivation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026 good, let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic realized that it was her turn and focused after pushing the straw hat on her head, when the flow of mana released from the Traps of Restoration spread around to the far corners of the world and started transforming the Traps of Destruction.</p><br/><p>Absorbing the surrounding mana and matter, the Traps of Destruction were engulfed by the mana from the Traps of Restoration and changed on a fundamental level. Orochi honestly exclaimed at Mystic\u2019s absurd mana control.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo\u2026\u2026 splendid mana control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an item boost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t focus so be quiet!</p><br/><p>Unlike her words, the engulfing process was very smooth. All the Traps of Destruction scattered around Dareu were evolving! From Traps of Destruction to Traps of Restoration \u2013 a new order was being created after denying the records of until now and one that developed according to Yu IlHan\u2019s intentions!</p><br/><p>Of course, that process sucked and consumed an enormous amount of mana in Dareu, but that would just slow down the birth of monsters so it wasn\u2019t completely a bad thing.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Declaration, has become level 56.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Dimensional Ruler, has become level 85.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Dimensional Adaptation, has become level 83.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Fleet Command, has become level 89.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Mystic! Let\u2019s be done and over with this before heading to the next world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh, the mana wave is truly a spectacle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up both of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Mystic\u2019s grand actions, even Yu IlHan\u2019s skill grew all by themselves. A thought flashed by Yu IlHan\u2019s mind at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then if the members of Dragon\u2019s Nest kill enemies\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes and analyzing his own records, he found the answer quite quickly. Not only the records of enemies, he found out that a little bit of experience was given to him as well. Since the dragons belonging to Dragon\u2019s Nest were fighting with countless monsters right now, his records were piling up even though he wasn\u2019t doing much.</p><br/><p>\u2018So there\u2019s a reason why the leaders of each faction are in a completely different league to the members;</p><br/><p>He groaned subconsciously. Although he felt this after looking at Greed, the leaders of each faction were all frightening beings! Growing endlessly even while doing nothing thanks to the actions of its members\u2026 that would mean that the newest of the 5, Yu IlHan, was the most disadvantaged!</p><br/><p>Wait.</p><br/><p>Then how was it possible that Michael was equal in power to Satan, the leader of the Army of Brilliant Light?</p><br/><p>\u2018Or was that BS?\u2019</p><br/><p>No, but from looking at how aggressive Michael acted normally, he didn\u2019t seem like someone who would lie about that. Didn\u2019t Yu IlHan let Michael go precisely to hold Satan back?</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s possible if God left all of his records and authorities in his charge.\u2019</p><br/><p>But he was too weak for that to be true. No matter how disadvantageous Michael was against Yu IlHan in terms of attributes, he wouldn\u2019t be so easily defeated by Yu IlHan. Then there\u2019s one answer left.</p><br/><p>Division.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I think about it, although he was killed by me, Raphael was absurdly OP as well. He had a healing ability that surpassed the other 7th class beings by hundreds of miles. If the situation wasn\u2019t leaning heavily in my favor, I would have missed the chance to kill him.\u2019</p><br/><p>In that case the possibility that God\u2019s power and records were divided among the four Great Archangels of Heaven \u2013 Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Among them, Raphael died and Michael could be overcome anytime, so the remaining ones who potentially posed a threat were Gabriel and Uriel.</p><br/><p>\u2018Leaving aside Uriel because I don\u2019t have any records about that one, it nags at me that Gabriel has the power of foreknowledge. Foreknowledge, clairvoyance eh\u2026\u2026 that shouldn\u2019t be the case, it definitely shouldn\u2019t be possible, but it bothers me.\u2019</p><br/><p>From one moment a doubt that was near assurance twitched inside Yu IlHan\u2019s heart. It was too absurd to be true, but his instincts warned him so much when he tried to reject it completely. So the solution would be to stop thinking about it until he actually confirmed it\u2026\u2026 but if it was that easy, he wouldn\u2019t be thinking about such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, why do you wear such a frown? Look at that woman groaning. Humans call this a spectacle, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a scene that I can\u2019t miss, but she\u2019ll have to groan like that even more in the future so I\u2019ll have many opportunities to watch. Orochi you just prepare some popcorn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ll deal with you two later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to the abundant mana in Dareu, the evolution of the Traps of Destruction proceeded unexpectedly quickly. New Traps of Restoration were being generated, and in the process of being linked in consciousness with them, Mystic had finally met a hurdle. Groaning and grunting while continuing to control all of them did look quite funny and cute.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to dismantle Raphael\u2019s body as soon as possible\u2026\u2026 but I have something more urgent I guess.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had a look at Orochi who teased Mystic and Mystic who bit her lips but still continued to control the evolution process of the Traps of Destruction and stopped his thoughts there with a shrug.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the right time. If only he could activate the Hourglass of Eternity on Earth, he would be able to cleanly take care of everything that was needed\u2026. The problem was that if he went to Earth right now, Earth would become a higher world.</p><br/><p>Ironically, Yu IlHan could only go back to Earth after he was fully prepared for war.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Mystic cheered. She succeeded in transforming all the Traps of Destruction scattered in the vast lands of Dareu into Traps of Restorations! Yu IlHan nodded in satisfaction and ordered her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then let\u2019s see if the Traps work effectively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, are you looking down on my abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic clicked her fingers while curving the tips of her mouth into a smile. At that moment, the Traps of Restoration scattered around Dareu vitalized their domain and released a strong wave of mana.</p><br/><p>[Mm!?]</p><br/><p>[Kugh! Kergh, that\u2019s a trap\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t resist\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Even though I want to resist\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Such tragedy!]</p><br/><p>The monsters that were fighting the dragons and dragonkin immediately reacted to it. Even though they had both high levels and high intelligence, they couldn\u2019t resist the aura that the Traps of Restoration emitted and helplessly rushed in! Yu IlHan laughed heartily after looking at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHide and seek is over! Hahahahahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster is the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, I did know of their power but this is really\u2026\u2026 they\u2019re all being sucked in no matter if they are level 250 or level 270.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can even imprison higher existences, not to mention 4th classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigher existences?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had just trampled on the technology of Heaven\u2019s Army like nothing and checked the Traps of Restoration that were being filled and laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>Since his companions had taken care of a lot of monsters, the Traps of Restoration didn\u2019t quite get filled, but there was no worry of any Overflows occurring. Under Mystic\u2019s control, the Traps of Restoration had worked splendidly to prevent any kind of mana reaction if there were no monsters nearby!</p><br/><p>[Dad, how did it come to this?]</p><br/><p>Yumir, who was having fun leading all the dragons found where Yu IlHan was and flew straight towards him before asking. Yu IlHan stroked his head and explained to him the outline of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monsters born in Dareu will all be sucked into the Traps of Restoration automatically. So you just need to make suitable teams of dragons and dragonkin and send them to dungeons.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dad is amazing!]</p><br/><p>The common knowledge of Heaven\u2019s Army was that 4th class monsters couldn\u2019t be imprisoned with the Traps of Destruction. However, Yu IlHan made the Traps of Restoration that ignored such a common knowledge with little to no effort.</p><br/><p>This new type of prison system that only Yu IlHan and Mystic could control soon imprisoned all monsters born in Dareu, except the dragons and the dragonkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, I did hear that you will make something called the Traps of Restoration, but this is frightening\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean frightening? This is just the beginning. I\u2019ll scatter them to other worlds too so just clean the dungeons while we\u2019re waiting. Oh, before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He needed to fulfill his promise. Yu IlHan looked at the dragonkin that had lost their enemies thanks to the Traps of Restoration and looked back at his companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone pick one dragonkin that you think fought well. Starting from Mir.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Aaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[Oh supreme being, you will really give us the opportunity!]</p><br/><p>Even though they watched the process of First becoming a dragon, the dragonkin still couldn\u2019t believe in him fully, but now they became emotional after they heard Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan hadn\u2019t lied! They could really become dragons! They could confirm the strengths of all higher existences belonging to Dragon\u2019s Nest while they fought together, so the dragonkin\u2019s passion to become \u2018dragons\u2019 had become amplified. So, it was no wonder that they had become emotional after hearing his words. Yu IlHan made a bright smile after looking at them being honestly happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fu, I love dragonkin. They\u2019re so simple.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, your face. Your face looks like a complete villain right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The higher existences belonging to Dragon\u2019s Nest were: Yu IlHan, Heli\u00e8na, Yumir, Liera, Erta, Kang MiRae, Na YuNa, Kim YeSeul, Pat\u00e9, Jirl, Mirey, Ericia, Flemir, Mirfa, Orochi and Mystic \u2013 a total of 16. Yu IlHan gave each of them the right to pick one dragonkin so the number of new dragons would be just 16.</p><br/><p>However, that was enough.</p><br/><p>[I thank you, my lord!]</p><br/><p>[Kuooooooh! Dragon, the mana of dragon and the blood of dragon! Flows in my veins!]</p><br/><p>[Me too! I will definitely become a dragon next time!]</p><br/><p>[Dungeon! Let\u2019s go wipe out dungeons!]</p><br/><p>All dragonkin that saw their kin being reborn into dragons had their eyes flipped. They armed themselves with the resolve that they will definitely become dragons next time! Yu IlHan spoke to them with a merciful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you bring about suitable results, I shall make you all into dragons. Any dragonkin is set to be able to freely enter dungeons so rampage to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood!]</p><br/><p>[Uooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>[You idiots! Pay your respects to the ruler!]</p><br/><p>The dragonkin instantly split up into groups and charged into dungeons. Yu IlHan\u2019s companions only watched with dumbfounded eyes. Yu IlHan turned around with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going. It won\u2019t take too long. Oh, can you take the Guardian fortress and a few of our members to Earth and go over to Earth for me, Miss MiRae? I think it will be better to move the people there to Dareu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcluding those of you that are going to Earth with Miss MiRae everyone be on your guard. It\u2019s very likely that Legnae will invade Dareu. I\u2019ve prepared everything so you shouldn\u2019t have any problems fighting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Giving out orders was done as well. Now, Yu IlHan took Mystic and Orochi into the Flying fortress and set out. The number of Traps of Restoration in his inventory was 6,938. Once all of these were successfully scattered across the worlds\u2026\u2026 it would be his victory.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019d still win even if I fail.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you have an evil face that doesn\u2019t look like the main character at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan and the other two set off for other worlds.</p><br/><p>This was later known as the sowing seeds legend of the leader of Dragon\u2019s Nest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

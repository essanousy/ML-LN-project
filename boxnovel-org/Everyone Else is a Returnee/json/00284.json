Yu IlHan did everything within his power to prepare for war. With \u2018Everything in his power\u2019 referring to spending all of his piled up materials to create items \u2013 from personal equipment to disposable weapons and munitions used in war!</p><br/><p>He upgraded all the equipment that his party members had, made backup weapons, and added additional equipment to the already terrifying Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress, long before he had time to check his own skills and stats.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan(Human?)]</p><br/><p>[Main Class \u2013 Hell Bringer Lv 299]</p><br/><p>[Sub Class \u2013 N/A, Dragon Rider, Dimensional Traveler]</p><br/><p>[Title \u2013 Pancosmic Loner, Untouchable, One hit for me; one hit for you, Creator of Myths, Not two hits, nor three hits but one hit, A thousand in one hit, Dragon slayer, Dragon\u2019s ally, The Quickest, Hero of Fire, The Frog that leaped out of the well, Blessing of the god of smithing, blessing of the goddess of fire, Surpasser, Creator]</p><br/><p>[Strength \u2013 827 Agility \u2013 766 Health \u2013 635 Magic \u2013 1,238]</p><br/><p>[Active skills \u2013 Falling Down(Deathgod, Soul enchant, Blaze, Death collector, Transcendent regeneration, Extreme poison resistance, higher curse resistance) Lv43, Mana crafting Lv Max, God Force(Superhuman strength, Critical hit) Lv79, Rule Lv Max, Dragonic blood Lv96, Warp(Leap) Lv58, Dimensional ruler Lv69]</p><br/><p>[Passive skills \u2013 Dragon-man resonance Lv87, Dismantling Lv Max, Blacksmithing Lv Max, Record(Language) Lv82, Magic engineering Lv Max, Excavation Lv Max, Spear of Untraceable Trajectory(Spear mastery) Lv98, Great Cosmos-severing Spear(Spear Mastery, Physical combat mastery, Blunt weapon mastery, Sword mastery, Whip mastery) Lv86, Absolute accuracy(Throwing, Shooting) Lv Max, Cooking Lv Max, Unshakeable heart Lv Max, Dimensional adaptation Lv59, Fleet command Lv 66]</p><br/><p>The first thing his eyes saw was the sub class \u2013 at first, Yu IlHan had the sub class \u2018Angel\u2019s Partner\u2019, but as the contracts between all his previously partnered angels were cancelled, he lost the qualifications of the sub class. And it took another half a year for the class to completely disappear.</p><br/><p>There was a time he thought that he would be able to acquire a new sub class once that one disappeared, but it seemed like not everything went his way. The Akashic Record had kept its silence on that matter.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something that happened often, so there was no one that could advise him about in either, and in the end, Yu IlHan could only leave the sub class blank for the time being. This wasn\u2019t something that he could solve with his effort. He could only wait for another opportunity to arrive.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut my skills really grew a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had used the Hourglass of Eternity ten times before that, so the amount of time he spent inside it would amount to about 15 years. Breaking that up, he spent 30% of his time soaking in the Cradle of Miracles, and trained with the Great Cosmos-severing Spear in the majority of the remainder, so his Great Cosmos-severing Spear had reached level 85 now. The growth of his other skills weren\u2019t that far behind either.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only that. In the process of awakening his dragon powers, his stats uniformly rose, and the more he got used to manipulating the power of fire, his magic stat increased as well, so now, he would be on par with 6th class beings based on pure stats alone.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that he might not be able to call himself a human anymore after he checked his status. Though, this was nothing new. Even his face that reflected light with the shiny surface of the armor had no traces of his previous self.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he became scared.</p><br/><p>Is it really me that is in this place? Perhaps it was someone else that is not me? Am I just</p><br/><p>dozing off and dreaming inside a classroom in university and nobody has noticed me? Such absurd thoughts rose rapidly and made Yu IlHan\u2019s mind messy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>His lover that watched over him ever since they first met, replied naturally as if she knew that he would speak to her. Liera\u2019s gentle and calm eyes pacified Yu IlHan\u2019s raging emotions. He lost his strength in his shoulders and asked in a truly stupid voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026In your eyes, have I changed a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it would be a lie if I said that you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera made a bitter smile. She saw through his intentions when he asked that.</p><br/><p>Liera too had several occasions when she was like this. When she realized that she had reached the peak of a world, when she became an angel under the guidance of Heaven, when she fell in love, when she became a high angel, and when she returned to a lower existence and stood by Yu IlHan\u2019s side \u2013 all of these moments were times when she couldn\u2019t believe her own existence and doubted her experiences.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about. But IlHan, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChanging \u2026\u2026 is the biggest proof that you\u2019re alive. And in that you will discover, that only you can be you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those were words that Liera could say only after observing numerous people during the course of her lifetime and winning against herself to become a higher being. When Yu IlHan became silent, she added with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I loved the you before the change, I still love you after the change, and my feeling will remain the same for the you of the future. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026No, it is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that it was quite underhanded for her to suddenly speak like that, but it was also the truth as it resonated with the feelings in his heart.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t blessed by the god of love for nothing. Even while grumbling, he opened his arms and hugged her tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me who\u2019s thankful. You\u2019d be surprised to know how much appreciation I feel towards you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They wanted to stay like that for quite a while, but sharp gazes started falling upon them, so they had to separate before long. The barrier would collapse at any second. This was not the time to be flirting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera-unni, so sneaky. I also want to know what Mr. IlHan was like before~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have realized IlHan\u2019s true worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI kinda want to kill you now, Liera. Can\u2019t you at least take it somewhere else where I\u2019m not there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan hugged me first, how could I refuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEek, eeeeeek\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera teased Na YuNa and the flustered Erta and boasted. There should be a problem with Yu IlHan who found such a side of her lovely as well. He made a small smile and clapped lightly to gather everyone\u2019s attention on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll depart as soon as the barrier breaks. I\u2019ve supplied everyone with their personal equipment, so I won\u2019t say anything much. \u2026\u2026Our objective is to screw everyone else other than ourselves. We\u2019ll grow in the process as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one amazing objective\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling has to become the Fifth God. He has to have at least that amount of daringness. Yup, so cool.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, the barrier broke. However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t leave with them right away. The three clan masters he had invited to the barrier before as they could resist the effects of the magic on Earth, also had the abilities to fight against higher existences if they were equipped with Yu IlHan\u2019s equipment.</p><br/><p>He first decided to ask them of their opinions. And then\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you of course. Thanks for calling us, mister unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is Lord Yu IlHan\u2019s wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t expect this, quite a lot of the clan masters wished to go with him. They had stepped up even while knowing that their opponents were higher existences, so he couldn\u2019t evaluate them as weak. Yu IlHan faced their stiff expressions and nodded his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone get on board the Flying fortress. We\u2019ll depart immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next place he went to was none other than Dareu. Mirfa, who had waited for him all this time, met him with a blossoming smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan coldly ordered her like a merciless street cleaner putting flower petals into the trash.</p><br/><p>\u201cGather the strongest thousand of the 4th class elves and wolfkin and get them on the Guardian fortress. Mirfa, you come this time. Jirl, Mirey, and Pat\u00e9 will now go to the Guardian fortress and command the elves along with Mirfa. Ericia, you also command the wolfkin in the Guardian fortress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Understood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps they had anticipated this, but the elves and wolfkin picked the thousand members in the blink of an eye, and lined up in the Guardian fortress with rapid movements. Yu IlHan felt slightly awkward even while supplying them with new equipment. Was it the mastered Rule skill that affected this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are we going to invade the higher worlds now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera asked with quite an excited expression. Yu IlHan firmly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to get our trump card before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, that.]</p><br/><p>Orochi, who had trained for 15 years with his new body and went beyond adaptation to developing his own body, shook his head as he muttered like a human. Only Orochi knew the identity of this \u2018trump card\u2019 here.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yu IlHan spoke with a groan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan was staying still? Everyone was shocked, but Yu IlHan made an excuse with an evil smirk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a little special of a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be even worse if he\u2019s saying it\u2019s a little special! Uu, I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re the ones invading\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, don\u2019t break me with it, okay?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Just what the hell do you guys think I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Can I choose not to answer?]</p><br/><p>With that, all preparations were done. Before Yu IlHan activated Warp with both the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress, he checked once again with Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was the condition to steal a world again?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You need to drive out all other higher existences in that world and erase all of their traces.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something anyone could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was about taking over an entire world, so it would be bad if anyone could do it. However, Yu IlHan had the abilities of a Dimensional Traveler, and his abilities were truly suited for taking over worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe leaders of each faction should possess a similar or even better ability than the one I have. However, there is something that makes the situation more advantageous for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re cool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re handsome!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was scared of himself for becoming used to such useless flattery, and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s that I do field work unlike those high and mighty heavy-asses.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew exactly where his strengths lay! Of course, this meant that, in other worlds, Yu IlHan was just completely reckless, but he wouldn\u2019t care about that for now!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I like fairness, so I want to start from the Garden of Sunset and alternate between each faction.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Is the reason you\u2019re starting with the Garden of Sunset because you don\u2019t like them?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because they look like the easiest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Until now, he hadn\u2019t crossed the final line. In fact, he had recovered his relationship with the Heaven\u2019s Army to an extent as well.</p><br/><p>However, what he was about to do now was strictly attacking first, and with that, he would not be able to avoid conflict and battle with other factions.</p><br/><p>Not only that, he had to point his spear at those that didn\u2019t have any malicious or hostile intentions towards him, just because they were in the same faction. It would be a lie to say that he didn\u2019t feel a sense of dread about that, but\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wish for me to dance on a stage that you guys created.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan activated Warp. The number of higher existences Yu IlHan had experienced until now were literally \u2018numerous\u2019, and creating gates to the higher worlds they once resided in from the records they had, was an easy thing to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll gladly take on the role of a villain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The skill activated.</p><br/><p>The figure of the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress disappeared as if it was never there in the first place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

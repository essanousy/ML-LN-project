She awakened the longing of death inside me.]</p><br/><p>The angels with white wings all committed suicide with their own weapons. It was no different for the fallen angels with black wings. They used their swords, spears, whips, or even hands to cut open their own chests and crush their hearts.</p><br/><p>Black and white blood scattered over the battlefield. Looking at the scene Heli\u00e8na extended her two arms and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>[Look, such a beautiful scene, no? Don\u2019t you feel their straight and pure love?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBe pure twice and the world will end, duh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s nothing more truthful to prove love than death. It means they\u2019ve thrown away their all for it!]</p><br/><p>The surviving 5th class beings all severed their own lives as soon as Heli\u00e8na willed it. Black and white feathers scattered in the air. Yu IlHan felt slightly disgusted at himself for thinking it was beautiful.</p><br/><p>[Ah, aaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[This damned\u2026\u2026 bitch\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Nati\u00e8re, it was your mistake to come here today. Oh my, you mean it isn\u2019t? You love me so much? How thankful I am!]</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>The 8th Wing of Brilliant Light, Nati\u00e8re, and the Chief Gatekeeper from the Garden of Sunset, Kelatuke, were no exceptions. They were resisting to their best of abilities by agitating their own mana. They might have been able to resist if they were at their full power, but with their powers exhausted with the violent fight until now, it was near impossible for them to endure Heli\u00e8na\u2019s final attack.</p><br/><p>The shark reversed the spikes on its armor and shaved its own body out while roaring, and Nati\u00e8re spread her own three pairs of wings to rip her body apart. If there was anything better for them than the other suiciders, it was that it took much longer for them to die due to the strong bodies they had.</p><br/><p>[Kh\u2026\u2026.Kugh!]</p><br/><p>[Fufu, you\u2019re beautiful, Nati\u00e8re. You\u2019re the prettiest that you\u2019ve ever been right now.]</p><br/><p>[Kuhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Perhaps Heli\u00e8na was waiting for this moment from the beginning \u2013 slowly poisoning them and paralyzing them, and instantly severing their lives once they became unable to move. She was not only a beautiful succubus, but she was also a meticulously proficient hunter as well.</p><br/><p>Yes, right now, he could understand why Heli\u00e8na was obsessed with him so much. To her who had gained victory after victory like this all her life, there should have been none that were able to surpass her.</p><br/><p>[Succu, bus\u2026\u2026.! I shall\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Oh my.]</p><br/><p>However, just one, was able to endure the succubus\u2019 order to commit suicide. It was none other than the 6th class high angel Spiera. Even while there was a festival of death around her, she was stiffly raising her head to glare at Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill you myself!]</p><br/><p>[How? Oh, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re in contract with Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s gaze headed to Yu IlHan once again. She asked with a cute and adorable face.</p><br/><p>[Darling, what will you do? If you say don\u2019t, I\u2019ll let that angel go.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could not understand Heli\u00e8na at all. Did she mean that she would follow him if he wished to? Wasn\u2019t that as if they were in a master-slave relationship? Just what did the \u2018fifth\u2019 mean?</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan\u2026\u2026! You need to, kill her! She\u2019s the enemy of Heaven\u2019s Army, and your enemy!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Spiera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan held off from replying to Heli\u00e8na and faced Spiera. As Heli\u00e8na had said, the contract between the two were still maintained.</p><br/><p>He could feel the connection that linked her to him, and one that allowed both of them to feel each other\u2019s emotions minutely. Yu IlHan thought that this was perhaps the best time to wrap things up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiera, I have something to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked. It was a firm voice not containing any emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you feel like when you abandoned Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Oh my, you knew without having me to tell you? My, my, you really are my type!]</p><br/><p>Spiera was silenced with Yu IlHan\u2019s sudden question, and Heli\u00e8na rejoiced that the man she chose had a darker heart than she had originally thought.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Uu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Liera and Erta\u2019s expressions stiffened, Their sense of guilt for betraying the Heaven\u2019s Army, and their rejection towards the Destruction Demon Army were dragging them back. They just didn\u2019t like this situation at all.</p><br/><p>However, they wouldn\u2019t try to run away either. As long as they decided to go with Yu IlHan, they had to accept everything that he did.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you feel when you realised that so many people could not meet their loved ones ever again?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That, is\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReturning to Heaven while leaving Liera and me behind, while countless infants died in that hellish place \u2013 what did you think about at that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me, Spiera. I want to hear your honest thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spiera\u2019s expression tragically twisted. She realized that Yu IlHan\u2019s heart had left the alliance with the Heaven\u2019s Army a long time ago.</p><br/><p>[I\u2026\u2026 did not think anything of it.]</p><br/><p>She eventually replied.</p><br/><p>[I only act upon orders of the Heaven\u2019s Army. I am a higher existence, and my emotions are not moved by lower existences.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Did that\u2026\u2026 answer your question?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his spear and asked Heli\u00e8na for the first time</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you sever the contract between me and her?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh, darling, sure! You heard that? Agree to the dissolution of the contract. Here, nod already.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Spiera bit her lips and nodded her head. At that time, the contract between the two dissolved with mutual agreement from both sides.</p><br/><p>[You have no angels in contract with you. All powers as an Angel\u2019s Partner become sealed. If you do not contract with an angel within a certain period of time, you will lose the qualifications of being an Angel\u2019s Partner. At that time, you may select a new subclass.]</p><br/><p>The moment the contract was completely dissolved, emotions of loss and vanity assaulted Yu IlHan. However, he felt a certain sense of newfound freedom. Being tied to somewhere did not fit him. The fact that a loner tried to join another group was a problem. He liked his current self the most.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, do you plan to go against me? Do you plan to go against the Heaven\u2019s Army?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain this situation in the simple words I like so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s lips made a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sound like a thug that just asked \u2018you wanna go against me?\u2019 even though you socked me right in the face.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Spiera\u2019s reply did not come back. Heli\u00e8na realized Yu IlHan\u2019s decision and made way for him while retreating to make a stage for the two of them. She even retracted her power for Spiera to be not charmed by her!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiera, let us fight. Not for the purpose of training, but with our lives on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026The succubus is listening to your words right now. If you use that power, you should be able to kill me easily. Why do you still hold your spear?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let someone else take over the finisher and just step back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took deep breaths and looked behind him. Liera and Erta nodded at him with stiff expressions. Na YuNa seemed to hesitate about saying something and she still gave him a blessing to put him back to his full condition while pouting, and Yumir swayed his tail lightly as if he knew what his dad was thinking.</p><br/><p>That was enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, come on, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve become more confident of yourself, Yu IlHan. Nice going.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not underestimating you. If you were in your normal condition, I wouldn\u2019t do something so foolish like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Spiera was currently exhausted with injuries all over her body. Although she was freed from the charm, her mental self should have been wounded quite a lot as well. Even with 6th class powers, she would not be able to overwhelm Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Above all, Yu IlHan wanted to experience the Great Cosmos-severing Spear for himself. There would never be another opportunity.</p><br/><p>He cancelled Falling Down that was maintained until now, and gathered all the dissipating flames and put it on the tip of his spear. Spiera\u2019s lips curved into a smile while facing the spear of flames, that were blessed by the goddess of fire, and was burning as if to melt everything around it.</p><br/><p>[So you are keeping such a courtesy against a mere traitor like me\u2026\u2026 you really are a good man.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Please conduct the last lesson properly, Spiera.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Very well, I shall show you my best.]</p><br/><p>Spiera also held her pure white spear and faced Yu IlHan. Her foggy eyes instantly turned crisp and clear. Liera, who knew how strong she was, became nervous and grabbed Yu IlHan\u2019s waist, but he lightly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fine you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn one of the options of Untouchable, there\u2019s one that allows me to escape an attack that will instantly put me to death. So, in any case, I won\u2019t die with one hit. And if I don\u2019t die, then I can recover somehow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually did have countermeasures! Liera became speechless at Yu IlHan managing to procure his safety even in such a situation. However, she eventually smiled, thinking that it was very much like him.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did not mind her, and stood up from Yumir\u2019s head and extended Ruin Calling. However, before he could leap, Spiera expanded her two pairs of wings and charged towards Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>[Die for the Heaven\u2019s Army, Yu IlHan!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHhp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan leaped slightly later than her. He set the angle to be horizontal, and overlapped leaps and re-leaped several times in the air to burst through the limit!</p><br/><p>[Activating God Force. Muscular strength increases by 340%.]</p><br/><p>While charging, Yu IlHan activated God Force without the support of Falling Down. Although he would be in much pain after the battle, he could not hold back with Spiera as his opponent.</p><br/><p>[Hah!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two were moving at rapid speeds, the moment of outcome rapidly approached as well. Spiera drew a stroke with all her powers in her spear, and Yu IlHan overlapped eleven trajectories into one.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>Spiera\u2019s eyes abruptly opened while looking at his spear strike. She had realized the power in his strike. Immediately after that, the two trajectories collided, and there was no sound at all.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Kugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was standing up with Ruin Calling Open, suddenly vomited blood. Although he looked fine on the outside, the amount of shock he had received internally was very high.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026 you don\u2019t need to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera and the others shouted while widening their eyes, but Yu IlHan firmly shook his head. He gestured that he was fine. By now, punctured internal organs didn\u2019t even count as injuries.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>Spoke Spiera.</p><br/><p>[Is that the path you have chosen?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still incomplete. I\u2019m going to incorporate your technique later too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Is that so\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s a pity that I\u2026 cannot see\u2026 the final\u2026\u2026. form.]</p><br/><p>A bitter smile hung on Spiera\u2019s lips. After that, her body split in half starting from the head to her waist.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 478 Spiera.]</p><br/><p>[Fusion evolution of skills are possible. By consuming 1 5th class magic stone and 1,000 4th class magic stones, will you fuse Spear Mastery, Physical Combat mastery, Blunt Weapons mastery, Whip mastery, and Sword mastery?]</p><br/><p>Even though she was exhausted by Heli\u00e8na\u2019s power, it was still possible for Spiera to battle, and it looked as if Yu IlHan was deemed as the biggest contributor to her death, as he got the experience and records.</p><br/><p>Moreover, as he had experienced the Great Cosmos-severing Spear at her final moments and even killed her and acquired her experience, the conditions to learn the Great Cosmos-severing Spear were fulfilled. Although he couldn\u2019t immediately learn it as he had spent all of his 5th class magic stones, it would become possible if he searched through the dead 5th class beings lying around.</p><br/><p>[Darling.]</p><br/><p>Making a sweet expression specific to a woman in love, Heli\u00e8na flew towards him.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re so cool! You\u2019re the partner I\u2019ve been waiting for all my life, I\u2019m sure of it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling will become the fifth God. You shall become the latest, but the brightest and strongest star\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at the remaining people in the battlefield while listening to her words. Although Yu IlHan and his companions were without any injuries, all the rest had died. Nati\u00e8re and Kelatuke also lost their lives while Yu IlHan and Spiera were fighting, so they were really the only ones left now.</p><br/><p>[I heard a prophecy. That I would eventually stand next to the fifth God!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this \u2018fifth God\u2019? Do you mean that I will create a new faction of higher existence?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You have noticed yourself, right? Darling\u2026\u2026 there are no beings that can endure 7th class being\u2019s attacks while being a lower existence. There\u2019s only you \u2013 in this wide multiverse, you\u2019re the only one. I also thought \u2018no way\u2019 but now I believe it. Can\u2019t you feel my heart pounding?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na grabbed Yu IlHan\u2019s hand and placed his palm onto her voluptuous chest. Yu IlHan admitted with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can indeed feel your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took his hand off her chest. Then, he struck with his spear, through her heart.</p><br/><p>God Force was still maintained, and having acquired Heli\u00e8na\u2019s records, he knew her weak points and her mana pattern as well, which allowed him to make the her heart burst instantly. Heli\u00e8na\u2019s two eyes widened as if she couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Dar, ling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for clearing up the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan twisted his spear to completely kill her. Then, he spoke with a cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Liera is my only partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way Yu IlHan would believe a woman who spoke of \u2018love\u2019 so easily, which he himself had taken hundreds of years to accept and admit. Additionally, he didn\u2019t know her true intentions, nor did he know if it was pure or not!</p><br/><p>From the moment she didn\u2019t realize that, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s final moments were as good as set in stone.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Thanks for clearing up traffic and disappearing, Heli\u00e8na</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Aaaaand she died.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

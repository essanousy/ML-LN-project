Trying to enter a ruin would destroy an entire empire.</p><br/><p>There should be a better line of defense than that of Ferata\u2019s, but he couldn\u2019t just watch it as it walked over there and destroyed everything. Yu IlHan took out a pile bunker first, and checked with the angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m facing a golem, but how do I go about it? In fantasy novels, there are things like cores, that will stop the golem once destroyed or removed. Also, I\u2019ve seen cases where people made a new golem out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, the Metal Hearts you\u2019ve hunted before indeed had a nucleus. However\u2026..] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Golems are magic life forms. Moreover, that thing is an \u2018artificial\u2019 life form at the peak of magic engineering technology to bring out the power containing within an object to the best efficiency. Think about it like this \u2013 if you made it, would you make a weak point for others to destroy?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You just need to smash it. What are you hesitating for?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Pushing Erta and Liera, who were talking in a roundabout way, aside, Spiera gave him the answer. Yu IlHan ended up laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I need to \u2018smash in pieces\u2019, that\u2026 thing that\u2019s over 100 meters tall and made of silver metal that even I, blessed by the god of smithing, cannot recognize?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, just split it in half or something.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that sounds sooo interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s vision became dark thinking that he now had no choice but to take the suffering route. If there was anything good, it was that he was still in concealment and was able to attack the golem in surprise and inflict additional damage.</p><br/><p>However, just as when he was preparing the pile bunker, he thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, does that thing count as \u2018life\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If artificial life forms counted as life, then the creator would be God, not man, duh.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Damn, the advantage he had as a Deathgod in battle had disappeared! Like this, Na YuNa\u2019s buff just ended up filling that gap.</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t so bad, since it said his attacks would contain the power of the goddess of beauty\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan grumbled as he checked the information on the pile bunker in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that the option I applied to help out in the fight with the perverted vibration demon is of help.\u201d</p><br/><p>[David\u2019s Stone Thrower]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Epic]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013</p><br/><p>1st stage : 2,100</p><br/><p>2nd stage : 3,200</p><br/><p>3rd stage : 4,500</p><br/><p>4th stage : 5,800</p><br/><p>6th stage : 9,800(Consumes 1,000 maximum durability)</p><br/><p>7th stage : 12,500(Consumes 10,000 maximum durability)</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 15,780/15,780]1</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. 40% increase in power when facing an enemy twice as large as the user. 50% decrease in power when enemy is less than that size.</p><br/><p>2.

It contains the pure wish of the crafter to make those taller than him, kneel before him, and will grow the more gigantic enemies are defeated.</p><br/><p>A masterpiece made with recovering durability in mind, from the previous experience of single-time use strong weapons. However, the drawback is that it is very hard to load, and may fail to load properly even after drawing strength from the user\u2019s time as a baby, sucking on the mother\u2019s breasts, from the previous life.]</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know that he would have to show his trump card here. And, this was against a monster that was worse than the perverted vibration demon!</p><br/><p>[Kuwoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>[IlHan, it looks like it\u2019s about to move! It\u2019s trembling!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Now, he had to attack. If he didn\u2019t start by dealing a massive damage, they would lose any chances of defeating it here.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was conflicted. That was because the pile bunker was currently loaded to the 6th stage. Well, he thought that the 6th stage would be enough against the perverted vibration demon, and recovering 10,000 max durability would make him consume well over 100 3rd class magic stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how I think about it, 6th stage doesn\u2019t seem enough\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wished that since it was big, it was sky-scraping big. But unfortunately, its height was around 120 meters.</p><br/><p>Although that was plenty jaw-slackingly big\u2026\u2026 the 3rd option attached on the pile bunker, \u2018100 times as large\u2019 only referred to height!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish that I was a 120cm midget!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even dwarves are bigger than that, so calm down, Yu IlHan!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan came to a judgement quickly. He had to inflict a big strike with a surprise attack, but 6th stage power was not enough. Even though the magic stones to recover the durability was a little wasteful, he now had to be bold and go with a 7th stage attack.</p><br/><p>[Guwoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the titan started moving slowly after roaring once more. The group with the imperial princess, who had formed a defensive line and started chanting offensive magic, seemed to be scared stiff by the moving titan that exceeded the realm of their imaginations.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn that day, mankind received a grim reminder\u2026\u2026. Uuuuugh! Mommy!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2026 wanted to say that too!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuuuugh! Grandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was speaking nonsense with his mouth, but his two hands were busy loading the pile bunker to the 7th stage.</p><br/><p>He had to deploy Superhuman strength, and twist the bone ammo with all his power! By 7th stage, the structure of the giant\u2019s rubber band enveloping the ammo had also turned complex, so he not only needed strength, but technique as well. That made it even more shitty.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghuuughuk! Great grandmaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t make strange moans!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s at great grandma already\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s big!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, this happened because of you, not him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t have any intentions on denying my responsibility, but do you really have to say that now when it looks like we\u2019d all die!? You sure care for your hubby!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the golem\u2019s advance speed became faster, the group fell into panic.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did his best to load before it was too late. He deployed Superhuman strength to beyond its limits, and kicked it off by another notch by regenerating the horribly ripping muscles that couldn\u2019t endure the load, with Transcendent regeneration!</p><br/><p>[The skill, Superhuman strength, has become level 75!]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Transcendent regeneration, has become level 61!]</p><br/><p>Now, he didn\u2019t even have any spare piece of mind to read the skill level up notifications. Yu IlHan focused all of his attention on the bone ammo that was gradually pushed to the inside while spinning ever so slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuuuuuup, great-great-great-great-grandpaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>And at one moment, the 7th stage was loaded with a clack! The moment he noticed that he had succeeded in loading, he deployed Ruin Calling to launch shockwaves behind his back and rush forward. The other people were in a mess right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe titan\u2019s coming! The titaaaaan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving aside succeeding technology, this ancestor wants to destroy the empire instead! Gigantic Thunder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re doomed. The empire is doomed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Kang MiRae\u2019s most powerful attack while being buffed by Na YuNa, only ended up taking a single toe. In fact, that was already a shocking power, but the enemy was too strong this time.</p><br/><p>[Kuguooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>The titan turned stiff for a moment, before raising its leg to step forward\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooooh!\u201d (This is MC)</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026unsuccessfully, that is, because Yu IlHan had flown on top of its head and struck with the pile bunker, right on top of its head!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Eternal Flame stimulated the stored magic gunpowder inside the ammo to cause a giant explosion, and at the same time the ammo was shot out, covered in fire, the 7th stage Giant\u2019s Rubber Band loosened in an instant to add another layer of driving force!</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Without exaggeration, it sounded like the skies were collapsing. Just the sound from the explosion from the Eternal Flame was already so overwhelming, but the snapping of the rubber band as well as the noise at the moment of collision with its head was even more booming!</p><br/><p>The vibration from the shockwave at that moment was also enormous, causing everyone in that area to lose their balance momentarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, that golem was so easily\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The results from depleting 10,000 of the maximum durability of the pile bunker, was, as expected, quite devastating. the golem\u2019s head measuring 3 meters in diameter was instantly obliterated, and the projectile proceeded even further to embed itself deep in the body!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more was that the tip of the projectile was still burning, so the golem was constantly taking damage.</p><br/><p>[Kuwooooooooh! Kuhaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>The golem roared without being able to come to itself. Did it feel pain despite being an artificial life form? Even if it didn\u2019t, it was definite that it reacted sensitively to the loss of its body parts.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026 Kergh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan put the pile bunker, which did its job splendidly, into his inventory, the scraps of metal that were scattered around after the explosion, all rushed up into the skies, before shooting towards the shoulder of the golem, i.e. where he was standing right now.</p><br/><p>He immediately equipped Ruin Calling on his front to shoot shockwaves to knock them down, and his face turned stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s trying to stitch itself back on!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although that\u2019s quite a frightening imagination, but yeah. It looks like you\u2019re on the mark.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Cheers to Yu IlHan\u2019s amazing perception.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know who it is, but it looks like this person had learned magic engineering properly. Rejoice, Yu IlHan. It looks like the materials you will get to see will be quite amazing!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes me tearfully happy dammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>These damned angels always got along each other at times like this! Yu IlHan, who wanted to cry, shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScatter these damned fragments!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who had initially been unable to act in front of the gigantic golem, finally found his job. After receiving a buff from Na YuNa, he used wind magic to blow away the fragments that tried to fly back into the golem\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae also found her role. Although it was scary to approach the gigantic golem, compared to Yu IlHan on top of its body, she had it easy.</p><br/><p>Her eyes glistening, she wrapped her two arms in lightning. She would thoroughly melt and burn the fragments to prevent the golem from recovering!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s do that too! We can do at least that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if the golem takes a single step forward, we\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!</p><br/><p>An order from the imperial princess was heavier than their lives! The mages all started chanting, and the knights charged forward. Unless they destroyed every single golem fragment, or died, they would never regain peace of mind again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuu, now that\u2019s less interference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan noticed that the number of golem fragments flying towards him had decreased thanks to the others\u2019 actions, and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He could now finally proceed to the next stage!</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Driverrrrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s quite a naming sense.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan took out another weapon from the inventory, Erta interjected blandly. However, this wasn\u2019t named by Yu IlHan but by the Akashic Record, so there was no helping it. He snorted with a hmph and equipped it.</p><br/><p>That was a weapon, comprised of two parts, with a thick and long handle, and had two blades intersecting as if a cross shaped driver, which made it look a little funny.</p><br/><p>[Powerful and Bright Wind Death Driver]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 5,200]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 9,700/9,700]</p><br/><p>[Options-</p><br/><p>1. Possible to spin the blade rapidly by consuming mana and durability. attack power and piercing power increases by 40% when doing so.</p><br/><p>2. 40% increase in fire attribute attack power.</p><br/><p>3. 60% increase in spinning power.]</p><br/><p>[A weapon that generates an absurd amount of rotational force by using mana and the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band. It consumes durability rapidly, but can generate a proportional amount of attack power. However, in fact, this is merely a tool to use other weapons in a stronger way.]</p><br/><p>If someone saw this, they would ask if it wasn\u2019t just a massive electric cross shaped driver. And Yu IlHan would not deny it.</p><br/><p>And coincidentally, there was a conveniently placed \u2018screw\u2019 embedded here as well. Yu IlHan\u2019s gaze looked downwards.</p><br/><p>There, embedded in the body of the golem, was a bone screw that conveniently had a cross etched on it, and looked very convenient to spin with a driver.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re a genius.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stabbed with the Death Driver, down with all his might \u2013 Clack! With such a sound, the bone screw inside the golem\u2019s body, and the Death Driver was perfectly combined.</p><br/><p>[G, Guwoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>Perhaps it instinctively felt crisis dooming upon it, as it started rampaging while roaring like mad. However, Yu IlHan had long since mastered the art of standing still on top of a rampaging monster!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019M ME!! Yu IlHan the Digger!\u201d 2</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re no digger!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who ignored minor remarks, firmly gripped on the handle of the Death Driver, and poured mana into it \u2013 all of it, including the portion that had grown with him eating a magic stuffed cookie!</p><br/><p>[Ku, Kuuoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>When the Death Driver started spinning with a resounding sound, the bone screw connected to it naturally started spinning as well. As Yu IlHan had made spirals blades on the bone screw like an actual screw, in the process of making the pile bunker, once it started to move, the golem\u2019s body started being ground apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The golem\u2019s body was harder than any of the bones of creatures he had faced off against until now, but right now, not only was the bone screw deeply embedded, it was weakening the surroundings by emitting fire. The bone screw that emitted fire while spinning at insane speeds, pierced through the golem at a faster rate over time.</p><br/><p>[Kuwuahhhhhhhh!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy drill, is one that will pierce the heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought while grinding the body of a golem that was over level 250.</p><br/><p>That it was worth it to create this item, just to say that line.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>On that day, mankind received a grim reminder \u2013 the lines said by humans when seeing a titan of enormous size. It\u2019s splendid, with despair and a sense of defeat contained in those words. (Attack on Titan reference)</p><br/><p>My drill is one that will pierce the heavens! \u2013 A line from the main character, Simon, 4of the passion animation, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the giant electric driver!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>4/6 chapters!

The image reflected was the figure of a feeble beauty that had long, silky black hair, couple with a pair of light purple pupils that glowed mysteriously. It looked nothing like Mystic\u2019s normally nonchalant attitude!</p><br/><p>Even Mystic herself couldn\u2019t believe it and stared at the mirror, awestruck. Every time her emotions changed, her expression changed with it, so there was no doubt that the figure in the mirror was her\u2019s, but she found it difficult to take in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you make such a beautiful woman with the bodies of those stinky old men\u2026\u2026 rather than that, this is really me? Ah\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was speaking when she suddenly felt an unfamiliarity in her own voice. The feeling of vibration whenever her vocal cords moved was something that she had never experienced before. After all, she had been killed by Yu IlHan as soon as she was born!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo pretty\u2026\u2026. Even the voice is wonderful. The neck is pretty, the bones are pretty, the chest is pretty and the waist is pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop showering yourself with praises.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grumbled to Mystic that was touching random places all over her body in front of the mirror. Since making a new body with 7th class archangels and a 7th class magic stone was not an easy thing for him to do, even he was feeling slightly tired after the exertion.</p><br/><p>At least Orochi shared some common points with him in the aspect that they were both dragonkin (Orochi and Echjar) but since Mystic, who was born as a higher existence on Earth, had no common points whatsoever with the traitorous archangels that resided in Heaven , it was no wonder he had such a hard time!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop showing off your nude body and get clothed, Mystic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you were looking at my naked body all the time! Pervert, master is a pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Pygmalion so rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Cypriot sculptor Pygmalion was the man who fell in love with his own sculpture, the first figurine otaku of mankind, to speak of.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yu IlHan felt that it was natural to feel some sense of love towards one\u2019s creations since every work was essentially the embodiment of the ideals of the creator, but he did not feel that love equated to sexual desire. So, even though he felt a slight attachment to and attained a sense of satisfaction after completing Mystic\u2019s nude body, his sexual desire didn\u2019t even move by a single nanometer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made your clothes too. It\u2019s one of my masterpieces so receive it with gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to push me around all the time in the future though\u2026\u2026 Wow, it\u2019s God ranked!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe materials were good so that\u2019s to be expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic covered her body with one hand and received her clothes from Yu IlHan with the other. She exclaimed as she couldn\u2019t feel any weight from it, but weight was nothing compared to the information on the artifact.</p><br/><p>Really, it was a simple, sleeveless white one piece dress, but its actual identity was an armor that boasted tremendous defense power thanks to investing almost all of Daiel and Ramiel\u2019s feathers. Of course, it wasn\u2019t a simple armor either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought out the traits of the traitors when I created it. When you focus on controlling the Flying fortress, the Guardian fortress, or the Traps of Restoration, it will stay white, but when you enter battle the one piece will turn black. Read the specific details later\u2026\u2026 and here, a straw hat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so pretty\u2026\u2026 urgh, this is God ranked as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018straw\u2019 hat that was made with the remaining feathers and el hazra had naturally become God ranked as well, and when Mystic put it on, she looked like a rich lady on a stroll. Being satisfied with his creations, Yu IlHan let out a smile and spoke to Mystic who was touching the straw hat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only need to wear that when you\u2019re controlling things inside the Flying fortress. It will amplify your calculation abilities as a whole.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get how master makes all these amazing things like nothing. Oh, my head doesn\u2019t hurt at all now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Controlling the two fortresses was no big deal at all now. Not only that, she felt as if she could control a thousand times more than the Traps of Restoration that existed now. Though actually, it was the fact that the Traps of Restoration had their own control function that made that possible, but still, it was an amazing feat. Mystic smiled in satisfaction, thinking that Yu IlHan kept his promise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, master. You really did put some effort in. \u2026\u2026Though, I don\u2019t know what to feel when I think you\u2019re the one that made me like this in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time you were an enemy, but now, you\u2019re an ally. Anyhow, since you\u2019re well-dressed, go to Orochi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light words that Yu IlHan spoke of colored Mystic\u2019s face bright red. Bullseye.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what are you saying! Why do I need to go to Orochi! It\u2019s not like that? I have absolutely no interest in that snake! He only annoys me since he teases me all the time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m planning to make proper equipment for him after I made you one. So go call Orochi for me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had a smile on while he was speaking. Mystic despaired after looking at his expression which revealed that he knew everything. It was her complete defeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot. An idiot who gets fooled by an idiot\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>She slowly walked out and unfurled two pairs of white dragon wings from her back. Although the league of her body was extremely high, her soul hadn\u2019t reached that level yet and she remained a 6th class.</p><br/><p>[A white dragon\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only her image. In fact, I\u2019m rather curious about how Orochi will react to Mystic.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Did you not send her to get him?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I wanted to get him, I could have just messaged him directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Echjar became silent. That was true. However, Mystic was too depressed to realize that and went to get Orochi herself! Thinking about how angry she would act later, he found it fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Should I just lay out the foundations for Orochi\u2019s equipment? Keshein and Hillutonne\u2019s bodies are\u2026\u2026 whew, Keshein has a magic stone. Such a lucky one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The former Dragon of Despair, Echjar, resolved to never go against Yu IlHan. His ruler was in an extremely faraway realm both in the aspects of the mind and the body!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fooled me, masterrrrrrrrrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>Around ten minutes later, Mystic, as red as a tomato, came back with Orochi who was sighing. Yu IlHan met the two while giggling. With the Cradle of Miracles folded out for Orochi.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Three hours passed, and this time Orochi was showing off his body in the mirror that Mystic once used. Although Yu IlHan was only planning to upgrade his equipment, he took a look at his body while he was at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve completely melted into the body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I worked hard for it you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was only a black haired handsome youth with copper skin and sculpted muscle on the outside, a shocking amount of power laid within. After he became a higher existence with Echjar\u2019s body, Orochi had thought that there were no more aspects to get stronger in, and now he had to take that back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you even adjusted the minute imbalances in the body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you have become a higher existence, Echjar\u2019s body that was used to make your body wasn\u2019t complete, was it? I only supplemented the lacking parts using the remains I had leftover from making your equipment. Although it was quite hard to dragonify their bodies, it was much easier than Mystic\u2019s case other than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan extracted the very essence of Keshein and Hilluttone\u2019s bodies to combine with Orochi, who had Echjar\u2019s body, to bring out its potential to the max. Above all, he had put in a lot of effort to diffuse Orochi\u2019s soul fully, so that he would never have to suffer any pain due to inharmony between his body and soul.</p><br/><p>As something like a side effect, it was no longer possible for Orochi to leave as a thought soul from his body. Orochi was no longer a thought-soul but a full whole soul that possessed a body.</p><br/><p>This was the same with Mystic as well. Of course, she was still the control tower of the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress as well as being the managing director of the Traps of Restoration, but it was no longer possible for her to escape her body and be infused into the Flying fortress. Since she was reborn as a complete soul and possessed a complete body, it was natural that she could no longer leave it at her convenience.</p><br/><p>Orochi\u2019s two eyes widened after hearing that fact from Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026\u2026 the realm of the Creator? I don\u2019t comprehend the extent of master\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have still a lot of lacking points to be called a complete Creator, but I\u2019m better than you think at least. Well then. Go ahead and give me your respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do get that you\u2019re becoming a lot more arrogant as time goes\u2026\u2026 ugh, you really are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orochi brought out his purple flames and controlled it only to be shocked by the extent of amplification which was much higher compared to before. He couldn\u2019t believe that it was possible to perfectly and completely synchronise the bodies of different higher existences. However, Yu IlHan was worried about something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the pressure on your body, you think you can hold out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBarely. Although I was aware of this before\u2026\u2026 the league of my soul is too low compared to the upgraded body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this before, but since your soul has become perfect, your soul will endlessly experience growth in the future, albeit slowly. Perhaps because you were once a dragonkin, you are one of those that received the most effects in the Cradle of Miracles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone under Yu IlHan that had qualifications to become higher existences were all reborn as dragons through the same process, but it wasn\u2019t like everybody had an equal rate of growth.</p><br/><p>The efficiency differed according to how well they synchronized with Yu IlHan\u2019s records that was transferred through the Cradle of Miracles. Liera, who loved him to the extent that she received a blessing from a god, had the highest efficiency, while Yumir, who reached the realm of higher existences at the same time as him wasn\u2019t that far behind.</p><br/><p>And after those two was Orochi, who was being shocked in front of the mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026 exciting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAway with your exciting crap. Are all of you exhibitionists? I completely remade your original equipment so wear it. Hey, get it quickly. What are you going to do if there\u2019s a peeper outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was such a pervert under you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a problem because there is. Yu IlHan mocked Orochi in his heart since Orochi could not sense Mystic hiding outside the workshop, peeking inside, as he gave him his equipment.</p><br/><p>Orochi tilted his head but still received the items anyway. A set of black underclothes that lined the inner layer, and was very elastic while being tough in defenses. Adding on to that, a thin black metallic armor \u2013 it looked similar to the Flamesoul Dragon Body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis looks similar to your armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t create Eternal ranked items like it\u2019s nothing, well, its functions shouldn\u2019t be too far behind. It\u2019s a God-ranked artifact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of God-ranked items so easily, as expected of master who mocks God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orochi felt anew after thinking about the past. Would he have been able to step on the ground with two legs like this with such a strong body if he hadn\u2019t expressed his submission towards Yu IlHan?</p><br/><p>Of course, the Orochi of that time is dead and the Orochi that remained in this place could be said to be another Orochi that was born again\u2026\u2026 but at least it was fun for him that he could be under Yu IlHan\u2019s wing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster sure is an interesting man. Although it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t have fun when I went around destroying cities\u2026\u2026 this is much more interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will become interesting to the point of seriousness in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am prepared. Talk about it anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orochi equipped all his gear and stood next to Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan collected all the Traps of Restoration piled on one side of his workshop, into his inventory and called for Mystic that was hiding behind a wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic, let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiik!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic was startled and walked out stiffly. She never knew that she was found out. Even though it was inside her domain, the Flying fortress, trying to \u2018hide\u2019 in front of Yu IlHan was a foolish thing for her to do.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Mystic? Why are you coming out from there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiik, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was quick-witted in the past, Orochi only tilted his head in confusion thinking \u2018why is she there?\u2019 after looking at her.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed after looking at the confused Orochi and the bright red Mystic. It seems like these guys changed in personality after acquiring bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first install the Traps of Restoration in Dareu. We need to strike back for real now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a counterattack against those frightening, uh, what was their name again? Legna, thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spoke out in an ever more serious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a counterattack against all foreshadows and plots that exist in the world.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

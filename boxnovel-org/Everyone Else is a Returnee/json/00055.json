Of course, there weren\u2019t only avians here but also lightning rats that looked like P*k*ch* R**ch*, which made him worry about copyright infringements, and also lizards, snakes and even bears. (T/N: In case you don\u2019t know pokemon(i.e. me) they are Pidgeotte, Pidgeot, Mega Pidgeot, Pikachu and Raichu)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>While cleaving a giant lightning rat by swing his deathgod\u2019s dragon-exterminating spike spear, Yu IlHan muttered.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 579,839 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 71 Big Lightning Rat.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys are too weak and I don\u2019t get injured at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s quite the unfortunate matter.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Zzz](Lita)</p><br/><p>The first thing he did when he came inside this dungeon was to check the levels of the monsters. He had to do this first in order for his life to not be threatened.</p><br/><p>Befitting of a dungeon with level 70 as the restriction, all monsters were above level 70, and some even reached level 80 or 90, but all of them died with a single hit from Yu IlHan\u2019s spear.</p><br/><p>Just how was this possible? \u2013 if you ask that, it was because of the absurd characteristics of his equipment.</p><br/><p>Setting aside the trivial options with his concealment or critical hit rate, and considering just the attack power,</p><br/><p>his attack power would increase by 30% and his fighting ability would increase by another 20% due to fighting \u2018life\u2019. These were the effects of being a Rookie Reaper.</p><br/><p>Due to the option from the spike spear, his attack power would increase by another 30% when doing a surprise attack,</p><br/><p>the robe increases his attack power by another 20% in a surprise attack,</p><br/><p>and finally his armor increased his attack power by 50% in a surprise attack.</p><br/><p>In other words, when he attacks in surprise, he would attack with a 130% increase in attack power. There would be a 20% increase in damage as long as the counterpart was a life form, so, within this dungeon where undead cannot be found, his surprise attack would be 2.5 times powerful!</p><br/><p>2.5 times didn\u2019t simply mean the effect of hitting two and a half times.</p><br/><p>For example, let\u2019s say that Yu IlHan\u2019s attack power was 1,000, and the defense of the opponent was 500.</p><br/><p>The defensive stat would vary according to the state of the armor, and the part where the attack lands, but anyway, when Yu IlHan\u2019s spear successfully lands, the opponent would be inflicted with the amount of attack value that surpassed the defense value, in other words, 500, damage.</p><br/><p>If it was just two and a half hits, then it would end with 500 damage being inflicted twice, and would end with 1,000 damage in total, and even calculating by multiplication, it would end at 1,250. (T/N: In case you don\u2019t get this, the calculations are:</p><br/><p>However, in a real situation, the damage was not like that. Yu IlHan\u2019s attack power would be multiplied by 2.5 to become 2,500, while the opponent\u2019s defense would still be 500. Therefore, the damage would be 2,000. In other words, it would increase by 4 times.</p><br/><p>Since the attack power and the defense was just set at random, in a real situation, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean the damage would be 4 times as much.</p><br/><p>Just that, within this dungeon, at least, Yu IlHan\u2019s spear strike was bringing out a more fearsome might than the deathgod\u2019s scythe.</p><br/><p>{Kwek!}</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 776,754 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 82 Lightning Bear]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 822,122 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 88 Lightning Bird]</p><br/><p>As a finisher, his title, \u2018Not two hits nor three hits, but one hit\u2019, gave him 20% more experience when he killed the monsters in a single strike, and even dropped magic stones at a higher rate, so Yu IlHan just had to harvest the experience and the magic stones.</p><br/><p>[Now you\u2019re even complaining that you aren\u2019t getting injured? You really are a pervert.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting injured so I can\u2019t train my transcendent regeneration.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s your problem?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Zzz.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Of course, once he deployed transcendent regeneration, there was a need for him to rest. However, Yu IlHan was a master of rest; All moments when he\u2019s not in battle was resting time for him, and no matter how much he hunts he could use transcendent regeneration again in just 3 hours.</p><br/><p>In the first place, transcendent regeneration didn\u2019t require a mastery of rest for nothing. If one did not master rest, then the prerequisites to use the skill wouldn\u2019t be fulfilled at all.</p><br/><p>As it\u2019s such a harsh skill, if he did not train and lower the conditions now, he may have to train it while confronting 4th class monsters. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t want to call that \u2018training\u2019 but a \u2018life and death battle\u2019.</p><br/><p>As such, he decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well, I\u2019ll train the superhuman strength too then.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he did have the thought to train transcendent regeneration and superhuman strength parallel, but it was more correct to say that he found it interesting that the monsters were snapped to death one after another, and did not use the skill.</p><br/><p>Superhuman strength increased physical abilities for 3 minutes, but once the duration ended, he would be weakened for 10 minutes. no matter how strong Yu IlHan is, he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill monsters over level 80 in a single strike in his weakened state\u2026 right?</p><br/><p>If then, the monsters would have the chance to counterattack, Yu IlHan would be injured, and he would be able to train the transcendent regeneration. Killing monsters and training skills; there, everyone\u2019s happy!</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect. This really is a perfect plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, perfect. You\u2019re a perfect pervert!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[ZzzZzz.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Erta condemned Yu IlHan, who chose the path of suffering, without knowing how he felt. With the poor sleeping \u2018beauty\u2019 angel Lita on his head, Yu IlHan charged through the dungeon.</p><br/><p>First, he used superhuman strength on purpose to sweep monsters with frightening destructive power for 3 minutes, and waited for the penalty to decrease his abilities.</p><br/><p>[Superhuman strength has become level 2.]</p><br/><p>[Physical strength decreases by 50% for 9 minutes 50 seconds since the duration of superhuman strength skill has ended.]</p><br/><p>People feel more loss the more they have. Yu IlHan, who, not counting mana, had status points that neared the 3rd class, even wanted to lie down right there and rest due to the weakened physical strength.</p><br/><p>However, that moment was exactly the moment to move. The conviction that monsters would not be killed by his weakened power was invading him. And coincidentally, there was a strong looking monster nearby. That thing that looked like M*g* P*dg**t!</p><br/><p>{Kweeeeek!}</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it really didn\u2019t die!\u201d</p><br/><p>{*Kuuuk*}</p><br/><p>Only after it allowed a preemptive strike to land did it recognize Yu IlHan\u2019s figure before the giant lightning bird spat out lightning from its mouth with a bizarre sound.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan even got hit by an attack that was fast, but could see the trajectory of, on purpose, while charging. In fact, it was hard to dodge since his muscular power was weakened too!</p><br/><p>\u201cKhk, that\u2019s ticklish.\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kuruk! Kurururuk!!}</p><br/><p>When the attack landed, the lightning bird charged towards him in delight.</p><br/><p>On one side, Yu IlHan was confused since its attack did not hurt at all, before he realized that his armor was a legend rank one. Since he either fought monsters that couldn\u2019t even scratch the armor, or those that literally ignored it, he had no chance to see the might of his armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I take it off?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll get angry.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cTch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan seriously considered de-equipping himself, but even for him, in a dungeon where he did not know what would pop out, it was foolish for him to take off his armor. He knew this fact well.</p><br/><p>Moreover, no matter how small, isn\u2019t it still an injury? If he got hit 30 more times like this, he would be able to use transcendent regeneration.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, Ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kuuuk!}</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grabbed the spear with both of his hands, which became slightly numb due to lightning, and charged at the lightning bird. His spear wouldn\u2019t flinch with just a small injury.</p><br/><p>The breathing that matched instantly, and the spearhead that struck out in the correct moment! The spear, which looked like it would split the horizon in half, halved the lightning bird.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 784,343 experience.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, still, it died with two hits.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s because your abilities would increase by 20% when confronting life. The abilities of a class are important due to that. Rookie Reaper not only increases surprise attack power to the extreme, but is also a good unique class that helps out sufficiently in battle situations. You would also have no problem with fighting undead since Angel\u2019s Partner will support you. Although it\u2019s a coincidence, Rookie Reaper and Angel\u2019s Partner have quite the good affinity.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI should get hit more before the penalty ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You really are hateful.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Zzzzz](Lita)</p><br/><p>Like that, Yu IlHan kept using superhuman strength, swept the monsters in the 3 minute duration, and fought a hard battle with his weakened strength.</p><br/><p>If he fought for 5 minutes with the penalty, he could use transcendent regeneration. However, as mentioned before, transcendent regeneration required rest energy to use, so he couldn\u2019t use it again until he recovered rest energy. Like this, there was no way this would be a proper training session.</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was something that Yu IlHan took out from the Cross Bag to drink. It was none other than a portion-pack of bloodrink.</p><br/><p>[Ah, why did you take that out at this time!?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuu, rest energy is filling me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[What!?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Zzzzzzzzzzz.](Lita)</p><br/><p>The story turns back a little. This was when Yu IlHan pondered on how to train his skill after he came back after defeating Reta Kar\u2019iha.</p><br/><p>He could use try&amp;try to somehow train the rest of the skills, but the only skill that weighed on his mind was the transcendent regeneration.</p><br/><p>Resting at least 3 hours after using it once\u2026 Just considering the skill training requirements, he had to reuse transcendent regeneration for hundreds or thousands of years. There was no way he would do something that useless.</p><br/><p>As such, Yu IlHan pondered on how to recover rest energy that would normally be filled with rest, with another method.</p><br/><p>The first thing he could think of was Na YuNa\u2019s holy power. However, she wasn\u2019t an item that Yu IlHan could carry around like a battery. Then what else? What came to his mind then was the troll\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>As soon as he thought that, he started making the bloodrink and\u2026 it became like now. At least several thousand liters were packed into small portions and were waiting for their consumption within the Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan calmly explained to Erta, who was looking at him dumbfoundedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrolls only eat and sleep and eat and sleep, rinse and repeat. Their blood is full of rest energy due to that, and isn\u2019t that concentrated energy that\u2019s healing their injuries fast? I thought like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, it should be.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, wouldn\u2019t this bloodrink, which is made by refining troll\u2019s blood, be the only drink that would be able to recover rest energy in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Probably, if you have extreme poison resistance that is.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This bloodrink isn\u2019t simply a potion-replacement that recovers injuries fast. This is a specialized potion to train transcendent regeneration!\u201d</p><br/><p>His conclusion was very absurd, but at the same time, very reasonable. Well, he just recovered rest energy using bloodrink right now, so it just got proven!</p><br/><p>And just 200ml worth had enough effect of 3 to 4 hour rest. This was really a rest drink.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, you\u2019re right. Just how did I not think of that until now? No, just why did other people not think of training transcendent regeneration with troll\u2019s blood?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t learn it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah.]</p><br/><p>Erta ended up acknowledging Yu IlHan\u2019s nonchalant reply.</p><br/><p>Since Rest skill was unimaginably hard to learn and train, there weren\u2019t many who mastered it.</p><br/><p>Naturally, those who learned transcendent regeneration would be few as well.</p><br/><p>There maybe cases where they learn a similar skill to transcendent regeneration due to the special characteristics of a class or a race. The demon race, which are the higher existence of Breakers, and the innate overlords, the dragonkin are like that. Holy knights were known to have a similar skill when their job reached the extreme.</p><br/><p>However, those were not transcendent regeneration. They were skills with a different effect, a different penalty, and different requirements to use.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, Erta maybe might currently be with a man who may master transcendent regeneration for the first time in the multiverse.</p><br/><p>Of course, all this was not possible without extreme poison resistance. It was truly absurd, but currently, Yu IlHan was the only(Yu IlHan) existence who was perfectly ready to train transcendent regeneration!</p><br/><p>[Extreme Poison Resistance Skill has become level 8.]</p><br/><p>[Cooking Skill has become level 15.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, other skills level up too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of refining the troll\u2019s blood or not, it was still extreme poison, so when he drank it, extreme poison resistance skill would grow. Since it was also a high difficulty cuisine with the ingredients being extremely toxic, just drinking it would increase the cooking skill as well.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m tired of getting shocked so I won\u2019t. Although I\u2019m forgetting nowadays, higher existences are able to control their emotions.]</p><br/><p>[ZzzZzz.]</p><br/><p>To be more shocked, it would affect her pride, so Erta started controlling her emotions. Along with the ever-sleeping angel Lita, Yu IlHan proceeded to the deeper part of the mutated species dungeon.</p><br/><p>In front of Yu IlHan, who could finish all monsters with two strikes even with the penalty from the superhuman strength skill, the dungeon was being destroyed at a frightening rate.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>In the last chapter, some people were doubtful about the prices of the weapons, so to explain, Kang MiRae only offered the highest price she could after considering the abilities of the smith, the level of the materials, the magic stone, and all other elements! We know of Yu IlHan\u2019s ability, but the only thing she knows that he has a connection with a smith with level 29 mana crafting! Meaning that she isn\u2019t just trying to buy a legendary equipment with 10 billion won!</p><br/><p>Answer \u2013 Bloodrink was a drink to train transcendent regeneration. There are people with extraordinary deductive powers\u2026</p><br/><p>Skill training labor should be done in groups\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I\u2019m NOT translating Onomatopoeia\u2026 I\u2019m just leaving it as it is\u2026 how do birds cry when they are injured\u2026? chirp chirp? How do they cry when they\u2019re delighted? Still chirp chirp\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The boss-tier leopard monsters that appeared in the initial stages of the Great Cataclysm and the mutates species in this dungeon were monsters that evolved from the original animals on Earth, and in contrast, those that occurred naturally from concentration of mana are the ones such as Metal Hearts and trolls.</p><br/><p>The angels called the former \u2018Originals\u2019 and the latter, \u2018Migrants\u2019. Even though the only difference was that they were born after the Great Cataclysm, it was not known why the angels called them \u2018Migrants\u2019.</p><br/><p>On the basis, the structure of the physical bodies of the two types weren\u2019t that different. They were the same in the sense that they were monsters, some had magic stones, some had bones that were metallic, and some wielded the power of lightning. Regardless of their types, strong monsters were strong and weak ones were weak.</p><br/><p>Just that, regarding their potential, the story changes entirely.</p><br/><p>The natural-born monsters from the concentration of mana are strong at the beginning but their growth potential was not that big, and would need a long time to evolve to the next stage.</p><br/><p>Once they were trapped in dungeons, they ate mana within it to slowly, very slowly grow and wait for challengers. Of course, there were always exceptions, so it was rumored that some insane monsters absorb their entire race\u2019s record to evolve to a higher existence.</p><br/><p>However, the monsters that evolved from animals originally on Earth, by acquiring mana, were different. They may be weak at first, but their growth potential was a variable; there maybe those who ended up as weak level monsters, and there maybe those that may evolve to acquire godly strength.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Earth\u2019s characteristics were added, and the starting levels of the animals that lived for one thousand years, were already damn high, and they mostly had high potentials as well. This meant that, on Earth, no one should be careless of a dungeon where \u2018Originals\u2019 resided in.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 2,489,775 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 98 Great Thunder Bear.]</p><br/><p>[Superhuman Strength skill has become level 15. The aftereffects of the skill decreases.]</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan, who blew away the neck of a monster in a single strike, Erta shouted.</p><br/><p>[Like I said, be careful a little!](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t take off my armor. Oh, superhuman strength just levelled up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wow, level 15 already? That\u2019s one of the rewards from Heaven\u2019s Quest, right?](Lita)</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t he taking it lightly because you, Lita, are taking this lightly!](Erta)</p><br/><p>Regardless of what the angels were chatting about, Yu IlHan concentrated on dismantling the electric bear\u2019s body. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t easily instakill a near level 100 monster. It could be said to be because of a critical hit on top of his superhuman strength.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, one of the titles\u2019 effect activated, and perhaps due to the 20% increase inj probability, a magic stone with strong lightning powers popped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this, I gathered enough magic stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s good to sell weapons or armor, but don\u2019t release magic stones easily. At the current point in time on Earth, 2nd class magic stones are a more dangerous currency than you think.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why Erta was so nagging about that when he felt like the people on Earth would grow to hunt 2nd class monsters easily. Of course, that was just Yu IlHan\u2019s hope.</p><br/><p>Now, he didn\u2019t want to catch attention like LA\u2019s Dark Knight or Sungdaein Bolt. As he was one who had no memories of gathering any attention in his life, it was more painful for him.</p><br/><p>With a bitter smile, he put the rest of the part of the bear, the large amount of meat, the bones, and the skin. He didn\u2019t think about what materials he would use to create the robe to sell to Kang MiRae, but it seems it would be enough with the materials he gathered in this dungeon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the third day?\u201d</p><br/><p>[About that much. It\u2019s alright to think it over slowly. Compared to the Metal Heart dungeon, you\u2019re going at a fast pace.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[It kinda annoys me that you\u2019re talking as if reminiscing a memory about just the two of you.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the one to talk when you\u2019ve been sleeping this entire time.](Erta)</p><br/><p>At Erta\u2019s sharp call, Lita declared shamelessly.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s because beauties are sleepyheads!]</p><br/><p>[But not all sleepyheads become beauties. If it\u2019s as you say, Sn*rl*x would have become a heroine long time ago.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a male so he can\u2019t become a heroine. Probably.\u201d</p><br/><p>Concluding the angels\u2019 hopeless conversation, Yu IlHan stood up. Seeing him take out the pile bunker from his inventory, Erta flinched and asked.</p><br/><p>[Even I didn\u2019t feel it\u2026 Did you feel a strong monster\u2019s presence?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m preparing since I feel that something might pop out now I asked about the time and you girls were talking crap.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Please tell me the method to enjoy life like you do.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare for life for about a thousand years. It can\u2019t not be fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta found Yu IlHan\u2019s future prediction absurd, but what was more absurd was the strong aura that could be felt immediately after/</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan smirked at her wordlessly, Erta couldn\u2019t hide her frustration.</p><br/><p>[This dungeon was originally a level 70 restricted dungeon, wasn\u2019t it? But how can there be a 3rd class monster appearing as if it were natural?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true. No matter if they are Originals or not, this speed of growth is too abnormal.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it because they grew up too fast after the initial level check? You too know that Earth isn\u2019t ordinary. You might want to renew the dungeon information more frequently from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, I\u2019ll request for that.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Just why was such an important issue not edited yet? That was because insane people like Yu IlHan, who enters dungeons with level requirements above 50 did not exist yet.</p><br/><p>2nd class monsters appearing in a level 40 restricted dungeon, and a 3rd class appearing within a level 70 restricted dungeon were completely different in danger levels.</p><br/><p>Speaking clearly, the only ones who encountered 3rd class monsters in a dungeon were Yu IlHan, Na YuNa and Kang HaJin. It was natural that there was no report to the angels.</p><br/><p>Although it seemed plausible to ignore the level restrictions and enter dungeons since Yu IlHan did that, in fact, there weren\u2019t that many people on Earth who enjoyed adventure. That was because most people were aware that they only had one life.</p><br/><p>Before, Na YuNa and Kang HaJin stepped into a dungeon with the level restriction of 50 without any hesitation, but that was only because the materials they needed were within that dungeon.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Kang MiRae\u2019s 2nd job advancement, and without Na YuNa\u2019s absurd ability, they would never do such a thing.</p><br/><p>There were unwritten iron rules in other worlds, and those were: to check if one\u2019s own level was higher than the dungeon restriction level by 10 or more, to check if there were at least 5 members in the party, and to procure an escape route to escape at moment\u2019s notice</p><br/><p>All people of Earth that went to other worlds for 10 years had learnt those rules for survival, as much as they got to learn to use mana. Excluding Yu IlHan, that is.</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaaaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>The one that appeared was a giant bird. Its entire body was colored in gold, and every time it flapped its wings, a small streak of lightning would fall from its surroundings. It boasted of an overwhelming aura!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could not guess what kind of animal it had been originally. He only predicted that it may have appeared by clashing with other monsters several times to evolve.</p><br/><p>Looking at all the sparks that appeared due to the lightning attribute mana that gathered towards it, Yu IlHan muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems it will hurt a little if I get hit by that guy. It looks even stronger than the Highland Troll Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think it will end with just \u2018a little\u2019.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pondered for a moment, but he decided. He wouldn\u2019t die with that as the opponent anyway! If it hurt slightly much, then he would welcome it. Not because he was a pervert, but because he could train transcendent regeneration.</p><br/><p>Thanks to levelling up to level 15, the duration of superhuman strength still had 2 minutes left. Moreover, he could reduce the penalty time using the bloodrink so there was no need to hesitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s kill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kicked off the ground. It was still emitting small streaks of lightning everywhere so he might be found before he attacked. To avoid that, he had no choice but to attack from a higher position!</p><br/><p>\u201cHup!\u201d</p><br/><p>200m away from the bird, Yu IlHan jumped high. Before, he had buildings where he could kick off in the air to go higher, but now, there was nothing.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t mind that. With pure leg strength, and the physical strength from the superhuman strength skill, along with the optimal leap technique which was engraved into him from the countless times of training, were supporting him!</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the conditional skill, Leap. You can use it while deploying superhuman strength, and you can use it to jump high using the enhanced leg strength. You can jump quicker and higher the more the skill levels up.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s body flew up several hundred meters in an instant. He even felt a little faint since the surrounding scenery was changing so fast, but he came to himself at the next moment and aimed at the target.</p><br/><p>The giant electric bird, which seem to know that a human has entered the dungeon, but did not catch Yu IlHan\u2019s presence, was under his foot!</p><br/><p>His figure drawing a parabola, he dropped downwards. At that moment, the electric bird started moving its body suddenly.</p><br/><p>Clicking his tongue, Yu IlHan fixed his trajectory by flapping his legs in midair, but it seemed difficult to target the head. Clicking his tongue, he muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the skin will be ruined.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s your problem?](Erta)</p><br/><p>At the moment when he was about to fall to the ground if he wasn\u2019t careful, Yu IlHan activated the Cross Bag\u2019s option. Weight Transfer! He transferred the weight of the Cross Bag onto the pile bunker.</p><br/><p>As he had put all his spoils of war of 3 days into his Cross Bag, the weight was over tens of tons! Yu IlHan\u2019s dropping speed increased.</p><br/><p>The giant bird\u2019s body zoomed in within Yu IlHan\u2019s vision. I can\u2019t run! \u2013 with a skeptical smile, Yu IlHan nailed the pile bunker onto it just like that!</p><br/><p>Kigigigigik!</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaaaaak!}</p><br/><p>The bone-shivering sound as the ammo pierced its body, and the electric bird\u2019s screech of pain resounded out/</p><br/><p>The pile bunker successfully shot the ammo into the electric bird\u2019s body, but due to the strong rebound, it didn\u2019t dig the bird\u2019s body enough and stopped mid way!</p><br/><p>The pile bunker, which instakilled many monsters until now, had failed to do so for the first time.</p><br/><p>{kwak! Kuaaaaaaaak!}</p><br/><p>\u201cKehk!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed to be in so much pain as it violently rampaged while emitting lightning from its entire body. However, the moment Yu IlHan realized that he failed to instakill the bird, let go of the pile bunker and jumped backwards.</p><br/><p>At almost the same moment, its wings brought up a lightning vortex. Due to his quick judgement, Yu IlHan could escape the range of effect of the vortex, but the pile bunker he left behind got caught up and was spinning in midair.</p><br/><p>It would be fortunate if it didn\u2019t get ruined due to the lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not let you go if my dear bunker is injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026You\u2019re gonna kill it anyway.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Landing safely on the ground, Yu IlHan checked the duration of superhuman strength. It was around 1 minute 12 seconds. It would be good if he could kill it by charging at it with the spike spear, but from the looks of the clump of lightning it was releasing, he didn\u2019t feel like doing so.</p><br/><p>Moreover, after getting hit by a strong strike, the giant bird now knew of his position; and with the pile bunker ammo embedded on its body, it was charging right at him insanely with the lightning vortex around it as well. Even getting hit by a train(T/N: How about Truck-kun?) would be better than getting hit by that.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018heheh\u2019 laugh, Yu IlHan ran backwards. He didn\u2019t have the hobby to commit suicide.</p><br/><p>[What happened to training transcendent regeneration?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo good, please try next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replying playfully to Erta\u2019s joke, Yu IlHan took out the rough moonlight\u2019s bone atlatl, the spear throwing device. Although it had a range increase option, in a situation where the counterpart was charging right at him, it didn\u2019t fit in that much.</p><br/><p>If there was a moon in the sky, then attack power and accuracy would have increased by 40% but it was unfortunate that there was no such thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s a frag shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Running to avoid the electric bird\u2019s charge, Yu IlHan quietly muttered. Erta asked back.</p><br/><p>[Then why is it not exploding?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI designed it so that it would only explode the moment it\u2019s completely inside the enemy\u2019s body, in fear of hurting myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just how did he make that? He really had some good skills.</p><br/><p>However, even though Erta had only heard that much, she realized what Yu IlHan was intending to do.</p><br/><p>[Are you trying to shoot the throwing spear onto that pile bunker ammo to drive it deeper?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan violently grabbed the bone atlatl. He checked the distance between them, and the duration of superhuman strength.</p><br/><p>29 seconds. No problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>He leaped yet again. As the conditional skill leap was correcting his body\u2019s movements, he could jump even higher.</p><br/><p>An opportunity rose up. The opportunity for him to throw the spear in the same trajectory as last time, and at the same time, the opportunity for the bird to to attack Yu IlHan, who could not move freely in the air!</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaa!}</p><br/><p>The giant bird spat out a lump of lightning from its beak. As he had resolved for that much, Yu IlHan received it with all his body, and stopped in mid air for a short moment due to the shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>A golden electric current ran throughout Yu IlHan\u2019s body. As it was not a 3rd class monster for nothing, it really did hurt a lot. Transcendent regeneration activated immediately, but even with that, he couldn\u2019t recover completely.</p><br/><p>However, if he lost the opportunity now, then he would receive an even bigger shock because of its charge. That thought made Yu IlHan endure.</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and tensed his arms. The body that trembled due to the electric shock, was stopped by the mentality that had surpassed the human level.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yu IlHan violently swung his arm with the atlatl to shoot the throwing spear. That attack was one that was more lightning-like than actual lightning.</p><br/><p>The short spear which was shot out, pierced the lightning vortex that the monster kept around it since it first allowed a hit to land, like nothing, and it instead absorbed the orbs of lightning that it had shot out while charging forward.</p><br/><p>Whether that was theoretically possible or not, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less. Since it was happening right in front of him.</p><br/><p>The thrown short spear reached the pile bunker ammo\u2019s end as if being sucked into it and hit it strongly. The ammo which received the short spear\u2019s force in its entirety naturally dug into its body, and the next moment, it exploded within the body to spit out thousands and tens of thousands of fragments.</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>Watching the giant bird drop onto the ground with a screech, Yu IlHan landed on the ground and took out another short spear before loading it on the bone atlatl.</p><br/><p>However, that was unnecessary. The lightning vortex around the bird\u2019s body seemed to grow weaker before it dissipated completely, and the next moment, with an enormous monstrous shout, it fell on the ground. It had died completely!</p><br/><p>[You have earned 6,965,384 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 122 Giant Thunder Bird.]</p><br/><p>[You have fulfilled one of the conditions to acquire the active skill, Counter. If you fulfill 3 more requirements, you are able to acquire Counter.]</p><br/><p>[The duration of Superhuman Strength ends, and for 7 minutes 30 seconds, muscular strength decreases to 60%\\</p><br/><p>[Death Collector has become level 4.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 60. 1 Strength, 2 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>With its death, powerlessness overcame Yu IlHan\u2019s body, before it disappeared due to levelling up. However, Yu IlHan\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t that good even though he had barely overcame the situation.</p><br/><p>[What is it, IlHan?](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering about why I levelled up at such a time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gripped the atlatl tightly.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, at that time, the pile bunker, which was spinning in mid air due to the giant bird\u2019s lightning vortex could be seen dropping towards the ground. And the next moment, a vortex that came out of nowhere raised it up again.</p><br/><p>That meant one thing.</p><br/><p>{Kuooooo!}</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaauuuuu!}</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there\u2019s no way my bad intuition is wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t boast so proudly!](Erta)</p><br/><p>And that was that he had to run around a little more for the battle to end.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The quantity was too much so I looked back to see if there were unnecessary things, but as it was enjoyable, I decided to upload it as is.</p><br/><p>Pokemon ref again.</p><br/><p>There is no intentional increase in quantity in the story. I wrote it since it\u2019s all necessary, and I put in effort to make it worth a single episode\u2019s value by checking twice or three times. But when I see \u2018you added unnecessary stuff\u2019, or \u2018I will drop if you split it into parts\u2019, and such comments, I get drained of energy (T/N: This doesn\u2019t apply to you English Readers\u2026 Korean readers are picky\u2026 Long chapters are good though, isn\u2019t it? (For reading, not translating)).</p><br/><p>As such, please refrain from putting comments that bring about a storm of lightning to the author\u2019s brain and heart. The story that readers even pay money(T/N: Shit) is Everyone Else is a Returnee written by \u2018Toika\u2019 Right?^^</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a lot of talk about dropping speed. Honestly, this author wrote it without thinking and has decided to find materials, and as a result, I\u2019ve found that when two items of the same surface area falls, the one with the bigger mass reaches terminal velocity faster.</p><br/><p>In other words, it will fall faster!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s STILL talks about dropping speed\u2026 I searched for 2 hours before I got fed up. Just why do I need to find these things\u2026 If it doesn\u2019t bother you to the point that you wake up in sleep because of this, can\u2019t you just read it? If you cannot let it go even in death, then please put a link that objectively, and shortly(!!) explains this that can be seen at a glance. Perhaps due to my inability of searching, I can only arrive at the conclusion that dropping faster is normal.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>People are wondering about angel\u2019s ranks\u2026</p><br/><p>4th class is at level 200</p><br/><p>5th class is at level 300, and from here, they would be considered higher existences.</p><br/><p>Lita and Erta are both angels with the suffix \u2018ta\u2019, this means that they\u2019re both 5th class angels.</p><br/><p>The reason why I used the word \u2018rank\u2019 and not \u2018class\u2019 is because there are gaps even in the same 5th class beings. You can consider Lita as a higher level than Erta, and Lita is also in a higher position than her. Myuta was the chairman of the angel\u2019s assembly last time, so he can be considered in a higher position than Lita as well, but he\u2019s still someone who is still at 5th class.(Heck, there\u2019s 100 level difference between 4th and 5th, there should be at least that amount of levels between 5th and 6th class, if not more)</p><br/><p>I will not spoil about 6th class since even I don\u2019t know what their levels are\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

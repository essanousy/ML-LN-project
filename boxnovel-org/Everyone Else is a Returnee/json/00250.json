While everyone was overwhelmed by the sight of Echjar\u2019s remains, Yu IlHan agilely hopped from the head to the tail while stripping the skin perfectly and separated the bones.</p><br/><p>Although Echjar had lost a lot of blood while falling down to a lower existence and cursing Yu IlHan, there was still a considerable amount of blood left, and not a single drop was wasted as everything was sucked into the Cradle of Miracles.</p><br/><p>The Cradle received all the blood and alternated between rising and falling. Liera realized this was the \u2018concentration\u2019 process that Yu IlHan had mentioned before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, that looks really abnormal\u2026\u2026 doesn\u2019t it become more dangerous by becoming distilled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not giving them to the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s dangerous after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t deny that, it didn\u2019t have the word \u2018miracle\u2019 in its name for nothing. The moment the Cradle of Miracles received Echjar\u2019s blood, it was returning the blood to the original state at a frightening speed. Meaning, the form it had prior to Echjar\u2019s falling. There was literally no way it was not dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really is the Cradle of Miracles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it will go further than that. Though, there should be a limit\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought \u2013 if he just left it there, perhaps he may be able to make a splendid \u2018Breath\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will become the greatest mana potion of all time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a mana potion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dragon\u2019s blood was at the apex of all blood of magical lifeforms. Mana recovery wasn\u2019t the only result. The Breath that Yu IlHan had drunk all this time had etched themselves into Yu IlHan\u2019s records.</p><br/><p>Although the incident that awakened the power of dragons was the contract with Yumir, Breath did indeed play a pivotal role in the development of the power..</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it might be possible for you guys as well. Let\u2019s start from a relatively weak 4th class dragon. Drinking wine and bathing, isn\u2019t it all good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds really ominous\u2026\u2026 well, it should be fine if it\u2019s with you, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Echjar\u2019s blood was only a minute portion of the remains. His skin, bones, and muscles were all of the highest quality. The most important aspect was the sheer quantity of them due to the size! There would be enough to equip an entire army and still have some left over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they all have their equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ll make a third levitating fortress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think I won\u2019t need it for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although there was an infinite amount of things he wanted to make with this dragon body, there was no time for that right now. In the end, the cleanly dismantled corpse went inside Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory again. He only left out a portion of them \u2013 his two eyes, heart, and the hardest chunk of scale at the chest.</p><br/><p>However, Liera looked at the heart that Yu IlHan was holding with his two hands and asked while tilting her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, isn\u2019t that a DRAGON HEART?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh what? Yeah, this is the heart. You saw me extract it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not just any heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s two eyes glistened like the milky way galaxy.</p><br/><p>\u201cA DRAGON HEART.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately put down the heart and checked. At the moment of extraction, the heart was like any ordinary dragon\u2019s heart, squishy and massive, but now that it became separated from the rest of the body, it was reducing in size while the hardness and the brightness was increasing. Of course, the mana inside was transforming as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan exclaimed with a single syllable and proceeded to touch it. It was indeed a DRAGON HEART. The exact same one that was infinitely more precious than a magic stone! This was a 7th class DRAGON HEART, so its worth would definitely be several orders of magnitude higher than a 7th class magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, whwhwhwhwhwhwhat do I do with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCccccc\u2026ccalm down, IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she was the one who said it, Liera, who noticed the value of it afterwards, also panicked. First, Yu IlHan hurriedly stored it inside his inventory. Even if Lupin appeared here, he wouldn\u2019t be able to steal Yu IlHan\u2019s DRAGON HEART. Yu IlHan finally heaved a sigh of relief and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did need a source of power for the final stage of my armor that I was designing\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An item that could fit that role, and was stronger than he had expected, had so suddenly appeared. He didn\u2019t even have the confidence to mana craft with this properly! Perhaps mastering the skill will allow him to?</p><br/><p>However, while Yu IlHan and Liera were at a loss what to do, the magic formation beneath their feet glowed lightly. Yu IlHan\u2019s expression stiffened as if someone had poured cold water over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic formation is restraining her from entering. It won\u2019t last long. It looks like I need to hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was slightly excited about the unprecedented treasure of a 7th class DRAGON HEART, this was no time to be like that. He had to make the necessary equipment as soon as possible, in order to commence the operation.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finished up the banquet that was almost broken up anyway, and made the people board the two respective fortresses. He hesitated a little before declaring.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone wait on Earth for around 2 hours. When I bring you back to Dareu, it will be the final battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was a little sorry for them as they were all prepared for battle, there was no turn for them this time either. This was due to Yu IlHan\u2019s lack of foresight, thinking that there would be no 7th class participants. He thought that there was no reason that they couldn\u2019t participate since the horror of Echjar had disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we need to wait 2 hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, are you going to do something dangerous again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir\u2019s eyes glistened again. However, Yu IlHan made a bitter smile and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s just\u2026\u2026. some affair between a man and a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>He said something so stupid trying to say it in a roundabout way! And to a little kid too! However, Liera was frustrated that she couldn\u2019t deny that. What\u2019s more was that Erta also had feelings for Yu IlHan. Of course, the person in question did not know that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will become a really big battle. Everyone prepare and resolve yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave a glance to Pat\u00e9, Mirey, Jirl, Ericia and his other subordinates and nodded his head and moved to Earth, and the next moment, he returned to Dareu alone\u2026\u2026 or he tried to, when his sleeve was grabbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need a buff, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go too, dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sigh, he looked back at them. They were Liera, Na YuNa, and Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you confident in your resistance to charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve received the blessing of the god of love. Meaning, I won\u2019t be affected by any charm while I still love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the blessing of the goddess of beauty. There\u2019s no one prettier than me so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m immune to all status ailments.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that Liera and Na YuNa may possibly resist the charm, but he blinked his eyes after hearing Yumir\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m immune to all status ailments, dad! It was around 70% when I was born, but after I became 4th class, I got a title saying I\u2019m immune!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 Thinking back, he was born with the title \u2018Birth of Chaos\u2019 (T/N: Check chapter 106). The OP title that gave him 70% resistance to all status ailments. He remembered that he gritted his teeth while thinking about the difference in status at birth, but to think that was a foreshadow for this moment\u2026 this was a mistake on the part of the foreshadow meister Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan knew very well that immunity didn\u2019t mean invincibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for 7th class being, they can break your immunity. It will be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have other titles and have around 250% resistance in total!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no gap at all for any status ailment. Yu IlHan had to admit his loss here.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, I guess I can\u2019t help it. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, I\u2019ll definitely be of help to dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to laugh at her after seeing how pretty she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNa YuNa, you have a good life.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yu IlHan returned to Dareu with the three of them, he immediately gave a call to Erta. She received the call as if she was waiting for this.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, are you alright?]</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, things are progressing a little too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hm, this side is the same in that things are progressing \u2018a little too fast\u2019.]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s words were very carefully said, but Yu IlHan instantly realized what was happening after hearing her words. The Garden of Sunset! He was sure that the they were trying to snatch Erta while the Destruction Demon Army and the Heaven\u2019s Army were fighting it out.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she was looking like she was following the will of the Garden of Sunset, and they would not cause any harm to her, but the problem was what was about to occur from now on. He was sure that the instance of an angel transferring to the Garden of Sunset would be very noisy, and it wasn\u2019t like the Heaven\u2019s Army would not know of that fact.</p><br/><p>It would be better if he still had some more time, but not everything went smoothly in life. Yu IlHan immediately took out an anvil and a hammer and checked with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you wait 5, no 10 more minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>[10 minutes, that\u2019s plenty.]</p><br/><p>Good, he could only try now. Echjar\u2019s two eyes and the hardest scale, and the blood inside the Cradle of Miracles would allow him to do this!</p><br/><p>[You, you\u2019re finally touching my body after you split me up to pieces?]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>After silencing Echjar, he dipped the two eyes and the scale in the blood. The Cradle of Miracles immediately resonated with them, and as he had wished to, they quickly regained their former leagues. However, there was no time for any exclamation right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this quickly\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mana crafting materials were two 5th class magic stones. These were the last 5th class magic stones he had.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan teared up a little but still powdered them and applied them on the hammer before hammering the scale. This was a very difficult process of blacksmithing and mana crafting at the same time! Such a difficult technique was being used to speed up the work process.</p><br/><p>\u201c2 minutes passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cgood.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Yu IlHan was making was a helmet. The helmet that would cover for his weakness!</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame combined with Blaze licked its tongue and melted Echjar\u2019s scale just as he had wished to. Yu IlHan cooled the scale with the blood and coated it thinly over the surface, and made a draconic-shaped helmet that fit his size. His speed was frighteningly fast.</p><br/><p>Although this was actually a process that required more effort, he couldn\u2019t help it right now. Fortunately, the skills he had piled up weren\u2019t for nothing and there were no big flaws. Liera checked the time for him.</p><br/><p>\u201c5 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The core materials for the helmet would be the two eyes. The body part that possessed the most magic power and resistance after the heart. This too, would have been refined slowly and with more effort if he had the time, but not now. He\u2019ll just solve it all with mana crafting!</p><br/><p>\u201cHhp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan struck down on Echjar\u2019s eyes with the hammer covered in 5th class magic stones and immediately started mana crafting; to make it smaller and harder; to process it into the right direction that Yu IlHan wanted!</p><br/><p>[Hell Seeker\u2019s Demon Eye was completed.]</p><br/><p>The completed product were two thin panels that were tens of times smaller than the original. At least on the outside, it went as Yu IlHan had intended to. Considering that this had an independent name like the Destruction mirrors of the Hundred Eyes, its functionality should be splendid as well. However, Yu IlHan was unsure of that name.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know if I succeeded or not with such a name.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c8 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no time for groans either. Yu IlHan placed the two eyes that became the right size for the helmet, onto the frame and struck down with his hammer again. Eternal Flame softly wrapped itself around the helmet.</p><br/><p>He was a little unsure about the end product since the work process was rushed, but the next moment, he could rest easy after the helmet and the eyes became one and gave off immense light. That was a light that he could only see when everything went as he wished to.</p><br/><p>[Dragoneye of the Avenger was completed.]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Chaos]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 18,600]</p><br/><p>[Durability 1,104,000/1,104,000]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 Magic 800]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Reflects all status ailments at a 50% rate. However, the probability halves every league difference the enemy is higher than the user.</p><br/><p>2. 150% increase in all status ailment resistance.</p><br/><p>3. 50% increase in all magic resistance]</p><br/><p>The moment the information appeared on his two eyes, he was relieved. At least he had no confidence in making a better helmet than this for quite a while. Meaning, this was a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>He liked that the functions he wanted were all attached at a decent rate. The defense was also nothing to scoff at since he had made this from the scale of a 7th class dragon, and with magic resistance increase on top of status ailment resistance increase, it could be said that his resistance to charm magic had increased by 200%! Curse resistance and cures immunity wouldn\u2019t just play around either, so he was really confident now.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately put on the sharp helmet that had two dragon eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou girls will probably say I\u2019m cool even if I dance around naked\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you are really cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wearing the helmet that imitated a dragon\u2019s head, it went well with the Infernal dragon body that also imitated the scaly body of a dragon. The aesthetics also was not bad with the black shadow around the gauntlet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cool. You\u2019re almost like a demon lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s that side\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just one, rather than a hero of justice, he was closer to the pivot of evil. Well, it was fine since no one would be able to find Yu IlHan anyway once the battle started.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pulled down the visor on the helmet to cover his eyes. The part where Echjar\u2019s two eyes were attached to was there\u2026\u2026or not! It was a feint and was actually an eye blind. In fact, just wearing the helmet would activate all the options. It was truly a Yu IlHan-like trick.</p><br/><p>Anyway, with this, all the preparations he could do were done.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. If I still get cursed, you can start calling me the Cursed King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds cool for some reason! If you get seduced by that succubus, I\u2019m going to call you fluffylegs. Oh, ten minutes are up.\u201d (T/N: I have NO idea what that\u2019s supposed to mean googling didn\u2019t get me anything)</p><br/><p>The moment a new reason he could not be seduced was added, Yu IlHan checked Erta\u2019s status and location and activated the formation.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the seal from the magic formation was undone and the succubus entered Dareu, while Erta lost her qualifications as an angel and was put through the process of an arch-magic that made her into a member of the Garden of Sunset, just as the Heaven\u2019s Army realized that Erta was doing something strange, the Army of Brilliant Light realized that the Destruction Demon Army had sent two 7th classes to Dareu.</p><br/><p>This was the rise of the curtain to a period of chaos and calamity.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Start of book 11! Chaos and destruction right from the start.</p><br/><p>At first, I thought about how to explain the charm \u2013 as a curse or pure magic, but I decided to go with that it has properties of both.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>110 left\u2026?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

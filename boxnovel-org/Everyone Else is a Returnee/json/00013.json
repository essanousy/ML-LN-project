He, who ran after changing his direction for a bit after passing the train station, was even faster than a 60km/h car.</p><br/><p>[Hm, this is quite fun. I\u2019ll hold tight so don\u2019t you have any thoughts in somersaulting in mid air?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I a roller coaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite running with a lot of booming noises, whether it was the cars or the motorbikes or the pedestrians on the street, nobody gave a glance towards Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>As he was already used to it, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t pay it any mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople are decreasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The police are blocking them.]</p><br/><p>The scene became more and more unordinary as he went uphill on Jeongneung street. Empty roads instead of crowded streets, with police cars and military vehicles replacing the people. Soldiers were walkie-talkie messaging somewhere and the civillians were running down the hill.</p><br/><p>Looking at the people running down while crying and carrying 007 bags, heavy bags, or etc., this appeared no different from a disaster scene with refugees.</p><br/><p>They would probably think that reality is unfair \u2013 they had lived in other worlds for 10 years to adapt to situations like this, but as soon as they returned, monsters they can\u2019t fight were breaking their houses.</p><br/><p>On Earth after the Great Cataclysm, there were no more tutorials. The trial that made people realize that was too cruel. It was to the point that Yu IlHan, who was moving due to the reward promised by the angel, could feel the sorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the government really compensate for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The morale of the populace becomes the morale of the country, and the morale of the country becomes the power and and unity of the country. If the leaders know that then they wouldn\u2019t do nothing.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pushed one gear up inside his heart. Whether the government compensated or not, the thing he had to do didn\u2019t change. That was destroying monsters as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>While he was in the middle of running, there was a bang, like the sound of something exploding. Did the military use a rocket or something!? Yu IlHan thought idiotic things like that but the fact was that they didn\u2019t. It was just that a 7m tall brown bear had smashed into a 2-storey building, the sound resulting from its collapse.</p><br/><p>[HuuooOOooooo!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan realized that he had arrived at the scene of destruction.</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot, shoot more!\u201d</p><br/><p>A commissioned officer wearing a cool uniform was shouting, and the sounds of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers which were emitting fire came from all directions. However, they were too weak to penetrate the skin of the bear that was as big as a two storey building.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! It\u2019s not working! It\u2019s only the 4th day after the Great Cataclysm, but what can we do if these fuckers start appearing already!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBite on a knife and charge or something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbility users, aren\u2019t ability users here yet! What about the one who expressed cooperation with the government?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bear is changing directions! \u2026\u2026Fuck, scatter!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no other chaos that was like this. When the bear crashed into something, it would collapse, whether it was vehicles, signposts, or buildings. Like that, a whole street had become a mess and buildings were collapsing in real time. Erta clicked her tongue while looking at that scene.</p><br/><p>[To think that they break from a monster that just earned its 2nd class, human architecture is really fragile.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no materials, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people were already used to worlds with monsters. However, what did that do? They were lacking in everything whether it was architecture, materials, money, techniques, and even levels, and they only had the knowledge and experience.</p><br/><p>If it was another world, then it may have been near impossible for a monster at that level to create chaos, but currently, it was the strongest. If there was no tiger, then one would greet a rabbit as one\u2019s master \u2013 this proverb really fit in this situation.</p><br/><p>The bear was a disaster that had descended on the modern world. Yu IlHan decided to name that state as the \u2018Fuck, nobdy can stop me\u2019 state for convenience\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing, not killing it immediately? You aren\u2019t scared right? If it\u2019s you you can kill 2nd class monsters without pro\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cTiming.\u201d</p><br/><p>He cut Erta\u2019s urging and retorted as if he was scolding her while taking out his spear and holding it. He could feel the strength of the record that was allowed to him, and the power of the Blurred Lancer that enhanced his physical body as it held the spear.</p><br/><p>Ten percent increase in attack power due to concealment, 10% increase in attack power due to using a spear. Someone might say it\u2019s only 20%, but to Yu IlHan, who trained his martial arts so that he could bring out the most of his physical strength, it was a big difference.</p><br/><p>He felt good. He felt that he might achieve anything like this.</p><br/><p>He had experienced a lot of things, so Yu IlHan knew how great his concealment ability was. He felt enormously insulted that his ability was an innate ability and one that he didn\u2019t even train in, but that didn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t use it.</p><br/><p>The max level concealment that was activated as a passive. The concealment that gave him the strongest opportunity of a preemptive strike. The concealment which contained the essence of the insulting title of Pancosmic Loner.</p><br/><p>Now came a time where he could use it.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kicked off the ground, and met the huge face of the brown bear, which had been exposed when it had raised its arms just now.</p><br/><p>[Ku-oh?]</p><br/><p>Unless Yu IlHan attacked \u2018first\u2019, the bear wouldn\u2019t recognize Yu IlHan. While the bear tilted its head in confusion due to having noticed something, Yu IlHan stabbed the spear in its wide open mouth.</p><br/><p>[KUuuuuAaaaaAAaaa!]</p><br/><p>The brown bear screamed for the first time after appearing in the human world. Was it only that? A huge hole appeared on its tongue and at least several tens of litres of blood was plopping onto the ground.</p><br/><p>One of the soldiers, who couldn\u2019t avoid the blood, was soaked as he was ran over by the blood. He flailed his arms before being rescued by Yu IlHan, who landed a bit late. And with that, finally, the soldiers recognized the existence of Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cM*n *n Bl*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSungdaein Bolt\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>To think that there was a new nickname because one wasn\u2019t enough! However, he had no time to get angry at those soldeirs. Unlike the monsters he confronted until now, it was impossible to kill that bear in one shot, and the creature in question was running towards him after becoming angry from allowing a critical hit to land.</p><br/><p>Blood flowed like a river from its mouth.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shouted shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun for your lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bear will be killed by our 96Tiger plato\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen stay if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kicked off the ground again. Immediately after, the bear\u2019s thick front paw smashed in to the exact same place and the concrete collasped with a booming sound. When Yu IlHan, who was in mid-air, checked the status of the ground, the 96Tiger platoon was truly courageously running away.</p><br/><p>[Kuo-,KuhwaAaaOooooo!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The front paw of the bear which smashed into the ground was raised like a manekineko that may appear in a Japanese souvenir shop. When it was about to strike Yu IlHan again, he somersaulted backwards and flew down head first, sticking the spear into its front paw.</p><br/><p>[Kahacuuuuu!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHo!\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition to Yu IlHan\u2019s strength, on top the direction of the paw itself, the spear momentarily pierced deep into the front paw.</p><br/><p>A violent shock passed through Yu IlHan\u2019s body due to rebound, but he instead used that to pull the spear out of its front paw and jump in to the air just like that.</p><br/><p>The enormous amount of blood from its front paw scattered in the air to make a rainbow, and Yu IlHan was even higher up in the air, his figure was like a dolphin swimming in the skies.</p><br/><p>His grand and fantastic movements, which made one wonder if it was really the movements of a human, made the soldiers who were fighting against the bear dumbfoundedly look in his direction.</p><br/><p>[Woohoo! It\u2019s really fun as expected!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t enjoy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bear, which had a refreshing hole pierced into both its tongue and front paw, couldn\u2019t win against the pain and was intimidated. However, Yu IlHan, who jumped high due to the rebound, didn\u2019t have any thoughts to let it eat some aspirin. (T/N: Raws literally said \u2018apply some Fucidin)</p><br/><p>The brown bear destroyed buildings as it swung its front paw wildly while roaring. However, due to the extreme pain, it seemed like it had forgotten about Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>It would have been alright even if the passive concealment didn\u2019t activate, but this was within his expectations. He was just thankful for it.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan corrected his spear hold when he stopped in the sky.</p><br/><p>The spear of steel created by a human who surpassed the peak of technique was holding out well even while clashing with a mid-class monster\u2019s leather, muscles, and bones. Yu IlHan believed in his spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018It should be able to hold out at this level, right?\u2019</p><br/><p>While muttering with a bit of confidence, he held the spear tight with both of this hands, and aimed at the head of the bear which was thrashing around violently.</p><br/><p>There was no way a human without wings could fly \u2013 his body started dropping.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yu IlHan focused all his body weight into the spear. His body figure was similar to before he was left out, but his muscles, which were condensed and compressed, carried considerable weight.</p><br/><p>[KuuuoooOhhooo! Ah-SU-KREEEEEEEEM!]</p><br/><p>The bear howled in pain and was thrashing around. However, despite the fact that the bear may go out of his range if he was a bit late, Yu IlHan was calm. It was because he could just attack when he was on the ground as his concealment would remain active.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s dangerous to get hit by the attack. You know that, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I won\u2019t get done in by a thing like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>What weak-talk was she saying when she was the one to believe his ability? Yu IlHan kicked Erta\u2019s words and tensed his body.</p><br/><p>I can do it! Let\u2019s remember the first time I succeeded in striking Rita succesfully! \u2013 he thought,</p><br/><p>\u2018With all my strength\u2026\u2026Nooooooow!\u201d</p><br/><p>He extended his spear outwards.</p><br/><p>The spear which contained all of Yu IlHan\u2019s strength and weight struck deep into the brown bear\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[Ka!]</p><br/><p>The bear screamed a single syllable. And didn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone at that place recited revival spells \u2013 \u2018did it die?\u2019 \u2013 but the bear didn\u2019t come back to life.</p><br/><p>It had really died from to Yu IlHan\u2019s spear strike. (T/N: \u2018reciting revival spells\u2019: You know, when people say \u2018did it die?\u2019 then it never EVER dies\u2026)</p><br/><p>[You have earned 154,928 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 23. 8 Strength, 7 Agiligty, 5 Health, 5 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv54 Brown Big Bear.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned a new title \u2013 \u2018One hit for me, one hit for you\u2019! Critical hit rate increases by 10%.]</p><br/><p>[You have learnt the Critical Hit Skill! It increases the probability of succeeding a fatal strike by cultivating your eyes to see the weak points of enemies.]</p><br/><p>The large body of the brown bear, which had lost the strength to move, started leaning towards the ground. Yu IlHan became urgent and desperately pulled out the spear embedded in its head jumped before landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, with a boom that was similar to the sound of a bomb, the body of the brown bear collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t know you would finish it in just three strikes. You did well when you don\u2019t even have a skill.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell them to prepare the reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Erta praised his achievement while smiling, Yu IlHan retorted while looking over his spear, looking for any damage that might have occurred due to overexertion.</p><br/><p>However, it must really have been a great achievement. Otherwise, there was no way that he could have acquired a new title or skill.</p><br/><p>He was now sure about it. That skill was related a lot to the \u2018record\u2019 just like mana.</p><br/><p>The record that is created from all of Yu IlHan\u2019s movements, achievements, and other things that mixed with each other influenced the creation of skill, growth, and change. Critical Hit was just the beginning. He would probably be able to acquire countless other skills according to the way he acted.</p><br/><p>After he finished inspecting the spear, Yu IlHan raised his head. The moment he was about to leave for other hunting rounds when he finished dismantling the huge bear in an instant \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have arrived. We will take care of the rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the monster!?\u201d</p><br/><p>An offbeat resounded loudly and grandly. (T/N: heroes of justices have come late.)</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Thank you people for donating, I will strive my best to bring out better stories!</p><br/><p>PS \u2013 The Blurred Lancer was strong!!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The bear\u2019s roars(?) were all written in English in the raws. Hence you see capitals in the middle of the onomatopoeia.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

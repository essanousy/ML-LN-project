It\u2019s probably one of the top worlds that have been through the 3rd Great Cataclysm.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Was Liera\u2019s comment as they entered the truly enormous imperial castle. Yu IlHan agreed with her. Although Ferata, just before their 3rd Great Cataclysm, had also possessed 5 4th class people in one empire, Lanpas was in a different league.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, so you feel it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Irma An Ill\u2019ta with pride, as she was the imperial princess of the empire of Palladia.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe forces in our empire is tremendous. We even have three 4th classes, when others would consider themselves lucky if they have one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, is it fine to tell him that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat good is hiding it? If it\u2019s him, he would have felt their presences even without me telling him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree huh. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vaguely answered Yu IlHan to the imperial princess who acted very proud.</p><br/><p>However, what Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t surprised at, was not that. Well, it was no surprise since in regards to militaristic power, even Ferata was better than Palladia.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there are more than one hundred of those who are at the doorstep of 4th class, but have not been able to step through it due to lack of opportunities and records.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. What Yu IlHan was surprised at, was the fact that experts on magic, in a stable empire, numbered overwhelmingly higher compared to that of Ferata\u2019s!</p><br/><p>[If there are few geniuses in Ferata, then there are many talents here.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[However, they will die unless they reach the 4th class. How unfortunate. I think I can sympathize since I too had a time when I was stuck at the doorstep to becoming a higher existence for a long time.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Oh, really? I never felt such a thing.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Hooh, are you picking a fight with me?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Such was the beginning of the 5th Angel War. Despite the battle on top of his head, Yu IlHan leisurely followed the imperial princess and Kang MiRae while guessing how many wars they would have in total.</p><br/><p>Yumir\u2019s eyes were shining in Yu IlHan\u2019s arms, as he looked at the gigantic imperial castle, and Na YuNa walked in a graceful way, unlike her usual self. YuNa walking quietly was beyond beautiful, to the point that he accepted the reason why the god of beauty had bestowed a blessing on her.</p><br/><p>And since that figure nagged on his mind more and more, he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so quiet, its unlike you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhenever I\u2019m at a place I\u2019m unfamiliar with, I need to be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said as if speaking the obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m too pretty so wherever I go, people will aim for me. So I need to stick to a person I can trust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you and your first world problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the truth, so I can\u2019t help it~.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could she spout out such first world problems like that so naturally? Yu IlHan was shocked, but had to accept it after noticing that the maids, mages, and knights alike that they passed by on the hallway had focused their glances on her.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was natural with her since he was too used to the beauty of the angels around him, but in fact, her beauty had enough power to make everyone ignore the first imperial princess that was with her.</p><br/><p>So, the imperial princess became slightly upset.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Hey, you. Cover your face with a mask or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last resort~. It\u2019s fine to expose my face where people don\u2019t come at me like they\u2019re mad. And there\u2019s a splendid knight beside me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only protect myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s loner-ness wouldn\u2019t be shaken with Na YuNa\u2019s beauty alone! This was no exception to the next challenger, the imperial princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yu IlHan. I\u2019ll prepare a banquet tonight, so rest easily for today, and let\u2019s go there tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go there immediately if you tell me the location.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, the imperial family has prepared a welcome fea-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish before that. I\u2019ll go by myself so tell me the location.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Fuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess let out a laugh after feeling Yu IlHan\u2019s firm will.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she had met with a lot of strange people in her life until now. Interestingly, all of those with exceptional abilities had a weird point about them. She thought to herself that Yu IlHan was one of those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s delay the banquet until after. And since we can\u2019t send you alone\u2026.. can you wait 20 minutes for us to get prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the imperial princess left to prepare, Yu IlHan, Na YuNa, and Yumir waited in the room where Kang MiRae stayed in the imperial castle. Although he couldn\u2019t imagine what Kang MiRae did in order to acquire a room inside the castle, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere might be a battle in the ruins. There were a lot of such devices during the magic kingdom era.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I did suspect things to be like that, it really is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like an RPG!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think so leisurely after confronting those trap. Testing the door openers or whatever they say \u2013 aren\u2019t they all meaningless if the entrants die\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seems like Kang MiRae had a history with ruins. Yu IlHan stroked Yumir who was nibbling on a cookie in his arms, before thinking of something and took out a bag of cookies from his inventory to hand over to Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a battle occurs, eat one, and just one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this cookie made by you? And what do you mean in battle\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae accepted the cookie while tilting her head, and turned stiff after checking the information on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan. This is\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably guessed it, but it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who received the bag of cookies from Kang MiRae also stiffened very soon. However, she exclaimed soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this looks very expensive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale. To anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae, who guessed the meaning behind those words, took the bag of cookies back from Na YuNa and put it inside her chest pocket. When Na YuNa nagged about wanting to eat one, Kang MiRae gave her a smack instead of a cookie.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the imperial princess, who was riddled with all sorts of earrings, rings, tiara, and bracelets, and looked like she was preparing for a ritual, appeared. She shouted courageously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought there was a restriction on the number of accessories you can equip?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a subclass that allows me to increase the number of equippable artifacts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that was a meaningless subclass for anyone other than a princess of a huge empire!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan knew of the infinite potential of subclasses as he himself had the Angel\u2019s Partner, and Dragon Rider subclass, but he could only admit defeat in front of the princess\u2019s subclass. He also wanted that class.</p><br/><p>[You do know that just because you want to get one doesn\u2019t mean you will, right? Like how you acquired the Angel\u2019s Partner and Dragon Rider are special cases.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. So, first, let me try making accessory-type artifacts for the next few months.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yup, you aren\u2019t listening at all.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was deciding in his heart, what subclass to earn for his next class, the imperial princess\u2019s words came to a climax.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve prepared an airship so let\u2019s go immediately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Miss MiRae. Is this empire really wealthy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae immediately nodded and explained further.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought all worlds were like this, but it looks like they aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to get on the airship!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, hurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The airship prepared in the flight zone in one corner of the imperial castle, wasn\u2019t as big as he had expected, but it had a tremendously sturdy and beautiful outer appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. You\u2019ve mana crafted the magic stone itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan exclaimed while checking the various artifacts installed according to their roles in various parts of the airship. When mana crafting on a magic stone, it had a higher probability of transferring the power contained in the magic stone, and it also enabled the magic stone to emit mana more stably.</p><br/><p>If there was a drawback, it was that there was an extremely high possibility of the functions of the completed artifact being restricted, and the conclusion was that more magic stones had to be wasted in making an artifact that had the same function! Yu IlHan felt deplored after seeing many 4th class magic stones embedded in various places throughout the airship.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, IlHan is in a silent rage!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[The soul of a meister is crying\u2026..] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess acted proud without knowing what he was thinking. Yu IlHan decided to not speak about how he could make a better item than this with just two 4th class magic stones, as he seated himself.</p><br/><p>However, unlike Yu IlHan, Yumir was very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, are we going to fly in the skies with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Although, it\u2019s much slower than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she wanted to retort, she couldn\u2019t say anything since she saw Yu IlHan using Ruin Calling to fly just 3 days ago. Irma An Ill\u2019ta activated the airship after feeling a little down.</p><br/><p>The magic engine activated to levitate the airship, and immediately after that, another engine activated to push the airship forward. The speed gradually increased over time, but the inside of the airship was quiet and comfortable as if they were on the ground. Only, the pilot was busy activating and controlling many artifacts at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the airship completely took off, the imperial princess looked back at the group with shiny eyes.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae kept quiet as she had experience riding in these before, and Yu IlHan did think that it was quite unexpected since it was more comfortable and wider than an aeroplane, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Yumir was looking at the outside scenery in joy, and only Na YuNa replied with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot worse than an aeroplane!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWut!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t compare it to the first class seats!\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere became cold in an instant. The imperial princess stared at Na YuNa, but the person in question only nonchalantly smiled. Yu IlHan decided to play with the kind and cute Yumir rather than meeting eyes with those idiots.</p><br/><p>The airship arrived at the destination in exactly one hour. It was a location in the middle of a huge stone mountain, completely outside the city, and from the fact that there were traces of big explosions nearby, it seemed like they had used magic in the excavation process.</p><br/><p>A truly humongous and grand monument was rolling on the ground, and nearby was the entrance to the ruins. He thought that that monument may have been blocking the entrance to the ruins.</p><br/><p>In any case, the entrance to the ruins had opened. A path entirely made of pure, white metal, could be seen connecting to the central regions of the stone mountain. Although it was unknown how deep it was, it was incalculable to the eyes from the outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Some of you come here and guard the airship.\u201d</p><br/><p>The knights and mages protecting the entrance to the ruins immediately ran over after noticing that the airship had landed. The imperial princess naturally gave them orders, and guided the group to the ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to enter here. We had a hard time cleaning out that monument.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like Yu IlHan\u2019s predictions were on the mark. It was amazing how there were traces of burns and craters all around the monument, but the monument itself had no scratches at all.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan approached it. There were incomprehensible archaic characters everywhere and after reading them for a moment, he asked the princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you not think that there was another way to open the ruins?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did try, but there was no other method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you used such a stupid method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid!? Even I don\u2019t want to use magic against such a sturdy stone! I brought 2 4th class mages to do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was talking about how stupid it was to remove the monument with raw strength, but it seems like the princess had misunderstood.</p><br/><p>\u2018This person has both a sharp side and a stupid side. I don\u2019t want to get caught up with her in the future, if possible.\u2019 \u2013 thought he, as expected of a loner, while extending his hand to the monument.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to the monument?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to open the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? But I\u2019ve already opened the\u2026\u2026 so that\u2019s it. I did not actually open it, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess had understood correctly this time. Yu IlHan made the group back off with a wave of his hand without much words. An incomprehensible language to anyone in that place, came out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201c(Welcome to this place, O, strange one.)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s reading the archaic text on the monument!? How can a person from Earth like Mr. Yu IlHan read the archaic language of this world\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>He ignored the reactions of everyone present as he read on. The more he read, the more light the monument started emitting, and accordingly, mana started boiling within the ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201c(The devotion of the juniors willing to continue and research the meaning of magic engineering\u2026\u2026)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, the ruins are reacting! I knew it was right to have brought him here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Mr. IlHan was already amazing, never did I know that he had the ability read archaic languages\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was now reading the last sentence on the monument.</p><br/><p>\u201c(I leave behind here, the essence of magic engineering that I\u2019ve dedicated my life to researching. I wish for the junior to see the ends of magic engineering, which I was not able to catch even the slightest glimpse of, due to the lack of my ability.)\u201d</p><br/><p>The monument glowed in blue. Following that, the path made of white metal, started trembling and the light intensified. The high-level mana crafting technique had leapt beyond time and started breathing again!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan explained to MiRae and company.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it wasn\u2019t activated properly since it has been such a long time since the ruins were made, but it looks like reading the text on the monument was a trigger to activate all the magic engines again. It did take a little of my mana in the process\u2026\u2026. in any case, the ruins will be active now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo now we can acquire everything inside the ruins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted the imperial princess in emotion. However, immediately after that, an explosion with a \u2018boom!\u201d could be heard at the summit of the stone mountain.</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that the ruins hadn\u2019t collapsed, but the explosions did not stop there and gave a bad feeling to all those present.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it \u2018was\u2019 like that originally, but the situation is slightly different now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When everyone\u2019s gazes were on the summit of the mountain, Yu IlHan refuted her comment. However, as the group was being shocked while seeing a gigantic\u2026 \u2018something\u2019 raising its \u2018body\u2019, they didn\u2019t listen to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ill\u2019ta brought two mages here and fired off magic like mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut nothing happened at that time, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, the ruins will act normally \u2018now\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonchalantly replied Yu IlHan as he warmed up his body. He was preparing for battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a little late, now that it\u2019s functioning properly, it\u2019s trying to \u2018exterminate the invaders\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>[To think it will do a timed attack, nice going!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Please be a little more nervous. No matter how you look at it, it\u2019s a colossal monster over level 250!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae took out the bag of cookies from her chest pocket, and threw one in her mouth, and gave one to Na YuNa and Yumir each. Na YuNa became happy from the cookie even in this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan, marry me after defeating that thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Guoooooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>Replied the colossal monster on the mountain instead of Yu IlHan. Na YuNa grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. I have the same opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much! At least reply to me in Korean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd please buff me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao! And I hate myself for buffing him so obediently!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Attack power and defense increases by 30% for 20 minutes. When ambushed, a shield will appear to protect you, and all attacks will have an additional effect from the god of beauty, Leytna\u2019s power.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan expanded his Ruin Calling as soon as he received Na YuNa\u2019s buff full of \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018devotion\u2019. After letting Yumir go, he also took out a magic stuffed cookies, and threw it in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cUiiiik! Who would\u2019ve known that such a monster existed in the magic engineering ruin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, don\u2019t approach it and attack from long range, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the imperial princess gathered the knights and mages that protected the entrance to the ruins with a crying face, Yu IlHan instructed Yumir as he flew into the air with a leap.</p><br/><p>At that place, was \u2018it\u2019. \u2018It\u2019 being, a ludicrously large monster that made him think it would be possible to have a 100m dash on top of its back.</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooooh!]</p><br/><p>The monster that had grown after eating a tremendous amount of mana during the long years of hibernation \u2013 the giant golem; born from the essence of the magic engineering era\u2019s top technology \u2013 let out a deafening roar!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I\u2019m the King of Chosun\u2026. wait, that\u2019s not it (T/N: I\u2019m not sure what part of this chapter this is referring to, nor the reference itself)</p><br/><p>Readers that scroll down as soon as people like Na YuNa shows up\u2026 please be rest assured.

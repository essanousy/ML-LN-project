The wicked plan to connect Earth with another world was over with just two strikes from Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>When that happened, the only one left in that place was just the higher existence, the angel.</p><br/><p>[Why did the dungeon\u2026\u2026Shit, high rank angel!?](Male angel)</p><br/><p>[You are so dead.](Lita)</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was taking care of the humans, Lita was taking care of the angel that helped the humans. This was because although she could not use her powers with humans as the opponents, if it\u2019s an angel, much less a traitor one, she would be able to use everything without holding back.</p><br/><p>[Kuhk!](Male angel)</p><br/><p>[Where do you think you\u2019re going?](Lita)</p><br/><p>The moment the mage\u2019s brain got smushed like tofu, the angel realized that the situation wasn\u2019t good and tried to run away without doing anything, but Lita agilely got close to him and kicked his leg to break it and poked his eyes with her index and middle fingers. Due to the chain of attacks that connected like water, the angel could not even fight back and flew into the air.</p><br/><p>[Kuhuk!]</p><br/><p>[You won\u2019t die peacefully.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Like humans, the difference in abilities between the angels were also all over the place. If Erta, and the male angel that\u2019s getting beaten up by Lita right now, had high magical ability, then Lita was purely a martial faction that was blessed by the god of fighting.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yu IlHan knew that from 990 years ago.</p><br/><p>[Kuhk, Kuhuk! Wai, listen to, Khak!](Male angel)</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t bite your tongue yet! Grab onto your consciousness!](Lita)</p><br/><p>Her master level close combat landed all over the male angel\u2019s body and was coloring the ground with white blood.</p><br/><p>100 combo, 200 combo, 300 combo! Starting from the initial tackle, the male angel\u2019s body did not come down from the air so the air combo bonuses were stacking.</p><br/><p>[He will really die at that rate! We have to at least interrogate him!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Okay, then heal this guy.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Meaning, she would beat him up more after the heal. Erta could only obediently use healing magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yu IlHan was looking at the gate in the middle of the dungeon. It was not activated right now, but if this remained, the it was unknown when another person as disgusting as the this mage would come over.</p><br/><p>He could take care of this in one go since he could do a surprise attack, but the magic power dwelling in his body was at a horrifying level. If he couldn\u2019t do a surprise attack, then he would not have even tried to attack.</p><br/><p>However, if the other world over this gate has someone as strong as the mage just now, and if that person comes over the gate over to Earth. If that person acts before Yu IlHan intercepts\u2026</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it gave him a headache. In a busy world where he had his hands full worrying monsters, why were the other worlders coming over for? If they wanted to kill humans, then they could do it in their own world!</p><br/><p>\u201cErta.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will destroy the gate](Erta)</p><br/><p>The light that came from Erta\u2019s extended hands covered the installed gate. Yu IlHan was watching with his spear gripped tight just in case someone came over, but fortunately nothing like that happened.</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s magic was powerful. The gate seemed to distort slowly and it completely disappeared, leaving behind a magic stone that was the core of the gate, and not a long after, the magic stone too cracked apart due to exhausting all its power. This was the moment the connection with another world was completely severed.</p><br/><p>[No!](Male angel)</p><br/><p>[Yes!](Lita)</p><br/><p>The male angel shrieked after looking at that, but Lita\u2019s fist made him shut up. The combo was just going past 700.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was absentmindedly looking at that scene. Since it was a spectacle that could not be seen with money.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, are you alright?](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta asked in a careful voice. Since he knew what she was worried about, Yu IlHan replied with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he hunt monsters until now? Because he wanted to increase his level? Because he wanted to acquire monster skins and magic stones? No, those were just by products. They could not become the reason why Yu IlHan had to hunt monsters.</p><br/><p>He killed the monsters since they became a threat to mankind, and to himself. If the monsters that appeared at the same time as the Great Cataclysm, did not intend to kill humans, then Yu IlHan would have played around with them, doing tic tac toe or something. Of course, that was if they could notice him in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys will become a threat to me if I leave them behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, he killed. He scouted just in case he made a mistake, and as a result, he killed them as he had confirmed the fact that they were no different from monsters. Of course, he had to acknowledge that he was more enraged due to finding the two dead women.</p><br/><p>[Is it really just that?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t, then what? Should humans be special?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s words were reasonable. The reason they killed was the same, but if he felt different just because those in question were different, then that itself was hypocrisy.</p><br/><p>[No, of course not. However, that\u2019s as if.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta shut her mouth around there. It was because it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant for Yu IlHan to hear.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan felt that he knew what Erta was going to say next so he stared at her for a brief moment, before laughing it over and went into looting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, just who killed him so cleanly? Just the head disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Quite a tremendous defense. Although, you\u2019re something too, since you broke through it.]</p><br/><p>The mage was wearing a luxurious looking robe that was made with black silk, which looked very expensive even at a glance. Thanks to Yu IlHan killing him so cleanly, the robe was intact as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is good, then would the need to make a robe disappear?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I guarantee that you will have to make a robe.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted and grabbed it when a message popped up.</p><br/><p>[Cynical Iron-wall Black Mage\u2019s Jacket]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 3.300]</p><br/><p>[Equip Restrictions \u2013 Magic category 3rd class, 400 Magic or above]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 Mana recovery, 40% increase in magic casting time, activates Magic Fortress by consuming mana when in danger of being hit]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,100/2,200(Auto-recovery)]</p><br/><p>[A jacket made by a top tier crafter using a Dark Yarn acquired from hunting an original monster in a legendary dungeon. A legendary mage called to modern life directly inscribed a protective magic formation.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my Zelnaga. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did Erta foresaw that this would happen? The robe had a monstrous equip restrictions. Of course, it had accordingly monstrous options, but it seemed for sure that Yu IlHan would never wear this robe.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what was that item description? They were definitely a combination of words he knew, but it was incomprehensible like looking into a woman\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>However, there was something that weighed on his mind more than that; it was the text that looked like an upgraded version of Yu IlHan\u2019s own bracelet option.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic fortress\u2026 So what he blabbed on about before his death was this. Was this the damned protective layer that covered him?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, that was more like a constantly active magic protection that\u2019s closer to self defense. It\u2019s different from the option attached to this robe.](Erta)</p><br/><p>His leisurely attitude was all because he had an insurance. However, according to Erta\u2019s words, it seemed the Magic Fortress didn\u2019t activate properly when Yu IlHan attacked him in surprise. Well, that should be why he looked so unjustified in his death.</p><br/><p>Then why? For what reason did the Magic Fortress not activate? If it was the Yu IlHan at the beginning stages of the Great Cataclysm, he might be agonized while thinking about it.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan had already crossed many mountains and rivers. He wouldn\u2019t say \u2018that was close\u2019 and sigh in relief. In the first place, if there was any danger, his intuition would have warned him beforehand.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t once or twice that it happened, so Yu IlHan himself knew it very well.</p><br/><p>[So even a legend rank artifact did not detect you!](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, and I was about to say it! But you saying it makes it more tragic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, it was true that he could kill the mage more easily due to that, but even so, he couldn\u2019t help getting angry. Taking it out on the robe, Yu IlHan stuffed the robe into the Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll also sell this to the Empress. A little later.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Good idea.](Erta)</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan could wear it himself, then doing so would be the best. However, it was declared that he couldn\u2019t wear it due to the equipping restrictions so it should be better for someone who can use it well to wear it.</p><br/><p>Adding to that, if that someone is capable of compensating for this, then it would be even better.</p><br/><p>He searched around for a weapon expectantly just in case, since there was the robe, but there were no such things. Instead, there was a small leather pocket inside the clothes that the mage was wearing, and that, was a pocket with spatial expansion magic cast on it, although, it was much smaller than Yu IlHan\u2019s own Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan became shocked after seeing that flasks with red and blue liquids were coming out in large amounts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought this was the time for gold to come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>[These are things that cannot be bought with gold. They are top class health potion and magic potion. Please be aware that potions cannot be bought in shops no matter which world it is under Heaven.](Erta)</p><br/><p>But what good was that? He had the bloodrink for health, and he couldn\u2019t even use mana, so there was no need for him to recover anything.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pondered on what to do with it, but in the end, he put them inside his Cross Bag; while believing that the time to need it would come.</p><br/><p>He checked the 1st class man\u2019s body just in case but there was absolutely nothing. Clicking his tongue, Yu IlHan stood up.</p><br/><p>Lita was just going past 3000 air combo.</p><br/><p>[It doesn\u2019t seem like Lita\u2019s rage would calm down any time soon. Yu IlHan, what can we do?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can cheer for Lita. Bring some popcorn, Erta.\u201d(T/N: It really does say that)</p><br/><p>Leaving Lita to beat up that angel all she wanted, Yu IlHan did his own thing \u2013 to recover the dead women\u2019s bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, please make these people clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I understand](Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt complicated while seeing that the two women\u2019s bodies became clean due to Erta\u2019s magic. He did want to find their families, but he did not even know where they were kidnapped from. He couldn\u2019t waste time like thatt.</p><br/><p>Recovering the victims\u2019 bodies, Yu IlHan completely burned the mage and the man\u2019s bodies since human bodies did not spit out mana and were useless as crafting materials.</p><br/><p>Around that time, Lita\u2019s punishment had ended. He couldn\u2019t find consciousness no mater how much healing magic he was casted with, so they decided to leave the rest to the other angels.</p><br/><p>[Lita, did you listen to why they cooperated with humans?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[No, I couldn\u2019t since I was beating him up. The others would listen in my place!]</p><br/><p>Lita\u2019s smile looked uselessly refreshing. It seemed that her mood became a little better while beating him up to her heart\u2019s content. Of course, this was nothing new, so both Yu IlHan and Erta had given up and exited the dungeon along with her.</p><br/><p>[Lita, thanks for your work.]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, it\u2019s you again. Isn\u2019t it better for you if you just get into an exclusive contract with Heaven?]</p><br/><p>[He already did. DIdn\u2019t you see that Lita and Erta\u2019s achievements were skyrocketing nowadays?]</p><br/><p>Angels were already waiting in front of the dungeon. He thought that Lita would just pass the traitor angel but she stood on the same side as them while putting the male angel over her shoulders.</p><br/><p>[There is a saying that one revealed traitor means 30 hidden ones. We don\u2019t know when another traitor will try to do something, so I will come back after confirming that this guy gets his head lopped off.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cAre traitors cockroaches!?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an iron-blooded declaration without a hint of carelessness!</p><br/><p>[Traitors are sooo dead now. Look at Lita with her eyes flipped.]</p><br/><p>[They just had to do it on Earth of all worlds\u2026 foolish things.]</p><br/><p>Although he realized the moment she recommended Vale Tudo, it seemed that Lita\u2019s powers were not ordinary. There was no need to rustle the leaves while knowing that there is a snake, so Yu IlHan ignored her even after seeing all that.</p><br/><p>[I will come back at least by tonight. I will come back with a good quest reward so wait for me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy me ice cream on the way back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having a conversation that sounded like a mother and son\u2019s just as the mother was going grocery shopping, Yu IlHan sent Lita off. Since there were too many cases where Yu IlHan got involved with angels, now even the other angels greeted him or were bowing their heads. Quite the astral scene. (T/N: Dunno why \u2018astral\u2019\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I know. We should go hunt quickly.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta, who was now used to the unresting ironman Yu IlHan, spoke as if she had given up. However, Yu IlHan shook his head while laughing bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tapped the Cross Bag twice. The victims\u2019 bodies were inside it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least, let\u2019s bury them somewhere suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.Of course, of course.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Hearing Erta\u2019s low voice, Yu IlHan moved his steps. He did not enjoy alcohol normally, but he felt like drinking today.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>1. Just acquiring a 4th class mage\u2019s record does not make him able to wield mana. Like how he had killed countless other life forms which could use mana. Just that! If he could use it then Heaven will send\u2026\u2026.!</p><br/><p>2. The mage\u2019s preparation was in fact, meticulous. It\u2019s only because Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment, which fooled even legend rank artifacts, was more meticulous.</p><br/><p>3. Slow but sure Erta.</p><br/><p>4. Not going over to another world yet. The danger risk is still to big.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Regular chap #3</p><br/><p>Also, have you read One Man Army?

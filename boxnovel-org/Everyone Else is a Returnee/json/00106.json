I! To her!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Along with the words: \u2018it\u2019s very fortunate that you weren\u2019t banished from Heaven\u2019, I have to tell you the unfortunate news that Lecidna has already died.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>When Erta, who was just as enraged as Lita, replied powerlessly. Liera ended up lowering her spear.</p><br/><p>It was akin to a face of a student that realized that their entrance exam scores could have gotten them into a better college than their school grades by at least two levels.1</p><br/><p>This sense of loss, powerlessness and despair!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the baby dragon walked with his little steps and grabbed her leg just as her boiling rage was wandering without a direction to go.</p><br/><p>Then, with a pure and na\u00efve voice, he spoke what was on his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his head to look at Liera. He was handsome because he was born as a dragon, but perhaps due to the influence of Yu IlHan\u2019s mana, he even resembled him.</p><br/><p>Disregarding others, it was Liera who deeply loved Yu IlHan, so it was a critical hit at that time. Marvelously, Liera\u2019s burning rage and desire for revenge melted down like ice cream under the hot sun.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not noona.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera lowered his head and met his gaze and spoke in a gentle voice.</p><br/><p>[Call me mom from now on.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Lieraaaaa!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[But he\u2019s so cute! On second thought, he only absorbed IlHan\u2019s mana, so I can accept it!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Really, a surprising turn of events. Yu IlHan, who didn\u2019t accept everything that was happening here quite yet, could finally come back to being himself after listening to Liera\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course. He only absorbed my mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tapped his cheeks and came to himself. The dragon who was watching let go of Liera\u2019s legs and imitated Yu IlHan and tapped his own cheeks.</p><br/><p>Was it a child after all? Yu IlHan laughed at that unexpected reaction and waved his hand to call him over. The child, who was at a loss at what to say after hearing what Liera said, ran towards him in joy and stopped in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are my dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words of conviction without the slightest bit of suspicion.</p><br/><p>Yeah, of course. Since it\u2019s true after all. However, it isn\u2019t!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tried his best to calm himself down and spoke after meeting the child\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me carefully. I never thought that I will become your father, nor did I have such a resolve. Conclusively, I have no relations with your mother whatsoever. Understand that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t something to be said to a newborn, but the child nodded seriously as if he understood everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only woke you up with flames and mana. Of course, I will raise you because of the promise with Lecidna, but in compensation, I will even use you in battle. I will even subordinate you with the Rule skill. Isn\u2019t it scary? Did you understand that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blatant words even made Yu IlHan himself feel guilty, but the child smiled na\u00efvely and nodded again.</p><br/><p>Yes, it isn\u2019t so bad to be honest from the get go. \u2013 muttered Yu IlHan in his heart and declared as such:</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, so, I cannot be called your dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are my dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tried his best to endure his urge to smack him, while the child spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragons are like that, dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing strong is everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan sighed while facepalming, the child laughed while doing the same action.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Why are you imitating me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause dad is strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, he was imitating because he thought he might get stronger if he did. Yu IlHan felt stuffy when he heard the truly child-like but at the same time, dragon-like words.</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t you acknowledge it, Yu IlHan? To think they breed using the fusion of mana, it truly is dragon-like. As such, that child is indeed your son. However, that\u2019s from a dragon\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s very far from what you\u2019ve learnt and wished for until now: romance, marriage, and childbirth. I\u2019m just saying that you ended up with a child just looking at the last step.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta, who said that, continued as if she had prepared all her words.</p><br/><p>[As such, you have a child, but it can still be said that you have no wife. You are a born loner and virgin, just with a dragon child!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the worst!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh, please. Call it second worst.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t escape reality anymore. He was caught in a trap the moment he took out the golden egg from Lecidna\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>Lecidna, she was a woman who, from the beginning till the end, caused Yu IlHan several headaches.</p><br/><p>[Call me mom. Mo-m.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s noona\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Liera, stop it. It\u2019s embarrassing.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Was Liera also at an age when she wanted to marry and have a child? Yu IlHan, who was at a loss, thought such idiotic things and watched the scene where a dragon and two angels played around before tapping his cheeks again. Even if he got bruises on his cheek, he had to come to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he acknowledged reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are indeed my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, he had lived for over a thousand years, but according to his register, he was still 20 years old.</p><br/><p>He got a dragon son.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish, I will make you stronger. However, you will suffer a lot so keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything if I can get stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather than a newborn, that line was more fitting for a protagonist in a shounen manga, but Yu IlHan decided to not bother thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must first name you. Will MyungHan be good?\u201d2</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t EVER name him that!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Mandarin.\u201d3</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not even Korean!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Due to Erta\u2019s desperate opposition, the child\u2019s name, in the end, was decided to be, \u2018Mir\u2019, the pure Korean word meaning \u2018dragon\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cYumir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYumir! My name!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Coincidentally his surname is Yu so his name gives off quite a pressure!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Ymir (Yumir) was the name of the ancestor giant in Norse Mythology. Even though this name was purely coincidental, created from a Korean surname and a Korean word!</p><br/><p>\u201cYumir. Yumir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir seemed to be so happy that his dad named him as he hugged Yu IlHan and jumped around.</p><br/><p>Then, he suddenly collapsed on the ground and spoke while hugging Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a bitter smile, Yu IlHan was about to open his inventory, when he thought of something and grabbed Yumir\u2019s jaw to see inside the mouth to check whether he had teeth. Very sharp and sturdy teeth could be seen.</p><br/><p>As expected of a dragon. A born predator.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s eat meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had tons of meat. Moreover, there was also the fire that could control temperature according to his mind, right by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot! It\u2019s delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat a lot, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he grilled the meat with some suitable sauce, Yumir ate deliciously as if having waited for it. At that moment.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ve contracted the baby dragon Yumir due to the power of the Dragon Rider. The passive skill was activated. You cannot activate the active skill as your dragon\u2019s power is still too weak.]</p><br/><p>Although they had already talked about this, the contract was done the moment the Yumir ate meat. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t hide his worry for Yumir\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiya!\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, a contract was a contract. Yu IlHan\u2019s and Yumir\u2019 mana seemed to resound out and softly meet each other as if in resonance, before it spun around and became a solid tie between them.</p><br/><p>A deeper connection between the two was formed than the ones formed with angels. Since the child was too weak as of yet and wasn\u2019t so reliable, but this connection wasn\u2019t bad at all.</p><br/><p>However, that wasn\u2019t the end.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Rule, can activate. Proceed?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt a slightly complex emotion, but as they had already spoken about it, he activated the skill without hesitation. The skill, Rule, was much more simple than the contract, and a strange mark was formed on Yumir\u2019s neck before disappearing.</p><br/><p>[The dragon, Yumir, has become your subordinate. Yumir\u2019s growth accelerates. You may view Yumir\u2019s status.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI put a collar on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tended to be awkward towards Yumir, but whether he knew or didn\u2019t care, or whether he just liked it, Yumir just answered with a smile and munched at the meat while smearing sauce all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just empty my entire inventory.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kid had quite an aura while eating, so Yu IlHan just took out meat in units of 10 kilograms each time.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Flame was making Yu IlHan\u2019s life easier by leaning towards the outside of the furnace, and Yumir, who looked at that scene where it seemed like Yu IlHan was wielding fire like his own body, clapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour stomach is more amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yumir was busy eating, Yu IlHan called out Yumir\u2019s status window on his retina and checked.</p><br/><p>[Yumir]</p><br/><p>[Baby Dragon Lv1]</p><br/><p>[Title \u2013 The one baptized by the flame of eternity(130% increase in fire attribute resistance, absorb a portion of fire attribute attacks), Birth of Chaos(70% increase in all status ailment resistance)]</p><br/><p>[Strength \u2013 48 Agility \u2013 32 Health \u2013 29 Magic \u2013 64]</p><br/><p>[Active skills \u2013 Concealment Lv 1, Middle tier wind magic Lv 1, Superhuman strength Lv 1]</p><br/><p>[Passive skills \u2013 Mana rule Lv 1, Dragonblood regeneration Lv 1, Physical combat mastery Lv 1, Language Lv 1, Resting Lv 1, Critical Hit Lv 1, Extreme poison resistance Lv 1, Higher curse resistance Lv 1]</p><br/><p>\u201cWao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that was talent. \u2013 or so the status window said to him. How could he possess so many useful things from birth!</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, you also had concealment when you were born, no?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cShaddap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. The world was unfair. There was no reply even if one complained to heaven, so one could only do his best to live with all one had.</p><br/><p>And, this kid who was eating meat in units of kilograms, had a super accelerated start line. Not only did he have several skills that Yu IlHan had never heard of, there were some higher ranked skills as well.</p><br/><p>Moreover, those frightening titles! Lecidna\u2019s words were correct. The fire that influenced his birth had a lot of effect in his power.</p><br/><p>Just as he decided on the direction he should raise him in.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Burp*.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he finally full? The child made a small burp and collapsed before sleeping on the spot. Feeling that a calm night had arrived after a storm Yu IlHan felt his energy draining.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ahh, so cute. How can he be so cute?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera, who still hadn\u2019t given up on becoming the child\u2019s stepmother, used magic to lightly wash the sleeping Yumir and embraced him. Then, she looked at Yu IlHan and spoke.</p><br/><p>[We should buy him some clothes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should do that when we go outside. That\u2019s good, we have to buy clothes for the elves too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s heart pounded momentarily while looking at Yumir in Liera\u2019s embrace, but he didn\u2019t understand why it was so until the very end, and vaguely said.</p><br/><p>However, while he was looking inside the inventory to shake that feeling away, he found something he had forgotten about until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the bucket.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Yu IlHan took out was the huge bucket that would take up more than half of the workshop. The bucket that turned dragon\u2019s blood into a high-end alcohol called Breath.</p><br/><p>He finally found it after he had dealt with the elven empire and the other matters.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s that bucket? The magic I feel from it is not normal?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also curious. So it goes like this. At first I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the moment he touched the bucket, the bucket\u2019s information was renewed and appeared on his retina.</p><br/><p>[Dragon\u2019s breath-imbued Giant Bucket]</p><br/><p>[As a result of resonance of almost one thousand hearts of dragons along with the special materials the bucket was made from, the bucket evolved into a similar artifact of the magic organs of dragons.</p><br/><p>All things that enter this bucket will be reborn as a result of strong injection and circulation of mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thunder roared in Yu ILHan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>[IlHan?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The angels, who found his reaction strange, strange checked the information on the bucket and likewise, became speechless.</p><br/><p>[So dragon\u2019s hearts can become like this when they\u2019re gathered up\u2026\u2026 I didn\u2019t know since I never did gather them\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t have the chance to gather them at all\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>It was an extremely difficult thing to give create an artifact with a method other than metalworking. Strictly speaking, even Erta, who contributed to the creation of this artifact had never experienced such things before.</p><br/><p>However, what could he do with this artifact? Although the description was grand, but it was in fact very difficult to find an actual use.</p><br/><p>There was definitely something, but even the two higher existences couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. All they could think of was to get some hot water into it and have a relaxing dip. There would be no better treasure than this for those who learned the way of mana, especially those who trained in magic.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan did. He already knew the answer!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out a 100L plastic bag containing dragon\u2019s blood from his inventory and ripped it apart on top of the bucket. The blood inside poured into the bucket.</p><br/><p>[Kyak, What are you doing!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Oh, through that, we can make an alcoholic drink called Breath. It\u2019s the creation of both Yu IlHan and me\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan denied her. Was he denied the shared work? Erta\u2019s eyes filled with disappointment but that was her misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>That was because, the next moment, Yu IlHan took out dragon meat he was storing and threw them inside the bucket where dragon\u2019s blood was splashing around!</p><br/><p>[Huh?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What are\u2026.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>To the angels who were watching the scene with dumbfounded expressions, Yu IlHan shouted with pride like the moment he successfully hunted the sperm whale in the stormy seas before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something liike Breath. This\u2026\u2026 This is a treasure that will broaden the horizons of monster meat cooking!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thunder that roared in Yu IlHan\u2019s mind, was none other than the enlightenment of a new recipe due to his cooking skill!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>All dragons pursue power. Of course, there are different forms of \u2018power\u2019.</p><br/><p>As explained in this chapter, Yumir (Ymir) is an ancestor giant appearing in Norse Mythology. It\u2019s apparently also the name of a character that appeared in \u2018Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin)\u2019 that was famous for \u2018various reasons\u2019.</p><br/><p>Passive concealment is a power only allowed to a single person, Yu IlHan, across all worlds!! Of course, the concealment skill itself was inherited!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan who grows (as a chef) through enlightenment.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Gosh the chapter is hilarious xD.</p><br/><p>Also, I will interchangeably use \u2018Yumir\u2019 and \u2018Mir\u2019 for the dragon child. Yu Mir looks crap.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yu IlHan confirmed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the connection was there before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That dungeon was once cleaned by an alliance of four clans including us Lightning God. And that was 6 weeks ago.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>[However, when we entered today to clean it again, it was irreversibly worsened. Feyta, the guardian angel of Na YuNa judged that at least 5 weeks had passed after the connections.]</p><br/><p>If the connection happened just after they cleaned it, then the Lightning God clan would of course be annoyed and feel a sense of loss.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan himself was relieved after hearing that, since at least, this didn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t due to Yu IlHan coming back to Earth.</p><br/><p>Objectively thinking about it, even though there were no relationship at all between the two events, he was about to get into a serious depression because of it. Yu IlHan was no god that carried disasters, and it would be nonsensical for the Earth to become noisy just because of his return.</p><br/><p>Since his delusions were over, it was now time for countermeasures. Yu IlHan glanced at the elves that were dismantling dragonkin before asking Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you at the scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We are. With the Front Line Alliance as the start, we contacted the Korean government, the media, and all government personnel we have connections with in foreign countries, but we don\u2019t know when they will arrive\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cFront Line Alliance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s monstrous connections were nothing new, but he did mind about a new word that was mixed in her words. Kang MiRae lowered her voiced and explained.</p><br/><p>[You can think of it as a connection between the 26 clans that traded higher standard weapons with you. Since the growth of these clans can only be faster than the others\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that they\u2019re helping. If you tell me the location, I\u2019ll go there right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.We\u2019ll wait for you.]</p><br/><p>He finished his call and lifted his head. The elves, who just finished dismantling a dragonkin and was classifying them into parts, looked at him to ask what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation has changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Yu IlHan to the elves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you your equipments first. And I\u2019m sorry since you just started, but I think you will have to go into battle first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe waited for those words!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shield warrior Jirl, rejoiced while putting away the dismantling knife. Seeing that the others have similar expressions, Yu IlHan laughed and confirmed with Erta who was making a strange expression on top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny info from Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>[None. By now, Feyta, who\u2019s with Na YuNa, should\u2019ve reported to the higher-ups. Although, there\u2019s nothing they can do even if they know! That\u2019s right. All we can do is to watch you suffer while eating popcorn!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down. You can give us quests and rewards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta was worried that Yu IlHan alone may as well rob the entire storage of Heaven, but it wasn\u2019t that she could stop what was happening now even if she did worry.</p><br/><p>While she was sighing, YU IlHan continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I should tell Liera to look after the house and Mir. I can\u2019t bring a level 1 kid to a place where who-knows-what can come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought you might drop him on the scene saying life is all about practice.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I some kind of lion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, he was informed of the exact location through the messenger. Along with that, he looked at the photo of the scene, and there was a dungeon gate that looked like it would explode at any moment. However what was more overwhelming was the Lightning God Clan that deployed their forces after having cleaned out everything around the gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman activity can be amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, it is amazing.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s here, what\u2019s the prices of those buildings? And there are, let\u2019s see, one, two, three\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think it\u2019s about time that you stop thinking like a peasant!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan confirmed the place and distributed the equipment for the elves to equip, and gave an extra mask to Pat\u00e9 and Phiria as they did not wear helmets.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it off. You will cause a mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two elves who obediently wore their masks without asking why, and another two elves whose faces couldn\u2019t be seen due to their helmets. Good, perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we arrive at the scene, first wait quietly and you just have to do what I do. If I fight, you fight, and if I move, you follow me. No problems here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>One human, an angel on his helmet and the four elves immediately left the workshop and started moving.</p><br/><p>The night of the city was very noisy, and that was very ironic. Currently, there was a potential disaster in Korea, and in fact, not far from this place, but these people were laughing and chatting without a care in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. We\u2019re wearing such a sturdy and heavy armor, but our speed increased instead of decreasing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJirl, shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves were delighted at the performance of the equipments Yu IlHan gave them, but in fact, there were slight differences.</p><br/><p>This was simple, as because their weapons were all legend ranked, but their armor were split into unique and legend ranks. They were amazing as expected of Yu IlHan\u2019s creation, but they couldn\u2019t help but feel unsettled slightly. However, since Jirl boasted about his armor so blatantly, no wonder did it feel so bad.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was listening to the conversation between his subordinates, thought that he should develop more skills in processing leather and cloth and made a bitter smile, when a flash appeared in a direction they were going.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that? Is something happening again? Is it the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were walking on the night roads also whispered to each other after looking at the pillar of light. Some of them looked like their drunkenness disappeared as they urgently called somewhere.</p><br/><p>The pillar of light only appeared for a moment, but Yu IlHan was sure. That, was the lightning that only Kang MiRae could make on Earth.</p><br/><p>The pillar of light that purposely lowered destructive power and increased the luminescence, a signal saying \u2018It\u2019s here!\u2019. Her magic control skills were really no joking matter.</p><br/><p>Although not at the level of Yu IlHan who massacred all dragonkin in Dareu, it seemed that she grew in her own way during these three months. Of course, it was probably also due to the legend ranked staff he gave her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing ability there. Your Majesty, are there many people at that level on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a problem because there aren\u2019t. Let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>They exited the city and rushed straight to where the pillar of light was emitted from. Soon, Yu IlHan could feel several presences of people. Kang MiRae did say she called a lot of people, but it seemed her influence was not something to scoff at.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves were proficient in gathering information through their sight, hearing, or smell as they lived in hiding for so long. Naturally, their levels of sensing presences were almost at the level of Yu IlHan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there aren\u2019t that many skillful people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough there are some that aren\u2019t much different from us\u2026\u2026 Your Majesty is really different from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are arriving soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>They immediately became silent and gathered towards Yu IlHan. It was to receive the effects of his concealment.</p><br/><p>They arrived at the place where the civilians were prohibited from entering. Although this would be meaningless once monsters started pouring out\u2026\u2026. Yu IlHan laughed bitterly and crossed that line with the elves.</p><br/><p>There were many monsters that created dungeons with their own power, but most dungeons occurred from the Traps of Destruction that the angels made. As the angels weren\u2019t idiots, they scattered those Traps of Destruction in places without much human presence, but this time, the dungeon at the center of this incident coincidentally and unluckily happen to be near a city.</p><br/><p>Of course, it must have been very well known that a dungeon was nearby, but whether it was because of money, age, or other unavoidable circumstances, there were a lot of people who couldn\u2019t leave their homes and move to another place.</p><br/><p>However, through this incident, they would have no choice but to leave their homes, since while some military personnel were evacuating civilians, some were also clearing out those houses for good.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we not approach at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar voice. It turned out to be Michael Smithson, the clan master of Metal Knights. A slightly tired female voice answered that question. It was the clan master of the Magic Dragon clan, Takagaki Asuha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe saw a lot of gates that looked like this before, in the Kantou region. I mean, on the day the Dungeon Wave occurred. You get what I mean, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no idiots in that place that did not understand that a Dungeon Break was about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gate may open at any moment, and entering now is no different from suicide. Although we had to escape due to the possibility of losing our lives when we were scouting, there were at least 30 thousand 2nd classes and over 200 3rd classes from what we\u2019ve seen. What we should be aware of is that this is only a small portion. It\u2019s plenty difficult to fight against such numbers, we can\u2019t fight in an environment that will leave them with an advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cool-headed and fluent English. It was definitely Kang MiRae\u2019s voice. At that point, Yu IlHan and the four elves could enter the vast clearing that the clans had cleared out, but no one in that place could notice Yu IlHan\u2019s arrival due to his concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s good for us to fight more safely\u2026\u2026 Isn\u2019t this your counter, miss Kang? You\u2019re quite cold-hearted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re evacuating the civilians even now. Moreover, even if there are civilian casualties, if we lost a member of the Lightning God Clan in this place, then we\u2019d be courting a bigger disaster in the future. I have to be cool-headed as the leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, I have no intentions of allowing any civilian casualties, she added.</p><br/><p>The firm will contained in a cold voice. No matter how stubborn and self-righteous Michael Smithson was, he couldn\u2019t help but have a positive attitude towards her. Yu IlHan could see Kang HaJin stopping him from talking with Kang MiRae any further. Na YuNa was all smiles as always on the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, I really want Susanoo to appear now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Front Line Alliance here were all members that saw Susanoo\u2019s heroism from the side. It was natural that there were voices that looked for Susanoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Honestly, there were quite a lot of incidents before, although none of them were as big as this. However, we couldn\u2019t find his figure anywhere, and that means\u2026.. Either he\u2019s stuck doing something in the other world he went to, or he died, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie? Him? Miss Malatesta. That\u2019s quite funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that you took it as funny. Of course it\u2019s a joke. He isn\u2019t someone to die just because someone killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9, who could now understand human speech thanks to the artifact, whispered to Yu IlHan in a slightly excited voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom their words, it seems like the one called Susanoo is the strongest on Earth. Although he won\u2019t be stronger than you, Your Majesty, but it seems he\u2019s quite good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Your Majesty! You\u2019re respected even among humans!\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves, who underwent strict training during the past few days, all opened their eyes in flattery. It was sad that none of that worked on Yu IlHan, though.</p><br/><p>At that moment, new people arrived on the already packed clearing.</p><br/><p>\u201c129 people of Bump Clan is here. The gate hasn\u2019t opened yet, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c58 people of Caycicle Clan has also arrived. We couldn\u2019t stay still since it\u2019s Korea where Vanguard is situated in.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all at least of 2nd class. The higher levelled ones even looked to be around level 80. The Magia Clan\u2019s clan master did say a lot of things happened on Earth, but from how their levels were so high, it seemed she was right.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll widen the clearing! For the clans that just arrived, please go to where we direct you!\u2026.. YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh yeah. I\u2019ll call my younger uncle now. I just have to clear out that apartment complex and widen the clearing right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just with Kang MiRae and Na YuNa\u2019s decisions, hundreds of billions of won (\u2248hundreds of millions of dollars) were instantly gone. Yu IlHan watched the scene where huge buildings were being destroyed by the ability users and could come to a conclusion that it was a wise decision to sell them weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful not to clash with other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ordering the elves, Yu IlHan took out his phone and messaged Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>[I have arrived.]</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae, who was having a conversation with others seemed to have felt the vibration as she took out her phone to check it. A smile appeared on her lips after checking Yu IlHan\u2019s message.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good, MiRae?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Na YuNa, Kang MiRae tapped on her phone. Yu IlHan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>[You should\u2019ve seen when you came here, but the dungeon will open soon. According to Feyta\u2019s words, the dungeon will not assimilate with Earth instantly and that monsters will come out from the dungeon endlessly. Is there anything else you\u2019re wondering about or anything we can help you with?]</p><br/><p>There is. Yu IlHan smiled lightly and tapped on his phone once more.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll leave the directing to you, and prepare the strongest lightning magic you have. And you can shoot once you feel it\u2019s necessary.]</p><br/><p>[Understood.]</p><br/><p>Although his request may have sounded a little weird, Kang MiRae acknowledged right away before leaving the control of the situation to Kang HaJin and started to prepare her magic. Seeing that the quick witted Na YuNa buffed her from the side, Yu IlHan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeehee. Such simple women.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Can\u2019t you fix that habit of speaking like a villain, sheesh?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>There were some weapons he had made while considering battle on Earth while he had some spare time in Dareu. Special weapons made using dragonkin corpses in which all sorts of magic dwelled! And with Kang MiRae\u2019s support, one of them would see the light today.</p><br/><p>Thinking about what that may cause, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t help but laughing.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t think that he himself was the god of disaster, but if he checked his face on a mirror, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to deny that.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was indeed a god of disaster.</p><br/><p>A god of disaster that ushered disaster not towards humans, but towards monsters!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The previous arc and this arc titles are all parodies\u2026..!

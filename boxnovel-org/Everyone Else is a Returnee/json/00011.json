The people obediently left.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu. It\u2019s fortunate that we meet you again like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could both of the soldiers that he met two times be both women? He was curious but that was that. He could tell what the soldiers wanted to say to him without asking.</p><br/><p>As for the reply the reply, Yu IlHan had already prepared one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve looked for you a lot. Really, why did you leave when a person was about to speak to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t go\u2026 I was packing up right in front of you\u2026- he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, I wouldn\u2019t be treated like this if I wasn\u2019t wearing a military uniform\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m really frustrated. I should just throw all of it away or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond lieutenant. Sungdaein Bolt isn\u2019t listening to your words right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan moved his hand up to hold the spear by the head as he started to dismantle the monster bodies while using it as a knife. It was unbelievably uncomfortable, but he had no choice as the leathers of the wild dogs and the wolves couldn\u2019t be cut without the sharpness of his spear. He could schedule a day to make a knife.</p><br/><p>And for that, too, he needed a personal workspace.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust! Listen when a person\u2019s talking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not listening. I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m not helping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD, do you perhaps have any feelings against the country or the military\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have anything against them. He, too, felt proud when the Korean sports representatives in world-scale competitions achieved good results, and he also believed that there was a value in Korean history and tradition. He never regretted being born Korean.</p><br/><p>It was just that such a sense of belonging to the country cannot direct Yu IlHan\u2019s choices, and his fate. Just that.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was peeling the wild dogs\u2019 skins in a blink of an eye, questioned whether he really needed to take the wild dogs\u2019 bodies when there were a lot of wolf bodies.</p><br/><p>Due to the level differences, the dogs\u2019 leather, teeth, and bones were obviously weaker than that of the wolf\u2019s. Of course, it was frightening that it had higher defensive stats than steel plate armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dog bodies, would you like to buy them? I will dismantle it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Yu IlHan, who changed his attitude as if flipping a hand when a matter came up, even after he said he wouldn\u2019t talk, in front of her, the female second lieutenant was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>However, the moment that Yu IlHan turned his head while saying that it was fine if they didn\u2019t need them, she came to her senses and shouted urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy! We\u2019ll buy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll sell it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible the magic stones too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t sell those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u2026\u2026Tch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan bargained with the second lieutenant while he kept dismantling the dogs. The second lieutenant said that she didn\u2019t have the authority to decide and contacted her superiors, and those superiors who learned well that they needed to use the monster\u2019s bodies in the end to go against the monsters, accepted Yu IlHan\u2019s offer right away.</p><br/><p>However, in truth, monsters were appearing in the whole world and not just Korea. Of course, strong monsters, such as the Direwolf that Yu IlHan killed, didn\u2019t appear, but sightings of those as strong as the [Wandering Dog] were quite frequent, and those were in the range of what the K-2, K3, and grenades from the strong Korean military friends could manage.</p><br/><p>But why did they nod their heads when Yu IlHan said that he will sell the bodies? That was because of the state of the bodies.</p><br/><p>The strong friends from the military shoots guns when they meet monsters. Even soldeirs confident in their physical ability would shoot guns.</p><br/><p>Just those at the level of the Wandering Dog would have unbelievably thick skin, so they needed to use several tens of rifile bullets, and sometimes grenades to kill them with no difficulties. As a result, the state of the corpses would normally be horrible to look at.</p><br/><p>The leather would be damaged to the point of being considered trash, and the bones would shatter. So, although it may be possible to use it for research, it would be impossible to use it on its own.</p><br/><p>In contrast, how was the state of the bodies of the Wandering Dogs that Yu IlHan hunted?</p><br/><p>Even otherworlders would raise up their thumbs as they looked at Yu IlHan, who would insta-kill monsters, with the least amount of damage, and call him the best hunter.</p><br/><p>Even that would be a good deal for them, but if his dismantling skills were also accounted for, then they would become speechless. The scene where the intact corpses separated into leather, bones, and meat as if they were like that from the beginning, was passed to the second lieutenant Han YeoRang\u2019s superiors without problems no matter how bad the quality of her phone camera was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Second lieutenant Han, don\u2019t ever let him go. Drag him here using any means other than violence!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he says that he will never talk with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you have to use a honey trap, drag him here!\u2019</p><br/><p>The strong friend and \u2018beauty\u2019 second lieutenant Han YeoRang, who heard the word \u2018honey trap\u2019 for the first time in a real situation since she was born, was in agony. Did she have to quit the military after beating up her superiors, or did she have to take him to the optometrists to check his eyesight\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..I will try to persuade him.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, her grass root-sized patriotism and the even smaller soldier\u2019s attitude grabbed a hold of her. However, before Han YeoRang ended the call with an amazingly small voice after killing her emotions, Yu IlHan, who finished dismantling the dogs and was about to go into working with the wolves, spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will exchange in cash so please get it ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026So he says, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang wanted to cry. This was the tragedy of the middlewoman.</p><br/><p>On another hand, Yu IlHan finished dismantling while humming.</p><br/><p>Unlike yesterday, when he fought with the insect monsters, he had gained more. It was because it was easier to process animal bones and leather in comparison to insect carapaces.</p><br/><p>Of course, the wolf\u2019s bones weren\u2019t metal so it would be impossible to melt them down, but he could recreate them into defensive equipment and weapons according to the innate structure of the bones, and the leather would become good defensive equipment without a doubt. Not only that, he would be able to create other artifacts using the magic stones.</p><br/><p>However, the more important profit were the magic stones. He didn\u2019t know while he was killing, but the leader, the Direwolf, and the vice-leader, the Big Wolf, both had magic stones.</p><br/><p>Moreover, unlike the soybean sized magic stone from the Big Mantis, the Direwolf\u2019s magic stone was about the size of an almond chocoball.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks quite tasty\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[NEVER! A magic stone isn\u2019t something that a human can intake directly! Do you want to be controlled by the monster\u2019s mana!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who heard Erta\u2019s sharp warning, voiced his horror.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026 Wasn\u2019t this too blatant of a foreshadowing!?</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, a trained loner, ended up predicting the disaster that her words would bring. Some time in the future, humans would turn into monsters by swallowing magic stones in their greed to become stronger faster, and Yu IlHan would fight against them\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could assure himself that this would happen not just once, but many times, as humans are foolish and would repeat the same mistakes.</p><br/><p>He lost all his strength as he already knew that, so Yu IlHan rolled the guiltless magic stones in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic stones are sure pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excluding the boss and the mid-boss magic stones, the trivial magic stones that Yu IlHan harvested numbered about 20. Han YeoRang gulped when she saw that.</p><br/><p>Combining all of those, it would end up equalling an enormous amount of money even in Guundia, the other world that she had gone to. And as it was one of the key materials to make \u2018artifacts\u2019 that everyone wanted, on Earth, its value would multiply by hundreds or thousands of times.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a different story as to who ccould create such artifacts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hmph, what, shall I use a honey trap?\u2019</p><br/><p>While Han YeoRang was thinking idiotic things, Yu IlHan organized the maagic stones and the dismantled wolf bodies. To carry them, he temporarily made a bag using the wolf leather, and he put the leather, bones, and magic stones inside it.</p><br/><p>And when he put all of them inside, what was remaining were the mountains of wolf monster meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this edible?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you have the weak poison resistance skill.]</p><br/><p>At Erta\u2019s cool headed words, he gave up on the wolf meat. However, when he was about to put the bag on his shoulder, Han YeoRang approached him carefully and asked with pitiful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you\u2026 sell some mwagic stwones and some of the grey wolf lweather\u2026..?\u201d (T/N: Ask cutely\u2026?)</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he reject so refreshingly? Was he some stiff general in his past life\u2026? (T/N: Actually, this was a pun in Korean. Raws are literally, \u2018Was he some danhobak farmer in his past life?\u2019 with danhobak being a pun of danho(being determined))</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang, who spoke with a bit of cuteness, had to step back with tears in her eyes when her charm didn\u2019t work on him. She resolved to beat the soldiers up until they were half dead when they went back.</p><br/><p>At that time, the cash arrived. It was a cash delivery service with a lieutenant colonel-level personnel, and a government personnel attached as bonus.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wanted to refund just the bonus, but things didn\u2019t turn out that way. It was said that the Goddess of fortune and the Goddess of misfortune always came in pairs, and it seemed like it was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really amazing! To think that you killed all those monsters with your strength alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonsense starting with those words were completely chewed by Yu IlHan and he just quietly checked the amount of money. (T/N: chewed is a Korean way of saying \u2018ignored\u2019; You can \u2018chew\u2019 someones words means you can ignore someone\u2019s words)</p><br/><p>370 million won in total. (\u2248 320,000USD)</p><br/><p>His hands trembled lightly. Despite the thousand years of training, he couldn\u2019t not be nervous in front of the enormous sum of money in front of him. It was because despite the fact that he had driven big ships and high-class sports cars, he had yet to steal from banks.</p><br/><p>[No matter how good of a condition that the leather and the bones are in, considering that the Wandering Dogs are less than level 20, this is quite generous. It\u2019s highly possible that they want to leave ties with you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s like that, right\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan carried the bag on his shoulders. Yu IlHan, who confirmed that their gazes were fixed on the bag with the wolf leather in it, which was incomparbly more valuable than some wild dog, he relaxed and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exchange is over right? This is my money, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s yours! However before that, why don\u2019t we tal\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably see each other again soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan retorted icily and ran an app after taking out his smartphone. It was an app he downloaded after realizing something yesterday in the campus square.</p><br/><p>The app\u2019s function was very simple. It would flash an enormous amount of light in one moment. After the flash, everyone there, except Yu IlHan himself, closed their eyes for a moment, and opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what was that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here. He disappeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe disappeared in such a short time!? Just how high level is he\u2026\u2026!? Just what kind of vision(?) did he acquire in the other world?\u201d(T/N: the raws literally says vision\u2026 but I don\u2019t know what it is, may be a reference to an anime or smth)</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, Sungdaein Bolt\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, m*n *n bl*ck\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no need to explain. Yu IlHan was still right in front of them. (T/N: LOL)</p><br/><p>Even though the passive concealment wasn\u2019t active during to the fight, if he distracted their gazes, then the concealment would activate again. What Yu IlHan used was the gap in recognition.</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The time it will take for heaven to move due to my report is one day. I\u2019m sorry but during that time, we\u2019ll need to keep moving. Dangerous monsters would have shown themselves in other places as well.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Let\u2019s go after leaving this in a safe place. And I need to check that class thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan left the people who were desperately searching for him and moved his body.</p><br/><p>His long day had only began.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Next chapter, he will get his class! I was trying to shove it in this chapter, but it was too long\u2026</p><br/><p>I should give him a mask full of originality and strip him of the ironman mask\u2026\u2026!</p><br/><p>After Yu IlHan\u2019s busy day finishes, in other words, chapter 3 finishes, I can say that the main novel will start. Please look forward to it!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Disassembly will now be called dismantling\u2026 thx guys.</p><br/><p>\u2018Strong friend\u2019 refers to the military.</p><br/><p>Poor second lieutenant\u2026 lol</p><br/><p>What I love about this author is he gives blatant foreshadows\u2026 and that the MC knows them!</p><br/><p>Weak poison -&gt; poison -&gt; strong poison (the other two will come up later)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

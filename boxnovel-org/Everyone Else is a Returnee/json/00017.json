It was because one mistake would lead to an overall failure.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan perfectly tuned the strength of his arms, which were trained from his many years of practice, and proceeded with the work. As is, he didn\u2019t even consider failure and was giving life to the artifact without a moment of rest.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s figure as he worked with intricate hand movements that were neither overflowing nor insufficient, was truly reverable \u2013 purer than anything and beautiful.</p><br/><p>Rita probably had monopolized this side of Yu IlHan for 1000 years. She alone must have kept watching the figure of this lower existence concentrating in one type of work and in the end, surpass his limits.</p><br/><p>[Aah. I think I can understand it a little bit.]</p><br/><p>Erta understood just a tiny bit, about why Rita, who was treated nobly even amongst higher existences, fell for a lower existence, who had nothing special about him. Just a tiny bit!</p><br/><p>At that moment Yu IlHan put down his tools. The tiny metallic sound returned Erta back to reality as two sentences came up on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina</p><br/><p>[You have awakened Blacksmithing Lv Max.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the title \u2013 \u2018Creator of Myths\u2019. All effectiveness of productive activities increase by 20%.]</p><br/><p>The sentence, which appeared like a declaration that there was no further realm to pursue, like dismantling, and the title which would be a huge help to Yu IlHan in the future.</p><br/><p>Just with these, Yu IlHan thought that picking up the hammer was worthwhile. He had succeeded.</p><br/><p>While carefully placing the Trap of Destruction, he spoke to Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What!? You mean already?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean already?\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s see, five hours have passed though?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan would also lose the flow of time while working, so he could only tell her after looking at the clock.</p><br/><p>After she realized that he wasn\u2019t wrong, Erta reddened her face. This was because that meant that she had watched him working while forgetting the flow of time for 5 hours.</p><br/><p>[Even if it\u2019s 5 hours, it\u2019s way too fast. Did you really complete it according to the blueprint?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like a mother-in-law and check it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>She confirmed. It was perfect. It was to the point that she was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Just who would believe that this was made by a human? She could only be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>However, like Rita, Erta also couldn\u2019t praise other people obediently. (T/N: Tsundere alert.)</p><br/><p>[Khm, I guess this counts as a pass. However, there\u2019s still the mana crafting process with the fecinom and the magic stone.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI was waiting for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Th, that\u2019s true. The angels were going to help with that, weren\u2019t they.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also looked forward to how the artifact, which possessed a high level of magic that he couldn\u2019t understand despite having made it himself, would be completed.</p><br/><p>When he looked at Erta with shiny eyes, she kept coughing awkwardly in order to forget the figure of Yu IlHan working, and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>[Please wait for a moment. I will call my colleagues right away.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about Rita?\u201d</p><br/><p>[She won\u2019t be coming.]</p><br/><p>After Erta cold-heartedly cut apart Yu IlHan\u2019s question, which was full of hope, she did a truly unbelievable action. She had caused a shiny yellow ring to appear above her head!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fluorescent light that only existed when I was young!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s an angel\u2019s ring!]</p><br/><p>After retorting against the tackle that she was expecting, what Erta did was none other than communication. She had sent messages to her colleague angels who were on standby in heaven.</p><br/><p>The angel\u2019s ring was a symbol of an absolute bond that surpassed the constraints of time and space, as well as that of the world. It was an exclusive ability to angels that could transfer one\u2019s own emotions, intentions, and will to one\u2019s colleagues who have the same angel\u2019s ring.</p><br/><p>Soon, four to five people who emitted brilliant light like Erta appeared inside Yu IlHan\u2019s workshop. There were both men and women, but their common points were that they were all handsome men and beautiful women.</p><br/><p>[Erta, is it true?]</p><br/><p>[Check with your own eyes, Fashta. The evidence is here.]</p><br/><p>[To think that a human made a Trap of Destruction, I can\u2019t believe it.]</p><br/><p>[However, this doesn\u2019t smell like it\u2019s from heaven. This is indeed an object created purely with a human\u2019s power on Earth.]</p><br/><p>Erta clapped and called the angels, who were starting to express bits of disbelief, exclamation, fear, and such feelings.</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s not much time! We need to get to work immediately!]</p><br/><p>[That is true.]</p><br/><p>[Yes, that is true.]</p><br/><p>[Will the mana crafting go smoothly? I\u2019m curious.]</p><br/><p>The angels started gathering while chatting as they all placed their hands on Yu IlHan\u2019s shoulders, head, and back respectively.</p><br/><p>At that moment, an enormous pressure fell on to his mentality.</p><br/><p>[Begin, human.]</p><br/><p>[We will lead the direction of the will. You only have to will that you want to finish the Trap of Destruction.]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, this is the same as when you first did mana crafting. If you concentrate with the magic stones and fecinom in one hand, and the Trap of Destruction in the other, we will do the rest.]</p><br/><p>Was this what higher existences are? Despite the fact that only their hands came in contact, their souls, high wills, and the noble mana weighed Yu IlHan, who was only a lowly human, down.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that they had no hostility towards Yu IlHan, just by confronting them, he automatically received damage. A 4-dimensional wall which couldn\u2019t be surpassed existed between them and Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>If he was an ordinary human, he would have lost conscious immediately. He could only endure with the will that didn\u2019t corrode even after living for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only his fighting power and techniques that he polished over those 1000 years. The will to never give up on his life and the belief to continue forward. The steel-like heart that held him up for countless years allowed him able to stand in that place and retain consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly took deep breaths in order to calm himself and stand firmly.</p><br/><p>He held the magic stones and fecinom in his right hand and the Trap of Destruction in his left hand. The angels were chatting as they wanted while looking at that scene. He ignored all of them and quietly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Then he imagined. The scene where all these fused into one.</p><br/><p>He wished. The birth of a dungeon which could imprison all the animals that have evolved after acquiring strength and reason.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Focus.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t show me a scene where you get swept by a human\u2019s will. The name of the angel cries.]</p><br/><p>[Ha, really, just how did such an interesting human appear? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem with the 1000 years\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[I said focus, Ahata.]</p><br/><p>The angels also emitted mana and will at the same time. If their power was directly applied, then they will achieve the same results from when it was made in heaven, so all their power and will were displayed through Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, some thought \u2018Wouldn\u2019t the Trap of Destruction perhaps be finished even without us?\u2019 for a while when they looked at Yu IlHan\u2019s strong will, but after acknowledging that that was throwing away all their pride as higher-existences, they immediately erased that thought from their head.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s will and the will of the angels interconnected with one another, starting to change the Trap of Destruction. The overwhelming mana activated the magic engraved in the Trap of Destruction, and the power of fecinom transferred inside it. The workshop was filled with bright light.</p><br/><p>[More.]</p><br/><p>[Just a little bit more.]</p><br/><p>[O, human\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The mana crafting finished not long after. The fecinom and the magic stones in his right hand had disappeared as if washed away, and replacing that, the Trap of Destruction started to emit a faint red light that possessed an unordinary aura.</p><br/><p>It was the birth of a truly perfect artifact.</p><br/><p>[\u2018Meticulous\u2019 \u2018Earthly\u2019 Trap of Destruction was completed.]</p><br/><p>[Mana Crafting has become Level 7. The quality of the finished artifact increases.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also opened his eyes carefully after those lines appeared on his vision.</p><br/><p>As he thought that the weight in his palms disappeared, he saw that the completed Trap of Destruction was floating on his palm. Several tens of metallic rings enveloping the cube inside as they spun was a truly wondrous sight.</p><br/><p>[Even though I was prepared for about 10 failures.]</p><br/><p>[To think that we would succeed immediately\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The angels appeared dumbfounded. Although Yu IlHan also felt proud, as he felt his effort was acknowledged, the limits of his mentality was approaching, so he carefully distanced himself from the angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, get away from me. Your consciousnesses are too much of a burden to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true. We even forgot that you were a lower existence.]</p><br/><p>[Yes. Well done, human. \u2026\u2026No, I think it\u2019s rude to treat you as those other humans.]</p><br/><p>[His name is Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, thank you. I half-disbelieved it, but its a truly exceptional skill. If possible, I even want to watch you while you\u2019re working on the metallurgy process.]</p><br/><p>[We don\u2019t even know whether it will work properly.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of the angels tackled.</p><br/><p>[We need to experiment with it.]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s very reasonable.]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, we shall go together. Perhaps, it will help your mana crafting if you look at the process of the birth of a dungeon.]</p><br/><p>When the work was done, the angels started chatting loudly again, but this time, they talked differently. Factions were split into those who felt uncomfortable that he had such a firm will and ability despite being a lowly human, and those who wanted to acknowledge his ability and desired to raise him.</p><br/><p>Of course, as they were good existences (as opposed to evil) at the core, there was no one who harbored ill intent towards him.</p><br/><p>[My thoughts are the same. Yu IlHan, don\u2019t you want to have a look at the scene where the Trap of Destruction activates?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to talk twice about it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>He always welcomed new information and stimulation. There was no reason why Yu IlHan should reject that proposal.</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was wiping off the sweat on his face with a towel, the angels started confirming that the Trap of Destruction was for real. However, one of the angels, who was exclaming about its aesthetic beauty, suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>[Whoa, this has an alpha option and a beta option!]</p><br/><p>[What?]</p><br/><p>[Meticulous, Earthly\u2026\u2026It\u2019s true.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan perked up his ears while wiping off his sweat. Erta, who noticed that, explained with a sigh.</p><br/><p>[We call the additional attribue which gets attached to the product of blacksmithing and mana crafting, \u2018option\u2019. It appears randomly according to luck, materials, and the ability of the smith. Normally, there are two, alpha and beta, but both appearing in the first creation is unprecendeted. Are you satisfied?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, I know everything.]</p><br/><p>After confirming the Trap of Destruction, Yu IlHan went out with the angels. As he couldn\u2019t fly, two angels grabbed his arms while flying, but honestly, although it looked very uncool, Yu IlHan was joyful just with just the fact that he was flying in the sky.</p><br/><p>The streets were still silent. There were the sounds of monsters howling from somewhere, sounds of soldiers desperately shooting guns, and sounds of flying helicopters. He truly felt that the apocalypse had arrived.</p><br/><p>[Hey, this human isn\u2019t an angel. There is a need to cast invisibility magic on him.]</p><br/><p>[There isn\u2019t. Unless he attacks first, there is no way he would get found by humans.]</p><br/><p>[What? No way\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Yes way.</p><br/><p>[They really can\u2019t recognize him?]</p><br/><p>[As expected, the sole dropout\u2026\u2026!] (T/N: Yu IlHan can mean \u2018sole\u2019/\u2019unique\u2019; the \u2018sole\u2019 used in this line is literally \u2018Yu IlHan\u2019)</p><br/><p>The angels looked at Yu IlHan, who was realizing a miracle with his human body, in shock, and Yu IlHan was annoyed. He resolved that he wouldn\u2019t mix with these angels, who looked at him like a monkey in a zoo, after he finished this quest or whatever it was called.</p><br/><p>The place they had arrived was at the top of a hill.</p><br/><p>In front of Yu IlHan, who looked forward to how the artifact would activate, Erta, who was holding the Trap of Destruction, took a short, deep breath before throwing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Watch, Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>While the Trap of Destruction was falling, the metallic ring which were spinning on the outside suddenly expanded in size.</p><br/><p>The ring which had a diameter of just 20cm increased to 1m, 3m, 8m, and without restraint before it became thin to the point that it couldn\u2019t be seen as it scattered into the air.</p><br/><p>No, was it really \u2018scattered\u2019? While Yu IlHan was in doubt, at that moment, the second and third ring began expanding and scattering in order. While looking at that scene, the angels nodded their heads in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>[So until now it\u2019s going smoothly.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That meant that the phenomenon that happened just now was not a failure. Perhaps, were the metallic rings created with that intention in the first palce?</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was concentrating his consciousness\u2026</p><br/><p>The Earth trembled.</p><br/><p>Monsters started gathering towards the hill.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>MC\u2019s not a pushover\u2026 T^T</p><br/><p>This is in the end, a \u2018quest\u2019. Meaning that MC had the choice to reject. MC does what he wants, he\u2019s not doing it just because he\u2019s told to</p><br/><p>Erta did not threaten him. In the first place, Yu IlHan asked a question first and Erta only answered the truth</p><br/><p>God is definitely not omnipotent nor omniscient. This is one of the most important reasons why this novel can make sense.</p><br/><p>God and angels don\u2019t scam humans. The difficulty of the quest is directly proportional to the rerward, and if even this is doubtful\u2026 then one cannot trust in anything. T^T</p><br/><p>The reason why the reward was not given prior to the quest was because Erta could not judge whether MC will succeed the quest, and if he does, how succesfully, and what would MC need at the end of the quest;; I should add this bit.</p><br/><p>MC did not ask about the reward as he already received a satisfying reward (Eternal Flame) for his previous quest. You can take it that he\u2019s \u2018trusting\u2019 them</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame is a too OP reward. It seems like my descriptions were insufficient. As to how good, it will be revealed as the story goes on so look forward to it!</p><br/><p>The prefix option and the postfix option will be changed to alpha and beta. I took this from mabinogi, and as expected, it\u2019s no good. Teehee!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Some of the angels speak in ancient form, (English equivalent would be thou/thy and the like) but I know none of those things, to hell with that.</p><br/><p>As seen up there, \u2018Yu IlHan\u2019 can mean \u2018solitary\u2019 or \u2018unique\u2019 (just anything that has to do with being alone)(I guess his name was one of the reasons why he was left out). While his father, \u2018Yu YongHan\u2019 can mean \u2018useful\u2019. This will come up later</p><br/><p>tiny spoiler: [\u2026A useful skill.] \u201cDad skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ehem, nobody\u2019s thinking of Totsuka Saika from Oregairu when they read \u2018Trap of Destruction\u2019 right?</p><br/><p>Time to read chapter 65 of EER on Munpia! \u2764</p><br/>\n</div>"}

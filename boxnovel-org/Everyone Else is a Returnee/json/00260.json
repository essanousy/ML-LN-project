I did clean up the monsters in that world though, to be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man, he even hid from his son. I had such a painful time while we were dating too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul spoke in longing. Even though it was not an optimistic situation, she made Yu IlHan nervous as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be fine. That man isn\u2019t one that would die somewhere unknown. He\u2019ll appear like nothing had happened once the seal on Earth is dispelled, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really curious about where you get your confidence from, but\u2026\u2026 okay. Let\u2019s go back to Earth then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s do that. Though, I\u2019m quite amazed that you can just return with me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had heard about the long period of time he had to spend on Earth, she had heard about the things he had experienced as well. However, despite that, she still could not believe the realm Yu IlHan was currently at. Kim YeSeul thought that that was the difference in talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan will open his way to being a higher existence soon, so you\u2026\u2026 um, mother can also join the faction then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great if that were so.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Yu IlHan looked back at Kim YeSeul and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I do not think that there is a need for you to fight as well. Not all strong people have to fight, and I also became this strong while I fought for survival\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, mom can judge that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul gave a smack on his forehead and spoke playfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this mom be left out when her son is suffering? Son, you do your own thing. I\u2019ll just follow you all by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s stubbornness was quite strong \u2013 to the point that Yu IlHan\u2019s own stubbornness could be said to come from her as well. He felt stifled because he couldn\u2019t express all his emotions that he wanted to put across to his mother, but Kim YeSeul even understood those feelings of his as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019ve got a lot of friends now? I want to see them soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re all \u2018friends\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke Liera as if to declare. However, where did Yu IlHan\u2019s quick-wittedness come from? Kim YeSeul immediately realized the things Liera wanted to hide and her eyes glistened.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? So there are more \u2018girls\u2019 that are \u2018still\u2019 \u2018friends\u2019 \u2018for now\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just called me your child though, mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy new child. My son is going to become an amazing man, and amazing people need more people to support him. Let\u2019s go see them. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera became dejected and Kim YeSeul became delusional, while Liera put the three inside his range of his skill and activated Warp. As if they noticed their leaving, the spirits appeared by crossing through space.</p><br/><p>[Our precious friend YeSeul. May you never come to this place again.]</p><br/><p>[May you be happy, may you proceed forward.]</p><br/><p>[The movements of the Garden of Sunset are strange. They are those that can become allies, or enemies. However, they are more dangerous when they\u2019re allies than when they\u2019re enemies. Remember this.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy precious friends, I shall not forget you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul nodded her head deeply to the ones that were with her for eons. The next moment, Yu IlHan\u2019s skill activated and moved the three to Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, he\u2019s back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHaaan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones that were waiting for Yu IlHan to come back reacted all at once. The most surprising was Na Yuna\u2019s, and the moment she noticed Kim YeSeul was with him, she immediately ran into her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I wanted to see you~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so you\u2019re the second?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m the second~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s forehead was filled with cold sweat after hearing Na YuNa\u2019s reply that contained not the slightest bit of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d admit it so openly without considering pride or whatnot. My son is really blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because he is capable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na Yuna\u2019s body emitted a charming fragrance as she smiled flawlessly. It was not a perfume, but was a fragrance from condensed mana. Yu IlHan immediately realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you really did get your 4th class in that short amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, aren\u2019t I good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was currently filled with confidence. With acquiring 4th class, her status and skills would have changed dramatically, so it was not strange that she felt so high. Yu IlHan asked lightly to Na YuNa who was looking straight up to him after leaving Kim YeSeul\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your current level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt shot up after I got 4th class and it\u2019s 279 now~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one with the most contribution after Yu IlHan in this war in Dareu was neither Liera nor Yumir but Na YuNa. She managed the two holy regions in the two fortresses and gave blessings to all the ones in the region \u2013 wide-area buff \u2013 and she was also the only one that was in a party with every one of those members.</p><br/><p>The amount of experience she had earned was naturally the second largest after Yu IlHan, and now that she had acquired 4th class, she was now very close to level 280. She had not only acquire her subclass, but had an 80 level increase as well and the mana in her possession increased drastically, and her already strong holy power was now capable of surprising even higher existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of Earth really aren\u2019t normal. The probability of IlHan and Na YuNa being born within the sme world must be absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease praise me more, unni! More!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now, I\u2019m going to deliver the punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgyaaaaaaaak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was bullied by Liera after exposing her desires. Everyone left the two alone. Liera\u2019s punishment was truly evil in the sense that the ones punished were in for an extreme amount of pain, but the two looked very close on the outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Erta. I have greeted you in another form once before, but right now, I\u2019m a human as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, the third?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Erta properly introduced herself to Kim YeSeul. Unlike the foolish-looking Na YuNa, she acted very composed, but she could not deceive Kim YeSeul. She made a smile while looking at Erta\u2019s thick green eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please take care of me from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Likewise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I think I saw another angel before. Where is she now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s words made the atmosphere freeze for a little. Erta looked at Yu IlHan for a moment, and he nodded his head without hesitation. He could not hide things from his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has died. She had different views from us, and after a fight\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan killed her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s honest reply made Kim YeSeul unable to speak for a little. An otherwise insignificant</p><br/><p>question had given her the worst possible answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may experience this a lot if you are with us. Yu IlHan is not the pure and naive little child you think he once was. I think I should tell you this beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I know that much. He couldn\u2019t have saved all of these people if he lived so kindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul looked at her son. She licked her lips as if to say something, and she ended up nodding her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot return to your current self once you die, son. Please remember that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two ended their conversation here. In the world that was transformed into a mess, they could not live with the thoughts of a 21st century person. Right now, this should be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cG, greetings! I\u2019m master\u2019s loyal servant Ericia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia appeared as soon as the conversation ended. The silver ears on her head was folded politely, and looking at her, Kim YeSeul\u2019s eyes widened once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, I\u2019m not such a great person for all this politeness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m His Majesty\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With Ericia as the beginning, Yu IlHan\u2019s companions and subordinates all nodded towards Kim YeSeul\u2019s head. Kim YeSeul could finally feel that her loner son had actually changed a lot. Of course, what surprised her the most was the Dragon\u2019s Army lead by Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty noona.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my. So many cute little kids\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul knew that these were the last survivors of the children who were born after the Great Cataclysm, also known as newtypes, as she heard from Yu IlHan. So, she couldn\u2019t honestly be happy about this situation.</p><br/><p>How many lives had been lost for them to stand here currently? How much pain and suffering was there? Just imagining it made her heart ache.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here. Let me give you all a hug once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhihi.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t really cry when the children were in front of her were all smiling brightly. She hugged each and every one of the children that neared 8,000 in number, with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is strong and feeling confident. Mir has tried his best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, grandma. I did well, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you did. As expected of my grandson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, she\u2019s the hero\u2019s grandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The children rejoiced when they heard that she had the same blood as him and was embraced by Kim YeSeul. Yu IlHan watched that scene and was relieved on the inside.</p><br/><p>Although they followed Yu IlHan and Yumir, the emotional qualities of the two could not be considered normal. Perhaps Kim YeSeul would be able to fill the void which was left in the children\u2019s hearts. He honestly wished that it would become as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving them to their touching moments, Kang HaJin checked with Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to go find Miss MiRae. You wanted that answer right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry to sound like I\u2019m urging you to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. She\u2019s my friend as well. Though, I do want to make some equipment since I have a lot of materials to use\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan checked the status of the Hourglass of Eternity in his inventory. Although a lot of things happened and felt like three months had passed since he last left the barrier, it hadn\u2019t even been ten days.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have plenty of time to do that in the Hourglass of Eternity. I now know that something disastrous may happen if I slack around, I\u2019m planning to focus on the people now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Thanks. You\u2019re a great person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also thankful. You are the only conscient person in our team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do know that\u2026 Though, the \u2018sole conscience\u2019 does sound pretty sad\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two exchanged bitter smiles. Then, he turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we depart then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to MiRae\u2019s surprised face when we she sees us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan headed to the mansion with big steps, but suddenly stopped midway. Liera, Na Yuna, Kang HaJin, the elves, the wolfkin, as well as the Dragon\u2019s Army and Kim YeSeul all focused their attention on him.</p><br/><p>He spoke.</p><br/><p>Before that, should we have a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Lanpas prospered with the development of magic, which was overwhelming compared to numerous other worlds. And at the center, Palladia, something that could be called landscape-changing was happening.</p><br/><p>[You have achieved a miracle that all beings in the world cannot believe. You have pioneered a new realm of the Akashic Record, and has earned the qualifications to become a mage of the 4th class.]</p><br/><p>[From now, you will pioneer the realm of mystery, unknown to anyone. No one knows what kind of place you will arrive at after you experience countless trials and difficulties. The god of magic bestows a blessing on you. All mana used in magic decreases by half, and once a month, you may recover all your consumed mana.]</p><br/><p>\u201cM, MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress of the empire, Irma An Ill\u2019ta, spoke with a trembling voice. Despite her age nearing thirties, her face was flawless without a wrinkle, and was currently colored in shock, and looked as if she was ten years older.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what did you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint blue gate was floating on one side of the room. The one that made it, Kang MiRae, had glistening eyes as she let out a smile while speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I can go meet Mr. IlHan now.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

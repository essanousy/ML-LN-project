(3)</p><br/><p>The first thing that happened after the battle was over was the rescue process. The people who couldn\u2019t escape to another world in time, the people who were injured during battle, people who were trapped under rubble\u2026\u2026 As the battle was big, the scale of casualties was big as well.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan and the Empress also went into rescue as soon as they got off from the body of the leopard, but the figure of Yu IlHan lifting up rubble weighing several tons easily after he looked feeble for 3 minutes due to the penalty time, was truly overwhelming.</p><br/><p>\u201c2nd class is really different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis mask changed, didn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t that monster\u2019s bone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheeereee! Watch out for the buiiiiillding!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the rescue was about over, the huge leopard corpse also shrunk by about a half. Even though it was dereased by a half, the humans were agonized with the huge corpse in front of them.</p><br/><p>It was because although the distriubution of the spoils of war was also a problem, there was no one, with high enough ability, who could do something about that corpse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment when one of the soldiers pulled out his knife, Yu IlHan, who just finished rescuing a soldier by flipping a Retona, objected and stepped in. Although he was a loner without social skills, he wasn\u2019t an idiot who would make losses with his eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the ratio of the corpse I should get is the highest, though\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was good to fight the monster with one mind, with the spoils of war after the fight, in front of them, human greed will always appear. Moreover, as they had clear proof that they fought with their lives on the line, no one would want to forgo their rewards to another person.</p><br/><p>The problem was that everyone here had put their lives on the line to fight.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked back at the Empress and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the fair ratio?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he couldn\u2019t judge, he had to request another person, but it was difficult to believe another person\u2019s judgement. So, he tried believing in her who left her life with him.</p><br/><p>\u201c60% to you, 20% to me, 20% to the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike at the fight, the Empress replied in a cold voice, and Yu IlHan, who heard those words, exclaimed.</p><br/><p>The world has turned into one where it revolves around MVPs!</p><br/><p>However, one had to say that her calculation was accurate as an entire district would have collapsed, much less the people in it, if not for Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anybody have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked around and asked if they agreed to her words.</p><br/><p>In fact, as they couldn\u2019t reject the two strongest people here, Yu IlHan and the Empress, coming out strong, they also couldn\u2019t tackle the Empress\u2019 words coming from experience when she was the one who fought more monsters than anyone in another world.</p><br/><p>\u201c60%, you say, hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cool-headely judged. There would be a lot of parts on that body which was as big as the Brown Big Bear he fought, even after that leopard\u2019s body had decreased in size.</p><br/><p>Even the leather, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make an armor, but that was the armor. He would be able to make partial armors or gloves, and boots and those kind of things; and as for the bones, there was no need to talk twice about it \u2013 it will become a splendid material.</p><br/><p>And above all.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nimbly jumped and landed on top of the leopard\u2019s head. Then, he shoved his hand, which was wearing a glove, into the wound he made with his concentrated attack to kill it. Then, he protruded the bone blade and efficiently dug up the flesh and muscles while looking for something. As a result.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really here. I kinda expected for there to be one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As it\u2019s one who might have acquired a 3rd class so the quality of the magic stone must be considerable.]</p><br/><p>The thing he took out was the magic stone which emitted a clear blue light. It was not rice grain-sized, nor was it soybean-sized, nor was it almond chocoball sized, and it was as big as a F*r*r* R*ch*r!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a magic stone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, a 2nd class monster\u2019s magic stone\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGulp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked back at the Empress and asked. Her calculations were worth trusting.</p><br/><p>No, in this situation, there was no one other than her to believe in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat looks about 60%.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after the Empress nodded her head, he naturally in-my-pocketed the magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this so you guys take the rest by yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s a magic stone\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the soldiers raised his voice when he shrank back down after receiving the glares from his surroundings. The gazes of the people who thought Yu IlHan\u2019s achievement was amazing, and especially the gazes from those who were rescued by him, were sharp.</p><br/><p>However, as humans were always foolish and and had always repeated their mistakes, there were quite a few people who were possed by greed at the big sized magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to at least calculate the magic stone differently!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also put my life on the line, I damaged it a lot too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur party claims ownership of the magic stone! We can\u2019t accept a distribution like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battlefield where everyone\u2019s will had become one had instantly turned into a mess where greed clashed with each other. How could the situation change so fast! Even Erta, who judged the possibilities of Earthlings highly due to the battle just now, was dumbfounded at this situation.</p><br/><p>[As always, lower existences are no good. I was foolish for thinking that everyone is like you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you praise me like that, I won\u2019t give you anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s fortunate that you know it\u2019s a praise.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled at Erta\u2019s words and took out the magic stone which went inside his pocket once.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you should have done that from the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that you took it out before the situation turned ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just who was \u2018ugly\u2019 in this situation? Yu IlHan had such questions but he didn\u2019t say it out loud. They might be thinking that there was a problem with Yu IlHan taking the magic stone as the reward because they have a magnificent dogma and view of life.</p><br/><p>Changing people\u2019s way of thinking is not easy. Most thought that they were absolutely in the right so no matter how you bring the truth to them, rather than snapping their thoughts, they even treat it as a lie and attack you.</p><br/><p>Of course, this didn\u2019t only apply to them. Yu IlHan may also claim what is wrong as right some time.</p><br/><p>And so, solving a dispute with words is in fact, impossible.</p><br/><p>His mother, who realized that a long time ago, always told Yu IlHan this:</p><br/><p>Why fight with words when you have those splendid fists.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan threw the magic stone with all his strength. The magic stone, which flew past everyone, flew and sunk deep, very deep into the leopard\u2019s head where Yu IlHan took it out in the first place.</p><br/><p>It was a throw that will make a mark in history.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they looked at the unbelievable scene, the humans all became quiet while reminding themselves of Yu IlHan\u2019s ability which overwhelmed the leopard throughout the entire fight, despite loooking slightly hideous at some times.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake whatever you want and give 60% to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan declared in front of those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is even a little bit less than 60%, I will beat you all up so keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lightly swung his spear and pierced the ground. The undamaged concrete floor cracked apart with a loud sound. Some might say it\u2019s a threat, but in truth, it was an action he did to gather attention onto himself fearing that the passive concealment would activate again.</p><br/><p>Silence flowed for a moment, but it didn\u2019t last long. It was because they all knew that they\u2019ll lose even if they fight all together against Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Especially when he had become stronger, much less recover his strength, due to levelling up by monoploizing the leopard\u2019s experience!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Take the magic stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as you want. Shit\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026\u2026were too greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The abiili users who courgeously went up against him all backed off, scared. However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t laugh at them or anything. Instead, he confidently went on top of the leopard\u2019s head, stabbed his spear, and reclaimed the magic stone without much difficulty.</p><br/><p>That action, instead caused the people to shrink back more. It was because they knew that his leisure was not an act, but real.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dismantle my share, then I\u2019ll give you 40%\u2026\u2026 Although I want to give you half, you took all the experience so to make up.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, there was someone who who was living lively inside that frozen mood, and it was none other than the Empress.</p><br/><p>Only she kept her pace regardless of what other people said. Like the time she hunted the monsters inside the campus.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I need the bones, I think it\u2019s better if you give me more of its hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the conversation, which sounded like they were at the butchery, ended, Yu IlHan immediately started dismantling. As the Empress\u2019 share was 20% of the body, which counted as 40% after Yu IlHan took the magic stone, the Empress\u2019s share of 20% was half of the leopard\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>After a calculation that was faster tha lightning, Yu IlHan started wielding his knife. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to call his skills of splendidly stripping its leather and taking out the bones, godly.</p><br/><p>Especially his skills in stripping exactly a half!</p><br/><p>Only 7 minutes and 30 seconds had passed for the huge leopard to be stripped of its leather by exactly a half. Yu IlHan\u2019s dismantling process was both unrestrained and precise so it was quite a spectacle, and the people could only look at it dumbfoundedly</p><br/><p>The process was done.The high quality bones and leather which was piled up on one side was bigger than a person\u2019s height so it was truly a spectacle. The Empress quietly muttered while looking at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should call for a car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of the huge leopard\u2019s corpse. Although she had only took the bones and leather without the poisnous flesh, the amount was absurdly high. Even considering that she had to give 40% of it to Yu IlHan, it was still gery large.</p><br/><p>The Empress took out her phone and called somewhere. While looking at her doing that so naturally, he had already expected it but it seemed like she was from a considerably well-off familiy. Or that she had made quite a fortune by herself at such a young age.</p><br/><p>Regardless of which, Yu IlHan wanted to distance himself from her as he could feel the aura of a social butterfly from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I move your share as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Empress, who seemed to have grown comradery while fighting together, as she showed good intent towards Yu IlHan, and Yu IlHan, who made an AT Field\u2026\u2026A wall on his heart due to being uncomfortable with the Empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was producing an atompshere that he was about to leave naturally, the people panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what about our share!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t steal from others so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan retorted in cold voice. Of course, he knew very well why the people were trying to hold him here.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t strip its hide by our stregth alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we do, it will get all tattered.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boens too. How can we pull those out? Do you want us to cut the flesh apart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to earn the reward and go to the other world quickly\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When one complaint erupted, it spread around like wildfire. Erta muttered with a rotten expression when she saw the people who were becoming of one mind again after the fight.</p><br/><p>[I feel skeptical about my work. Maybe I should go to the countryside and make a farm or something.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do that. While you\u2019re at it, please send Rita in your place too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll try holding on for a while.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who managed to shut Erta up, once again struck the ground with his spear lightly in front of the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you give me 50%, I\u2019ll dismantle it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu IlHan was a loner, he was a loner with spirit.</p><br/><p>To him, who did everything alone until now, there was no way he would be scared of 100 people or even 1000 people gathering up against him, when they won\u2019t be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it 40% for the Empress and 50% for us!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ratio is very strange from the beginning! It\u2019s just peeling work!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cW, wait. If Sungdaein Bolt wasn\u2019t here, we won\u2019t even be able to get any spoils of war. Why are you so upset!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, everyone\u2019s so brainless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, then I won\u2019t. If anyone says no, then that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone was split into 2 factions \u2013 one that supported him, and one that rejected him \u2013 Yu IlHan turned around. In any case, he had enough materials. When he said to give him 50%, that was just to bully them.</p><br/><p>Like the time with the Brown Big Bear, he tied the leopard\u2019s leather into a bag and put the bones inside.</p><br/><p>During that time, a vote was happening between the people, but their opinions never narrowed down into one. Yu IlHan laughed at them and left the place without regret. He really didn\u2019t care about them.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have another thing I want to request you with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026How?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know when a vehicle had arrived and when everything was loaded, while commanding the vehicle with her share of monster byproducts, the Empress was following him.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was slightly touched as this was the first time in his life that he was followed by another person. Then, at his question, the Empress truly accurately looked at his eyes between the mask and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I concentrated without taking my eyes off you, I could find you. It\u2019s truly an amazing concealment skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Yu IlHan, who was getting all fired up to tackle that he didn\u2019t want to learn the concealment, the Empress spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to party with you. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another person who\u2019s worthy to be my partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think like that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s wall around his heart was truly sturdy. However, as if she had already expected such a reaction, the Empress retorted without paying it much heed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike you, I\u2019m also thinking of being active on Earth inthe future. I\u2019m not that weak to go to another world and do easy quests. \u2026\u2026You\u2019re the same right? I think that there will be an opportunity for us to meet again in the future, definitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also thought that. Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t go to another world, but that he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The Empress held out her name card. The name Kang MiRae and the contact address, and there was a name of a company that he had never seen before. He could see that she was trusting Yu IlHan considerably as she gave out her identity even though Yu IlHan didn\u2019t expose anything about himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease contact me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she left. He wanted to give high points to the Empress\u2026\u2026 Kang MiRae that she didn\u2019t bother him so much. Of course, there won\u2019t be a case where he contacts her in the future.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who truly became alone, in other words, got found by no one, shurgged his shoulders and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home. I have a lot to make now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew you would say that.]</p><br/><p>Erta sighed as if she gave up and pulled on Yu IlHan\u2019s hair. She meant for him to go home.</p><br/><p>The Empress, and Yu IlHan all left the place. Without even realizing that Yu IlHan had left, the people were still in dispute, and the leopard\u2019s body, which looked considerably strange as just one half was completely intact, was also left there like that.</p><br/><p>And at one moment.</p><br/><p>The corpse of the leopard twitched a little, but nobody realized that.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>A stereo typical foreshadow ina while.</p><br/><p>AT Field : The wall of a heart that excludes other people.

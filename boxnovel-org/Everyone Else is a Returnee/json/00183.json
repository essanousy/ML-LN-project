Moreover, wouldn\u2019t she be of more help to Yu IlHan, if she came back as a 6th class?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll help even if you become 6th class, it doesn\u2019t help with you here anyway, so don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You could have sent me off nicely! Did you really have to do that?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Grumbled Erta, but it was true that she felt a little more relaxed now thanks to him.</p><br/><p>[Take care while I\u2019m not here. Liera, I\u2019ll be back soon.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Nah, you don\u2019t have to come back. I\u2019ll live happily ever after with IlHan, so all you need to do is prepare the gift.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll come back ASAP after the promotion so don\u2019t even think about it!]</p><br/><p>However, immediately after Erta left the place, Spiera also unfolded her wings while scratching her scarlet hair. Yu IlHan finally noticed that the ring above her head was undulating vibrations and light non-stop.</p><br/><p>[So 2 years were too long after all\u2026\u2026 It looks like they\u2019re short on hands up there. Although I\u2019m sorry when I am in a contract with you, but it looks like I\u2019ll also have to leave.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ended up smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, off you go then. Don\u2019t forget to buy ice-cream on the way back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why every time\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll mobilize all the angels when I first go up there. I really wish we can get rid of the traitors once and for all this time\u2026\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>With Spiera gone as well, the already large mansion felt even bigger. Yu IlHan felt a little sad after realizing that spending two years with them made their presences natural around him. Although, there was still one left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you, Liera?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to be by your side even if I die.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Then perhaps she was quite free? There was no way that was true. The ring above her head was also signalling non stop while flashing.</p><br/><p>Although it was quite easy to forget, Liera was also a full-fledged high angel of 6th class1 . Right now, she had a higher position not just in strength, but in the Heaven\u2019s system of authority and work.</p><br/><p>Even if her main job was to be a guardian angel, there was no way she didn\u2019t have work after leaving for 2 years. Well, that was supposed to be the case\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to answer that?\u201d (Kim YeSeul)</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ei.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Just as when everyone\u2019s gaze was focused on the undulating ring of light, she grabbed it and snapped it in half!</p><br/><p>[There, no more calls now.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really fine!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the same as having turned it off.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem \u2018off\u2019!? You just broke it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera didn\u2019t answer him but got closer to him instead.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what might happen at any time. So I\u2019m going to stay by your side forever. I\u2019m not leaving you. That\u2019s my mission as a guardian angel.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became speechless. It seemed like the incident where they were put in a place where even the Heaven\u2019s Army could not reach, had remained has a light trauma for her.</p><br/><p>At the time, the angels were grumbling about how they couldn\u2019t return, but perhaps Liera was thinking about something else at the time.</p><br/><p>In any case, their relationship had continued for more than a thousand years. Yu IlHan was not confident with his relationships with other people, but he knew that Liera was treating him as special. He was very thankful to her for it.</p><br/><p>[Eheh, I feel sooo better with all the calls gone.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Then do whatever you want. But do receive the calls that come from Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yup! I\u2019ve set it to away mode!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cAway mode!?\u201d</p><br/><p>She laughed it off lightly, but it shouldn\u2019t have been an easy decision for her. Yu IlHan decided to respect her decisions. In fact, he felt better now with her by his side.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan left her hanging on him without pushing her away, when Kim YeSeul, on the other side, had shiny eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.I know what you\u2019re thinking but it isn\u2019t that. We\u2019re like siblings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother does not remember having such a beautiful daughter. Though, I\u2019d love to have her as a daugher in law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said, there are no women who likes your son!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan denied that, but Kim YeSeul didn\u2019t seem to believe it. To her, anyone was a potential daugher-in-law if they were pretty and had the ability, regardless of whether they were higher existences or not!</p><br/><p>Not only her, Kang MiRae and Na YuNa\u2019s eyes on the two were also very wide. Yu IlHan shook his head to deny what they were thinking, but Na YuNa spoke in a small voice while pouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cTraitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps another world other than Earth was running inside Na YuNa\u2019s head. What were they called again\u2026\u2026? \u2013 Yu IlHan thought about such useless things again, and stood up. In the first place, they were the ones who rushed into the mansion saying it was urgent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ve set a target, let\u2019s go work now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo dad is going to destroy formations with us too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, unfortunately, not \u2018with\u2019 you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to divide up the work. It won\u2019t be efficient for all of us to be together in the same place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite having so many allies, Yu IlHan\u2019s thought process was still that of a loner\u2019s. Of course, it was also a reasonable decision, in consideration for efficiency.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I need to be apart from dad again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry since we won\u2019t be apart for forever. We\u2019re going to see each other soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about how they had to separate just after they met, Yumir\u2019s eyes started tearing up. So Yu IlHan patted on the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this works out, we\u2019ll be free for a while too. Let\u2019s endure it for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He failed. Although he thought that everything was fine since Yu IlHan himself was fine in the 2 years in the dungeon, it wasn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>He did not know that other people missed him as much as he did others. Until now, there was no such occasion in the such place.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t like that now. Yu IlHan realized that. It felt quite ticklish, but at the same time, joyful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise. I won\u2019t go anywhere by myself from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was making a promise with Yumir, the eyes of all the others had lighted up as well. Seeing them, he smiled and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, really. I will come back to this mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll believe you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was making a promise with Yumir, Kang MiRae and Na YuNa were communicating with there eyes. That, rather than signals between friends, was more ruthless, akin to those between wanderers in the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we do need a person to support Mr. IlHan, and it will be best if I stay by his side since I\u2019m a mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real need for a mage to destroy magic formations. Rather than that, isn\u2019t a priestess better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll just go-.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d NOT, alone.\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked like these women also had experienced a lot of things other than just those that are explicable by levels and skills. Yu IlHan felt awkward and took a step back, and remembered something he had forgotten about until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat of the elves and the wolfkin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae made a difficult expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were busy there 2 years ago, but they became even busier from a while ago. Unfortunately, it will be hard to request them for help. Rather, it\u2019s at the point that I think we should help them instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s \u2018there\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDareu~~. Where elves are the mainstream race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Added Na YuNa. While Yu IlHan was still not in understanding, Kang MiRae explained in kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 4th Great Cataclysm arrived in Dareu. The elves headed there to protect their kin, and the wolfkin are helping them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan absent mindedly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>However, the moment he fully comprehended her words, he couldn\u2019t help but shout out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe FOURTH Great Cataclysm!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, that\u2019s it. The development speed of the elves were indeed fast, but I never thought that they would be at the point of a Great Cataclysm. Perhaps clearing out all the dragons played a role?]</p><br/><p>The 4th Great Cataclysm was the highest stage a lower world could reach. Going beyond that will be the realm of higher worlds. If the intelligent species were unable to hold out, they would die out, and if they endured, but could not develop themselves any further, then they will forever stay at that stage.</p><br/><p>But to think Dareu had undergone the 4th Great Cataclysm with just around a thousand people there\u2026 Yu IlHan carefully thought that perhaps Dareu was just before the 4th Great Cataclysm when he went there.</p><br/><p>The 4th Great Cataclysm. A lot of 4th classes will be born. Although he didn\u2019t want to think that it will be more hectic than the current Earth, perhaps\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cGod dammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we want to help, we have our hands full here\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in fact, we don\u2019t even need to help them~. All the wolves from Kiroa went over to Dareu. They were levelling up like mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the elves and the wolfkin were his subordinates, he thought that he couldn\u2019t bare to bring them here even after hearing that they were facing off the 4th Great Cataclysm. Like what Kang MiRae had said, he rather wanted to go help them instead\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u2018Four of them. No, six of them including Ericia and Flemir. I armed them with legend rank or better items so it should be fine I guess\u2026\u2026 Pat\u00e9 has an epic that can control undead, so they should be able to limit the amount of casualties.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, the verb \u2018limit\u2019 was a very evil word, as it meant that casualties were factored in. Yu IlHan hated himself a little for thinking like that.</p><br/><p>When he turned his head around after a sigh, since he couldn\u2019t think of any countermeasures, he saw the gate to Dareu in his mansion. Although there were no people around the gate, Yu IlHan had made an artifact that inserted mana into the gate by gathering them up from the mansion, so it was maintained perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorst case scenario, they should just push the monsters out the gate, and the mansion will handle them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably did that a few times already~.\u201d</p><br/><p>[In the monsters\u2019 view, the gate connecting to Earth may as well be their path to hell.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is the identity of this mansion\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shook off his mother\u2019s question, as well as his worry about the elves and the wolfkin. He decided to not mention about how this mansion will become stronger in the future, for the sake of everyone\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>In the end, the person that would go with Yu IlHan, was decided to be Na YuNa. The vicious rock-paper-scissors between her and Kang MiRae which had continued over 30 matches, had ended in her victory with 3 wins, 30 draws, and 2 losses.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won~!! Yes! It\u2019s a date with just the two of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu, wanna try saying that again?]</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, you were with him for 2 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa nonchalantly replied to Liera\u2019s threat, and Kang MiRae bit on her lips without showing Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan was going through an unprecedented peak popularity of his life, but unfortunately, only he wasn\u2019t aware of that fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s decided, then let\u2019s go. Wait, before that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out some things from his inventory and laid them out. Each and every one of these \u2018things\u2019 would cause an uproar in any world!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this? Please introduce me to the dungeon you went to~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI made these during spare time in the dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch treasures\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn spare time\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The table in the living room was topped off with glowing objects everywhere. He distributed them out to the members.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve made more mage equips if I knew you were a mage mom. But since it\u2019s urgent, use this for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>The item Yu IlHan gave her while saying that was an epic ranked staff as well as an epic ranked robe. Kim YeSeul blinked her eyes non stop when she received those.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s urgent, you say\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s epic, but I really don\u2019t like the stats\u2026\u2026 It has an option that enhances magic other than elemental magic, but there are really no offensive magic in non-elemental magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, amazingly, Kim YeSeul was a mage who could not use elemental magic. Although according to her words, it was due to her lack of talent, but in Kang MiRae\u2019s view, as someone who had seen her interfere with space and time, she only found that absurd.</p><br/><p>In any case, the artifacts Yu IlHan had made all found their respective owners. The weapons and armor were all epic, and the accessories were all legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I knew my son was amazing\u2026.. to think it\u2019s this much. With this, perhaps we may actually be able to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul had the most inferior equipment, and had her fighting power increase by two times in an instant. And considering her level and skills, two times was an absurd number. Kang MiRae and Na YuNa were not that much different.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFIVE\u2026\u2026 options?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made amazing equipment even before, but the items in front of the women\u2019s eyes right now were on a completely different level. Of course, that was a part thanks to Yu IlHan\u2019s explosive growth in magic engineering, and a part thanks to the fact that he had made them using the materials from the demons he had got from the \u2018hell\u2019 dungeon.</p><br/><p>Exceptional ability met exceptional materials, so there was no need to talk about the result.</p><br/><p>[And there are craftsmen who can\u2019t even make legends with a magic stone from a higher existence\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cWith these, I think I can even hunt 4th classes alone now\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Miss YuNa, if you get your hands on some holy stones, embed it on that socket, and it will automatically mana craft and add an extra option.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic engineering is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou gave us such amazing equipment, but why is yours the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Kang MiRae while tilting her head. Looking at the accessories on his ears and neck, it seemed like he did indeed make them anew, but his armor looked to be the same as before. However, Yu IlHan sighed as if he had waited for her to say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe armor and aegis also somehow grew to epic rank\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey grow!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really satisfied. I\u2019ve almost mastered magic engineering, so I think I\u2019ll be able to make my dream armor if I get my hands on a magic stone from a higher existence, but I haven\u2019t find suitable ones yet\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone turned silent.</p><br/><p>Just what had happened in the 2 years he was away, they\u2026 did not want to ask.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>This novel writes the psychological growth of an OP loner (half serious)</p><br/><p>In regards to Yu IlHan\u2019s mother, Kim YeSeul, as well as Kang MiRae and Na YuNa\u2019s levels, there are no balance problems at all. I repeat, AT ALL.</p><br/><p>Please remember that even the foreshadow reading meister Yu IlHan cannot know the things he has not seen with his two eyes. You are free to understand novels as you wish, but if you endorse that to the author\u2026 it\u2019s troubling.</p><br/><p>After this, all comments talking about how it\u2019s a she\u2019s a balance breaker or is a complete BS will be deleted. Please understand since I\u2019ve made this decision in consideration for the eyes of many kind readers out there, as well as this author\u2019s mental health!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>LOL I think I read a NUF spoiler post about how broken MC\u2019s mom was.</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s true, there are absolutely no problems at all.</p><br/><p>Ane reading this, I found one superior point of KR novels compared to CN cultivation novels.

The power that only a select few of higher existences have, the power that is only granted to Executor angels of Heaven\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>As her power was already restricted by coming to Earth, unbelieveably, Erta was currently weaker than Yu IlHan. If it wasn\u2019t like that, she should have been able to protect herself from danger.</p><br/><p>[I heard that this doesn\u2019t happen in a place other than Abandoned Worlds\u2026]</p><br/><p>But why did such things occur on a dungeon on Earth? She thought up of countless theories, but unless she does not find a material evidence, they will stay as theories.</p><br/><p>What was more importantt was to break through this crisis! Biting her lips, Erta put more strength into flapping her wings.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t only flying away from Yu IlHan to not disturb him. She was looking for reinforcements. They, who also ended up getting trapped in this dungeon, and untrustworthy ones!</p><br/><p>Until a few moments ago, she couldn\u2019t move around carelessly as she wasn\u2019t sure about it. However, while fighting with the reaper, she could feel a faint signal on her angel\u2019s ring which had lost its communication function. It was none other than Feyta.</p><br/><p>And right now, Feyta was with the man-woman duo. 2 skilled people who have finished their 2nd job advancements.</p><br/><p>[Seeing that they, who even have an escape scroll, cannot leave the dungeon, this place really is in a situation of a pseudo-Abandoned World.]</p><br/><p>And to escape from this situation, there was no other option than to defeat that strange monster, which was the core of this dungeon.</p><br/><p>If that happens, whether the entrance of the dungeon opens, or the Trap of Destruction shows itself, or the dungeon itself self-destructs, or something will change. If they also do not want to die in this dungeon, then they will have to cooperate with Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>That monster with the outer appearance of a deathgod was a mutated 3rd class monster. It was already a miracle that Yu IlHan was fighting it alone, and originally, there was no way two more 2nd class people would turn around the situation.</p><br/><p>However, Erta trusted in the eyes of Feyta. She believed in the girl with an extraordinary holy power, Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>[Moreover.]</p><br/><p>She was also thinking of something else. If that occurrs successfully then Yu ILHan would definitely be able to defeat the reaper!</p><br/><p>[So please endure a little more, Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>Who would have predicted that she would worry about a mere lower existence so much!?</p><br/><p>No one, including herself, did not know the identity of those emotions. however, Erta instinctively realized that that emotion would affect her very much in the future, and didn\u2019t hate that fact that much.</p><br/><p>A difference in league wasn\u2019t that much of a problem for her anymore. (T/N: What was translated as \u2018soul\u2019 before will be changed to \u2018league\u2019)</p><br/><p>So, please, I beg you.</p><br/><p>As one other angel did before, she prayed in the name of God that she followed and flew across the dungeon.</p><br/><p>How much time had passed since she left? Yu IlHan was still fighting against the reaper with much difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Pant* *pant*\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Limit\u2019 was something he had experienced a lot of times. However, right now, it was the worst among those limits. His stamina had depleted, wounds were everywhere on his body, and the curse which penetrated through the wound on his arm was spreading around while numbing the senses of his entire body.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the training that he did over hundreds of years, then he would have collapsed already. Since he already could not feel how his own arms and legs were moving anymore.</p><br/><p>He was just moving while believing in the record that was etched on his body over several hundred years. And that, was a truly painful torment.</p><br/><p>{You don\u2019t fall. You won\u2019t fall.}</p><br/><p>The reaper also was looking at him with disbelief. As it thought to chase after Erta after quickly killing Yu IlHan, it kept pouring out skills, and thanks to that, its mana was depleted, so it could make neither the baptism of spikes nor the storm of wind blades.</p><br/><p>{Why do you not fall?}</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, fucker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Swearing at it, Yu IlHan swung his spear again. As he had done so thousands of timse until now, the spear ripped apart the skin beneath its already ripped hood, and pulled out its blood. The black blood sprayed onto his armor and burned. The armor really did save his life several times.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuk, fuuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trying his best to sort out his breathing, Yu IlHan postured himself straight. He calculated the position of the opponent and held his spear, before charging at it while dodging its sharp attack. His movements seemed no longer like a human, but a ferocious beast.</p><br/><p>In truth, the curse was already affecting his sight. Even now, it was slowly, very slowly blurring his vision.</p><br/><p>The figure of his enemy, the figure of himself holding the spear couldn\u2019t even be seen now. The teeth-clatteringly powerful curse was eating away Yu IlHan\u2019s everything.</p><br/><p>Even so, Yu IlHan swung his spear again. The spear with all of Yu IlHan\u2019s strength just barely avoided the deathgod\u2019s scythe and ripped its wrist. It screamed.</p><br/><p>{Kuaaak! How, how can I not kill you!?}</p><br/><p>Its rage finally breached the limit. It even brought out all the magic that it had saved for hunting the angel. That changed into form of a long, sharp scythe and rose in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>So it really was saving its power. Yu IlHan, who couldn\u2019t wield mana yet, but could sense it, felt dark magic power boiling in his surroundings. He desperately avoided them and laughed a little with a \u2018heh\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mere magic power.\u201d</p><br/><p>It acted as if it could do anything with magic power, but it couldn\u2019t kill Yu IlHan for tens of minutes. Instead, if just counting the number of hits they struck, then Yu IlHan would have overwhelmed it already.</p><br/><p>What good was a good weapon? In the end, everything was decided by the skills of its user. Even right now, Yu IlHan read the movement of those scythe just by instinct and dodged all of them. This was the moment where a large amount of mana it just used evaporated into the air.</p><br/><p>Then he instead saw through its dulled movments due to wielding the scythe to approach it and struck with his spear with his full strength!</p><br/><p>\u201cHup!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit.]</p><br/><p>{Kuwaaaaaaak!}</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s spear pierced its chest. He attacked the same location continuously and finally succeeded in destroying its bones.</p><br/><p>The deathgod stiffened while teetering, and Yu IlHan swung his spear twice again and succeded in attacking its body.</p><br/><p>However, unfortunately, the next moment, Yu IlHan collapsed right there.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t even swear. It was because he didn\u2019t know how to move his jaw muscles. He felt that he might bite his tongue if he wasn\u2019t careful so he didn\u2019t move it anymore, his mouth was still half open.</p><br/><p>The curse was truly ferocious. He misstepped once and now he couldn\u2019t even think how to move next. He felt as if all the nerves inside his body was tangled up.</p><br/><p>Yes, a patient tied to a hospital bed might feel similar to this.</p><br/><p>{Kuhahahahahat!}</p><br/><p>The next moment the deathgod\u2019s scythe mercilessly flew and struck his back. The defensive power of the armor was truly exceptional and blocked that strike, but it couldn\u2019t hold out against the chain of attacks and ended up getting destroyed.</p><br/><p>{Die!}</p><br/><p>The deathgod\u2019s attack hit his back. The pain of bone shattering, and a new, and more ferocious curse spread around his body, giving him pain and blowing away his consciousness.</p><br/><p>The fact that he moved his body to avoid the next attack was probably due to that. His subconscious made that movement, outside of his capability, to succeed.</p><br/><p>{You\u2019re quite stubborn!}</p><br/><p>\u201cHeeeh.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange voice that was neither a groan, nor a shout, nor a scream, flowed out. Yu IlHan somehow thought it was funny. He himself thought that he wasn\u2019t of the right mind right now.</p><br/><p>\u2018I really might die at this rate. Really.\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that there wasn\u2019t a case he thought \u2018it\u2019s a crisis\u2019, but at those times, he had the confidence to break out by himself.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t like that now. The new curse that permeated through the wound on his back was more malicious.</p><br/><p>His vision was dark, there was no strength in his body, and ignoring his will, powerlessness pervaded his body. He was somehow standing by somehow putting strength into his lges, but he felt that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything more.</p><br/><p>You think I\u2019ll die? Yu IlHan strongly thought to himself.</p><br/><p>You think I\u2019ll die?</p><br/><p>2 months after Great Cataclysm. This was the period of time that he had lived on Earth.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t endured for 1000 years alone just to live for 2 more months. He still had a lot of things that he hadn\u2019t done. There were still a lot of things that he had not experienced. The things he want to make, the things he wanted to learn, the things he wanted to see \u2013 there were too many.</p><br/><p>I want to see Lita.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t die like this.</p><br/><p>{I will take your life. Your record, I will take your everything.}</p><br/><p>Assured of victory, the reaper said arrogantly. Despite being overwhelmed by Yu IlHan through out the whole fight, now that it had noticed Yu IlHan\u2019s limit, it had changed instantly.</p><br/><p>It was a funny guy. He wanted to laugh at it for a long time, but it was disappointing that he couldn\u2019t see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho will die?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, he curiously could speak. Thinking that the will of humans are very curious, even though it was he himself who did it, he continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll die for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan moved his body to avoid the scythe that was swung to take his life. This was the moment he, who hadn\u2019t even acquired his 2nd class, broke through the power of a curse through sheer will alone.</p><br/><p>However, with that, his movements stopped.</p><br/><p>A momentary result. His movements only got him 3 more seconds before the deathgod reaped his life.</p><br/><p>And there were people who arrived within those 3 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cEiii! Rescue that person pleeeease!\u201d</p><br/><p>A funny incantation assaulted Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>However, that funny chant blew away the two curses inside Yu IlHan\u2019s body; recovered his depleted strength, albeit a little; and made him mentally stable enough to avoid the deathgod\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>{Iiiiiik!}}</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan!]</p><br/><p>[Whoa. Why is such an absurd monster in this dungeon!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, fuck it aaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllll!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaaaaaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>Human holy knight Kang HaJin, who was in charge of the team\u2019s health; and who had not many things that he did not know about until now, but acquired so many of them after meeting Yu IlHan, smashed against the deathgod.</p><br/><p>Originally, not even a sinlge unit of damage would be inflicted with his chargem but with his job of a holy knight, and the absurdly strong blessing of Na YuNa, on top of the damage already inflicted on the deathgod collaborated to blow the monster away!</p><br/><p>{Kik, Kuaaaa!}</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s good that you\u2019re alive. Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s not human. He made that monster into that state alone. He\u2019s not human!]</p><br/><p>Angel Erta rejoiced, and angel Feyta became shocked.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at them while smiling before he found something over the horizon. He instantly knew what Erta\u2019s plan was after looking at that.</p><br/><p>Then he shortly asked Kang HaJin who was staring at the deathgod.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long can you hold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy myself!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin shouted in fright. He heard that it was a cooperative attack, but when he went into battle the story changed!</p><br/><p>However, looking at Yu IlHan\u2019s serious eyes, he could only honestly answer with a crying expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cA, about 30 seconds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what could change in 30 seconds? Kang HaJin didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beneath the half-shattered helmet and the mask, Yu IlHan\u2019s mouth made a refreshing crescent. While Kang HaJin was absent minded, Yu IlHan kicked off the ground and started running.</p><br/><p>Towards the three trolls, who were wandering around beyond the horizon.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin\u2019s kinda cute, ain\u2019t he? (T/N: Tsundere~)</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who blatantly acts cute.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>\u2026 So busy\u2026 next chapter is end of this arc.</p><br/><p>(sponsored chapter)</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her flesh had been crumbled, muscles torn, bones twisted and broken and even her bone marrow was flowing out. The damage made him wonder how she was even alive, and made Yu IlHan\u2019s heart ache. He couldn\u2019t even imagine how much pain Liera herself was undergoing.</p><br/><p>However, when the armor melted into the legs, the bones became sturdier and healed as if time was flowing in reverse, new muscles sprouted out and \u2018red\u2019 blood flowed above it, flesh covered the gap, and skin grew above that.</p><br/><p>[You, this\u2026\u2026 how?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you might do something so reckless. This equipment wasn\u2019t to strengthen you, but a device to help you recover after storing your records. The fifth option is the nucleus and is the entire meaning of the armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Something like that was possible? No, before that, was it so simple to recover a higher existence of 6th class like her? She wanted to ask too many things, but the pain from the recovery shut her mouth.</p><br/><p>And that was very wise of her. The technology behind it required Yu IlHan to explain for at least 6 hours, going on about the blacksmithing he had learned as well as magic engineering and other magic languages.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrictly speaking, it isn\u2019t returning you to the past state. This is helping you settle as a lower existence after extracting the records of you as a higher existence without much pain, by remembering the structure of your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You knew\u2026\u2026 I would do this?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then you, knew of my feelings too\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not that\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shut his mouth about that part. In truth, he was thinking about such a case with a 50% probability. However the cowardly Yu IlHan could not erase the thoughts \u2018what if she didn\u2019t?\u2019 from his head.</p><br/><p>So, he fooled himself to think that a 6th class angel from Heaven\u2019s Army maybe close to him, but did not have any feelings towards him, and that she was only treating him like a blood-related brother as a big sister.</p><br/><p>The matter with Na YuNa added onto that thought. One coincidence does not happen twice, so there was no way Liera would like him. Such a strange thought-process had solidified in his head.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Idiot, bad guy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the criminal\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could not raise his head in front of Liera. If he did not realize after all that happened just now, he wasn\u2019t human, but a flea.</p><br/><p>Liera perhaps felt that he had realized enough, and laughed even with the suffering. Meanwhile, Yu IlHan\u2019s blood flowed and drenched her armor, and in the process of the armor melting, it was recovering the other parts of her body and not just the legs.</p><br/><p>[Did you kill it for good?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. I killed it for good and collected the body too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Sheesh, that greed of yours\u2026..]</p><br/><p>No matter how much of a bitch that thing was, it was still a 6th class. It would be strange if he didn\u2019t collect it. Yu IlHan was shameless, and Liera smiled bitterly. His unchanging attitude was his drawback, as well his good point. And she liked that side of him as well.</p><br/><p>Now,her two legs, knees, and thighs were recovered and her waist was slowly being reconstructed. No in fact, a more fundamental and large change was occurring throughout her body.</p><br/><p>The white blood signifying an angel had all left the body, and red blood replaced her blood vessels. The newly made heart accepted the blood and pumped it throughout the body, which then would resonate with Yu IlHan\u2019s blood and support the creation of the new body.</p><br/><p>The traces of the light pink armor were all gone as well. Liera touched the glossy skin that was newly growing after her dead skin had peeled off, and felt that her armor was gone.</p><br/><p>[Too bad. It was an armor that IlHan made.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a better one anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the recovery proceeded to a certain point, the blessing of the god of love also chipped in. Going beyond just clinging her to life, it became able to more freely interfere with her body, and started developing the body with the power that could be called the holy power.</p><br/><p>Before, the interference was small as she was already a higher existence, but now that she had fallen to a lower existence, the story was different. It was making her suitable for one blessed by the god of love!</p><br/><p>In fact, her destroyed older appearance was helping her be born anew. New wine should be poured into new wineskins, perhaps? Although the process was unimaginably painful, the blessing of the god of love and Yu IlHan\u2019s power lead her to a completely new realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Ah\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>From some moment, her voice became different as well. Before, her voice sounded like it was ringing from above no matter how much he faced her up front, but now, her voice sounded like she was really whispering into his ears.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan liked this more, but Liera didn\u2019t seem to be purely happy about it, and became panicky while stroking her neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026.. this feeling. It\u2019s been such a long time. I really returned to a lower existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy body feels uselessly heavy~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd here I just revived you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, she fell to 4th class from 6th class, so it would be a lie if she said she only felt happy. She was prepared to throw away everything for Yu IlHan, but facing her 4th class self after everything that happened, she felt very complex. It was understandable. Reality was always different from ideals.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant a blanket?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I want to stay like this for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>With everything that covered her body, gone, including her armor, she was obviously naked right now. Her body that was torn apart and unsightly to look at during battle, had long since regained its original glossy and elastic appearance.</p><br/><p>No, perhaps she looked more attractive than before. Although it was embarrassing to look at that part, Yu IlHan suspected that her chest had become bigger, and in fact, that was true.</p><br/><p>This was all the great powers of the god of love. Everything was to receive more love from the person of the opposite sex that she loved! 1</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, her face still had some unpeeled dead skin. When Yu IlHan stroked her cheeks with his hands, the and the dirty debris fell down and glossy, white skin appeared. Yu IlHan made a small smile as he looked at Liera\u2019s clean face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, pretty again. I think you\u2019re more pretty now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch embarrassing words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liear\u2019s cheeks turned redder than a tomato from the heart-strike, but Yu IlHan still had a leisurely expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday I\u2019m invincible. I spouted so many embarrassing lines while watching you fight it, while making you recover, and in other situations as well, so nothing would change even if I say one or two more lines. Although, I do have to confidence to roll around in suffering faster than Sonic when the night comes\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera never stopped smiling for some reason. For her, she was happy that Yu IlHan was alive, and she was alive as well, facing him right now.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wanted to enact punishment to her who was smiling without knowing anything, but he decided to withhold it. It was no wonder, since he also like this situation where the two were facing each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>It would have been for the best if she just kept smiling, but suddenly, her two red eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>To think she\u2019d stab from such an angle! A drop of cold sweat ran down Yu IlHan\u2019s back. He thought that he answered enough, but it seems it was his misunderstanding!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, like I said I already\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a proper answer. Properly, definitely, unmistakably, and undeniably! truthfully!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026How are you so confident? What if I say no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera made a cute smile that made him want to eat her up, and opened her mouth to say some frightening words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will carry things out by force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rapist! There\u2019s a rapist here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no one other than us here on Earth right now. It\u2019s not a crime if I don\u2019t get found out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d \u2018I\u201dm here. Me! And forget about being caught, a crime is still a crime!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was even scarier since her eyes looked completely serious. Yu IlHan looked down at Liera\u2019s face, when she had grabbed his hands to prevent him from running away, the two of them ended up laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he spoke. At that moment, another woman\u2019s face flashed by in his mind, but the feelings towards that person were insignificant compared to his feelings towards Liera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, that you don\u2019t have to commit a crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The millennium that went further than just making them familiar with each other, where they shared everything and started to understand other deeply; as well as a few years they endured together while believing in each other even while the surrounding situation was hectic.</p><br/><p>Now, there was an emotion in the realm that was way beyond just shallow emotions like novelty, pettiness, boredom, and familiarity that linked him with LIera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also like you very much. So\u2026\u2026. I ..love ..you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Born coward, stupid, shy, and idiotic, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t do something like approaching her first\u2026\u2026 but if Liera was looking at him, he thought that he had to do his best to face her head on.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t run away at this point.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>But now that he actually found the courage to confess, he could not hear a reply. It was no wonder since Liera didn\u2019t know how to act after hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s direct confession.</p><br/><p>Her current feelings were similar to an ordinary salary woman who bought a lottery ticket while wishing to become 1st, but still thought that she had no chance, and actually won the jackpot.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuguuuuuuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>She twisted her body, trying to hide her face, but the hands that she had grabbed before became her own drawback and she couldn\u2019t turn around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiuugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease say something I can understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like dying because of embarrassment and happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just revived you so don\u2019t go dying again sheesh. Moreover, who was it that wanted me to say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be so direct!\u201d</p><br/><p>He did think that the him of today was invincible, but people really shouldn\u2019t do what they\u2019re not used to. Yu IlHan also found it unbelievably embarrassing. He wanted to roll on the ground right now. However, Liera didn\u2019t let his hands go even while being embarrassed, so he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>[Go on, kiss.]</p><br/><p>Someone urged them on in that predicament. Lifting their heads, the Flying fortress was flying above their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean a kiss\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a scene suited to this situation!]</p><br/><p>Mystic\u2019s voice sounded very pouty, and it looked like she didn\u2019t like the fact that she had to just watch without being able to do anything. No, perhaps she was just annoyed while watching Yu IlHan and Liera filming a romance drama.</p><br/><p>[Go on and kiss her, master. Or else I\u2019ll just drop the flying fortress on you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you tease me when you don\u2019t even have a body.\u201d</p><br/><p>[And just because of WHO was it? Huh!]</p><br/><p>He ignored Mystic. Then, looking down at Liera twisting her body in embarrassment, he resolved himself with a short deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I can\u2019t stay passive forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Huh? Huuuuh?]</p><br/><p>Catching that muttering, Mystic\u2019s voice became higher. However, Yu IlHan took the next step without hesitation. He grabbed Liera\u2019s hand strongly with one hand, and grabbed her chin with the other, and lowered his head to\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI, IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera, who never imagined that the other side would approach first, was surprise lip-attacked by him. With that, Liera couldn\u2019t say anything anymore.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Ah, goddammit. It\u2019s so annoying.]</p><br/><p>[I shouldn\u2019t have said to kiss!] \u2013 Mystic, who was flirted right in front of, made the Flying fortress go berserk and break-dance in the air. Meanwhile, Orochi, who, likewise, watched everything that played out, quietly muttered inside the Infernal dragon body.</p><br/><p>[This is going to be quite a sight alright.] (Orochi)</p><br/><p>And as such the two of them lived happily ever after, occasionally having to endure the teasing from the flying fortress, but still, happily ever after.</p><br/><p>-FIN-</p><br/><p>Just kidding \u2013 KouKouSeiDesu</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Fuu, I really did my best here writing this climax. I thought this maybe the second most important scene in this novel. And perhaps due to that, the more I read it, the more childish I found, but I was still very satisfied. I would be so happy if my current feelings could be felt by you readers.</p><br/><p>Other than that, I gritted my teeth so much while writing this chapter. Why do I have to write a happy chapter about the MC\u2026.? Pew! Pewpew! Give me back my hands and feet dammit!</p><br/><p>I thought I prepared a lot of scenes where IlHan prepared for Liera\u2019s outbreak, but there were some of you that were surprised. IlHan is not that careless!</p><br/><p>You must be curious about the class and skills right now. Looks like it will happen in the next chapter!</p><br/><p>1. I guess the god of love doesn\u2019t approve of homosexuality.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

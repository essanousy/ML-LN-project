In this place, where human presence was already spread thin, a barrier had been erected to keep people out and a secretive experiment was taking place.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>And round one of the experiment ended in failure.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElectric Shield!\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous explosion that happened instead of something else, assaulted two people, but the safety magic quickly activated and protected the two from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a failure this time too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026That seems so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Irma An Ill\u2019ta, the first imperial princess\u2026\u2026no, the person who had become empress since 3 months ago, asked in a nonchalant voice as Kang MiRae, the most trusted consultant of the empress and at the same time, the person who rose to the highest position among the people of Earth, replied while biting her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think the connection is completely severed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the world I was born in. There\u2019s no way it was so easily severed. The connection is definitely there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut at least with our abilities, it isn\u2019t possible to reconnect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The experiment they were carrying out was none other than attempting to connect two worlds. In the past, anyone else would have snorted at the thought of it, but it was something that happened naturally until just a while ago on Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Despite that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae felt a little down after hearing Irma\u2019s words, but came to herself and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only continue working hard until it succeeds. Whether it is for the people here in Lanpas that want to go back to Earth, or for those people trapped in other worlds too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just honestly say you want to see Mr. Yu IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I want to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s honestly put Irma at a loss for words. However, Kang MiRae only blushed a little, but did not have much of a change in her expression even as she continued speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to see him 365 days a year, so I cannot say I do not want to see him. It wasn\u2019t this bad even when I was separated with YuNa for 10 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, hey\u2026\u2026. sorry. I mentioned it since you didn\u2019t look like you acknowledged that\u2026\u2026 fuu, how quickly times change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae giggled seeing Irma An Ill\u2019ta\u2019s red face. Only she would be able to make the empress of an empire panic so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe related skills are rising rapidly, so I believe that I\u2019ll be able to achieve results soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Yes. I also wish for Earth to be reconnected to Lanpas, and other worlds too. I want to participate in your wedding after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWedding, you say\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae seemed embarrassed after saying that word out loud, but still tapped her cheeks to come back to her usual self.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many competent people around that person. Even if everything goes well, I cannot be assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo MiRae, you are so militant about everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave first. I should do the next experiment after I see some results in other things first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae checked up on the barrier magic around the area, and picked up her luggage. Everything was battle-oriented in some way or another.</p><br/><p>Ever since she was \u2018trapped\u2019 in Lanpas, she had been going around dungeons and magic ruins that were still considered the mysteries of this world in order to research a way to go back to Earth, and on the side, to raise her own abilities.</p><br/><p>These dungeons were left uncleared for countless years, so their difficulty was unimaginable. However, Kang MiRae was the biggest genius Earth had given birth to (P/R ???!! Ilhan?). On top of her vicious attitude and the support from the imperial family, three whole ruins were newly excavated and conquered within just one year.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to go right away? Even though the ruins have just been excavated?\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress spoke while looking at her with worried eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest for a day? Magic ruins are not simple things, you may lose your life due to a moment of carelessness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do feel quite threatened since its coming from the person who almost blew up an entire empire for a single ruin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat again, sheesh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back to the incident that occurred in the ruins where the very essence of magic engineering was located, the two exchanged small smiles. At that time, it was no different from a disaster, but now, they were just good memories. The power of time was frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s been a year already\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018only\u2019 been a year \u2026\u2026.I do not plan to leave that as memories, nor do I intend to give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I thought you just regained your leisure, but whipping yourself again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Kang MiRae turned around. Unlike her lively voice, her feeble shoulders looked very shaky and made the empress sigh while looking at her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not plan to. I still have people I need to meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her own brother Kang HaJin, who made her able to breathe in the stuck up world of the higher society, and strict education. Her friend Na YuNa, who had been with her for her entire life whether it was in a good way or a bad way. And also\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018If it\u2019s that person, wouldn\u2019t he have achieved 4th class already? Isn\u2019t he hurt somewhere?\u2026\u2026. Perhaps he gained another woman?\u2019</p><br/><p>Once she thought about Yu IlHan, there was no end. Even though she couldn\u2019t do anything even if she did so. She only took herself for a fool since even she couldn\u2019t stop it even if she knew about it.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae shook off the minor thoughts with a shake of her head, and walked forward, leaving the empress behind. Irma An Ill\u2019ta made a bitter smile and left the scene of the failed experiment.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, two of the people that Kang MiRae thought of were currently\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk for the maiden\u2019s hand in marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady maiden has also completely become a citizen of our world. His Majesty the emperor does not wish to delay this any further. For the future of the two empires\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate that old fatty~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO, old fatty!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026in a very difficult situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you insult the emperor of the great empire, His majesty Li Catriana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBleeeh to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady maiden!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChase that fatty out too~! If you don\u2019t, I will. With Lady Leytna\u2019s holy power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa instantly rejected the envoy from the self-proclaimed empire of Li Catriana, that held power rivalling that of the holy empire of Elforce. And this was no small matter either, this person had brought news pertaining to marriage and the emperor who was in charge of half the continent!</p><br/><p>Although they had momentarily made the envoy step back for now, the priests that supported her all grabbed onto her skirt and kneeled down with pale faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady maiden, the opponent is an emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey do not fear the power of Lady Leytna. What are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of such a fatso either!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike her usual leisurely self, she was really enraged, and the priests retreated due to her forceful attitude, when she spoke in resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll wage war on us soon so get ready~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWar!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people shouted in shock, but Na YuNa calmly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were already all over the place, trying to come up with ways to swallow Elforce. If that guy married me, things would become easier, and if I reject, that guy would use that as an excuse to invade~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he just fell for you\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even need to be considered. Whether it was me then Elforce, or Elforce then me, he wouldn\u2019t have cared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s confidence was piercing the skies as always today.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were going to fight them anyway so get prepared. Perhaps they already have an army prepared so please evacuate the civilians first, and let\u2019s talk about the rest after I talk about this to Her Holiness.</p><br/><p>When Na YuNa stood up from the seat, Kang HaJin, her guardian knight also followed her up. The priests could only see them out absentmindedly. However, that was just for a moment, and they started talking to each other with sighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to follow the lady\u2019s orders. Moreover, I also didn\u2019t like that emperor so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also wanted to see the scene of Lady maiden kicking that pig\u2019s ass. We\u2019ll wage the most beautiful war under the name of the goddess Leytna.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s start a war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the maiden had decided, their intentions did not matter and this war was inevitable. If so, they could only accept their fate and start a war. Na YuNa\u2019s current authority over Elforce was just that much.</p><br/><p>Like that, the war between the two strongest countries of Breya, was set in stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuNa, will it be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Kang HaJin asked Na YuNa in a worried voice as she walked in the hallway with her high heels clicking on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Kang HaJin panicked since he didn\u2019t think that he would get an answer like that, when Na YuNa vented her frustration on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat shameless fatso. It makes me angry just thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were a lot of men who tried to approach you that way in the past too. Moreover, this was the emperor of another country we\u2019re talking about. Couldn\u2019t you have declined more nicely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re preparing for war anyway. Unless I accept the marriage, we would have to fight anyway so there is no need to \u2018politely decline\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>True, there was no need to do that. However even in the situation where she didn\u2019t need to do all that, Na YuNa put on a mask. Perhaps it was a sort of a self-defense mechanism to not show her inner self, but that made a lot of other people misunderstand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if we did as you said, we might have delayed the war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, she didn\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, to do that, I would have had to meet that fatso at least once, and that guy may have schemed something. In the first place, I\u2019m a woman with an owner. there\u2019s no way I\u2019d give room for any other men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.You changed a lot too thanks to Sir IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Mr. IlHan doesn\u2019t like lies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, a sinful guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it. He left me here for such a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa nodded at Kang HaJin\u2019s words. Then, she giggled after looking at Kang HaJin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous~?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m relieved that you finally found a proper partner\u2026\u2026 though, it does pain me that you chose Sir IlHan out of all people out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, Yu IlHan was a capable man alright. However, his sister, who looked like she\u2019d have nothing to do with love for her entire life and her friend had been smitten by him. Even though he didn\u2019t believe in fate until now, he had no choice but to do so now.</p><br/><p>However, as if she knew everything he was thinking, Na YuNa laughed at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRae won\u2019t be able to seduce him anyway~. But before that, what are you worried about when both our families seem like they\u2019re up in the air?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I\u2019m a member of my family, I only wish for my sister to do well with the person she likes, as her brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you say that, I won\u2019t give him to her~.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa stopped there and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiving him or whatnot. We can only talk about that when he is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you did something when he was with you? I heard you were together until the 3rd Great Cataclysm\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a small sigh, she kicked Kang HaJin\u2019s shin with her heels. Her strike enhanced with holy power that became stronger by the day, contained the power to make a paladin kneel.</p><br/><p>\u201cKergh!\u201d.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go meet Her Holiness so wait here~! Think about what you did wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe did, something alright\u2026.. Kergh!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the man who was left alone on Earth while countless other people were fighting their battles in countless different worlds, was\u2026</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[Kihiiiiiiiih!]</p><br/><p>[Kuho, Humaaaaaaaaaaaaan!]</p><br/><p>[What are doing by making dungeons explode in succession like that!

Great, prepare to fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u2026not stopping at weeding out the very roots of the monsters on Earth even after one year, and was currently occupied with making dungeons explode.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>This is the 200th chapter. Although there is still a long path left, the number 200 makes me proud for some reason. Thanks for being with me until now, and please take care of me in the future.</p><br/><p>This chapter is quite similar to the last one. I\u2019ve shown you the figures of Kang MiRae and Na YuNa, who are second most important people after the main character, in a single chapter. Even though I know that many of you want to see IlHan and is disappointed, I can\u2019t afford to leave this out\u2026\u2026 so I\u2019ll promise. Next chapter will be about IlHan alone.</p><br/><p>I talked about an event. It\u2019s nothing complex. I\u2019ll have a popularity poll to celebrate chapter 200. Please write just ONE \u2018favorite character\u2019 on the comments. I\u2019ll be thankful if you write the reason, but it will be fine if you don\u2019t mention that.</p><br/><p>(Stuff about voting rules and time)</p><br/><p>(Stuff about announcing results)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The fatigue that had haunted her mind and body had completely disappeared, and as such, she was feeling very comfortable now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, her mood rapidly dropped after seeing the woman next to her bed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Not that great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still feeling bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmmmmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two pairs of wings which she used to be so proud of were nowhere to be seen, and she was wearing a light pink dress that glistened with a mysterious glow.</p><br/><p>The overwhelming pressure from being in the same area had disappeared, and she felt as if she was an ordinary human and not an angel. No, well, the power and beauty she possessed were definitely not ordinary, though.</p><br/><p>Na YuNa realized and accepted that Liera had become a lower existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you here all this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I took care of some intruders mid way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Mr. IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo beat up the Destruction Demon Army. He\u2019ll probably take care of the imperial army while he\u2019s at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was why it was not Yu IlHan but Liera that was watching over her. Na YuNa asked questions once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said to protect me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot you but the holy region itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is Mr. IlHan in bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe turns frightening and is very proactive, and the bliss is indescr\u2026\u2026. whoa!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera covered her mouth, but Na YuNa had already acquired the information she needed. She sighed while muttering.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you two ended up like that after all. I did think it was going to happen somehow when I was expelled from Earth\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.You really think fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera was shocked at Na YuNa\u2019s ability to verify the truth in an instant with just small hints and collapsed on the spot. Then, she thought back to that time and jousted YuNa.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you still took his fir\u2026 first kiss even while knowing that!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be only the two of you left, and you like each other, so naturally there will be progress. Though, I really didn\u2019t want that to happen\u2026\u2026 and I even put a stamp on him too. *Sigh*, if I hadn\u2019t been expelled from Earth, I could take the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera decided to fix her opinion of Na YuNa being a pure and na\u00efve kid. This girl was the devil! She even had the urge to lift the blanket up to see if there was a tail or not!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lower existence now\u2026\u2026 if you dare, I can beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNuuuuu, a certain someone was just stolen of her first love, and now that the woman who stole the first love is threatening me. I really want to cry in sadness alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Na YuNa really had tears in her eyes, Liera became silent. However, Na YuNa realized that Liera was being considerate of her, so she wiped the tears off and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine~. It\u2019s not like Mr. IlHan and I were dating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like goals don\u2019t go in just because there\u2019s a goalkeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liera was really about to take her spear out, Na YuNa burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. I also don\u2019t like people who hate me. In fact, it hurts my pride too. So I\u2019ll stay still for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you keep room for everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to do from now so please get out for a little. I\u2019m going to pray to Lady Leytna to make you and Mr. IlHan break up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll kill you here and now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You guys get along well.]</p><br/><p>Mystic snorted at the two who were quarreling. She thought she\u2019d see a more bloody scene, but it was much less intense than she had expected!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never going to break up so stop dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you might say that, but I don\u2019t know about him! I\u2019m much younger and more pretty after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>If she could read the minds of Liera and Na YuNa who were playing around, she wouldn\u2019t think to that extent, but unfortunately, Mystic wasn\u2019t so mature yet.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan arrived around that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Miss YuNa. You were up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu IlHan enter the room, Na YuNa became absent minded again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like your fatigue has been relieved. So the blessing of the goddess of beauty is OP after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really was handsome. Perhaps the lense on her eyes had become thicker after longing for him so much, or perhaps Yu IlHan had really become handsome, but he really looked handsome right now.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Miss YuNa. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEih!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was absent mindedly observing Yu IlHan\u2019s facial features, and came to herself after Liera elbowed her in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHing~, you won\u2019t even let me look at him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan\u2019s face will wear off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your nonsense again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan approached and gave Liera a smack on the forehead. At that moment, Na YuNa realized that Yu IlHan was dragging something with his other hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan, what is that in your hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s the emperor of Li Catriana.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nonchalantly replied and put his arm forward. There was a massive sword stuck on the chest, his two legs were</p><br/><p>mashed, all the hair and the scalp was pulled out, his lips were bleeding, and so it was quite difficult to recognize, but from the fat belly, it indeed was the emperor.</p><br/><p>No, wait.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.The emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the sudden present, Na YuNa became speechless, but Yu IlHan continued as if it was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him yet. You\u2019d need another sacrificial lamb in order to console the rates of the victims.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people of Elforce had to bid farewell to countless allies while fighting against the empire. Most of the civilians suffered and many died. Even if the war ended like this, they wouldn\u2019t be able to quench the thirst of the people. To quench their thirst, something at the level of the blood of the emperor would suffice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Miss YuNa and the one called the pope can do whatever you want with this guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu IlHan nonchalantly saying that, Na YuNa once again became speechless. The fact that he treated an emperor in charge of half the world, like he was nothing, gave her a feeling that he was seeing things beyond a lower existences\u2019 view.</p><br/><p>However, Na YuNa thought that even that was cool. Hm, it looked like her lenses were quite thick after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the emperor is here, then what of the imperial army?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were taken care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan. Na YuNa didn\u2019t dare to ask the details as she was afraid of the meaning behind \u2018taken care of\u2019. Of course, Yu IlHan wouldn\u2019t have obliterated a million strong army\u2026 right? But if you thought back to his overwhelming appearance\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At that time, Yu IlHan said something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tied them all up so go check later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan left the mansion with Na YuNa and Liera. On the perimeter of the Flying fortress, where the ground could be seen, Na YuNa did indeed find that the millions of soldiers belonging to the imperial army were all tied up and lined up in a long line. The one that was watching over them, was of course, Yumir in dragon form.</p><br/><p>\u201cWao\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be a historical moment in Breya.\u201d</p><br/><p>Can a single human make a million others kneel in front of him? The answer was, \u2018yes\u2019.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan simply cancelled his concealment, broke through the imperial army, found the emperor, and beat the guy up senseless. During the entire process, no one could touch Yu IlHan, nor could anyone interfere with him.</p><br/><p>Even all the power of the empire put together could not protect the most important existence. And like that, the empire lost against Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd after that, I told them to do as I say if they didn\u2019t want to die, and here we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor was captured, and the army was immobilized, so\u2026\u2026. the war has ended?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan agreed with her like nothing had happened. Despite ending the war that decided the fate of the continent all by himself, he sounded as peaceful as ever. Well, it was actually not that hard for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPf, pfffffft.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa found everything absurd and just laughed. What would the people on the ground feel when they saw that? What expressions would the pope and Kang HaJin be making right now? Thinking about that, she found it too funny. Seeing Na YuNa like that, Yu IlHan asked her another question in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have to do anything else for you? Miss Yuna?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot, but I\u2019ll put up with this for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa laughed again after Yu IlHan panic. Right now, she even found it enjoyable that Liera was glaring at her.</p><br/><p>She really had the urge to pour kisses on Yu IlHan with all of her current emotions, but that was impossible with Liera here, so it was only unfortunate. She could even see Liera\u2019s arm muscles twitching, prepared to stop her at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cheapskate.\u201d (Na YuNa)</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Huh?\u201d (Yu IlHan)</p><br/><p>[Humans really are interesting.]</p><br/><p>Only Yu IlHan, who didn\u2019t know of the conversation that happened between the two, tilted his head. Only Orochi left a short sentence of his impression after realizing what happened!</p><br/><p>Like that, the war that encompassed the entire world of Breya, had finished. The war did not end in the victory of Li Catriana, the country that caused this war, or Elforce, that stood up under the protection of the goddess of beauty, Leytna, but in the victory of a loner that intruded mid way in order to save a single woman.</p><br/><p>The upper echelons of the empire, including the emperor, were all executed. The emperor that wanted to possess Na YuNa to the point of causing war, had died without so much as being able to step on her shadow.</p><br/><p>The Flying fortress as well as Yu IlHan, who had appeared after Na YuNa had shown a miracle in the holy region, were acknowledged as a part of Leytna\u2019s power, or her avatar, or something else on that line to the believers of the church. This was no exception even to the imperial army that had lost, and now the entire continent was united under her name.</p><br/><p>Li Catriana collapsed just like that. With Yu IlHan and the Flying fortress\u2019s actions, they could weed out the core of power of the empire, so it was not that difficult for Elforce to absorb Li Catriana.</p><br/><p>The problem was about who would take the throne of the united empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly you are worthy to take this crown in this world right now, YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to go back to Earth with Mr. IlHan now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven while passing on the chance to become the master of a world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The core personnel of Elforce, including the pope, judged that only Na YuNa, who caused the miracle of the holy region, as well as the one that called Yu IlHan here, was worthy of being the emperor, but Na YuNa didn\u2019t have any plans to stay in Breya any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t need me, but Mr. IlHan does!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, IlHan doesn\u2019t need you either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, he probably thinks otherwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was actually right. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t deny that.</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s blessing is very strong. The only one that could make Yu IlHan even stronger, when he had already escaped the limits of a lower existence, was Na YuNa. Now that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know who he might fight against in the future, he would honestly have to beg her to come with him if she decided to stay as the empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t lie to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had already told Na YuNa of the deep relationship he had with Liera. Na YuNa acknowledged that without being shocked, but as that tugged on Yu IlHan\u2019s mind, he could not bear to ask her to come with him. However, seeing her express her intentions to come with him without him doing anything, Yu IlHan was only thankful.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what are we supposed to do? Who else in this world can represent Lady Leytna other than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke the pope while sighing. Na YuNa replied while pouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Holiness can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already so old\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were young last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a temporary thing because I emitted all the mana I\u2019ve bound until now. To keep that state, I\u2019d\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was listening this whole time, took out some 4th class magic stones out of the mountains he kept in his inventory, and made around 5 accessories on the spot and gave them to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are some presents to congratulate your ascension to the throne from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. But this should\u2026\u2026. hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a precious treasure that went beyond just supplying mana, and permanently restored her recoverability of her physical body. Simply speaking, it could raise her lifespan just by wearing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think my body cells are recovering by the minute\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Since you\u2019re already so high level, you\u2019ll become younger even if you level up a little in the future. You\u2019ll probably be able to live for a few hundred more years. Why don\u2019t you take the challenge to become a higher existence while you\u2019re at it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The pope, that regained her late-twenties appearance by transmuting the overflowing mana from the accessory into holy power, looked at Yu IlHan as she would at a freak, but Yu IlHan was already used to that kind of thing and felt nothing from it.</p><br/><p>Na YuNa smiled in satisfaction, and Liera also made a bitter smile, as if saying this was nothing new.</p><br/><p>Such was how the first empress of the united empire, came about.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The way Na YuNa calls Liera had changed huh (T/N: I didn\u2019t translate this correctly I guess\u2026. she calls her \u2018unni\u2019)</p><br/><p>A new party member!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

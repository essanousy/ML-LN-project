Earth will be placed in the center of all battlefields, and countless experts shall gather to conquer the land of mysticism!\u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow, it sounded like a game prologue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, you will need an army. An army that you can trust your back with. We shall become that power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd therefore, you want me to spare you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess immediately kneeled down. Even while shaking from nervousness, Flemir gathered the black wolves just in case the red ones attacked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan flicked his fingers again and butchered only the red wolves again, but inside, he was quite conflicted.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s true that this girlie won\u2019t be able to betray me if I use the Rule skill on her. However, just how much significance does a wolfkin royalty have for her to say that those guys will follow me too? Can\u2019t they just declare someone else as royalty and stab me in the back anyway?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wolfkin is centered around the royalty. Without the special power from the baptism containing the blood of the royalty, wolfkin cannot be blessed by the moon. This is also the reason why the Destruction Demon Army tried to capture and not kill me. Without me, the wolfkin will go extinct.\u201d</p><br/><p>Explained the princess as if having read his mind. She then continued,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only surviving royalty is me. No, if you put me under your rule and ask me then, then I will have no choice but to answer the truth, so it will be easier to find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite desperate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to survive. Also, I want to let them survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could feel that the princess wasn\u2019t lying. Yes, since it was the truth, it was all the more laughable. He snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you should have thought about where you set foot in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess bit her lips. When she looked at Flemir momentarily, he only lowered his head in embarrassment. Yu IlHan now knew who exactly was behind the plan to invade earth, but since it should have been the princess who gave the final approval, he had no plans on letting her off easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not make any excuses. I just want you to understand that we\u2019re that desperate. If you listen to me, if you accept me as your subordinate, then I will do anything for you. Even if it maybe licking your boots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s dirty so no.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf so! Then I-\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought for a moment before asking Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.Thinking about how a new woman is about to be stuck to you, I don\u2019t feel that well.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[N, nothing at all! If you can rule over a massive monster army like that, then you should. Only if you can completely subdue them. Yes, of course.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Somehow, the angels around him nowadays were behaving quite strangely, what exactly was happening? While tilting his head and scratching his ear, Yu IlHan nodded his head. He then flicked his fingers once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKgwaaaaahk\u201d</p><br/><p>Over 400 dragon bone spears. They didn\u2019t show the slightest sign of cracks even after hundreds of throws, despite having ended the life of all the howling red wolves on this land.</p><br/><p>With that, in this world of Kiroa at least, wolfkin that belonged to the Destruction Demon Army did not exist any more. Well, at least among those that took part in this war.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emotionally speaking, he could never accept this, but Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t an idiot who decided everything based on his emotions.</p><br/><p>If it was Yu IlHan alone, then he had the resolve and confidence to survive anywhere and everywhere, but if all other people of Earth died and Yu IlHan was left alone, then there would be no more people to play tic-tac-toe with, would there? Well, there wasn\u2019t anyone to play with him in the first place, but still!</p><br/><p>\u201cI accept your suggestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the princess was being thankful to the point that she was even banging her head on the ground, Flemir was frowning due to his complicated emotions. From that, it did seem like the princess wasn\u2019t lying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please, immediately subordinate me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wait. I don\u2019t think I have any room in the ski-\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttering, Yu IlHan checked the information on his status, and the Rule skill amongst that, and he was surprised to find out that the level of it had already reached 13. The reason was simple. It seemed that Yumir and the elves were going on quite the rampage, and as such, his skill level was rising rapidly.</p><br/><p>He had plenty of room. He could probably take an additional 7 on top of the princess.</p><br/><p>\u201cScratch that. Let\u2019s hurry then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Extending his hand, Yu IlHan activated the Rule skill. Flemir looked like he wanted to stop it at all costs. While Yu IlHan was thinking that Flemir was not cut out for acting at all, the Rule skill had safely subordinated her.</p><br/><p>[Moon Wolf, Ericia, has been subordinated to you. Ericia\u2019s growth rate accelerates. You are now able to see Ericia\u2019s status.]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he was going to raise her well, but he still opened her status just in case she had lied, but it seemed like she was definitely the princess of the wolfkin; One of her titles was \u2018Blessing of the Moon Goddess\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 85. Aren\u2019t ya weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has not been a long time since Her Ladyship was bo-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlemir, do not call me politely in front of my master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yu IlHan was about to say that addressing each other using titles was tedious, he came to a conclusion that it didn\u2019t matter at all, as the two wolves looked very serious. To be exact, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to meddle.</p><br/><p>Now that he had subordinated her, if anything became different, it was the attitude of the surviving black wolves. Although the wolves still possessed remnants of fear and hostility towards Yu IlHan, they were still kneeling down and paying their respects.</p><br/><p>Nearly ten thousand wolves paying their respects to him wasn\u2019t such a bad feeling. He wasn\u2019t used to receiving attention, but that didn\u2019t matter since they all lowered their heads towards him. Satisfied, Yu IlHan looked at the surroundings. He still couldn\u2019t see any red wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go clean up quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess went into the gate first. Flemir looked at Yu IlHan with an expression that he wanted to say something, but soon frowned and followed her into the gate. Looking at their backs, Yu IlHan tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are they dating each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Perhaps.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Said Erta in a tone like she reeeeeeaaallly wanted them to be. So this angel was meddling in other\u2019s love affairs now? Yu IlHan ended up laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to accept that guy as a subordinate either, but if they want to marry then I can just accept him as subordinate and make them marry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[And the child born from the two?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cFree slave acquired.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Slave-born-slave treatment!?!!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan headed into the gate. What was left behind was the ten thousand wolves that still had their heads on the ground, and the snowy plains blanched in blood..</p><br/><p>\u201cDefend that side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold out, on the right! Hold out a little more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKroaaaaaaang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beyond the gate was a total mess. Black and red wolves were howling, and human shouts filled the land.</p><br/><p>Brave people, cowardly people, and the four elves that stood out despite having concealed their appearances using artifacts, and a roughly 7-year old child that was sweeping the wolves with frightening magic in an angel\u2019s bosom! Wait, he got bigger again!</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael Smithson, who managed to see Yu IlHan\u2019s figure, shouted in a loud voice. Just as Yu IlHan was thinking that this guy maybe liked him, the majority of the humankind people abruptly raised their heads and found Yu IlHan, when they shouted simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo came back!\u201d</p><br/><p>With an incomprehensible feeling, Yu IlHan flicked his fingers. When hundreds of bone spears similar to those that decimated Kiroa continent were summoned once again, the wolves all gave up fighting and just stood still in resignation, waiting for their deaths, but the bone spears only found and killed the red ones, even within the chaos of the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Everything was thanks to the ability of Absolute accuracy. To be exact, if he did not have that ability, he wouldn\u2019t have tried summoning those spears in the air and letting them fall down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s pouring out hundreds of spears.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the humans were being shocked, the spears were re-collected and thrown again.</p><br/><p>Up, down. Up, down. Wolves died. Wolves died again.</p><br/><p>If people realized that even something of this level was Yu IlHan showing restraint considering the growth of other people, then what would the other people think? Of course, he was doing that precisely because he had predicted that!</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who arrived near Yu IlHan with Liera\u2019s help, dispelled his concealment and hugged Yu IlHan, before bashing his head onto the armor again. It didn\u2019t look like he felt any pain as he was smiling.</p><br/><p>Liera had a look at the messy battlefield before explaining to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[This boy was no joke.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been able to do much after the chain level ups stopped, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>Middle tier wind magic was definitely strong, and a dragon\u2019s Mana control would make that even stronger. However, Yumir\u2019s level was still too low. The first few shots would have been enhanced by the amplified mana resulting from chain level ups, but after level ups slow down, it should have been difficult to do much more.</p><br/><p>Moreover, from how he had a figure that was fit attend elementary school, he was definitely a 2nd class now!</p><br/><p>[The clan master of the Lightning God Clan gave him a mana potion. That woman has tons of them. I did hear about the idiom \u2018money can even make ghosts do things\u2019, but I still wonder if that woman bought an entire alchemy guild] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty and kind noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir added onto Liera\u2019s explanation. The strong was scary, but it seemed like this guy liked Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, as he was using magic in a battlefield without Yu IlHan, his concealment would have worn off. This meant that Kang MiRae gave him potions after seeing that Yumir was strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves came as well. The thief, Phiria, and the archer, Pat\u00e9, were relatively clean, but Mirey and Jirl who had to block the monsters with their bodies, were soaked in blood.</p><br/><p>Although their faces were covered, Yu IlHan could know without taking their masks off how delighted they were at meeting Yu IlHan again. Laughing, Yu IlHan spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are dirty so fight somewhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cold Majesty is cool too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo kill the red wolves instead.</p><br/><p>The humans weren\u2019t at a disadvantage in the first place, but with the return of Yu IlHan and the 4th class wolfkin, Flemir, the morale instantly tipped towards the human side. Moreover, it seemed that the DD-wolf that went beyond the gate before had already died.</p><br/><p>Looking at the traces of the tens of giant spears that were destroyed, Yu IlHan smirked. Before going through the gate, he had told the Empress how to cause an explosion using the stored lightning energy as the fuel.</p><br/><p>It would naturally be enough to kill a 4th class. He had made them with that in mind in the first place as well. Insurance did work. He was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive eternal rest to our kin tainted by the dirty Destruction Demon Army! Show them the might of our wolfkin!\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess didn\u2019t even consider going back to wolven form now, and courageously shouted. The black wolves rampaged even more under the princess\u2019 encouragement and ripped apart the red wolves, and Flemir killed the red wolves as if it could save one more wolfkin.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan supported them by dropping some bone spears whenever he felt that he was about to be forgotten, as he walked out of the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Beyond the defensive formation formed of thousands of tankers, the clan master of the Magia clan, Carina Malatesta, who just finished killing tens of red wolves with her magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you care to explain? You said you were going to come back after killing all the 4th classes, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter killing all the red wolves, we now don\u2019t have to kill the black ones any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Every long-ranged attackers focused their attention on him. Yu IlHan kindly explained to the people who were confused due to the sudden turnaround in the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have subdued them. In other words, they are my underlings now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied. Yu IlHan kindly repeated again, and her smiling face froze stiff.</p><br/><p>Well, not just her, everyone who heard that, their expressions turned stiff.</p><br/><p>The battle ended within 30 minutes after that.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>N/A</p><br/><p>(P/R: no author notes this chap)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I will post an announcement, but I\u2019ll be on a break (from translating) from 6th of March ~ 1st of April.

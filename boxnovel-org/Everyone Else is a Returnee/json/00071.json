He couldn\u2019t care less as to whether people admired him or not.</p><br/><p>2nd class monsters that he had to kill while flipping dungeons inside out were still all over Tokyo, and he wanted to kill as many as possible before those Metal Knights or Lightning God or Magia or whatever interfered.</p><br/><p>[Somehow, there are more dungeons in Tokyo than Kanagawa.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t think there would be any Originals here.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about other places than Tokyo or Chiba? Isn\u2019t the damage spreading?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, it\u2019s alright. Well, of course a few dungeons in other areas did break but it\u2019s at a level where the JSDF can handle it. No, well, not \u2018handle\u2019 it but they are going through quite the suffering.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>In other words, he only had to finish Tokyo and Chiba! Yu IlHan stopped for a moment and looked behind him. He could see the Susanoo Army that had inflated to around 12 thousand men.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it would be over if they charge forward now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[They\u2019ll be obliterated if a 3rd class appears so no.](Lita)</p><br/><p>That made sense. The difference between classes was truly absurd. It was difficult for a hundred 1st classes to win against a 2nd, and two hundred 2nd classes cannot handle a 3rd class. Of course, monsters like Yu IlHan are counted differently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Susanoo Army!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, we\u2019re alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the scale had become so big, just moving around made a huge cloud of dust. The monsters shrunk back after seeing the wave of humans charging at them, and the humans that looked at them rejoiced.</p><br/><p>Nerima district. This was the moment when they entered the 23 districts of Tokyo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis quite well off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered Yu Ilhan while looking at the stalemate that was there before he came. Tokyo, at the same time being the center of Japan, was also a few of the cities that were at the center of the world. The ones who knew the importance of Tokyo all focused their power on Tokyo, and the clans that just set foot from overseas were also using this situation to heighten their reputations.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the people of Kanagawa would be frustrated since they couldn\u2019t receive help, but for Tokyo, it was a fortunate thing.</p><br/><p>Currently, in Nerima district, Metal Knights from England was in the middle of fighting, and thanks to their bold actions that charged ahead with sturdy armor, the number of 1st class monsters were almost gone.</p><br/><p>Even the 2nd class monsters could not break through his defense so there was no need to say anymore about that. Even if Yu IlHan left them alone, this line wouldn\u2019t be broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk, master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kill it now! Double Cross!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kiyaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the line only wouldn\u2019t be broken, and it didn\u2019t mean that they could kill the 2nd class monsters. The core members of Metal Knights had high defense but relatively weak attack power.</p><br/><p>Then, it would be better if they cooperated with another clan, but due to their pride, this wasn\u2019t occurring yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will take care of him! You guys kill other monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut at this rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not block the glorious path of Metal Knights!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are they doing? Are they from the middle ages, and they came here through a time machine or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>[IlHan, do you think people of the past were all foolish and idiotic that wars occurred on Earth and nuclear weapons were made?](Lita)</p><br/><p>[Do you think it\u2019s just them?](Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know this, but Magia clan of Italy, who were acting in Kita district quite nearby were in the same situation.</p><br/><p>The Magia clan was made up of mages with high firepower, and all they lacked was defense, but thank to them saying that they didn\u2019t want to cooperate with other clans, they couldn\u2019t bring out their full power.</p><br/><p>Their choice was understandable since they must be worried that their reputation would not be so high if they cooperated with another clan, but thanks to their puny pride, they were late in restraining the monsters, and more sacrifices were occurring this way.</p><br/><p>Even though one may think that one wouldn\u2019t do such a foolish thing if one had a proper human head on one\u2019s neck, humans always committed actions comparable to dogs and pigs if they were tied by money and power.</p><br/><p>What they were doing now was exactly that; they would rather suffer more than do something for another.</p><br/><p>The Korean clan, Lightning God, was slightly better off, as their team was balanced in attack and defense, but as they were low on manpower, their rate was quite slow. Of course, they weren\u2019t cooperating with other clans either.</p><br/><p>No, actually, their situation was slightly different. This should be seen as them being isolated since other clans were afraid that the Lightning God clan\u2019s influence would increase if they did anymore.</p><br/><p>Summing up, they were all annoying bastards.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You see the situation now?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[You see what you need to do to, right?](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replying confidently, Yu IlHan held up the atlatl. He enhanced his physical body with superhuman strength, loaded the spear onto the hook, and threw it towards the monster that the strongest-looking guy of Metal Knights was blocking!</p><br/><p>[You have earned 673,837 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 69 Spike Ketura.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJ, just who did that to the monster our Metal Knights will be hunting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the members of Metal Knights were being shocked or not, Yu IlHan\u2019s throwing spear didn\u2019t end with just one. On the necks, heads, and hearts, of the 2nd class monsters that the Metal Knights were defending against, a throwing spear was embedded.</p><br/><p>One, two, three, and four all collapsed at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Susanoo? Don\u2019t joke with me! These monsters are our prey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Metal Knights got thoroughly enraged, but Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less; he just kept throwing his spears.</p><br/><p>He threw, and threw again. Until the moment when all the monsters that filled the battlefield were in his Cross Bag, he threw his spears.</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFucker! Do you think the world is yours since everyone calls you Susanoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will definitely find you! We will find you and kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether they were shouting or not, Yu IlHan just kept throwing his spears. The moment the last 2nd class monster lost its life, Yu IlHan muttered in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re doing something really good, but somehow, you look really evil.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s Yu IlHan\u2019s charm.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Since the monsters were all dead, Metal Knights lost their job.</p><br/><p>Both the clan members and the clan master were all rampaging around while saying that they would find Yu IlHan and kill him, but the person in question was leisurely moving to another area.</p><br/><p>The once-again-inflated Susanoo Army also followed Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Lord Susanoo. He does not know retreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! They look quite good, they were boasting about how they were sturdy until moments ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018lords\u2019 of the knights of steel should go home since they don\u2019t have anything to do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaggots, trying to gain fame by sacrificing people\u2019s lives? Gain a plane to go home, damn you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The insults to Metal Knights were a bonus. Unlike them, who were looking to gain reputation, the ones who were purely fighting to protect their homes had the qualifications to mock them.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were also some among the Japanese that seeked to gain fame, and tried to show off by finding a good location, and there were some amongst the foreign clans that were fighting hard to save lives, so that statement couldn\u2019t be generalized, but at least right now, Metal Knights deserved to be insulted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, we need to move. At this rate, we will become nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we should move. Let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his subordinate\u2019s words filled with worry, the leader of Metal Knights, Michael, Smithson, replied while gritting his teeth. If he really retreated now, then he would receive the mocks of the entire world.</p><br/><p>However, Tokyo and Chiba still had plenty of monsters left, and they still had a lot of opportunities.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move so that Susanoo and we don\u2019t go in the same direction. Also, look for a clan that wants to cooperate with us. At this rate, we cannot overcome him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. There\u2019s no helping it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGather many small scaled clans. We will make them gain glory by making them abandon their lives, and we will live and gain power. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smithson talked like a dog in human skin, but since the subordinate was also a son of a bitch, it didn\u2019t really matter. When the subordinates were moving to fulfill his orders, Michael Smithson muttered while gritting his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo, I will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Conquering the 23 districts of Tokyo in order, Yu IlHan met several cases like Metal Knights. Of course, he ardently threw his spears regardless of what they were doing, and got insulted a lot. Also, his level increased as a bonus.</p><br/><p>[You have become level 83. 1 Strength, 2 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, this level really doesn\u2019t increase much.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think you can talk if you levelled up 8 times in a single day.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re gaining the same amount of levels as what others do in an entire year, in a single day, that is](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t much. I haven\u2019t slept a lot either\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grumbled after listening to the angels\u2019 words and checked the Cross Bag, and confirmed that several tens of thousands of 2nd class monsters were inside it. He newly realized how many monsters he annihilated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why isn\u2019t this exploding?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We added a lot of space while we were at it. But please be careful when controlling the weight. You might lose a shoulder if you aren\u2019t careful.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[It looks like it will take days to finish dismantling them too.](Lita)</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way it would end with \u2018losing a shoulder\u2019 with the weight tens of thousands of monsters, right! Well, it looks like he had to give up attacking using the weight of the bag.</p><br/><p>If he used any, then it would be for striking down. Yes. If he applied weight at the moment he shot the pile bunker, wouldn\u2019t he be able to attack the enemy without pressure?</p><br/><p>Of course, this would require precise control. And this, was something that Yu IlHan was good at.</p><br/><p>[Such a frightening thought.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m satisfied since he reminds me of my younger days.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[It was you, Lita! You made him like this!](Erta)</p><br/><p>Seeing Erta grabbing Lita\u2019s collars and shaking it, Yu IlHan laughed. Of course, he only said it, but he didn\u2019t want to use a technique with a lot of consequences. To be exact, he didn\u2019t want there to come a situation where he would have to use this technique.</p><br/><p>However, as always, such situations happen without fail. And always faster than his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, this area is all cleaned up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems northwest area has a lot of monsters, let\u2019s go there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommence movement!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lightning God clan solidified their attacking tactics and grew along with their fame while cleaning up the monsters little by little, despite the restraining movements from other clans.</p><br/><p>The Clan Master, Kang MiRae, sucked on a bottle of mana potion that she had bought with a lot of money.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a more passionate fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRae\u2019s at it again! It\u2019s the \u2018crazy girl\u2019 mooode!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here, YuNa. I will show you what a real crazy girl is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae, a pervert who looked cold like an icy hell normally, but turned extremely aggressive in a fight, decided on Na YuNa as the next target, when a clan member called for Kang MiRae while tilting his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, something just fell down from the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did? A monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, theeeere. A strange cube like thing that has a strange ancient magic formation like thing written on it. Huh? There\u2019s another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><br/><p>That member could see 3 cubes falling down in an area not far away. Kang MiRae of course didn\u2019t know what it is, but Na YuNa\u2019s guardian angel, Feyta did.</p><br/><p>[Trap of Destruction\u2026\u2026](Feyta)</p><br/><p>Muttered Feyta dumbfoundedly after seeing that. Na YuNa asked back with a \u2018Hm?\u2019 but Feyta didn\u2019t reply to her and screamed.</p><br/><p>[E, everyone run away! Run away now! W, we need to leave this place now!](Feyta)</p><br/><p>However, it was already too late by then. The three Traps of Destructions that fell down almost simultaneously activated immediately, and an enormous amount of mana wave covered the group.</p><br/><p>All the monsters in that area could not win against that strong seduction.</p><br/><p>A strong vibration rung the ground as if a great earthquake was occurring. from the ground, from the sea, from the sky\u2026 all the monsters gathered.</p><br/><p>While all the humans were shocked at the sudden change in events, the greatest nightmare ended up erupting.</p><br/><p>In the middle of Tokyo city, which was covered up by a Dungeon Wave.</p><br/><p>An Overflow had occurred.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Angels are all professional stable lockers.

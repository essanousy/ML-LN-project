Meanwhile, Yu IlHan pulled Liera off him and sat down carefully so Yumir wouldn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world I went to, Lanpas, has an empire called Palladia, where I\u2019ve been to. Oh, thanks for the tea. It\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the country that succeeded the Magic Kingdom of Illta. As it is an extremely ability-centered country where meritocratic ideals are placed onto a pedestal, anyone can become the emperor as long as they are talented enough. It lead to all sorts of magic being developed to the extreme.\u201d</p><br/><p>She also mentioned that magic engineering was one of the fields that were relatively advanced; and that she was sure since she had found a few books about the basics of magic engineering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you really help me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became agitated after hearing that. Kang MiRae, while looking at him, felt that she had somehow calmed down and discovered that her fatigue from the long battle had dispersed a little. Truly befitting of a case of unrequited love.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to what debt I\u2019ve accrued until now, it\u2019s nothing much. Although it is currently impossible due to the situation on Earth, I\u2019ll look into it as soon as things clear up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yu IlHan was puffed up in expectation for his soon to be mobile fortress, Na YuNa, who didn\u2019t feel so good about the two looking at each other with such affectionate expressions, tapped on Kang MiRae and retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play around and work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae remembered why she was here to see Yu IlHan in the first place and returned the sidetracked conversation to the original topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this mana that\u2019s being emitted from this mansion? The reason that so many monsters gathered here was probably due to the mana\u2026\u2026 To think that mana formed a fog\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve never even heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be like this for quite a while. Until the mansion grows, it will be difficult to control all the mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Did you just say that the mansion \u2018grows\u2019, did I hear that correctly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae intuitively felt that she would be better off not prying any further.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, this man had wiped out an enormous number of monsters that gathered from all over the world during the past 20 days. Every time she thought she had gotten used to it, a new surprise would be sprung onto her, it was getting more and more tiring.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough there were no casualties, there was a lot of damage to the properties nearby thanks to this mansion attracting all sorts of monsters. Although it\u2019s a little funny for me to be saying this, there will definitely be people who complain about why you caused things to turn out this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s true. Should I give them compensation for the damages?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae smiled and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. Whether it\u2019s chasing monsters out or attracting them, countless people\u2019s lives were saved thanks to your mansion. It\u2019s nonsensical to put properties and human life on the same scale in the first place. I only wanted to say that you needn\u2019t care even if such people appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan once again felt that Kang MiRae was a truly good natured person. It was unbelievable that she had grown up under the delusional Kang Chan.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed that she didn\u2019t know that Yu IlHan would not have been bothered about such people in the first place. (PR:The damaged properties, not MiRae)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very fortunate thing in the viewpoint of protecting Earth. We could worry less about human casualties when monsters appeared here. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m worried about you, Mr. IlHan, as you will be exposed to monsters in the future\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fortress, I mean, this mansion has an auto-shooting function, so it will be alright. Normal 4th class monsters won\u2019t be killed, but it will be able to tie them down temporaryily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a meticulous fortress that relieved the worry from people\u2019s hearts. Kang MiRae decided to not talk about it anymore. Instead, Na YuNa tilted her head and interjected into the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I see it, Mr. IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan, did you kill a 4th class monster this time rouuuund?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, none appeared. And, it\u2019s Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s straaaange. We also didn\u2019t meet one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been dangerous if we did. No matter how strong we became, 4th classes are too hard without Mir. Moreover, Earth is only in the initial stages of the 2nd Great Cataclysm, why would there be 4th classes? There are very few 4th classes even in worlds after the 3rd Great Cataclysm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae chided Na YuNa, reminding her to not talk about such unlucky things, but Yu IlHan was able to infer that Na YuNa wanted to talk about something from her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeees.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t thought like that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how many monsters the Bittersweet Persona attracted, there was no way 4th classes would randomly charge here.</p><br/><p>However, if they didn\u2019t get caught by the Bittersweet Persona, it was very likely that they weren\u2019t caught by the Traps of Destruction, so if there were 4th classes born of this Great Cataclysm, it could be deduced that they had hid away from human eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if they \u2018just\u2019 hid themselves, that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you also think that there are 4th class monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we think about how Earth behaved until now, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monsters were a problem because they attacked humans as their prey. Even Ericia or Flemir would think it was natural that they were hunting humans for records if they had not been under Yu IlHan\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>It looked bad since Yu IlHan was in the shoes of humans, but originally, there was no \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018evil\u2019 about monsters\u2019 actions. It was the same as how humans raised and killed cows and pigs for meat. Likewise, humans could kill monsters for experience without any sense of guilt.</p><br/><p>However, if such monsters didn\u2019t appear in his eyes, and hid themselves because they hated to fight, he thought that there was no need to exterminate each and every one of them. Rather, it would be questionable if it could even be called a \u2018monster\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if they had another reason for hiding? A very bad reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>As such, Na YuNa\u2019s words sounded even more persuasive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Miss Na YuNa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk about it if you call me \u2018YuNa~\u2019 with overflowing love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was unpleasant to have met you until now, and let\u2019s not meet again. Good bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it! I\u2019ll say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa pouted and brought out her thoughts. From the scale of the monster hordes in this Great Cataclysm, there definitely should have been 4th class beings appearing, but as if this was all planned beforehand, there was not even much of a single one, and that was very suspicious.</p><br/><p>Precisely because it was now that people were being relieved after the monster wave had gone past, it was the time to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we have no evidence, it feels a little quirky to ignore it\u2026\u2026 why didn\u2019t you say anything until now?\u201d (MiRae)</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause currently on Earth, only Mr. IlHan can fight against 4th classes.\u201d (YuNa)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you were just overthinking things?\u201d (IlHan)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ll give you a kiss inst\u2026.. ouch!\u201d (YuNa)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan watched Kang MiRae and Na YuNa\u2019s affectionate skinship as he obediently drank tea. Meanwhile, Yumir woke up and clung to the girls alternately, so it seemed like Kang MiRae\u2019s anger had dispelled a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ignore her words, since she\u2019s an idiot.\u201d (MiRae)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take a look around. Although Miss Na YuNa\u2019s head seems like it\u2019s empty, there is a sharp point about her, like a small shard of glass in the endless beach.\u201d (IlHan)</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d (YuNa)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stood up with Mir hanging on him like a koala. If it was the him of before, he would have been scared stiff at such a mission, but with Ruin Calling, he would have found it easy even if it was a planet ten times that of Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you go around and find nothing, tell me. I\u2019ll kiss you!\u201d (YuNa)</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being embarrassed!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like Na YuNa still thought that Yu IlHan liked her.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae left with (well, if you can call putting her on the shoulders after electrifying her, \u2018with\u2019) Na YuNa, adding on that she would contact them soon. Yu IlHan put down Yumir who woke up and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I go too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back soon so rest a little more at home. If you become hungry, there\u2019s Jangjorim (meat simmered in soup) and rice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course Jangjorim referred to the one made with dragon meat. A homemade food containing Yu IlHan\u2019s consideration for Yumir! There were also sister products \u2013 boiled dragon ribs and dragon dumplings.</p><br/><p>He took Yumir to the bedroom and made Erta stay with him before leaving. The vast clearing of a garden, came into his view.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wow, how clean.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>The mansion grounds were cleaner than he had expected.</p><br/><p>Because all monster corpses disappeared? No way. It was because the mansion repaired itself by absorbing the remains and corpses of monsters.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was after he had collected the remains of monsters above level 150, it was a waste to give it to the Bittersweet Persona.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely intact, let\u2019s go now then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no way there are 4th class monsters though\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It wouldn\u2019t be surprising even if there were, Liera.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan flew up to the skies with the still disbelieving Liera, and Spiera who accepted reality. As Yu IlHan\u2019s flight speed became faster as he adapted more to the Ruin Calling, the angels also had to fly relatively quickly in order to not get left behind.</p><br/><p>[Should we really be able to find 4th class monsters like this?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s people or monsters, if they hid from others, then I have the confidence to find them. I think about things from their viewpoint\u2026\u2026 I have a lot of experience doing that, so I know very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I had no intention to attack IlHan\u2019s heart, but I stepped on a landmine again!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You can just call it the power of the concealment master.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>However, even though Yu IlHan had looked over every single place on Earth with the two angels, he couldn\u2019t find any 4th class monsters. This was including the Pacific where it had completely turned into a monster zone.</p><br/><p>Although he found some that had potential to grow into 4th classes soon, it was true that there were no 4th classes currently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut since there are so many monsters here, let\u2019s clean them up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the first time I see a human who can use the word \u2018first\u2019 when talking about cleaning up an entire country.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s assault came as disaster was wrought upon the monsters. The endless storm of dragon bone spears accompanied with flashes from the Black dragon whip!</p><br/><p>In fact, Yu IlHan kind of expected to see another vortex if a large number of monsters died, but it seemed that it wasn\u2019t something that generated just because one wished for it to appear, but there was ALSO a sign of the vortex when Yu IlHan cleaned up the monsters in about 2 hours.</p><br/><p>[Even though it\u2019s happening right in front of my eyes, I can\u2019t see through its mechanism!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Wouldn\u2019t it be a type of monster as expected? Even if we know everything else, we still do not know the mechanisms of monster appearances\u2026\u2026.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>While the higher existences were busy making hypotheses, Yu IlHan cleaned up the nearby monsters and approached the vortex. Liera asked while seeing that Yu IlHan was putting away the whip and was taking out his spear.</p><br/><p>[So, what are you going to do now? Although it was possible in the mansion since you had mana explosion, would it still be possible now?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI should try until it shatters. It\u2019s not like it will connect to another world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Declared Yu IlHan confidently and inserted mana into his weapon. Eternal Flame, purple flame and Blaze were fused into a white flame, following which he deployed the Spear of Untraceable trajectory while trying to imbue the power of a sword, whip and hammer into it at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHhhhhhhhp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s strike with all his power pierced through the vortex several times!</p><br/><p>However, as it was still insufficient compared to the time he attacked using the power of the fortress, he attacked several more times while bringing up all the strength he could muster\u2026\u2026 or so he was about to, when the vortex suddenly started to expand with a strange light!</p><br/><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, it\u2019s exploding!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, dodge!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Before the angels even warned him, Yu IlHan called out Aegis in front of his eyes to protect him. Although the vortex caused a grand explosion, it could not overcome Aegis.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan realized that there was no green text on his retina, and realized that he could not break the vortex alone, and was putting away his Aegis\u2026..</p><br/><p>When he was met with a gate that showed a frightening scenery inside.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>That sounds nice, dragon dumplings\u2026</p><br/><p>The reason Yu IlHan beat up(?) the vortex without the help of the fortress, was because there was no world connected to him. To speak of it, he fell into a tiny misunderstanding</p><br/>\n</div>"}

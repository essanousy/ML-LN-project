They killed so many monsters that the huge vortex of mana appeared a few more times after that.</p><br/><p>As such, Yu IlHan focused all the mana in the fortress to \u2018kill\u2019 the vortexes and let his subordinates take care of the 3rd class monsters, but despite that, the experience from the vortex was truly enormous and he achieved level 155 within two weeks.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had a short opinion of this phenomenon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019ve done well to build the fortress!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Whatever this guy makes, there will always come a time when he needs it\u2026.. it\u2019s so frustrating!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[From how it gives me experience, it means that it is an existence with a record, right? And it turns into a gate by inserting other people\u2019s mana\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s also not possible by just anyone. From the current standards of Earth, if it\u2019s not the highest rankers, no matter how much mana is inserted in any way, they would eventually disappear.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Even the angels couldn\u2019t give a clear answer to the identity of the vortexes. That was because Earth was the only world among countless worlds that caused such phenomena.</p><br/><p>Then, the only answer was the human Yu IlHan who was gaining its records, but like how the Akashic Record only put question marks all over, Yu IlHan also only felt \u2018I feel like I know it but I don\u2019t!\u2019 no matter how many vortexes he \u2018killed\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be a good guy? It obediently disappears without attacking, and it even give me experience!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s connecting gates to other worlds in other places. Well, it might be alright for you, IlHan, since you aren\u2019t connected to any other world.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Like what Liera said, confusion was arising on Earth due to the sudden appearance of portals leading to other worlds in various places on Earth.</p><br/><p>Although they were worlds where the people of Earth had lived in, and were different from Abandoned Worlds, they were still other worlds.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t all the schemes by the Army of Brilliant Light had to do with connecting Earth with other worlds? But now, they didn\u2019t have to do anything, and Earth would automatically connect with other worlds! Things would turn annoying according to how they enticed the people from those worlds.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s fortunate is that not only there are very few people who have enough mana to create gates, the gate also closes very soon unless additional mana is inserted.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Yeah, it\u2019s just one day. It\u2019s good that everyone was wary against that gate, if someone actually went over and the gate closed\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds really annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>They would be trapped on Earth until another vortex forms. People from other worlds would be annoyed, and people of Earth would also be put in a difficult position as well. There was no guarantee that there would be no riots.</p><br/><p>Of course, the reverse was possible as well. What if the gate closes after someone enters it from Earth? Well, of course, that person would be able to go over to the world he or she was connected to, but would not be able to come back to Earth. Moreover, if that happened several times\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[There is a possibility that all sorts of people will get mixed up on Earth!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that sounds tremendously annoying\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But could it be considered as fortunate? As they were busy researching into the gates connected to other worlds, for the last two weeks, everyone on Earth was in a busy situation. No matter where they went, monsters were present in large quantities!</p><br/><p>The people of other worlds also restrained themselves from coming to Earth because they vaguely knew of the harsh situation. Well, anyone with rational thinking would not bring disaster upon themselves by going over to another world filled with monsters. It was just the people related to the Army of Brilliant Light and the Destruction Demon Army that were crazy!</p><br/><p>Like that, Earth that was undergoing harsh times after the Great Cataclysm had even dragged other worlds in. This could be said to be a period of nightmare for everyone other than Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Then, to Yu IlHan? Of course, this was a period of exp boost and grinding.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish this would go on for one more month.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are fine controlling the fortress from inside, but the other guys are suffering outside, aren\u2019t they? They would swear at you if they heard you.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, there\u2019s another vortex.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYesss, let\u2019s do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Truly fortunately, when a few more messy days went past, people started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Tens of thousands of monsters had been reduced to just a few thousand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monster horde definitely did decrease.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, of course it would be like this after exterminating them in such a large scale!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I think your subordinates also leveled up by an average of 3.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>All sorts of monsters that could fill Earth more than once, were all cleaned up as well. Of course, this was excluding places like the islands in the Pacific, or Venezuela, which had met its downfall since the 1st Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>Even though people were noisy about protecting the territory of humans, the people of Earth had no choice but to give up on some places. The monsters that weren\u2019t entrapped by the dungeons gathered at areas outside human influence such as the seas, mountains, and countries that had long since fallen.</p><br/><p>Oh, this was about monsters that weren\u2019t influenced by Yu IlHan\u2019s Bittersweet Persona. If Yu IlHan had not created this fortress, the map of Earth would have changed drastically by now.</p><br/><p>[Considering the happenings in the past few days, didn\u2019t about 20% of the monsters that appeared in the 2nd Great Cataclysm die here?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Liera, measure the mana concentration 30 seconds away from here. If that place could be considered as instant coffee, this place is a cup of gourmet espresso.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>As there were way too many monsters that died within the mansion grounds, the mana in this place was near to physical manifestation and had formed a light fog.</p><br/><p>Due to the power of the artifact, Bittersweet Persona, the mana could not escape and as a result, the fog did not disperse, enveloping the mansion and its perimeter.</p><br/><p>The monsters appearing nearby would be attracted by the fog, and as such, they would contribute to the mana in the fortress. It seemed unlikely that such a state would change anytime soon.</p><br/><p>[Somehow this looks like a mansion from a horror game\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t mention games, this situation is horrifying enough.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>How could a horror game even compare to this mansion where beings entering without permission would die in the most horrifying ways. Moreover, as there were too much mana within the grounds, there would naturally be monsters born inside the grounds, although, the traps would activate and instantly kill them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it would look cooler if the fog was a little thicker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spoke nonsensically as he controlled the fortress to deliver a finisher attack to the decreased number of enemies, when Liera flapped her wings and stood up.</p><br/><p>[Then since things are settling down here, I\u2019ll visit Heaven. The quest to create Traps of Destruction ended so I need to give IlHan the rewards.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cCleaning up the confusion after the 2nd Great Cataclysm also counts as a quest, right? Don\u2019t forget to separate the rewards.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, of course. Well, then, in compensation, quickly lemme.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cEeei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera playfully replied and kissed his cheeks instead of exchanging goodbyes. Erta\u2019s eyebrows twitched after seeing that Yu IlHan obediently let her do so.</p><br/><p>[To think you made Yu IlHan accept skinship so naturally\u2026..!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Ufufufu.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera flashed a victor\u2019s grin at Erta before leaving. She, who had lost miserably, could only grit her teeth, but Yu IlHan only went back to controlling the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then\u2026 from now, let\u2019s focus on recovering the monster\u2019s bodies\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eeeeeek.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta was met with Yu IlHan\u2019s back as he stood up, and she felt really inclined to kick at it. However, Spiera only thought that she was playing along despite being a higher existence.</p><br/><p>When four or five more hours went past, the situation finally calmed down. The decreasing monsters reduced even more from a certain moment onwards, and in the end, the endless throes of monsters rushing towards Yu IlHan\u2019s mansion died down completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan fell into despair while looking at the empty scene in the monitor. Not to mention the giant vortex that connected gates to other worlds, there wasn\u2019t much of a single monster within the screen!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be level 160 if I just level up one more time!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t go around saying that, the others will die due to high blood pressure.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>After checking that the long battle had come to a complete finish, Yu IlHan immediately let his subordinates return. Such was the end to the enjoyable mansion defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you were amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mana explosion that wiped out the monsters was really\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t use that too often. Anyway, you guys have done well too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan even felt sorry after seeing their appearances. They had to fight for 20 days in a row without even being able to wash up. However, it was unknown why the elves boasted superior aesthetics even though they should be dirty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWash well and have a nice sleep. Thanks to you guys, we won\u2019t have to worry about monsters for quite a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, then please excuse myself to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMirey, let\u2019s wash together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone was given a room of their own, Mirey, Phiria, and Ericia found it difficult to rest properly alone, and slept together in one room, and this was the same with Pat\u00e9 and Jirl.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that they should all sleep together while at it, but accepted the outcome after remembering that Pat\u00e9 and Jirl were male.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yumir seemed to have longed for his dad after fighting hard for so long, as he changed into his pajamas after washing with Yu IlHan, before falling asleep in his arms. His body temperature was warm and felt good.</p><br/><p>Although he looked like a perfect 11 year old on the outside, he was still a baby on the inside, prompting Yu IlHan to let out a smile, however, he couldn\u2019t stay smiling forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already level 140. Wow, that\u2019s insanely fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s what you\u2019re unsatisfied about!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>As Yumir was the one with most action in the 2 years and 9 months in the Abandoned World with Kang MiRae, he levelled up the most as well. It was the same this time in the mansion defense, and decisively, it was possible to have such an insane speed of growth because eating dragon meat let his level increase.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought back to the mountains of dragon meat in his inventory, and realised that Yumir may actually reach 4th class faster than him.</p><br/><p>[Mr. IlHan, can we come in?] (MiRae)</p><br/><p>[Yaaay!] (YuNa)</p><br/><p>At that moment, guests arrived.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled after checking the guests through the monitor. It was none other than Kang MiRae and Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>They actually came to find him as soon as the monsters retreated? It seemed like they like Yumir so much \u2013 thought Yu IlHan (wrongly) as he controlled the mansion to let them in.</p><br/><p>However, the moment Yu IlHan entered the guest room, something flew in through the window like lightning.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m back!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Liera. As Yumir was sleeping in one of his arms, he raised his other arm when she \u2018dove\u2019 into his arms.</p><br/><p>[Receive the rewards! And receive me while at it!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heavy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after Yu IlHan barely managed to hold Liera while not waking Mir up, a hot aura was transferred from Liera to him, and green text covered his eyes.</p><br/><p>[Heaven\u2019s Quest, 07, 08 complete!]</p><br/><p>[All status increased by 20. Strength increased additionally by 10.]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the passive skill, Magic engineering. You are now able to bring out the power of an artifact more easily, and the success rate of mana crafting increases.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sat down, with Yumir in one arm, and Liera in the other. Then, he tilted his head after checking the skill he had just acquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to Bittersweet Persona, I\u2019m already at the peak of magic engineering?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s just practical stuff without the theory. You are no different from having made a semiconductor from just its appearance. Of course, that\u2019s very amazing, but magic engineering isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s a field of study and a skill that one has to learn if one wields magical languages and mana crafting. It\u2019s also a study that developed naturally across numerous worlds hundreds of years after a Great Cataclysm occurs.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how he thought about it, it sounded annoying, but if the performance of his artifacts increased by raising its skill level, then he couldn\u2019t ignore it either.</p><br/><p>There would be improvements in the combination of soul enchant and the artifact, it would definitely assist in completing the mobile fortress. And even to the equipments he had to stop on the design phase!</p><br/><p>Good, now that he thought like that, his motivation surged. Yu IlHan asked Liera with an expectant face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, how can I train in magic engineering? It wouldn\u2019t just end with repeating mana crafting, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, I don\u2019t know either.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have expected this from how confident sounding you were!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaak!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan moved his fingers on her waist to tickle her mercilessly. He never could have possibly imagined that it was the best reward Liera could get!</p><br/><p>[Ugh, even I only know the basics of magic engineering\u2026..!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Are you frustrated because you cannot teach Yu IlHan magic engineering, or because you cannot take Liera\u2019s place\u2026..?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Erta only watched the scene in frustration, and Spiera looked at her with narrowed eyes. Yumir was sleeping soundly as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Mr. IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>And now, the forgotten guests were standing outside the guest room with eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. The door was wide open so I entered when I could hear some people speaking\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you employ me as a maid hereee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need one. And so\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just as when Yu IlHan was in a difficult situation, pondering about how to get out of this situation, Kang MiRae blurted out something completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic engineering\u2026\u2026 is quite well-developed in the world I went to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>A savior had arrived.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Nice EXP gain.</p><br/><p>Feels like a new quest.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>There seems to be a misconception that \u2018destroying vortices\u2019 = \u2018destroying worlds\u2019. NO, destroying vortices does NOT equal to destroying worlds. The explosions that happen at the end of the vortex generation is what causes the gateways to connect (I think so, anyway). NO WORLD IS HARMED DURING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VORTEX. (But I don\u2019t know what explains the massive EXP gain. Perhaps it\u2019s because the Akashic Record is bugging out)</p><br/><p>Hello, hello. It\u2019s Chamber posting today. This is a sponsored chapter! Thanks to all the sponsors!</p><br/><p>And I\u2019m always accepting sponsors! I have like, what, 10 stockpiled chapters at your disposal.

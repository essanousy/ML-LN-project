The Lightning God Clan realized that the environment was changing as they were leaving, and witnessed tens of thousands of 2nd class, and hundreds of 3rd class divided into two sides and fighting each other.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our concern if they fight amongst themselves\u2026\u2026. but any sign of intelligent species?\u201d</p><br/><p>[None from what they saw. That\u2019s natural. Dareu was the exception, God does not abandon any world.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>If Destruction Demon Army and the Garden of Sunset did not interfere with Dareu, it wouldn\u2019t have been abandoned, or so Erta said. After that, she talked about how God\u2019s hand will be extended to Dareu once again, but why did it sound like locking the stable after the horse was stolen\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Lightning God just escaped after looking at the battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, in a hurry too. Moreover, when their retreat was found out, and the Dungeon Break was pulled forward. There was no way that would have happened if they mastered concealment!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you advertise like that, there\u2019s no shop that sells concealment skills at $39.99\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan Sighed. He did think that there shouldn\u2019t have been a proper scouting, but never did he imagine that what they found out was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><br/><p>Lightning God seemed to be thinking that an Abandoned World was just a little bigger dungeon, but Yu IlHan knew the truth very well after the incident in Dareu; how horrifying of a scale an army could develop into within a world ruled by monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have just remained in their own damned world, why did it just happen to get connected with Earth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Heaven had judged that this would not be the end of it. There are even predictions that this is just the prelude to a big change\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Sighed Yu IlHan again when Erta added hurriedly in consolation.</p><br/><p>[If there\u2019s anything fortunate, it\u2019s that unlike Dareu, that world was doomed after the 2nd Great Cataclysm. So, it is likely that there\u2019s no 4th class monster in that world.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut a 4th class monster appeared on Earth even though Earth had gone through the 1st Great Cataclysm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta was tongue tied. Although it was a scheme of a traitor, it was still the truth. Yu IlHan continued speaking while fiddling around with the bone atlatl in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different from Dareu. I don\u2019t have much confidence in going against 4th class beings that aren\u2019t dragonkin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eight-tailed dragon spear did definitely become an epic rank. However, that high rank could not be used properly if he wasn\u2019t going against dragonkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour\u2026\u2026 No, five. It will be different according to the enemy, but that will be my limit. If any of them are over 230 in level, then I can\u2019t do anything either.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s plenty amazing.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI only wish that that world isn\u2019t like Dareu.\u201d</p><br/><p>His abilities would increase by 10% if fighting alongside Yumir due to the effect of Dragon-man resonance, but he couldn\u2019t bring a level 1 kid in a dangerous place like this.</p><br/><p>Thought Yu IlHan as he turned his head around, when he saw Liera with a blooming smile on her face and Yumir in her arms. Despite there being plenty of people stronger than him right now, he was concealed.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more amazing was that no one was able to see through this newborn\u2019s concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir realized it was him even though he had a helmet on as he jumped from Liera\u2019s arms into his. Clang, a metallic sound resounded out, but Yumir was still smiling as if not in pain.</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan glared at Liera silently, she excused herself in panic.</p><br/><p>[He said he wanted to see his dad! He looked like he might leave on his own!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, how can you bring a kid to a place where it wouldn\u2019t be strange even if a 4th class\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s skill, Concealment, grows rapidly.]</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s skill, Concealment, has become level 20. The resonance with the rider increases and can use a stronger level of concealment.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stopped speaking and sighed after reading the information on his retina. It seemed like Yumir\u2019s concealment was being lead to further heights as he became able to use a higher level of concealment while near him.</p><br/><p>This is completely OP! Or so Yu IlHan wanted to shout, but thinking back, his concealment was level max the moment he saw the status for the first time. He had no qualifications to say someone else was OP.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, just master it quickly. Let\u2019s earn a higher skill too, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who answered while not knowing anything with a smile, fiddled around to find a comfortable position. Of course, concealment skill level was still increasing.</p><br/><p>There were countless people and even more countless monsters around. Concealing in their midst, there was no way concealment wouldn\u2019t rise in level.</p><br/><p>[The power of bloodline is amazing\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while retorting, Yu IlHan was inwardly nodding his head. At this speed, he wondered if the skill will rise to level 50 by the end of battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s just think of it as skill grinding. Well, he\u2019ll be safe with me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s quite a positive attitude, I like it.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Even while grumbling, Yu IlHan repositioned Yumir in his arms. However, just as Yumir was staring at the countless 2nd class monsters pouring out from the gate, he asked Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, can I hunt them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a suggestion he never thought about. Since Yumir\u2019s level was still 1, he was planning to level him up slowly with goblins or slimes in a weaker dungeon.</p><br/><p>Yes, wasn\u2019t he too na\u00efve? Dragons hunting goblins lol. He had a higher ranked skill from birth!</p><br/><p>Wait, no, he\u2019s still level 1.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer by himself, Yu IlHan seeked the answer from Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many hits would it require to kill a 2nd class monster with middle-tier magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>[What that Empress over there is using is also middle-tier magic. If the caster\u2019s level and mana is enough, then of course it\u2019s instakill\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me dragons have middle-tier magic from birth?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cGooooood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Skill grinding location changed into levelling location.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, if you can\u2019t kill them instantly with your magic, then they will all die while crashing into the fence, so you have to kill them instantly. Or, you have to wound them fatally at least in order to get the MVP position.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t reserve your mana. It\u2019ll recover when you level up anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s prepare then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lightly grabbed Yumir\u2019s left hand and lifted him up. Yumir extended his index finger of his left hand that was grabbed by Yu IlHan, before gathering mana and changing it to wind magic. 1</p><br/><p>As expected of a dragon? Compared to humans, the ripple of mana, and the speed of magic completion was overwhelmingly superior. A fragment of 4th class dragon\u2019s magic he had tasted so much in Dareu was here.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you level up, you need to conceal yourself quickly like dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the wind on Yumir\u2019s fingertips got thick enough to take form, a 2nd class monster just came out from the gate.</p><br/><p>Now! When Yu IlHan lightly inserted strength into his hand grabbing Yumir, he immediately shot the wind bullet. A hole appeared on the monster\u2019s head, and it collapsed like that.</p><br/><p>It happened in a blink of an eye, and that monster wasn\u2019t the only one rushing out of the gate, so not to mention people, even monsters didn\u2019t notice it. The problem was what happened next.</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s level became 17.]</p><br/><p>[Yumir evolves into an Infant Dragon.]</p><br/><p>Blinding light was emitted from Yumir\u2019s now-unconcealed body. It wasn\u2019t something like a level up, but an evolution!</p><br/><p>The amount of light was overwhelming to the point that even monsters looked towards his direction, but the amount of light was too overwhelming so no one could see what was happening inside.</p><br/><p>And when the light disappeared, there was nothing there. The people were very surprised, but they weren\u2019t in a situation where they could calmly analyze things. Some just thought that Susanoo did something and some thought that people use the wrong magic.</p><br/><p>The answer was that Yu IlHan used the large amount of light to conceal themselves again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling that he was getting stronger, Yumir rejoiced while clapping. Thanks to the evolution, Yumir, who had a 2 year-old-looking body now had a body around 4 to 5 year-old, and the clothes he was wearing was instantly ripped to shreds as well.</p><br/><p>[So acquiring class makes their body grows as well. Dragons are quite the creatures of wonder.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Mmmmm, he was cuter before, but he\u2019s still cute now!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou recovered all your mana, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s overflowing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir\u2019s mana was indeed overflowing. The mana he couldn\u2019t hold within himself was covering his skin and he prevented it from escaping. This was a dragon\u2019s mana rule! It was an amazing ability.</p><br/><p>Mana recovered when level 1 becomes level 2, when 2 becomes 3, when 3 becomes 4\u2026\u2026. Like that, he had preserved all the mana that had replenished itself until level 17.</p><br/><p>Even while going through evolution!</p><br/><p>[Amazing technique. When I could do that, I had long since escaped the level where I could level up continuously like that\u2026\u2026.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I still can\u2019t do that. So continuous level ups had such a function!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no function like that. That\u2019s a cheat.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Obviously, Yu IlHan also couldn\u2019t do something monstrous like that. No matter how he became able to wield mana, this was something entirely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a lot of mana, can I use all of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I want to kill that next!\u201d</p><br/><p>The target Yumir pointed to was a wolf monster that just charged out of the gate. Yu IlHan saw through its level instantl.</p><br/><p>That, was a 3rd class. One that had a level over 110.</p><br/><p>In this place, excluding Yu IlHan, only the clan masters of the Front Line Alliance would be able to kill it on a 1 vs 1 fight. And they would need the higher ranked weapons that Yu IlHan had sold.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, you\u2019re still 1st class\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who\u2019s talking about who here?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Spoke Yu IlHan in worry, but he could only close his mouth at Erta\u2019s remark. Thinking back, he did indeed kill a 3rd class monster when he was still 1st class! Was it just that? There was a time the had to instakill 3rd class monsters for his 2nd class advancement quest,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can kill it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think much of it when it was himself in the scene, but how could he think so differently when it came to Yumir\u2026 Yu IlHan finally realized that he was a freak. Compared to what he did until now, his realization came too late.</p><br/><p>Liera spoke while looking at the two with loving eyes.</p><br/><p>[How can the father and son be so similar.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say what my mom used to say many times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both the father and son couldn\u2019t be happy when hearing that line! Yu IlHan fueled that rage into his hand and lightly grabbed Yumir\u2019s hand again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mir. Let\u2019s kill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir gathered the mana that was boiling inside his body, and the mana that was circling around it onto his index fingertip again.</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s skill, Concealment, has become level 30. The skill\u2019s power becomes stronger due to the increase in the resonance between the rider.]</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s skill, Mana rule, has become level 17.]</p><br/><p>Keeping concealment while gathering mana into one place let the skill proficiency rise like mad. Even after considering that, the growth of the skill was too fast. As expected of the talent of the son of the pancosmic loner. Shit.</p><br/><p>Sweating hard, Yumir condensed the mana. Perhaps because it wasn\u2019t just the mana he possessed, the bullet that took a longer time to form than last time had become a magic bullet that was worth waiting for to form.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, Mir. Let\u2019s just leave that guy from last time, and go with another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA stronger one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA stronger one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guy that Yumir pointed to last time had already charged against the lightning fence and was being weakened due to various attacks. Yu IlHan instead pointed towards a black wolf that looked like it would be easily over level 120.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir flicked his finger and shot the bullet.</p><br/><p>The bullet pierced through its head as if it were natural, and entered the gate as it seemed like it still had remaining power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The father and son tilted their heads simultaneously. Anyway, since the wolf died instantly, Yumir\u2019s concealment wore off once again along with an explosive level up, and Yu IlHan had to leap upwards in order to conceal themselves again.</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s has become level 31.]</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s skill, Mana rule, has become level 20. He can now steal insignificant amount of mana from another person\u2019s magic.]</p><br/><p>Yumir laughed in rejoiced and clapped. Tens of mana crystals formed and floated around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got loads of mana again!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yumir\u2019s magic stat increased considerably at each level up, the overlapped mana was headache-inducing. Yu IlHan thought in expectation that he might be able to get his son to go through the 2nd class advancement today.</p><br/><p>However, his expectations had to die down. The moment Yu IlHan and Yumir landed on the ground, a black-haired man with frightening aura rushed out from the gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man? He isn\u2019t human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the man that clearly looked like a 4th class, the humans finally thought that what should come had come as they gritted their teeth, Yu IlHan raised his hand to activate what he had prepared, and Yumir seemed to think that that guy was impossible for him and activated concealment to its limits while trying to dig into Yu IlHan\u2019s embrace but was blocked by the armor.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease forgive us for not recognizing your almighty existence as a dragon, and please help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Spitting out words that only Yu IlHan could understand, the man immediately kneeled and bashed his head on the ground.</p><br/><p>The situation was going in a direction that nobody had expected.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Mir is a genius! He does take after his dad, hahahaha!</p><br/><p>Even though dad and son being similar definitely isn\u2019t an insult, mothers always pick out the worst parts of the two\u2026 They probably have a lot of good points in common too! Probably!</p><br/><p>Insane senses that recognized a dragon even though it was a mere wind bullet! It\u2019s not really a bait. He just has good senses!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>How to become OP</p><br/><p>1. OP Gear</p><br/><p>2. OP stats.</p><br/><p>3.

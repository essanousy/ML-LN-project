These guys acted so secretively that it was safe to say that no other factious would invade it, but they had to prepare for the what-if scenario.</p><br/><p>Of course, if it actually happened, defending themselves successfully was a completely different story.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m done calibrating the mirrors.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to take out at least half.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry about it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Roger that!]</p><br/><p>One thousand concealed mirrors spread out from the Flying fortress to cover the skies, before all of them spat out strong rays of energy. Since the Flying fortress had become Eternal-ranked, Thousand Eyes had also rose in league as well; and by now, just that volley of attacks took the lives of hundreds of higher existences residing in that world.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan saw the pouring text of experience points and nonchalantly raised a hand in the air. The ones waiting in the two fortresses all prepared for battle.</p><br/><p>Although they were all merely 4th classes, all of their equipment was at least of the epic rank. Equipment made by the mighty creator Yu IlHan were all treasures that would cause a stir with a single fragment should they appear in any of the other worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to back them up so that no one dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t prepared for that much, he wouldn\u2019t have come here.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, the stage is ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was time to show them how scary a doll on the stage can possibly be.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand lowered. The two fortresses drove forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Leytnaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Na YuNa\u2019s shout, the holy region in the two fortresses expanded and covered the skies. The members inside all received a boost in power, and ambushed the enemies with glistening eyes.</p><br/><p>[What, how did they!?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Lower existences?]</p><br/><p>Communication was not necessary in war. Yu IlHan controlled the artifacts within the two fortresses along with Mystic to prevent the higher existences from casting magic, and restrained their movements. This was a war to weaken each of the factions, but at the same time, it also served to strengthen his allies. The less he acted, the better.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe killed one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 but!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kahk!?]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the enemies had lowered their guard. It was because the army under Yu IlHan was too overwhelming. Even though they were higher existences, and the world was their home territory, they were being pushed back in terms of pure militaristic might.</p><br/><p>[How\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>While their allies died in vain, someone questioned.</p><br/><p>[Why are you not restrained by the world!]</p><br/><p>In a world ruled by the Garden of Sunset, the ones not belonging to their faction should normally be restrained in their abilities. This was even more so for lower existences.</p><br/><p>[How did a path open to Louisa!? Did a ruler-class step it up!]</p><br/><p>[Our powers are not working. Like this, are we really the ones ruling this world!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to answer, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the problem for them was that all lower existences here was a part of Yu IlHan\u2019s fleet, and they shared the effects of the Dimensional Traveler. Just with that, they could completely ignore the penalty the world imposed on them.</p><br/><p>[This doesn\u2019t even make sense, this is\u2026\u2026Kahk!]</p><br/><p>This world was vast and the gatekeepers were spread out. However, the two fortresses had the ability to cover such a distance in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The two fortresses with battle forces in them appeared and disappeared from various places over the world with Yu IlHan\u2019s Warp ability, and by then, the 5th class beings had given up on tracing them.</p><br/><p>[We cannot confront them with our power.]</p><br/><p>[Reinforcements? When are they coming?]</p><br/><p>[But right now, reinforcements are\u2026\u2026 no.]</p><br/><p>[Tch!]</p><br/><p>The gatekeeper stopped his sentence midway. Immediately after that, Orochi\u2019s claws shot across the air and burst his heart.</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re going to talk, do it until the end. There are many annoying guys like master here.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hear you, Orochi. Move your arse if you have the time to complain.]</p><br/><p>[At least you don\u2019t deny it. Got it. I\u2019ll rampage to my heart\u2019s content.]</p><br/><p>Orochi gripped and loosened his fist several times as if he felt that practical battle wasn\u2019t so bad, and launched himself at an enemy with a faint smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Although the league of Orochi\u2019s soul was low, now that he was moving under the effects of Na YuNa\u2019s blessing, he would be almost impossible to injure if he managed to bring out just 30% of Echjar\u2019s bodily ability.</p><br/><p>[Reinforcements? They can\u2019t come here that early.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na, who scanned the battlefield while leaning against Yu IlHan, giggled and muttered.</p><br/><p>[By now, they should be busy having a battle in another world, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you go protect the others too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It was you who put me by your side saying the others won\u2019t be able to grow properly if I stepped out.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t have to act, and I never asked you to stay by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan coldly replied and shook his hand. A few mirrors shot out according to his gesture, and absorbed the magic that the gatekeepers casted to protect the allies. The enemies abruptly widened their eyes at the sight of that, and ended up losing their lives to the Dragon\u2019s army children.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, we\u2019re becoming stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaar! You can become even more stronger!]</p><br/><p>Similar to Yumir, the children worshipped power. They were in sync with each other, and had the most achievements in this battlefield. Of course, Yumir, the one leading them, was doing the majority of the work, though.</p><br/><p>[W, we need to run.]</p><br/><p>[But if we abandon and leave Louisa\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Even so, we need to survive to, Kuhak!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s time magic slowed them down, and Erta, Kang MiRae, and Carina Malatesta attacked with magic to kill him. Executing runaways was their job. The distribution of roles within their group was perfect!</p><br/><p>[The enemy\u2019s boss is in that castle.]</p><br/><p>[Castle\u2026\u2026 Is that really a castle?]</p><br/><p>[Answer me. For what are you committing this criminal act! Do you not fear he who is omnipresent!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not too late! Identify yourselves and submit to the Garden of Sunset!]</p><br/><p>At first, they tried to take care of it by themselves, then they realized that that wouldn\u2019t do and tried to call for reinforcements, but didn\u2019t work and tried to run, and now that even escaping failed, they begged and threatened them with their superiors. Higher existences who lived for thousands of years didn\u2019t act that much different from any human.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t even funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan stretched his fingers out with a giggle. The Thousand Eyes that scattered throughout various places of Louisa were all summoned to one place and formed a gigantic mirror. The survivors realized what he was going to do and were all frozen stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s a human that gave up on life just because they\u2019re afraid of someone that they don\u2019t even know when it would arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling, so cool. So selfish and evil!]</p><br/><p>Humans always struggle: to survive, to live, and to carry one living. The current Yu IlHan was the result of that. Of course, he did not plan to justify himself as being fair. He did not plan to blame the enemies for being bad.</p><br/><p>Only, the victor survives.</p><br/><p>[I will!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan muttered playfully like that, the gigantic mirror shot out a super high-density energy beam.</p><br/><p>[Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>Just from when was it there? There was a huge gate that opened in the middle of the atmosphere in Louisa. Beyond it were the figures of the reinforcements from the Garden of Sunset that came to the rescue, albeit a little late. The energy beam was directed at them without a single inch of deviation!</p><br/><p>[How\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>What was there to hide. Yu IlHan had read the movements of the entrants that entered the world through his power as a Dimensional Traveler, and shot them down the exact moment they entered!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>The reinforcements numbered thousands. This was because they knew how much impact stealing a higher world could have. Of course, there were quite a few 6th class gatekeepers among them as well, but there was no way of knowing how many were stationed here since they all died.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Record, has become level 84.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shook his head to erase all of the text that busily appeared on his eyes. Then, he could see the gatekeepers that were despairing.</p><br/><p>[How, can this\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[This is a nightmare\u2026\u2026 they are deceiving us! Higher existences, it\u2019s the Heaven\u2019s Army!]</p><br/><p>They became powerless in front of the scene where all reinforcements died the moment they arrived. This was a scene that could only be seen in the main headquarters of each faction. It also seemed like it was a little too strong, and even some of his allies were out of it for a moment. Even Heli\u00e8na had to ask Yu IlHan for confirmation with a dumbfounded face.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t attack like that all the time, right, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Not to mention the mana in the world, I had to suck up the mana from the dead higher existences to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stealing the power of the world and even destroying the members with it. That\u2019s the perfect invasion tactic\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The ones making up the Garden of Sunset had more various records compared to other factions, so it helped out a lot in the growth of his Record skill.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan judged that he had acquired everything he could from this world and shook his hand. The gigantic mirror split into a thousand (and four) mirrors, scattering across the world, and the gatekeepers ended up reacting a little too late because they were focused on that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Attack now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ordered coldly. His allies came to themselves and attacked. It didn\u2019t take that long for the enemies to be wiped out.</p><br/><p>[You have killed all the members in a higher world belonging to the Garden of Sunset. The skill, Dimensional ruler, has become level 64. You have acquired the ruling rights to this world.]</p><br/><p>[You are lacking several conditions to perfectly rule a world. Only when you fulfill all the criteria can you perfectly acquire the world. Be warned as until then, the world may easily be stolen back.]</p><br/><p>Some text that was within Yu IlHan\u2019s expectations filled his retina. He read that carefully and nodded. So Dimensional Traveler was one of the keys to becoming a higher existence after all.</p><br/><p>Now that he had come this far, there was no more need to hesitate. He would only fulfill the all the remaining conditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t reinforcements come again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they do. I\u2019ll need to clean it up later anyway. Well, then. Everyone get into battle formation. You\u2019ve all levelled up and don\u2019t need any rest, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Going against higher existences was a gamble that required one to put their life on the line. If they failed, they would die, but if they succeed, they would grow for sure.</p><br/><p>In truth, all the members making up the fleet had experienced huge level ups thanks to fighting against higher existences so they couldn\u2019t retort that much. There were some that didn\u2019t get an increase in level, but that meant that that one didn\u2019t do much in this battle and could not retort either.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll depart right away. Next is the Destruction Demon Army.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Is it because you still hate me, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because they\u2019re the easiest after the Garden of Sunset.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s attitude was as ever. Heli\u00e8na ended up bursting out into laughter at his nonchalant attitude. He snorted and activated Warp.</p><br/><p>The war had just begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

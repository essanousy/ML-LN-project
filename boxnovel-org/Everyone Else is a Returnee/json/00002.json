He had thought that he need to prepare for whatever he could since he didn\u2019t know when humanity would come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cVale Tudo and spearmanship are still sloppy. Actually, it\u2019s better for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Such a strange human\u2026\u2026.!]</p><br/><p>Even while receiving Rita\u2019s strage gazes, Yu IlHan immersed himself again in training. Rita provided all 3 meals for him anyway so he only needed to think about the martial arts that he needed to learn.</p><br/><p>And like that, 5 years and 10 years passed. It was the moment after 20 years had passed since he was left out.</p><br/><p>Now, his punches and kicks flowed with fighting spirit that can even kill a bear, much less a human, and the wooden spear he extended powerfully not only pierced the sandbag, but it shattered it. Yu IlHan himself thought that he had no talent in regards to martial arts, but growing up like this in just 15 years was amazing. Of course, it was also because Rita, who was a great fighting partner, was there for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning 40 soon. How is it? Do I look more mature?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The only thing you did was punching and stabbing with the spear. Do you think you earned anything other than enlightenment in martial arts? Did you see anyone acting their age after coming out from training in the mountains?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think so too? My mom won\u2019t tell me I\u2019m pretending to be mature, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry about it and keep training.]</p><br/><p>From this point, Rita, who came once a week, came once in 3 days. It was because she was worried that Yu IlHan might go crazy after being alone in the huge prison known as Earth for no less than 20 years.</p><br/><p>Whether it was due to her worry and interest or due to his innate personality, Yu IlHan endured well.</p><br/><p>He endured for 20, 30 years.</p><br/><p>[Just how much did it deviate!]</p><br/><p>While looking at such Yu IlHan, it was instead Rita who was nervous to the point of shouting. However, Rita\u2019s position wasn\u2019t actually that high so she wasn\u2019t in a position to ask God directly, and she didn\u2019t have the rights to reverse the time axis so she could only restlessly watch Yu IlHan training his body quietly, day by day.</p><br/><p>\u201cRita.\u201d</p><br/><p>One day, Yu IlHan said with a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember my mom\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when I look at the picture, it feels unfamiliar. Was this person really my family? Wasn\u2019t I living here alone in the first place? Everything was my deulsion and it is a lie that Rita made in order to console me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t say such things!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it was a joke. It might be good if it was actually like that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sighed and took back the spear. It was the time after 50 years of being left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fed up. I want to do something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m sorry to say this now but\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not known when the Great Cataclysm will occur. You cannot neglect your martial arts.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that they had shared several tens of years together, racial matters such as being an angel or being a human didn\u2019t really matter. The important thing to Yu IlHan was a person to look after him and a person who would listen to him. And Rita took that place so he followed Rita. That was enough.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was also the only human that Rita came into contact with for several tens of years, so she became to harbor feelings of more than just pity and compassion for the human known as Yu IlHan. Of course, she didn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s strange relationship which occurred due to God\u2019s error, was progressing in a truly marvelous direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll read some books.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good idea.]</p><br/><p>Martial arts would become important after the Great Cataclysm occurs, but reading helps widening one\u2019s reasoning and building the foundation for one\u2019s actions. It would help but it wouldn\u2019t harm.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who acted too fast that it may seem excessive after setting his mind on something, he shut himself inside the college library straight away. As he promised with Rita, he trained Vale Tudo and spearmanship for 3 hours a day, but he invested the rest of the time solely on reading.</p><br/><p>Even the most well preserved books would change colors after several tens of years passed, but \u2018thanks\u2019 to the \u2018stopped time\u2019, objects didn\u2019t get affected by time. It was a good thing for Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>His preferences leaned towards contemporary novels, but he got fed up after reading those for about 5 years and he moved onto others. While thinking that his ordinary college life might continue after the Great Cataclysm occurs, he first studied books related to his major which was management, and when he was also about to get fed up with it, he considered plural majors and read psychology or other humanities-related books.</p><br/><p>Unlike martial arts where the progress becomes less noticeable after a certain point, reading piles up knowledge. Yu IlHan, who was now hooked to that spread his interests to other books inside the library. Common knowledge, history, geography, calssics, physics, chemistry, art \u2013 he read every single books existing in the library.</p><br/><p>After a few years passed, the books inside the libraries were insufficient. There was no one guarding bookstores anway, so Yu IlHan started conquering the book stores within his walking range in search for books that weren\u2019t in the library.</p><br/><p>However, even this had a limit. On his 67th year of being left behind (Of course, Yu Ilhan no longer counted time), he made a big decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s learn another language.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then let\u2019s just change locations. I can deliver your meals wherever it is.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is that food coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Secret.]</p><br/><p>While pondering whether to cross the seas or not, he moved locations to China, the closet country. While driving any car to drive until he was out of fuel, when he found a working petrol station, he would refuel, and if not, he would just change cars.</p><br/><p>License? There was only Yu IlHan in this world so it was okay as long as the car he drove didn\u2019t fall off a cliff or explode after crashing.</p><br/><p>Even while moving, he studied Chinese in his spare time. The language studies made him sick after studying even a little became doable due to reading books for several tens of years.</p><br/><p>And the China he arrived at somehow was too wide. And there were of course, many texts.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mistake to set China as the first stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan screamed in joy at the fact that there were so much new knowledge. Humanity will definitely come back before I get to know all the knowledge of China \u2013 at that fact, he even felt sorry for that.</p><br/><p>However, that was his misunderstanding. Even after adventuring all of the wide lands of China, and studied every book in China, humanity still didn\u2019t come back. Yu IlHan no longer asked Rita how much time passed and Rita also didn\u2019t speak of it.</p><br/><p>He calmly moved to another country. It was because he felt that he might go crazy if he didn\u2019t get new stimulation, no matter what it was.</p><br/><p>Kazakhstan, Uzebkistan, Pakistan, India, Mongolia\u2026\u2026 After learning every language on Asia, he read all the books, records and even internet logs of all those countries. As if he would die if he didn\u2019t read something, he read and read again.</p><br/><p>Once, he forgot the iron rule of training martial arts for 3 hours a day and was close to getting beaten up by Rita.</p><br/><p>[Are you really alright?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his head. The last page of the last book of the 7.5 million books inside the Russian academy of sciences was revealing itself.</p><br/><p>Even though it was 7.5 million books, there were many books that also existed in other libraries, and to Yu IlHan, who could now read any book in a short time regardless of thickness due to reading repeatedly for countless years, it wasn\u2019t that hard of a task.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, I can\u2019t understand technical books even after reading them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan saw through the limits of this brain. It seemed that he wasn\u2019t a person who was fit for sciences. He only read because there was text, and just reading the book didn\u2019t make him a professional in that area.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s go to Europe.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re speaking in Russian right now, you know?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHyv\u00e4\u00e4!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Okay, we can go to Finland.]</p><br/><p>When he toured Europe, middle east, and even Africa, his vocabulary became rich.</p><br/><p>It was the 216th year after he was left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s just Oceania and America left!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cheered like a middle schooler who just checked that there was little summer homework left. At his unchanging tension even though he had lived for over 200 years, Rita made a bitter smile and asked back.</p><br/><p>[You do know that you have to go by boat, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. There are many boats without owners in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s called stealing.]</p><br/><p>The power of time was truly amazing. It had made a clueless college student in to an all powerful adventurer. Of course, there was no need to say twice since one human was given more time than a human lifespan, but Yu IlHan kept moving without rest as if he wouold die the moment he stops.</p><br/><p>Using all the knowledge of Geography, he set the sailing distance to the minimum, and he looked for a boat which could hold out for that distance. In the countless books he read until now, there were many specialized books related to ships, so there wasn\u2019t any difficulty finding a sturdy and a fueled boat, and driving it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRita, humanity didn\u2019t die out by any chance, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I said there was a deviation in the time axis. I was a fool for thinking it\u2019s just twice or three times. It seems that it\u2019s at least 10 times.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow exciting.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished preparing for the voyage, Yu IlHan unhesitatingly left the land he was on. As long as Oceania and America waited for him, there was no time for leisure.</p><br/><p>And several tens of years passed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI finiiiiiiiiiiiiished!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Such a nasty guy.]</p><br/><p>While looking at Yu Ilhan who was shouting and rolling around on top of the table inside Boston Public Library, known for being one of the biggest in America, Rita muttered with a</p><br/><p>fed up voice.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally had conquered all the available books revealed to humanity. Even though she had watched the whole process with her own eyes, it was an unbelievable achievement.</p><br/><p>After he left the library, sat down on a bench on the street and looked at the sky blankly for a while, Yu IlHan muttered while tilting his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Martial Arts?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done that until now too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t only read books while touring around the world. He went to various ruins which remained in some parts of the world, he found traces of martial arts and he kept revising various shortcomings in Vale Tudo and spearmanship. Training was 3 hours at the minimum and sometimes it would go over 8 hours, and 12 hours.</p><br/><p>His fighting arts and weapon arts which transformed to the point that he couldn\u2019t find the original style, was developed into a practical and high level technique to the point that Rita would have a hard time fighting him without mana.</p><br/><p>This was something that was unachievable by someone who didn\u2019t have talent even if that person was given countless years. Rita of course didn\u2019t tell this to Yu Il Han. Since he would get ahead of himself when she did!</p><br/><p>\u201cRita, other than martial arts or knowledge, is there something that might help after the Great Cataclysm occurs?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question that flew towards Rita, who was thinking about Yu IlHan\u2019s talent, was this. When she heard this, Rita could feel goosebumps.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>His question proved one thing.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who experienced more things than a human could experience in one life time, still didn\u2019t lose hope despite the time that had passed.</p><br/><p>To him, his life wan\u2019t over. No, perhaps he might be thinking that it didn\u2019t start until now. All the things he did until now maybe just in preparation for the life after the Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>It was a long time even for Rita, who was an agel, but a human who wouldn\u2019t live past 100 on average was treating the past years as prior preparation. Of course, he himself didn\u2019t know exactly how much time had passed, but that didn\u2019t make Rita any less surprised.</p><br/><p>[You, how can you be like that?]</p><br/><p>As she was dumbfounded, Rita spat out the question she endured until now.</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan tried to boast for a bit, he might have answered with a fancier answer, but he, who lived while looking for new knowledge and experienced without being in contact with another human for countless years, only had candidness and honesty left. It might be considered that he regressed back in to a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said I need to do it, so I do it. I can\u2019t practice mana so I need to do other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>With Yu IlHan, who sighed while replying, in front of her, Rita lost her words to speak. The countless emotions and impulses mixed with each other and blew up to the point of bursting and bleached her mind pitch white.</p><br/><p>Soon, she didn\u2019t know what expression to make and turned her head and spread her wings.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what to do before leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Think about it yourself from now!]</p><br/><p>Rita disappeared from the place, and Yu IlHan was dumbfounded. After cool-headedly judging the situation, he muttered again while sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first go back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a historic moment where an angel harbored more than just good intentions towards a human. And obviously, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t notice that.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know, but this was the 274th year after being left behind.</p><br/><p>Humanity didn\u2019t return yet.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>In fact, it\u2019s insufficient to read all the books in the world even with 500 years. Please think that it\u2019s possible only because the MC only read book for 100 years and his reading ability became abnormally high. In other words, novellic exaggeration!</p><br/><p>Let me introduce myself. I\u2019m the always swooshing Toika! I will write diligently so please take care of me.</p><br/><p>In this work, I was going to write how strong a man at the peak of lonliness can become, but now that I\u2019m writing, The angel falls for him in just 3 chapters. This won\u2019t do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Then I\u2019ll come back tomorrow! Adieu!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even the interior construction was perfect!</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a pity, we\u2019d have made it in time for the 2nd Great Cataclysm if we finished just 3 hours earlier.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera muttered while looking at the outwardly spectacular mansion.</p><br/><p>Yes, Earth had already met its 2nd Great Cataclysm. Mana within the atmosphere increased explosively, violent waves surged across the seven seas, and even more violent shocks split apart the lands. The changes that occurred every single moment as the skies continuously transitioned in color, were a proof that the Cataclysm had once again befallen Earth.</p><br/><p>Mana had just begun its natural generation when Earth had experienced the 1st Great Cataclysm, while plants and animals evolved. These were just relatively minute changes.</p><br/><p>However, the 2nd Great Cataclysm could only be described as Earth casting off its shell and acquiring a newly metamorphosed body. It was a phenomenon that occurred as mana evolved every object in this world.</p><br/><p>As such, it was best to hide somewhere wide and safe until Earth had finished its shedding. Nowhere could be designated as completely safe, due to the uncertainties like when and where the grounds would suddenly sprout upwards or split apart.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a better alternative for the people of Earth \u2013 going to other worlds!</p><br/><p>The ones that were awaiting the Great Cataclysm, and those without any physical ability, left for other worlds as soon as they saw signs of change. They should probably come back after a few days.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the situation was a little different for the clans that fought against monsters on the front lines.</p><br/><p>The implication of explosive increases in the mana concentration was expectedly, more monsters, and there was no way the Traps of Destruction made by angels would be able to handle all of them!</p><br/><p>As such, they were preparing even more arduously than before the Great Cataclysm, rushing off to wherever the saturation of mana was the highest and subjugating the monsters there as quickly as possible. If something went wrong, mana would overlap itself several times and give birth to an unimaginably powerful boss monster.</p><br/><p>[Just the 1st Great Cataclysm was hectic enough for Earth, and now it\u2019s the second\u2026\u2026 so don\u2019t you think that it will be similar to other worlds after their 3rd Great Cataclysms? In fact, the mana concentration is only a little below that of worlds after the 3rd Great Cataclysm.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta said in a careful voice, as she had experienced the hectic times on Earth after the 1st Great Cataclysm, together with Yu IlHan. Spiera also nodded with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>[If you think like that, it\u2019s no wonder the transcender factions are eyeing Earth. Perhaps Earth will be reborn as a higher world some day.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Then there will be a vicious invasion.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[The people of Earth would all die at that time.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>The three angels voiced their worries in succession. Their gazes were all focused on one person as well, whose identity was none other than Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[IlHan should be the key right?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Why do you think I\u2019m teaching him the Great cosmos-severing spear?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[But what he\u2019s doing now is\u2026..] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The human Blazing Reaper, Yu IlHan, who shouldered the responsibility of the fate of Earth, was currently in the process of checking the distribution of magic stones over the mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the 2nd Great Cataclysm happened, mana crafting will become easier huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My dear IlHan? Won\u2019t you go hunting monsters with this noona?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an important moment, so don\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, sir.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>After checking, Yu IlHan moved his steps to the central study of the mansion. Everyone that helped in the construction followed him.</p><br/><p>[Will it really work?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve observed mana crafting of such scale too.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[It looks like he\u2019s starting.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>After taking a deep breath, he took out a 4th class magic stone into his hands. Then, he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018I only need to do what I planned to.\u2019</p><br/><p>All magic stones were placed in their correct places. If they fulfilled their roles well, then it would be possible for the mansion to be completed as an impenetrable fortress. Of course, he was planning to upgrade it into a mobile fortress later.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, let\u2019s start.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan commenced mana crafting, light shot out from the magic stone. Although this scene was very normal around Yu IlHan, what came next was beyond everyone\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>As if resonating with the magic stone, the desk in the study started emitting light, before diffusing into the floor, creeping up the pillars and coloring the ceilings, and branching out into various places within the mansion and the surrounding land as well!</p><br/><p>[This is a frightening mana storm. There was no way the magic stone Yu IlHan used would bring out such effects though\u2026\u2026!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[That simply means that IlHan uses mana more efficiently than you, Erta, right?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I, it\u2019s because this is a combination of blacksmithing and mana crafting!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The light did not die down and burned continuously. In that process, the 3rd class magic stones installed in various parts of the land melted down to give special properties to various items exactly as Yu IlHan had planned for.</p><br/><p>Following that, the magic language circuit etched on all items in the territory resonated and amplified that power!</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s uselessly spectacular!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt reminds me of the day when the magic formation of the ancient elves shook the entire continent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty is enveloped by the light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t ascend to the skies like this\u2026\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, that light did not continue on forever. When the 4th class magic stone in Yu IlHan\u2019s hand completely melted down and fused with the mansion, the light covering the mansion and the territory finally died down.</p><br/><p>Although there was still faint light glowing in various parts of the mansion, unless someone imbued mana, they would soon dissipate into the atmosphere. The mana crafting was successful.</p><br/><p>At that moment, green text covered Yu IlHan\u2019s retina.</p><br/><p>[Bittersweet Persona was completed.]</p><br/><p>[Bittersweet Persona]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Chaos]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 5,312,500]</p><br/><p>[User restriction \u2013 Yu IlHan. Possible to transfer ownership to beings with Language skill level Max.]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Recovers durability by absorbing the mana and life energy from the destroyer.</p><br/><p>2. Automatically attacks everyone that enters without the master\u2019s permission.</p><br/><p>3. Grows by absorbing the records of opponents.]</p><br/><p>[A battle fortress disguised as a grand mansion. All items inside can be used as weapons, and the system that attacks enemies from long range is at the peak of mana engineering. The battle fortress would grow as it experiences more battles. If there is a disadvantage, it is that it is impossible to completely hide its mana due to the absurd functionality, and may attract nearby monsters with high probability.]</p><br/><p>Chaos? Just as Yu IlHan tilted his head at the completely new ranking, a blinding explosion of light occurred with Yu IlHan as the center. The light was a strange mixture of black and red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me this light is\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvolving? Dad is evolving!?\u201d (Mir)</p><br/><p>Unlike before when the light of the magic stone covered everyone including Yu IlHan, now, Yu IlHan himself was emitting light from his body.</p><br/><p>While everyone was panicking in this strange phenomenon, the sole being that already experienced this had her mouth open in shock. Yes, it was none other than Liera!</p><br/><p>[Huh? IlHan\u2019s state is as if\u2026\u2026?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cDad is evolving after all?\u201d (Mir)</p><br/><p>It was that moment when text that numbered even more than when he created the Bittersweet Persona, had appeared.</p><br/><p>[You have fulfilled one of the conditions in order to acquire the blessing of the god of blacksmithing. All conditions were fulfilled.]</p><br/><p>[You have received the blessing of the god of blacksmithing! Resistance and attack power increases by 20% when fighting against or wielding all weapons, and fire attribute resistance and attack power also increases by 20%.]</p><br/><p>[You succeed the record of the god of blacksmithing. You are now able to make artifacts above Chaos rank.]</p><br/><p>The light dissipated. Yumir, who was looking forward to his dad\u2019s evolution, tilted his head when he found that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t look that much different from before, but the angels didn\u2019t get deceived.</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuugh\u2026\u2026 my head aches so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Like how Liera\u2019s eyes had developed a tinge of red after receiving the blessing of the god of love, Yu IlHan\u2019s body had also received minute changes in the process of succeeding the record of the god of blacksmithing. To be specific, a part of his hair became ash-colored.</p><br/><p>Also known as highlights. This was a small, unnoticeable change if someone did not touch his hair in purpose, as expected of Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I just felt a malicious intent, ooooouch.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re overthinking it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, you\u2019ve just received the blessing of the god of blacksmithing, right? With this, there\u2019s already two human beings who received the blessing of gods on Earth.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The angels were expressing their joy, surprise or confusion in various ways, but Yu IlHan was in no situation to respond. New information flooded his head and made him chaotic.</p><br/><p>Informations on items or types of artifacts that blacksmiths of various worlds had created, their creation methods, tools, experiences and memory, and various materials oe metalworking of metals that made up the world. Yu IlHan felt like his brain was exploding, and collapsed while supporting himself from the sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>His subordinates hurriedly held onto him. Mir also cast whatever healing magic he could, but the headache did not settle. It would only become better once all knowledge took root in Yu IlHan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any state to go monster hunting.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It looks like the influence of the blessing of the god. Liera, you have experience, do something about it!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Ah, okay.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera seriously nodded and flew towards Yu IlHan before grabbing him.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m sorry I urged you to go hunt monsters, IlHan. Leave the rest to the others and let us go have a nice sleep. You\u2019ll be better after a long rest.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I told you to do something about his headache, not to fulfill your own desires!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The mini-3rd war had began on the side, but Yu IlHan didn\u2019t mind at all. Instead, even while grabbing his aching head, he stood up from that place.</p><br/><p>While his subordinates were looking at him with worried eyes, Yu IlHan opened his mouth after a short breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s prepare for battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You want to hunt monsters in that state? No, you should rest here with me!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Now I really admire your unbending spirit!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk later. Ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pushed aside the angels and sat on the soft chair in front of the desk. At that moment, the monitor installed on the desk turned on and showed the outside. it was the perfect security system that watched over both the inside and the vicinity around his land!</p><br/><p>In that same monitor, it could be seen that there were thousands of monsters charging towards them. Even though it was just after the 2nd Great Cataclysm, the horde was too large. Moreover, there were plenty of 3rd class beings among them! If left alone, they would destroy a city within moments.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in a hurry as if they\u2019ve found a treasure. What amazing morale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is this thing that they want and where is it\u2026\u2026 we need to chase them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan decisively cut off Phiria and Pat\u00e9\u2019s conversation. With one of his hand still on his head, he pointed towards the monitor. The rest turned their eyes on it, and realized that the thousands of monsters were rushing towards Yu IlHan\u2019s land.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered Ericia in confusion. Yu IlHan replied with a cute smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe treasure they\u2019re looking for is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to chase them, so kill them as soon as they come here. For a period of time, more monsters will be drawn here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone understood Yu Ilhan\u2019s words. To think back, whether it was the light from the mana crafting, or the faint fragrance of high-class mana that still leaked from various places, both of them did feel quite attractive.</p><br/><p>Of course, if they lost to that temptation, they would become a Breaker! 1</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While the group had lost their words, only Pat\u00e9 shouted with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve even made a cutting-edge monster attraction system! As expected of Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the flattery and go fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like that, on the day the 2nd Great Cataclysm arrived on Earth, the grand and spectacular mansion defense started autonomously as if to celebrate Yu IlHan receiving the blessing of the god of blacksmithing.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even know what the other people of Earth were currently facing!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The item ranks order is \u2013 Normal &lt; Rare &lt; Unique &lt; Legend &lt; Epic &lt; Chaos &lt; ??? &lt; God. Even if I explained differently before, this is the correct one!</p><br/><p>Congratulations! Yu IlHan has evolved to \u2018The one blessed by the god of blacksmithing\u2019 Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>So he finally received a god\u2019s blessing. That was a long road, although, there\u2019s still a long way to go! Go forward Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>PR: Will be gone from 26th may to 3rd june, Chamber will do the posting then, so it\u2019ll be off schedule!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He invested them without holding back, and did mana crafting on not only the pile bunker itself, but also on some parts of the ammo, and could bring out results which were better than he had expected perhaps due to the new variety of materials he had, and the higher level of mana crafting than before.</p><br/><p>[Frighteningly Destructive Metal Pile Bunker]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013</p><br/><p>1st level : 2,100</p><br/><p>2nd level : 3,200</p><br/><p>3rd level : 4,300</p><br/><p>4th level : 5,500</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 Piercing power and attack power increases by 40%]</p><br/><p>[Durability 2,100/2,100]</p><br/><p>[A terrifying weapon made by the best weapon smith of Earth. It has horrifying power, and even more horrifying backlash, so one needs more courage than when fighting monsters to use this weapon.]</p><br/><p>Although he did use Metal Hearts, to keep using it, he couldn\u2019t make a 5th level loading. It was because the power in the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band had increased along with the durability of the pile bunker\u2019s body. Of course, the 4th stage had frightening might as well, so he didn\u2019t have any complaints.</p><br/><p>Aside from that, Yu IlHan also made a variety of weapons using the sharp and hard bones and carapaces. Hammers, axes, greatswords, and even a grenade made from Giant\u2019s Rubber Band.</p><br/><p>The next things he set his sights on were long range weapons.</p><br/><p>Although it was good to make a bow or a gun, since he had the shooting skill, but thinking back to the fight with the Shadow Leopard, it was hard for him, who could not use mana, to inflict any damage using small bullets or arrows to a large scale monster.</p><br/><p>As such, the thing Yu IlHan made were neither a bow, nor a gun, nor metal skewers, but an atlatl. The spear throwing device that hunters used since the ancient times.</p><br/><p>[Rough Moonlight Bone Atlatl]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 2,800]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 Attack range increases by 50%, Attack power and accuracy increases by 40% under the moon]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,850/1,850]</p><br/><p>[A spear throwing device that one can use to slot a small spear in the hook to shoot. The result differs hugely according to the abilities of the user.]</p><br/><p>Atlatl was a tool that looked similar to a cane with a curved end, and it was a simple weapon that one could use just by slotting a spear made for throwing, on the end of the hook, and shoot the spear just by swinging it around.</p><br/><p>The range and the attack power was superior to just throwing the spear by hand, and above all, the biggest advantage was that it would get affected by the max level spearmanship that Yu IlHan had to bring out much better effects than any other throwing weapon.</p><br/><p>Aside from that, after Yu IlHan made a huge number of weapons that he can use, Yu IlHan immediately went into repairing his armor.</p><br/><p>Not only did he repair the black full plate armor that got damaged during the fight with Reta Kar\u2019iha, he also made a tough clothing using the skin of the Highland Troll boss. He didn\u2019t forget to mana craft on it to increase ventilation and defensive power.</p><br/><p>Lastly, when he opened the Cross Bag to enhance the harpoons and the ropes, he could find the spoils of war that he had forgotten completely until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those, were the magic stone, the black robe, and the large black scythe that Reta Kar\u2019iha left behind. Thinking back to the overwhelming ability that Reta Kar\u2019iha had, Yu IlHan checked their information one by one in full expectation.</p><br/><p>[Secretive Reaper\u2019s Fallen Robe]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 2,400]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 User\u2019s concealment ability increases by 20%, attack increases by 20% when attacking in surprise]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,238/2,430]</p><br/><p>[A robe which absorbed dark mana for a long time to possess the power of a deathgod.]</p><br/><p>[Fatal and Sharp Reaper\u2019s Scythe]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 3,100]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 Critical hit rate and damage increases by 40%]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,780/2,800]</p><br/><p>[A scythe that the last smith in a ruined world made with a metal from unknown origin.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThese weapons are slightly inferior compared to their ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head when he saw that it was below his expectations. He wasn\u2019t aware at all that he was using OP-tier weapons.</p><br/><p>However, that just meant that it was slightly inferior compared to her abilities, the options attached on the robe was an exceptional defense that would increase Yu IlHan\u2019s fighting power immediately. Yu IlHan used a magic stone to cleanly repair the robe and put it back in his bag. He had no plans to wear a robe that increases the effective of his already so-strong concealment, in public.</p><br/><p>The scythe also had quite a high attack power compared to the deathgod\u2019s black spear that Yu IlHan himself was using, but coincidentally, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t have a lot of experience using a scythe.</p><br/><p>No matter how high the attack power was, and no matter how good the options were, it was foolish to use a weapon that he wasn\u2019t used to. As such, he unhesitantly put the reaper\u2019s scythe into the furnace. If Erta was watching that, she would have screamed \u2018what are you doing?\u2019.</p><br/><p>However Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t insane, and did not plan to give such a good weapon as food to the Eternal Flame. He was planning to melt the scythe once and reforge it as a spear.</p><br/><p>\u2018It is definite that the metal is way better than Metal Hearts. Moreover, I don\u2019t know whether it had mana crafting or not, but the power dwelling in the metal itself can\u2019t be looked down upon. Perhaps it gained power over the years.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Eternal Flame burned in a rough and bright blue color. Yu IlHan, who now knew what that meant very clearly, unhesitantly threw a magic stone at it. He had less than ten now that he had used up so many, but since he had made everything he needed to make, he didn\u2019t feel that it was a waste at all.</p><br/><p>However, the reaper\u2019s scythe was strong. Despite the Eternal Flame burning roughly, it didn\u2019t seem to have any thoughts in melting down. When the Eternal Flame raised its temperature even more, a black aura emitted from scythe and made a black silhouette on top of the furnace.</p><br/><p>[Sssssssssss]</p><br/><p>\u201cReta Kar\u2019iha?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ssssss]</p><br/><p>He spoke to it thinking that there maybe some kinda will left in it, but it didn\u2019t seem as such. However, his try wasn\u2019t in vain. It was because he had spotted a slight vibration in the black silhouette the moment it heard the words \u2018Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018This will be easy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan found the trick right away. Although he didn\u2019t know what the black silhouette was exactly, he instinctively realized what he needed to do in order to achieve his objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cReta Kar\u2019iha. Breaker. Death. Deathgod. Ruin.\u201d</p><br/><p>While spitting out keywords related to Reta Kar\u2019iha, Yu IlHan observed the changes in the black aura. The keyword attack was very effective! Every time Yu IlHan said a word, the Eternal Flame burned brighter and the black silhouette was gradually losing power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWar, many against one, critical, ambush?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had muttered out all the words related to Reta Kar\u2019iha, but concludingly, it was useless work.</p><br/><p>The black aura didn\u2019t require that much deductive power. Just mentioning Reta Kar\u2019iha and her abilities was enough to bring out enough changes in the aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cLoner, woman, deathgod, heh!\u201d</p><br/><p>And the final moment came. Seemingly not wanting to listen to any more of Yu IlHan\u2019s words, or seemingly having enough, the black silhouette completely left the reaper\u2019s scythe and even the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black aura seemed to flow around in the air before being absorbed into Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s magic stone that Yu IlHan had left on the side.</p><br/><p>The already extraordinary magic stone started emitting an even stranger black light after completely absorbing the black aura. It really seemed delicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it\u2019s melting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less about that. He just smiled in pride, looking at the melting scythe.</p><br/><p>Around that time, guests entered his workshop, but since Yu IlHan was concentrating on the melting scythe, he didn\u2019t notice the uninvited guests. It was a truly marvelous concentration.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t you eat it. Yes. That way.\u201d</p><br/><p>He set the basic form by solidifying the molten metal on a mold, and before it completely solidified, he started metalworking.</p><br/><p>Although he did prepare for it, that metal had incomparably higher hardness than Big Metal Hearts. It was as if saying that it won\u2019t be swayed by Yu IlHan\u2019s needs even if it died, since Yu IlHan had ruined the original form.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat some more magic stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, regarding stubbornness, Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t inferior. He could only do it until it works if it doesn\u2019t work! He just threw another magic stone into the furnace and mercilessly melted the metal before hammering it.</p><br/><p>This should have been the first time he had worked for so long after he had made the steel spear. However, as Yu IlHan was a pervert, he was a type that would burn stronger the stronger the enemy was. The metal\u2019s stubbornness would only ignite Yu IlHan\u2019s stubbornness more!</p><br/><p>In the end, the metal slowly started changing according to Yu IlHan\u2019s will.</p><br/><p>[So he\u2019s processing that as well. Although, I did foresee this when he was working with harkanium.]</p><br/><p>[So cool.]</p><br/><p>[Hmph.]</p><br/><p>Whatever the uninvited guests were saying, it didn\u2019t enter Yu IlHan\u2019s ears. If he noticed them, then he wouldn\u2019t have been able to concentrate on work.</p><br/><p>How much time passed since he had started hammering the metal? First, the spear body lengthened and the spearhead seemed to be formed, before the blades were sharpened, and the spear body was polished.</p><br/><p>In front of Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes, a spear emitting black light from its spear body to the spear head, was born. The sharpness was so sharp that it seemed that one would get cut if one just put one\u2019s hand close to the blade.</p><br/><p>[Extermination Spiked Spear]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 3,700]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 Critical hit damage increases by 70%]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 3,100/3,100]</p><br/><p>[A master weapon made by Earth\u2019s best weapon smith by melting a weapon from another world. It is not completed yet.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, even the weapon information is reading my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true. This weapon would only be completed by using mana crafting with Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s magic stone.</p><br/><p>Even at this moment, Yu IlHan felt that the black aura, which was absorbed by the magic stone, was staring at him. He had snapped its stubbornness and changed the weapon\u2019s form so shouldn\u2019t he listen to that amount of stubbornness?</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was planning to go into mana crafting immediately, but since one process of the work was done, his concentration ended up slacking a little. Thanks to that, he realized one thing.</p><br/><p>In his workshop, which should be impregnable by humans due to the barrier set up by angels when he worked with harkanium, he could feel two existences other than himself.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he could smell a familiar fragrant from one of them. A very familiar, and at the same time, the fragrance that he longed for.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he couldn\u2019t not remember the words that the armored angel had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that the foreshadow had been taken back too quickly, Yu IlHan stood up while scratching his head, and turned back. At that place were an angel with a bright smile and another angel with a sour face.</p><br/><p>The two figures that he had exactly predicted.</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re back.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m back!]</p><br/><p>Same answer, different meaning. He stared blankly since he didn\u2019t know what expression he should have made, but in the end, he smiled as his emotions told him to. Then, he quietly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, uninvited guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Next chapter, the real rewards will be given out.</p><br/><p>The uninvited guests\u2019 return</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>There will be another one, in around 8 or so hours.

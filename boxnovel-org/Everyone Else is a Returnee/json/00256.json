Liera became speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OP!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the activation is quite hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026\u2026 *sigh*, I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The war was over, and the skill that prevented any outsiders from entering has also been activated. Although many horrifying monsters will be born in this world, as this world was now a higher world, the current elves and wolfkin would be able to manage that by themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia carefully approached Yu IlHan and Liera.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe battlefield has been cleaned up; the harvest of the materials\u2026\u2026 as well as recovering the corpses.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Ericia. Are we clear about the number of casualties yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuitable measures have been carried out. We\u2019re all waiting for master\u2019s next orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan patted Ericia\u2019s head who was lowering her head slightly. Looking at her twitching ears, he spoke with a small smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let us have the funeral then.\u201d</p><br/><p>A grand funeral for Phiria, whose death notified him of the occurrences in Dareu, as well as all the other elves and wolfkin who died throughout the war, as well as Lecidna, Yumir\u2019s mother, was carried out. Yu IlHan, his subordinates, the elves and wolfkin, and Yumir\u2019s Dragon\u2019s army all gathered in one place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, to be exact, Lecidna was completely fooled by the Garden of Sunset\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Mom.]</p><br/><p>When Lecidna\u2019s body inside Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory showed itself in the outside world, the setting sun colored her golden scales red. Yumir looked at that with clear eyes as if he didn\u2019t feel any sadness, before approaching her body and lightly embraced it, while still in dragon form.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m going to live on strong with dad. So mom, don\u2019t worry about us and be born strong in your next time, and live a long life.]</p><br/><p>\u201cA dragon is a dragon alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was speechless at Yumir\u2019s words, the children comprising the Dragon\u2019s army became sad for some reason while watching Yumir embracing Lecidna\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that hero\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel strange. I\u2019m not hurt, but I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that this helped the hero to become happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make the hero happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the children who took the fact that killing was a necessity for survival for granted, commemorating the dead was an awkward thing for them. However, Yu IlHan still wished for them to understand that death was a sad thing.</p><br/><p>To them, Yumir was their everything, so they would probably understand something after seeing him send his mother away. Although it would be bad if they hesitated to fight against their enemies, they could at least escape being unaffected by the deaths of their allies.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has worked hard. The blood you have shed have all become seeds to regain Dareu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd with our tears, may elves prosper once more\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKitera\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves who finally regained Dareu after a long period of time also commemorated their comrades in arms and cried. Although they could not regain the remains of Phiria, the other 3 elves could finally let her go with peace in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhiria\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect His Majesty to your share as well. Although we\u2019re still the ones being protected right now, I\u2019ll definitely become strong enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Phiria. I will never forget you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the atmosphere was slightly different in the wolfkin\u2019s side. They, who was assured that the Moon Wolf Ericia had chosen in this war, was a great man indeed, rejoiced that they have gained a gained a grand victory in this sacred war, and also thought that their comrades that died, died glorious deaths. They could send the dead off with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Kiroa had lost its future, what remained for us was also regress and death. However, we have met Lord Yu IlHan and finally gained a future. Look at us now! We may be fewer in number, but we have become incomparably stronger than before, and we shall become even stronger in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember the ones that died in this holy war! We! Have to become stronger, enough to cover their share, or more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shall follow you for all of eternity, Lady Ericia!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Yu IlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone commemorated the dead in their own ways. Yu IlHan silently watched, until he judged that they were done with it, when he held up his hand. At the same time, all of the remains were covered in warm, orange flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu IlHan\u2026\u2026 Truly an ability that\u2019s been blessed by the goddess of fire. To think there\u2019s a fire that provokes emotions just by looking at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if the flames are dancing in unison.\u201d</p><br/><p>What all they said was true. All the flames above the corpses had Eternal flame controlling them, and was dancing in order to make them rest in peace. Yu IlHan simply smiled as he felt that he could feel its emotions. He was just happy.</p><br/><p>However, the funeral that seemed to end like that left them a surprise gift.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who was now appeared in a human boy\u2019s form, pulled on Yu IlHan\u2019s sleeves while speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s there where mom died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean something\u2019s th\u2026\u2026. Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he didn\u2019t want to touch Lecidna\u2019s remains, he should have put more thoughts into the temperature of the fire in order to incinerate everything but this\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was confused and headed to where Yumir lead him to. When he got there, the place where Lecidna\u2019s remains were burning was replaced by an oval object. Yu IlHan\u2019s forehead was immediately filled with cold sweat when he saw that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 I have a slight trauma with objects of such shape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an egg, dad. That\u2019s a magic a dragon uses to protect an item safely. Those are mom\u2019s scales.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey definitely are scales alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>She should have collected the sturdiest of her scales and enhanced them with magic before storing them in her body in order to do this. Yu IlHan admitted with difficulty after looking at the scale capsule that was glowing red due to the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan approached it and touched it. At that moment, one of the scales protruded upwards and stabbed at Yu IlHan\u2019s finger. Although it didn\u2019t hurt, he didn\u2019t touch it anymore since he felt like any more would cause a bigger reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a defense mechanism\u2026\u2026 Mir, can you try touching it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir put his hands on top of the scale capsule. At that moment, the scales mysteriously collapsed with a sound and showed its contents. It was set to disarm against those of the same blood.</p><br/><p>And the contents were \u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cA letter and an unknown piece of metal. And also.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scales that were protecting the contents had merged into one giant piece of scale. When he knocked on it, it was so hard that it made Yu IlHan wonder if that really belonged to a lower existence. The magic power flowing inside was also very extraordinary and it felt as if Lecidna herself was compressed into that one giant scale.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the letter is for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you read it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I learnt from the elves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir read the letter with glistening eyes. While reading the letter, he gave Yu IlHan the pieces of metal that was with the letter itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, it\u2019s an artifact that allows you to contact the members of the Garden of Sunset.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo she tried to drag even you to the Garden of Sunset. Sheesh, she was completely hopele\u2026\u2026 hmmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The piece of metal was definitely in the form of a transceiver. Although it was designed in a complex structure, any dragon could interpret and activate it, since they could wield mana proficiently.</p><br/><p>The problem was not that. This transceiver generated a certain type of signal to send to the members of the Garden of Sunset residing in another world, and the second function would be activated once it received a reply \u2013 the function to create a gate that connects the two worlds.</p><br/><p>This was an artifact that allows people to move worlds! If the Heaven\u2019s Army had such an artifact, Yu IlHan wouldn\u2019t have had to spend a thousand years in solitude! \u2013 thought Yu IlHan, when he realized that this artifact bent around the laws of the Akashic Records itself.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way the Heaven\u2019s Army could acknowledge such an existence. No, perhaps, they didn\u2019t even know of it either.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we can destroy a lot of the bases of the Garden of Sunset with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to destroy them right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Yumir with shining eyes. Fighting numerous higher existences made him incomparably stronger than when he had first arrived in Dareu.</p><br/><p>Although it was too bad for Lecidna, Yumir was a guy that would like it if there was a battle, whether it was the Garden of Sunset or the Destruction Demon Army. However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t want to have any more battles for the time being, so he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I want to finish up what happened in Dareu at this point. If I asked everyone for compensation, the battle would become endless, and I also wouldn\u2019t be able to endure for so long. Let\u2019s save this for later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, if the other side picked a fight with him first, he would not let them go either. Yu IlHan put the artifact inside his inventory and had a look at the scale next.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so\u2026\u2026 Mir. What should I make you with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a necklace. A locket. I\u2019m going to put the letter in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make you a locket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that Yumir had no affection for her, when he saw that he sent her off so easily, and from the fact that he didn\u2019t talk a lot about his mother until now, but it seemed that he was wrong. Yu IlHan gave a tight hug to Yumir who put Lecidna\u2019s letter inside his bosom, before turning around. He was planning to make a pretty locket that can remind Yumir of Lecidna. Of course, he would also make it very functional as well.</p><br/><p>In any case, the funeral was over with this. Since they sent all that they had to send off, it was now time to go back to everyday life for the living.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, will you be going right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan was preparing for the two fortresses to activate, Mirfa asked with a panicked voice. He could not ignore the earnest gaze that wished him to stay with them more, and replied with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t take you all to Earth\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll come back once I am in need of your power again, so please fight on until then. I\u2019ll look forward to you all becoming stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMirfa, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll protect His Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jirl replied with a confident smile to Mirfa who could not let go of her regrets. Mirey, Jirl, and Pat\u00e9 had all finished preparing to leave and was behind Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cJirl, you idiot. That\u2019s not what she means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to serve you by your side\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The feelings the elves had towards Yu IlHan were absolute. He found this very awkward, but they were all adorable as well. Yu IlHan lightly stroked Mirfa\u2019s hair and consoled her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come around to play even if I don\u2019t need your help. Right now, coming over to this world is nothing difficult for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, Your Majesty! We will wait for your return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Mirfa\u2019s expression regained its smile. Mirfa nodded several times with a bright red face. That was also the moment when an alarm went off in Liera\u2019s heart when she was watching.</p><br/><p>To speak the truth, more than half of the elven females had feelings for Yu IlHan, so there was no room at all for Liera to relax! She only wanted to leave Dareu as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shall await the princess\u2019s return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shall definitely become stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, proceed forward. I will also become stronger under master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader of the wolfkin, the Moon Wolf Ericia, as well as the captain wolf Flemir also went with Yu IlHan. As a considerable number of wolves had grown to 4th class in this war, they would be able to hold out by themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we actually won.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like the final act of a book. I think it will be perfect if there\u2019s the word [-fin-] on the bottom right of the screen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many of those moments that it\u2019s nothing new anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, that\u2019s why I like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. I know very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone got on the Flying fortress. Since the Guardian fortress was made for the elves and wolfkin, it would be unmanned while they were not there, and would only serve to protect the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately activated the Warp skill against the two fortresses and the members in it. As there were several members, it should take a long time usually, but with the power of Dimensional Traveler, a few minutes would be enough.</p><br/><p>But when he was about to start the Warp skill, Na YuNa grabbed his sleeve and glistened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan. I want to see MiRae now~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite early you\u2019re saying that. However, I also want to see MiRae. And father too\u2026\u2026. And my other family members as well.\u201d (Kang HaJin)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m planning to go find my father and mother first. After that is Miss MiRae. \u2026\u2026 After that let\u2019s visit where Sir Kang HaJin and miss YuNa wants to go to.\u201d (Yu IlHan)</p><br/><p>\u201cF, father and motherrrr!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted Na YuNa in shock and started combing her hair. Liera and Erta were also nervous. As it was so obvious what they were thinking, Yu IlHan gave a smack on the foreheads of each of the girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like all the other worlds are as messed up as Dareu is, so we\u2019re going to take it slow from here. It will take time for Earth to leap into a higher world anyway. \u2026\u2026 And we also need some rest too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you need to make equipment with your profits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t read my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan seemed about to give a smack on Liera\u2019s forehead again, but suddenly changed his actions and put his hand around her waist. At that moment, Na YuNa and Erta were stunned stiff as if they were inflicted by paralysis magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s replying voice became so obedient like a different person altogether. Looking at her back as she followed Yu IlHan, Na YuNa and Erta grit their teeth and their gazes met, before they extended a hand out each and did a stiff handshake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe simply cannot give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we? I gave up my angelhood for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>And the two\u2019s voice perfectly synced.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cLet us do well from now on.\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? These women are scary\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Kang HaJin, who felt the shivers from the obsession of women, shivered in fear.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The story of Dareu is settled for now with this!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>As Kobatochandaisuki is away on a trip, it is very likely that the sponsor status will not be updated. So I\u2019ll put the current status here.</p><br/><p>If you\u2019ve read my notes in the previous chapter, you probably saw that it was $312. However, between the time I translated that chapter and this chapter, someone just dumped me with $200. Meaning the total is now $512, which is now down to $412 with these two chapters.</p><br/><p>Have fun reading!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

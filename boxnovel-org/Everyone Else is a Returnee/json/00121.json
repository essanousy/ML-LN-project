There was no one to comment on the side, and as both of them were bad with relationships, they skipped all the trivial greetings and conversation and went straight to the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestruction Demon Army, you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have heard about Transcender factions from Na YuNa\u2019s Guardian Angel, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo a certain extent, yes\u2026\u2026 So the number of things I should mind about is increasing. Although it\u2019s a good thing that I will never have to go against a higher existence directly\u2026\u2026. phew.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kang MiRae sighed, Yu IlHan ended up laughing. It seemed that Kang MiRae became comfortable enough to sigh in front of him. She also realized that immediately and changed expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, please excuse myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. Anyone would sigh hearing that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPah, fuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, be careful since your sigh may end up becoming a gale.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir was also at that place, in Yu IlHan\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae stared at Yumir for a moment due to the similarities between the father and son, before shaking her head and changing topics.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t say nothing happened on Earth\u2026\u2026. There\u2019s nothing that Mr. Yu IlHan would be surprised about. A few of the small countries collapsed, land became sea, nothing too serious. If you want the materials I-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was plenty surprising! And Yumir should really fix his habit of trying to copy his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t focus on every matter as there were too many monster appearances. Although it\u2019s fortunate that there were no stronger monsters than the one that appeared in the Kantou incident, the quantity of incidents increased explosively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that\u2019s the case from how strong the people got. You included, miss Kang MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty noona strong! Strong and kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae felt proud for a moment hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s and Yumir\u2019s praises before becoming dejected again. Only Yu IlHan would be able to give her such complex feelings on Earth. With confounding thoughts in her mind, she changed the topic once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, it\u2019s about the land that father talked about. The estimated statistics are already out, but I don\u2019t think I will be able to do this as fast as the time we traded this building. There are too many people involved in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it slowly. It\u2019s nothing urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you for your understanding. First, I will give you the documents related to it as soon as I finish compiling them. Then\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae closed her mouth. She had now finished saying everything she wanted to. As Yu IlHan had already talked to her about Vanguard, the conversation would end here. Truly neat.</p><br/><p>However, why did she feel that he was aloof even though he was at such a young age?</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, she thought of something to say. Kang MiRae licked her lips before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thing that father talked about, you don\u2019t need to mind. It seems he got a little greedy after seeing how exceptional you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m instead worried that you may feel down because of it, miss Kang MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae was about to speak something, but she decided not to. Thinking about her father\u2019s annoying face, she was afraid that anything she said would contain a strange meaning behind it.</p><br/><p>Organizing what to say in her head, she opened her mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m, also alright. Whether it\u2019s father\u2019s pranks\u2026\u2026 or teases, I\u2019m used to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.You must have a hard life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoona, are you hurt somewhere? Should I fix you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir figure asking with glittering eyes while leaning forward a little like Yu IlHan was truly cute, so Kang MiRae extended her hand to pat Yumir\u2019s head despite the fact that Yu IlHan was watching.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt. But thanks for worrying about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKind noona. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a child\u2019s privilege to sound cute despite saying two completely unrelated lines. Yu IlHan laughed and held him up high.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, daddy\u2019s talk is over so let\u2019s go eat now. I\u2019ll take my leave since my child is hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW, wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Kang MiRae stopped Yu IlHan with a shout. Both Yu IlHan and Yumir had widened eyes as they turned back. However, the one who was the most surprised was Kang MiRae herself; she didn\u2019t even know why she stopped them either.</p><br/><p>Now that she had stopped them, she had to say something. However, just as she was about to think about what to say, Na YuNa\u2019s face popped up, and her mouth opened automatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, think that we\u2019ve made a good relation with each other as colleagues. That is, as colleagues that fight against monsters. From the beginning of the Great Cataclysm, it\u2019s been over half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u2026 I also think that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t understand where she was going, but her words itself was very reasonable.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of situations where they had to meet each other, and he had made the first-ever party in his life with her, and even traded a lot with her clan, so at this point, it was no different from an alliance.</p><br/><p>There was no need for Kang MiRae to confirm that. At this point, they were considered colleagues.</p><br/><p>Right? I can think that since she called that first, right? \u2013 thought Yu IlHan, who hated to leave behind any embarrassment for himself or discomfort for others by measuring the distance between them on his own.</p><br/><p>However, Kang MiRae\u2019s words were just the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if\u2026\u2026 we address each other so stiffly (formally), I think it may be a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy \u2018address\u2019, you mean\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if having waited for it, she spoke very naturally and smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel we are distant for nothing by addressing each other with surnames. There will be many more cases where we will fight together in the future, and as such I think we could swap to a friendlier term. Not to show it off to someone else, but as colleagues. Isn\u2019t it fine to allow that? It will also be easier to communicate in battles that way too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally understood. So she meant they should call each other without surnames? Even though it hasn\u2019t been \u2018a year\u2019 since they met! Social butterflies had a really fearsome communication method!</p><br/><p>However, honestly, he felt quite, no, really happy. There was no one other than his parents and Liera that called him without his surname.</p><br/><p>\u2018Colleague. That\u2019s a word I haven\u2019t used before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Was there anyone in the world who became a loner because they wanted to be? 1 Of course, there are moments when someone wants to be alone when they live busily with many people around them, but no one would want to be alone for life.</p><br/><p>Rather, Yu IlHan was a special case since he had lived alone for all his life. It could be considered a Yu IlHan(unique) case.</p><br/><p>However, that was until today. Here was a person who thought of Yu IlHan as her colleague.</p><br/><p>The existence of people who had good impressions of him beyond the question of believe or not believe, was a truly thankful matter to him.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t a loner for nothing, and would hate it if a stranger or a person he hated, called him without his surname, but on that side, Kang MiRae passed with flying colors.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. If so\u2026\u2026 Should I call you miss MiRae from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mr. IlHan. Please take care of me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s expression was vividly brighter as she replied to Yu IlHan. Fuu, he was worried that everything would be just greetings until the end, but that was just him!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grabbed her extended hand and gently smiled. It was a smile from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss MiRae gives me something new every time. I\u2019m thankful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Kang MiRae\u2019s heart thumped loudly once.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s sudden ambush! As expected of a Deathgod, despite not being in concealment. The problem was that the person in question wasn\u2019t aware of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goes for me too. So, uh, yeah. I also learned a lot thanks to Mr. IlHan. If, you\u2019ll please, uh, excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Panicking due to Yu IlHan\u2019s unexpected ambush, she stuttered a little while replying and entered the elevator without even looking back. However, Yu IlHan, who felt satisfied for acquiring another ally that he could call by name, he didn\u2019t mind about that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat noona is pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to Liera, who\u2019s prettier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera-noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chatting loudly, the father and son left the room. Meanwhile, Kang MiRae, who was inside the elevator heading for 1st floor, was muttering in a small voice while putting her fist on her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him first. This is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then blushed while thinking about Yu IlHan\u2019s previous words, before shaking her head again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrade, this is a grade. A trade of each other\u2019s lives\u2026\u2026. Emotions are just misunderstandings. The \u2018emotion\u2019 I have is only admiration, and love is only my misunderstanding\u2026\u2026 the heart beats are only because of arrhythmia\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her soliloquy was good enough to make a song, but the person herself was very serious. However, there was no one around her to fix her misunderstanding. Even if there was, it wouldn\u2019t really have help out that much.</p><br/><p>Four days passed since then. Yumir levelled up to 65 during that time, and the elves raised their dismantling skills to level 65. Additionally, Phiria was just past level 76 for dismantling so she was ready to have a go at a 4th class remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAah, His Majesty is truly amazing. Now that I\u2019ve been enlightened on dismantling, I fear nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJirl, you aren\u2019t enlightened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Underground workshop. Yu IlHan confirmed that there were no monster corpses in his bag after rummaging through his inventory.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had long since dismantled the 4th class wolves. He had acquired 6 bodies, but only one produced a magic stone. Well, it was still a higher percentage than dragons.</p><br/><p>There was a corpse inside his inventory, but that was Yumir\u2019s mother, Lecidna. Yu IlHan was planning to cremate her when Yumir\u2019s matured a little more</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys worked hard until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all, Your Majesty. If you give us more work, then we\u2019d gladly-!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just rest a little first. I\u2019m going to activate the barrier as soon as I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan put dragon meat and wolf meat in the bucket that was filled with 3rd class dragon blood. As he was about to be fed up with dragon meat, he was now trying a variation.</p><br/><p>He had no confidence in succeeding, but there was plenty of time. Yu IlHan was sure that his recipes would increase if he tried changing the blood, and changing the meat, and a combination of the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat looks delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir was drooling in Liera\u2019s arms as he looked at the bucket. They haven\u2019t told him that it was dragon meat in the bucket. As such, Yu IlHan planned to not take out any of the meat during the two months. Dragonkin were well\u2026\u2026. they should be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the recipe solidifies, then I\u2019ll give you meat until your stomach bursts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>[This really is a workshop of chaos. Can\u2019t you at least put away that bucket?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is the most important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rejecting Spiera\u2019s request, Yu IlHan pushed the bucket aside after filling it with blood and meat, and took out a truly humongous piece of metal on the other side.</p><br/><p>That item was the tool used to train Great Cosmos-severing Spear. Spiera was naggy about where to place that blob of metal, and even interrupted in schedule planning.</p><br/><p>[You need to train in the spear for at least 24 hours.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, he polished his metalworking tools including the anvil and the hammer, and fed a few 2nd class magic stones lying around in his inventory to give it more power. Continuing, he confirmed the information on what kind of equipments he had to make within the barrier by reading through the Vanguard homepage, and the preparations were finally done.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it right? Did I miss anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wait, Yu IlHan. Someone is trying to enter the workshop.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Was Erta\u2019s report. Just who when not anyone could enter the underground workshop? Yu IlHan retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need to chase them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But\u2026 they are recognized at as allies\u2026\u2026?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>While the angels and the human tilted their heads, the door to the workshop opened and someone came in.</p><br/><p>Long curly, black hair and wolf ears that twitched between them. A glamorous body that was contrasting to the young-looking face. It was none other than Ericia.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019ve returned after settling everything I had to do. I will now serve you by your side in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her timing was truly perfect as if she had predicted that they were going to activate the barrier now! Does this girlie have a prophecy skill too?</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan narrowed his eyes momentarily while thinking nonsensical stuff like that, but he ended up laughing anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, that isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia tilted her head in confusion, but Yu IlHan didn\u2019t mind her and activated the hourglass.</p><br/><p>For two months, she would experience it herself.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I, stopped time\u2026\u2026! (Yu IlHan to the confused Ericia) (T/N: Apparently, a JoJo ref)</p><br/><p>Heart thumping is due to arrhythmia : (T/N: Uhh, a Kampfer ref apparently)</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a historical moment. IlHan finally acquired a \u2018human\u2019 ally\u2026 T^T. I can only say that the plot has largely advanced forward! Although it\u2019s unknown if Kang MiRae is also thinking of him as just an ally, but anyway, in IlHan\u2019s view, it is like that.</p><br/><p>What was that? Don\u2019t all Koreans refer to each other with just the first names within an hour after meeting a stranger? Uhh, in fact, I still call an uncomfortable seonbae with their full name\u2026. No, I\u2019m not a loner!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>~~~</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

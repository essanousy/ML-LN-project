Once Mystic focused her mind, then the single Trap would engulf all the Traps of Destruction in that world and would subsequently absorb the mana of that world to transform them into Traps of Restoration.</p><br/><p>The majority of the worlds were not as big as Dareu so it didn\u2019t take that long for the Traps of Restoration to activate and completely cover the world. Mystic became a little more tired every time they visited a new world but that was about it. The body that Yu IlHan had created for her was unbelievably good.</p><br/><p>Like that around the 26th or the 27th world they visited, Yu IlHan and the other two found angels. Thanks to Yu IlHan\u2019s actions the war of higher existences had ended in a vague state and the lower ranked angels had returned to duty.</p><br/><p>[Hm?]</p><br/><p>[Wait, I think something changed.]</p><br/><p>Even though they couldn\u2019t sense Yu IlHan entering and throwing a Trap of Restoration, they could sense the transformation of the Traps of Destruction. They had planted some kind of detection magic on the Traps of Destruction in order to operate them more efficiently.</p><br/><p>They sensed damage being dealt to the Traps of Destruction first, then the signals from all the Traps of Destruction in the world simultaneously disconnected.</p><br/><p>[The Traps of Destruction are being destroyed!]</p><br/><p>[Nonsense, the Traps of Destruction cannot be\u2026\u2026 no, but there is no Dungeon Break\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[No, the Traps of Destruction are turning into something else. Just what is\u2026\u2026 happening?]</p><br/><p>The angels scurried around in disorder and eventually reported to their superiors (though, that didn\u2019t work since Yu IlHan blocked it midway) before rushing towards the Traps of Restoration. Mystic directed the engulfing process of the Traps of Restoration while checking with Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, they\u2019re planning to investigate something. Is it fine to let them be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot to mention angels, even God wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. The moment any other higher existence tries to interfere with the Traps of Restoration, the Traps of Restoration in each world would go berserk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, there was something like that set in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whichever Traps of Restoration went berserk in whichever world, a signal would be sent to Mystic and Yu IlHan. It was fine even if they were late. The Traps would all disintegrate before anyone could analyze them. Yu IlHan explained with a smile of satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a move I learnt from God after examining the Legna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. You\u2019re becoming more evil than ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like they realized that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The angels entered a state of panic after realizing that the artifact was made with some technology unknown to them and that they would only be in for the worst even if they tried to touch it. To kick them while they were down, they couldn\u2019t even report to their superiors properly!</p><br/><p>[What do we do about this.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026We need to leave it be. I do not know what this being is trying to do by making these but we would only cause a disaster if we recklessly interfered with it. We can only return to Heaven.]</p><br/><p>[But would a high angel, or even an Archangel be able to solve this problem?]</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s an even bigger problem. That is, if such an item was scattered to only this world.]</p><br/><p>[Urgh\u2026\u2026 just when a big war had ended. Why did such a thing happen again?]</p><br/><p>[We only fight if there are beings that bring disorder to this world. Let us return for now.]</p><br/><p>It seems like the angels in charge of this world were quite capable. Yu IlHan nodded with a laugh. As long as they didn\u2019t do something reckless, the matter they\u2019re worried about should not happen.</p><br/><p>Not only that, there was no need for any Overflows in the future, nor was there a need to be afraid of what God may try to them. How good of an opportunity was that! The Traps of Restoration would instantly sell out if they were sold for just $39.99 a piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you contact them and persuade them instead? Before they try something bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? In the end, they\u2019re just salarymen who have no choice but to obey orders if it comes down to it. What would change just by telling them? No one who shouts \u2018revolutionary business\u2019 has succeeded in the past you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The more fundamental problem being that he might end up giving Heaven an excuse if he came into contact with them anymore than was necessary.</p><br/><p>What was an even bigger problem was that the self-proclaimed God may still have connections to Heaven\u2019s Army. If he explained the situation and it was somehow reported to the self-proclaimed God, then wouldn\u2019t that be frustrating! Everything would go wrong once he was caught up with others, so it was rather more comfortable to take care of everything himself!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you made a higher existence organization and became the leader, your thought process is still like that of a loner\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave me be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it\u2019s done. Let\u2019s go over to the next world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Strangely, Mystic became more vitalized the more Traps of Restoration she controlled. It was probably thanks to the records that were gathered through the Traps of Restoration. Noticing that, Orochi\u2019s expression became pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I be surpassed at this rate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou realized that a little too late. You should fight on too, Orochi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheating! Isn\u2019t that cheating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen want to manage the Traps of Restoration too?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was impossible. Orochi swallowed his frustration and could only watch as Mystic became stronger over time!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m becoming better and more efficient at this. I think we can go a little faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Your proactive attitude will make you stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh, being left behind by that woman\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s not acceptable!\u201d</p><br/><p>The engulfing process of the worlds proceeded smoothly. In a mere four days, Yu IlHan had changed the Traps of Restoration in thousands of worlds into Traps of Restoration.</p><br/><p>If they ran out of the Traps midway, they could just collect some Traps of Destruction and make them into Traps of Restoration so it was a super easy job!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I think the Traps you made will cover all worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re conquering all worlds in an unbelievable way\u2026\u2026 Master, are you planning to go to even higher worlds after you\u2019re done with lower worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying. How many lower worlds do you think they are how can I go around to them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan explained shortly to Orochi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I made the Traps of Restoration so that it would cross dimensions and engulf other worlds. Mystic, I think it\u2019s about time you start to feel something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I get a signal\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orochi and Mystic once again had to be enlightened. They were too small to comprehend and accept Yu IlHan! Mystic hadn\u2019t received a God-ranked artifact for nothing!</p><br/><p>It was the 32,918th world that Yu IlHan and the others met an unexpected guest.</p><br/><p>Just as when the Traps of Restoration was in the midst of engulfing, that is, when the angels of that world had realized something and were in disorder, a holy fire covered the entire world suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael? No\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head at the flame that seemed similar to Michaels, but realized that it was much weaker. Then there was only one answer. Uriel, also famous for wielding fire along with Michael in the four Great Archangels, was residing in this world.</p><br/><p>[So you are here, Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>Uriel used her holy fire in attempt to detect Yu IlHan, but not to mention Yu IlHan himself, it was impossible to sense Orochi and Mystic that was being concealed with him. In the end Uriel spoke in a loud voice that resounded across the world while looking for him.</p><br/><p>[I have already heard from Gabriel. You should be here, no?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would have just headed to another world if there was no mention of Gabriel even if the opponent was one of the Four Great Archangels! There were three that Yu IlHan was the most concerned about right now, and one of them was Gabriel.</p><br/><p>[I wish for conversation. This shouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for you as well. Will you not talk with me for a moment?]</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought \u2013 whether or not this is a trap, whether or not this would lead to something annoying\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whether or not he would encounter with the truth that he was worried about.</p><br/><p>After considering all of them, he raised one hand towards the sky. From his hand an enormous amount of mana was released and covered the world.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Dimensional Ruler, activates.]</p><br/><p>Just with that, the gate to this world was temporarily closed. With that, Yu IlHan and the other two were revealed for all to see, and Uriel immediately noticed his position and flew to him.</p><br/><p>[It really is hard to see your face. Your title of Pancosmic Loner is really apt.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you giving me damage when you just appeared? And that title already disappeared by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel was female. And one that possessed blindingly beautiful white-blond hair and golden eyes. Of course, it would be a joke if Yu IlHan\u2019s spear became blunt just because the opponent was a woman. Yu IlHan had already slashed many beautiful women in the past! Moreover, the preemptive strike she dealt to Yu IlHan made his hostility rise to the max.</p><br/><p>[I wish you didn\u2019t make such a hostile expression. I have lost a companion that I have been with for millions of years.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I send you to his side?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not that I\u2019m boasting, but there aren\u2019t that many men that could raise their eyes in front of me. \u2026\u2026Truly amazing.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Heli\u00e8na couldn\u2019t do anything about Unshakable Heart, but you? \u2013 was contained in his snort. Uriel made a bitter smile at his attitude and raised her two hands to tell him that she had no hostile intent.</p><br/><p>[As you know, the flames I wield cannot surpass yours. Although I wield the power of earth a little, but that would not work on you either. You know right? That I have no chances of winning at all.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know. That is why I\u2019m more curious as to why you scattered your presence so much in search for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I wish to request your accompaniment.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAccompaniment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s accompaniment when he killed one of the Four Great Archangels and became the leader of the fifth faction? This was the most absurd thing he heard after the alliance offer from Greed.</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan tilted his head in astonishment, Uriel laughed and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>[I am vaguely aware of what you are doing right now. You are moving in order to not cause collateral damage from the battle of higher existences to lower existences. Are you not?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just moving in order to survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even while saying that, you are looking for a way so that as many people as possible are saved, are you not?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan start feeling uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t that he was purposefully acting evil or anything, and was indeed just trying to protect himself and the ones close to him, but he was annoyed at the fact that someone was making him out to be some saint that saved everyone. Uriel seemed to have realized that and shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>[What is important is not that. I have come looking for you according to Gabriel\u2019s words, and wish to observe your actions as the representative of the Heaven\u2019s Army. With me around, you need not worry about clashing against the Heaven\u2019s Army.]</p><br/><p>Why is it that her words just sounded like an excuse? Yu IlHan felt like he became the main character of a play and replied to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it does bother me for you to accompany me when I don\u2019t know what strange beings are hiding amongst you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I am one of the Four Great Archangels. I do not leak information and records like the other angels. At least against other 7th classes.]</p><br/><p>This proved Yu IlHan\u2019s assumption. God had shared his important records from the four Great Archangels. Otherwise, they shouldn\u2019t be so arrogant and say that they will not leave any of their own records behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew I should have analyzed Raphael\u2019s remains first.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What will you do? Will you accept my request?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders. It was because he remembered what happened when Raphael accompanied him in killing the traitors of Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>However, the situation was very different from then. Uriel had no methods to interfere with Yu IlHan, and the current him could also\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, I will accompany you. Also, I\u2019m not sure if you know this, but there aren\u2019t many lower worlds left.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, I have already heard that your Traps have a tremendous ability. However, your job is not yet completed, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed. Perhaps she looked for him at this time after realizing all of that as well. Was there no way out of this?</p><br/><p>Then he could only accompany her until the curtains were lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still Heishia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan bit his lips and activated Warp with Orochi, Mystic and Uriel in his range. It was time to meet the epilogue of this stage, the truth of the matter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Especially, Na YuNa\u2019s beauty had transcended humanity, so it was normal for gazes to be gathered on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you, please come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had experience fighting the shadow leopard with Yu IlHan once, Fred, greeted them. They proudly received the gazes on them, and left the terminal on Fred\u2019s guide. When the awaiting limousine opened, there was a prior quest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you acquire it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She, who brought out her business before any greeting, was the Empress, Kang MiRae. Wearing a black-based robe, and instead of the mask that she wore while fighting with Yu IlHan, she was hiding her face with sunglasses.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe sounds so reliable, but in fact, HaJin-oppa got thraaashed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNa YuNa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The always-honest Na YuNa revealed Kang HaJin\u2019s humiliation for all to see. Kang HaJin tried to stop her, but the water was already spilt.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae first let them in the car, and expressed her confusion after facing them with her sunglasses off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou acquired them, but you got thrashed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, listen, MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that it came to this, there was no method to stop her. Kang HaJin could only obediently endure the replay of his dark history.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026A Korean who uses a spear? His name is Yu IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe also used things like pile bunkers. Feyta said that he\u2019s the strongest on Earth right now. And probably in the future too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that angel said so, then it must be true. Yes, hmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae answered like that after listening to Na YuNa\u2019s story and put on her sunglasses again. Then, she turned her head away from her and fixed her gaze outside the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, thanks. Thanks to you, I can now advance to 2nd class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you got all the rest! But MiRae, why did you turn your head so abruptly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only wanted to see the scenery outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything interesting outsiiiide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa got close to Kang MiRae and looked outside the window. However, only the unchanging roads could be seen. Looking at that, Kang HaJin thought \u2018perhaps?\u2019 and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, oppa. I\u2019m hearing of him for the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae answered in a calm tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut hearing that he\u2019s stornger than me, I\u2019m a little curious. Well, of course, he will get left behind by me soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs stubborn as always, eh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch MiRae is cute too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re being annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even though she said it was annoying, Kang MiRae didn\u2019t push Na YuNa away. They were childhood friends, and ones who had to be separated for ten years when they lived all their life together due to multiversal circumstances. A slightly overboard skinship was a good method to bring back their awkward relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, after that, I became curious of that person. But I told him to give me his number, but he didn\u2019t give me one until the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t, fu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. \u2026\u2026Mirae, didn\u2019t you just laugh at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRiiight? Rather than that, let\u2019s drink beer. Beer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we go home, and I do my 2nd class advancement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaaay!\u201d</p><br/><p>The delightfully cheering Na YuNa, and the vaguely complying Kang MiRae. Seeing that the girls were as ever, Kang HaJin sighed in relief and laid back on his chair. Then, he thought back to Yu IlHan, who disappeared just before they got on board the airplane.</p><br/><p>He thought back to Yu IlHan\u2019s various abilities, with every single one of them strong.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s alright. My strengths aren\u2019t only on fighting strength. Don\u2019t belittle yourself, Kang HaJin. Jealousy will only make me look puny. I only have to do what I\u2019m best at.\u2019</p><br/><p>There will come a day where he will put Yu IlHan under him. Then, it was no different from him winning. Imagining such scenes, Kang HaJin closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The limousine was heading to the destination smoothly and quickly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yu IlHan was roughly and quickly running towards his house. He was thirty times faster than that limousine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d</p><br/><p>From Incheon airport to Jongno, where he lives, he took less than ten minutes to traverse tens of kilometers before opening the door to his house proudly.</p><br/><p>However, his father didn\u2019t seemed to have come back from work as his shoes weren\u2019t present, and his mother had gone somewhere after leaving a post-it on the dining table.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan read the post-it.</p><br/><p>[I heard there were some fresh seafood so I\u2019m going on a quest to Ya\u2019umin. I\u2019ll be back before dinner!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan already got inflicted with Na YuNa\u2019s speech tone, even though he hadn\u2019t heard it that much. Ya\u2019umin, if there wasn\u2019t the word \u2018quest\u2019 then he might have mistook her for going to some market.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is my mother actually quite strong?\u2019</p><br/><p>His father always grumbled everyday, saying monsters were frightening, I have no talent and I\u2019m weak and whatnot, but didn\u2019t his mother have nothing like that? At least, it was clear that she was more talented than his father. If not, then she wouldn\u2019t have gone to another world so light-heartedly.</p><br/><p>Looking forward to the seafood for dinner, Yu IlHan washed his sticky body clean before directly going to his workshop.</p><br/><p>He waved his hand at the Eternal Flame, which greeted Yu IlHan by flickering violently, and he went into work that he had not done. It was the dismantling job that he hadn\u2019t finished.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might have to throw away all this meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the rotting speed was very slow compared to the meat of other animals since it had mana dwelling in it, and the materials that made it up was different in the first place, even monster meat rotted. Most of them were fine right now, but since had had hunted so many, it seemed very difficult to eat them all before they went bad.</p><br/><p>\u2018Should I ask them to apply a rot-proof function on the Cross Bag?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that before realizing one fact.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t I do it myself?\u2019</p><br/><p>However, he soon threw away that thought. The options on the Cross Bag were only made with several angels working together. Since he can\u2019t use mana yet, and didn\u2019t have a high level of mana crafting, he would be too incapable to challenge it.</p><br/><p>Especially, since the difficulty was raised as it went against the phsysical laws, it was wise to give up quickly.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ardently dismantled the Flame Lizards, trolls, and the scorpions. He first separated the meat by species, and using the vacuum packager that he prepared for such moments, he packaged them and returned them to the Cross Bag before separating a separate portion to put inside the refrigerator at home.</p><br/><p>He decided to throw away the large amount of meat which remained even after all that. It wasn\u2019t like he would never hunt monsters in his life again. There was no need to get obsessed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, it\u2019s a bit of a waste to throw it all away.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked while looking at the Eternal Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you eat meat as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt as if the Eternal Flame had nodded. No, in fact, even if it didn\u2019t, that didn\u2019t matter!</p><br/><p>Laughing with a \u2018fufu\u2019, Yu IlHan took out a frying pan. He was thinking of getting Cooking Skill experience, albeit a little, by cooking the remaining meat. The Eternal Flame can just swallow the cooked meat and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about throwing it away, so it was perfect!</p><br/><p>For 3 hours after that, Yu IlHan cooked. \u2018Cooking\u2019 was just simply grilling the meat, but as the amount was huge, his cooking skill increased by 2.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Flame wordlessly (even though it can\u2019t speak) swallowed all the meat, and the horrifying pile of meat was all gone like that. If someone else saw it, that person would be dumbfounded and would not be able to say anything.</p><br/><p>And when he processed all of that meat, what was left was their bones, carapace, skin and tendons. Even though he had gathered the byproducts after removing all the meat, they still weighed over ten tons in total. Thinking that he should take it a little easier on his hunt starting next time, Yu IlHan went into work.</p><br/><p>He first experimented whether he could make a Giant\u2019s Rubber Band with the tendons of the trolls and the flame lizards, but the results weren\u2019t that positive.</p><br/><p>The ones from flame lizards were no good at all, and with the trolls, they did acquire elasticity like the shadow leopard\u2019s tendons when he heated them, but it didn\u2019t exceed the shadow leopard\u2019s tendons. He felt that he would be able to exceed the black leopard\u2019s tendons if he heated a little more, but they reached the critical point and burned before they could.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s gaze turned to the Highland Troll Boss\u2019s muscles. The possibility was plenty. He immediately grabbed a string of tendon with tongs and put it inside the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remember that temperature from just now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flicker. The Eternal Flame burned bigger as if to answer him.</p><br/><p>Staring holes at the tendon that heated in the fire, he concentrated.</p><br/><p>Through the several hundred years of training, he came to a realization that he should be serious in whatever work he did that required him to work with fire. Anyone would become serious if they experienced the feeling of emptiness when everything turns into naught due to a moment of carelessness. This was also the reason why Yu IlHan respected chefs.</p><br/><p>The tendon glowed red. He had already seen this scene when he heated the trolls\u2019 tendons. However, before their properties completely changed, they burnt away.</p><br/><p>What was important was now. Would the Troll Boss\u2019s tendon be able to endure the Eternal Flame and achieve mutation? Yu ilHan watched with a thumping heart.</p><br/><p>The tendon became redder and redder. Yu IlHan could see with his eyes that it wasn\u2019t simply heating up, but the structure was changing. Of course, it didn\u2019t burn in vain. Well, there was a huge difference in endurance between 2nd class and 3rd class.</p><br/><p>Success. Yu IlHan was assured. He could make another Giant\u2019s Rubber Band after the black leopard!</p><br/><p>However, that was it. The moment thought it was about to succeed, the tendon lost its red color and returned white. Yu IlHan\u2019s tension loosened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, is there a limit to simple heating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe the problem laid in the fact that he had only used one method in creating a new material.</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame, in the end, was a flame. It was clear that the Highland Troll Boss\u2019s tendons had the possibility of mutation, but perhaps there might be something else required to bring out that change.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Eternal Flame burned blue and enveloped the tendon. While doing that, a streak of flame that separated from its main streak flickered as if licking with its tongue.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought \u2018maybe\u2019 and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I need to feed it something?\u201d</p><br/><p>A positive movement. Yu IlHan took out a few 2nd class magic stones which he acquired after finishing the dismantling, and put in his bag, and unhesitantly threw it. The Eternal Flame ate those magic stones as if it had waited for it and burned brighter.</p><br/><p>In the blue flames, the tendons gradually turned redder. It seemed glow gradually, before eventually became scarlet and shrank in volume. Seeing a clearer change than the time he made the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band with the black leopard\u2019s tendons, Yu IlHan shouted with his fist gripped tight.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Eternal Flame is the best and I don\u2019t need anything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Re-realizing the OPness of the Eternal Flame, he took out the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band from the furnace (T/N: I might have translated that as a fireplace before\u2026 pffft a fireplace is a smithy\u2026I must be crazy) That, which changed so much to the point that its original characteristics were all but gone, had a unique shine to it to make it look high-class.</p><br/><p>It was more elastic than the black leopard\u2019s and had a higher durability as well. It was the birth of a perfect Giant\u2019s Rubber Band.</p><br/><p>\u2018Would she come back when I make a new weapon with this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought up of Erta. He also thought of Lita\u2019s figure, but he decided to put her aside for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wish she\u2019d come quickly and attach about 9 options to the Cross Bag.\u2019</p><br/><p>It should be fine for him to ask for 100 options\u2026 With a humble mind, Yu IlHan picked up the hammer.</p><br/><p>From now was the delightful time of equipment-creating labor.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the two angels he thought of were coincidentally in the same place; as a participant of the meeting held by angels.</p><br/><p>[As a result of investigation, it was found out that Reta Kar\u2019iha was an intelligent species, an elf, of the world, \u2018Dar\u00e9u\u2019.] (T/N: Shit\u2026 accents\u2026 that\u2019s gonna be a pain.)</p><br/><p>[Ah, I remember meeting her when I was in charge of that world. She was a talented child. That world\u2019s history might have changed if she was born 500 years earlier.]</p><br/><p>[Dar\u00e9u is an Abandoned World. Just why did she appear in a dungeon on Earth? No, how did Earth get connected with an Abandoned World?]</p><br/><p>[Is it related to the overlap of the Traps of Destruction?]</p><br/><p>When the angels spoke a line each, the place turned noisy. The angel in the position of a chairman tapped the table and summed up the situation.</p><br/><p>[There are two big questions regarding this incident. One, how did a portion of an Abandoned World get connected with a dungeon on Earth. Two, why did it happen in a dungeon where the Traps of Destruction overlapped?]</p><br/><p>[Chairman, are you doubting your fellow angels?]</p><br/><p>[As a possibility, yes. If the human Yu IlHan didn\u2019t kill Reta Kar\u2019iha, then Erta and Feyta would have meaninglessly lost their lives. In the worst case, there\u2019s even a possibility that Earth and the Abandoned World will get mixed up.]</p><br/><p>[Wait.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, another angel interjected.</p><br/><p>[Did you say that a human killed Reta Kar\u2019iha?]</p><br/><p>[I did.] (Chairman)</p><br/><p>[A human on Earth? By himself?]</p><br/><p>[He wasn\u2019t alone. A human called Na YuNa was there too.] (Feyta)</p><br/><p>[Is that possible? It has only been two months since the Great Cataclysm ocurred on Earth. A single human defeated a 3rd class Breaker?]</p><br/><p>[Like I said, Na YuNa too.] (Feyta)</p><br/><p>The meeting place turned noisy in an instant. Feyta ended up becoming silent as she became shy since she was ignored twice.</p><br/><p>[How is that possible? Isn\u2019t that human suspicious instead?]</p><br/><p>[If there was someone behind this incident, isn\u2019t that human the one who we should be suspecting?]</p><br/><p>[Shut up all of you, my IlHan only became strong thanks to going through hellish suffering!]</p><br/><p>Lita exploded and shouted.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s a good child!] (Lita)</p><br/><p>[There are angels who were with Yu IlHan all the time. There is no room for doubt. What we should give him are rewards, not suspicion.](Chairman)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re right. He protected me and Feyta, and in that process, defeated the Breaker with exceptional ability. Also, regarding his exceptional ability, angel Lita should have submitted a report already.]</p><br/><p>Lita\u2019s words were quite off, but fortunately, the chairman and Erta correctly expressed their opinions, so the suspicion that was about to be given to Yu IlHan was safely avoided. The angels who didn\u2019t like Yu IlHan since before clicked their tongues, but there were plenty who liked him in that place. There were none who were stubbornly claiming again.</p><br/><p>[At this point of time, we cannot come to any conclusion. Therefore, I suggest that we increase the number of angels dispatched to Earth by four times to investigate the situation on Earth in detail.] (Chairman)</p><br/><p>With the chairman\u2019s declaration, the venue turned noisy.</p><br/><p>[Four times? Earth is just a tiny world where only the First Great Cataclysm occurred. Aren\u2019t we being too serious?]</p><br/><p>[Can\u2019t we just close Earth if a problem occurs? I think we are just putting angels at risk. The Army of Heaven is not infinite.] (T/N: Army of Heaven is the group\u2019s name, hence capitalized) (T/N: I do not know what this guy means by \u2018close\u2019. The word used here is different from \u2018abandon\u2019 from Abandoned World)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s not invest so much fighting power in a mere small world.]</p><br/><p>There were a lot of angels who objected. However, the number of those who agreed numbered much more.</p><br/><p>[No, Earth has too many connections with other worlds. We cannot rashly close it.]</p><br/><p>[I shall agree. It looks interesting.]</p><br/><p>[I also agree. Whether big or small, First Great Cataclysm or Third Great Cataclysm, a world has the right to exist.]</p><br/><p>[I think it should be fine if we pull some veterans out of the completely stabilized worlds.]</p><br/><p>[I agree.]</p><br/><p>[Agreed! Completely agree! Please accept place of work application!]</p><br/><p>There was no room for doubt as to who wanted to apply for a place of work. The chairman\u2019s suggestion instantly acquired more than half of the votes and was passed.</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s something I should tell you which is not related to this. Lord God had considered the characteristics of Earth, and decided to give benefits to a few humans belonging to Earth with outstanding ability to reclaim the balance of the world. Like a few angels including Erta and Feyta are doing, from now on, a few angels will take the role as a human\u2019s guardian angel.]</p><br/><p>[The probability to reach the center of the incident would increase if we stay next to strong humans.]</p><br/><p>[Although I don\u2019t want to meddle with a lower existence, oh well.] (T/N: Guardian angels were useless though\u2026?)</p><br/><p>The meeting finished around there. The angels prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>The chairman seemed to want to talk more seeing that the angels were going away in such a hurry, but since the chairman was aware that many things were only at the suspecting stage, the chairman only said this. (T/N: Sorry, I don\u2019t know whether this angel is male or female\u2026)</p><br/><p>[Watch over Earth. Although I do not want it, If it gets connected to an Abandoned World again, then the situation will become out of hand.]</p><br/><p>[Just why did it come to this when we have planned to connect Earth to other worlds to avoid a commotion, I wonder\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Why did the connection become so strong? Now we can\u2019t even sever it like we want. Shit.]</p><br/><p>[Are there any good ones amongst the returnees\u2026]</p><br/><p>The angels scattered in an instant, excluding a few to decide the rewards that will be given to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[What would make my IlHan happy?]</p><br/><p>[Rather than what makes him happy, shouldn\u2019t we give him something that can help him?]</p><br/><p>[M, my YuNa too. She worked hard as well!]</p><br/><p>Hearing the conversation between the poor angel Lita, and the strict mother-like Erta, which blew away all the serious atmosphere from just now, the chairman angel, Myuta, ended up laughing.</p><br/><p>[On my, Myuta\u2019s, authority, I promise him the best rewards. Lita, I will accept your stubbornness.]</p><br/><p>[Myuta, really? Thank you so much!]</p><br/><p>[Myuta-nim, why?]</p><br/><p>While Lita became honestly happy, Erta tilted her head. It was because Myuta was known for always keeping neutrality with a fair and strict mind.</p><br/><p>Myuta seemed to think a bit at Erta\u2019s question, before replying, shrugging.</p><br/><p>[I only execute God\u2019s wills. Allowing an unbalance for the balance of Earth. That\u2019s it. Also,]</p><br/><p>[Also?]</p><br/><p>[I think that rather than the 7.4 billion returnees, 1 dropout will probably approach the core of the problem.]</p><br/><p>At Myuta\u2019s words, the angels lost their words. If Yu IlHan was present, then he would have shouted \u2018fucking foreshadow!\u2019, but unfortunately, he was ardently smacking metal in his workshop right now.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Since this part is where a book finishes, I needed to put a lot of story, and as a result, the quantity became overboard again, I\u2019m sorry. (T/N: Yeah you should be, it made me suffer) (T/N: Every 25 chapters is a book, prologue included)</p><br/><p>Ignored newbie.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>This will be long\u2026 SURPRISE!!!!</p><br/><p>Everone got trolled! I trolled everyone! Lita did appear, but the two didn\u2019t meet yet! (I only said \u2018guess who will appear\u2019 and did not specify anything, I did not lie at all) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAha\u2026 ha\u2026\u2026 ha\u2026\u2026\u2026 (super long chapter, damn\u2026)</p><br/><p>Oh, btw, I didn\u2019t put the names to the speeches which were obvious or explained who was talking.</p><br/><p>I will not proceed to answer some questions (Warning, rants included).</p><br/><p>[You cannot use mana. You cannot learn active skills.] &lt;&lt; That\u2019s saying \u2018SINCE you cannot use mana YET, you cannot learn active skills\u2019. If he could, then that won\u2019t appear.</p><br/><p>Also, some people seemed to misunderstand. Class advancement is NOT a requirement to wielding mana. MC will become able to use mana gradually EVEN WITHOUT ANYTHING, IT\u2019S A NATURAL PROCESS THAT ALL INTELLIGENT SPECIES GO THROUGH AFTER A GREAT CATACLYSM. Erta is there to speed up that process. (And levelling up helps as well).</p><br/><p>Q. MC lived for 1000 years but he doesn\u2019t look that mature, does he?</p><br/><p>A. Living 1000 years alone will make a person CRAZY, NOT MATURE. It\u2019s xianxia/xuanhuan where people live for several millions of years without going crazy, that\u2019s strange, not this. (Well, although, I do guess their \u2018actual\u2019 life isn\u2019t that long since they go into meditation for who knows how long, also increasing soul capacity or whatever) Did MC ever cultivate? NO, he trained in systematic martial arts, read books and learned to smith.</p><br/><p>Q. MC is too light-hearted.</p><br/><p>A. It\u2019s already explained. A thousand years of experience is not a thing that a simple human can tolerate. I guess it\u2019s kind of a defense mechanism that he got on his brain. Besides, I think a light-hearted MC is better than one where he goes \u2018DEMON KING I WILL FIGHT YOU TO DEATH FOR HUMANITY!!! HE\u2019S SO STRONG!!! POWER OF NAKAMA SHALL WIN!!! HAREM FTW!!!!\u2019 or \u2018OH SHIT I OFFENDED A STRONG ENEMY/CLAN, I MUST NOW ACQUIRE INEXPLICABLE POWERUPS AND KILL THEM ALL!!!\u2019</p><br/><p>You want a dark MC? Go look for another novel. There are plenty of novels out there.</p><br/><p>Q. Aren\u2019t monsters suppose to be invulnerable to even nukes?</p><br/><p>A. monsters that are entirely made up of higher form of energy are invulnerable to those. The \u2018originals\u2019 are those who became monster after having acquired mana, they\u2019re not entirely made up of mana. Also, weapons containing mana WILL hurt them. The weapons that MC creates HAS MANA IN THEM!!!! (Even without mana crafting) Go re-read from the beginning. Don\u2019t criticize if you don\u2019t even know the novel properly.</p><br/><p>Q. What position is Lita in in the hierarchy of the Army of Heaven?</p><br/><p>A. I do not know. At the beginning, it is known that Lita cannot personally meet God in person. However, when Lita went back to Heaven to send MC Erta, her suggestion got through lightning fast. But, as seen in this chapter, God doesn\u2019t seem to interfere much with what the angels are doing.</p><br/><p>Q. Why can\u2019t MC use mana again?</p><br/><p>A. The others (or \u2018Everyone Else\u2019) were sent to other worlds to ADAPT TO and BECOME ABLE to use mana. But, MC was left behind on Earth, WHERE THERE WAS NO MANA, so he can\u2019t train or adapt to use it.</p><br/><p>Q. MC is too OP</p><br/><p>A. Deal with it. Why don\u2019t you try learning everything from scratch for 1000 years. You\u2019d become OP too.</p><br/><p>Q. Novel is too light hearted and is lacking depth</p><br/><p>A. That\u2019s the author\u2019s way of writing. If you want dark ones then go somewhere else. It will stay this way.</p><br/><p>Q. Why doesn\u2019t MC do this/that? He has all the knowledge.</p><br/><p>A. Reading and practice are different. Besides, I don\u2019t think he has photographic memory and can remember all of it.</p><br/><p>Q. Where\u2019s the storyline?</p><br/><p>A. Well\u2026 with this author, there isn\u2019t a specific \u2018arc\u2019. The entire novel is probably just one big story. Everything should probably get explained at the end. It was like that with his 2 previous novels. Also, THIS NOVEL ISN\u2019T ABOUT APOCALYPSE. Well, do you call it apocalypse if everyone on Earth is prepared for it? It\u2019s not even the end of Earth, it\u2019s just a level up.</p><br/><p>(Eh.. that\u2019s from NU reviews, now onto LCD)</p><br/><p>Q. Why doesn\u2019t MC attach (such and such) options to (such and such) items?</p><br/><p>A. Hey, it just got explained in this chapter. The more it goes against the laws of physics, the harder it will be to implement it. Like, a ring with a flight options if probably impossible for him to do as of yet.</p><br/><p>Q. Will Erta leave MC when MC becomes able to use mana?</p><br/><p>A. Hey, this just got explained in this chapter too. There will be more angels coming to Earth, guess who stays with MC.</p><br/><p>Q. Does MC want to get noticed?</p><br/><p>A. Well.. Idunno\u2026 probably yes, but he doesn\u2019t want to become famous I think, although, I think he just doesn\u2019t mind at all.</p><br/><p>Q. (Copy pasted) Chamber-chii I got questions is our poor MC gonna graduate from his V-card or not in the future, is the MC gonna go to the otherworld or even in the Heaven Realm or something, and lastly is he\u2019s body gonna change?</p><br/><p>A. Sorry, I do not understand your question. What\u2019s a V-card? If you mean virginity\u2026 maybe\u2026 who knows\u2026 If you want me to say what I think\u2026 I think it will happen after the novel ends since that\u2019s what happened with his previous 2 novels..</p><br/><p>For \u2018Heaven realm\u2019 eh\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u2018Heaven realm\u2019. If you\u2019re referring to where angels reside\u2026 who knows, MC\u2019s level isn\u2019t that high yet even in the raws.</p><br/><p>A slight setting spoiler here. Like there are \u2018higher existences\u2019, there are \u2018higher worlds\u2019. The place where angels reside is probably one of them. Although, it is already implied that there are \u2018higher worlds\u2019 from the fact that \u2018higher existences\u2019 cannot bring out their full power on a lower world (like Earth). Will MC go to one? This will become a spoiler, so I won\u2019t put it here. (Wait, this is a spoiler in itself\u2026?)</p><br/><p>As for his body? I dunno\u2026 well, his muscles already \u2018mutated\u2019 at the last parts of those 1000 years dropout period, didn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Q. Is his concealment problem ever gonna be solved?</p><br/><p>A. To slightly spoil, he can\u2019t \u2018undo\u2019 his concealment since he can\u2019t use mana as of yet.</p><br/><p>Q. Will MC use the scythe? That will fit a reaper better!</p><br/><p>A. What\u2019s the point of training in the spear then\u2026? You\u2019re obessed with reapers\u2026</p><br/><p>Q. Classes/Jobs don\u2019t seem to do much.</p><br/><p>A. Well, yeah. In games, it doesn\u2019t do much either other than giving you skills, which MC does not apply\u2026 and restrict you from using certain weapons, which doesn\u2019t apply to reality. Class advancement itself is like a \u2018guide\u2019 and an \u2018enhancement\u2019 to what the person already has. Hence, the already \u2018super-concealed\u2019 MC has become a \u2018blurred lancer\u2019 for his 1st job.</p><br/><p>Q. Isn\u2019t God a little too weak if he even forgot MC?</p><br/><p>A. Well, he did find MC after he was left out, who would think there\u2019s a max-level concealment person in a world which didn\u2019t even go through a single Great Cataclysm? &lt;&lt; Oh, this is my explanation, it maybe wrong.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s it)</p><br/><p>(Rant start)</p><br/><p>Man\u2026 everyone\u2019s like, \u2018When\u2019s the next chapter coming out?\u2019 \u2018I wanna read raws, please recommend me where I can read\u2019, GUYS I TOLD YOU I HAVE EXAMS, well, no one reads the translator\u2019s notes anyway\u2026</p><br/><p>Also people said \u2018it\u2019s hysteria not hystery\u2019. I\u2019m like, okay, (looks up the word), IT\u2019S YOU GUYS WHO ARE HYSTERICAL ABOUT RELEASES\u2026 (Lol) I mean, I never got \u2018what\u2019s EER schedule?\u2019 when I had no exams, but now that I have exams, 2 people asked me what the schedule was\u2026 (Murphy\u2019s law at its finest\u2026)</p><br/><p>There will be 2 per week, one on Thursday and one on Sunday (in my time, Korean time, GMT+9:00). I will change the schedule once the exams are fully over. (6th November) Nothing much\u2026 you might be getting more regular EER chapters per week\u2026</p><br/><p>(Rant end)</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

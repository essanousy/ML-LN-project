Having stopped, she realized what she had just done, and shocked herself out of Yu IlHan\u2019s embrace before lowering her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry. Please excuse my rudeness\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to the extent of rudeness but\u2026.. Oh, you guys get off too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Kang MiRae\u2019s words sounded calm, from her reddened cheeks and eyes, it seemed that she wasn\u2019t quite so. If they really did end up drifitng away for 1,000 days, it was quite understandable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I need to listen to you. Let\u2019s switch locations first. Ah, hey, I said get off.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how he thought about it, this wasn\u2019t the mood to scatter so Yu IlHan suggested with a bitter smile. This was an unimaginable way of thinking if he was still in his loner days.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae slightly nodded and wiped the tears off her face. Then, she proceeded to rip Na YuNa off Yu IlHan and throw her on the ground, before picking up her phone, that didn\u2019t have service for 1,000 days, and contacted somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu-ou-ou-ouch. MiRae, you really are harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease fix your habit of sticking too close to someone you\u2019ve given your heart to.\u201d</p><br/><p>In 5 minutes, limousines arrived at the venue. While Yu IlHan was feeling dumbfounded at this always-unrealistic scene, the drivers that came out of the limousines respectfully greeted Kang MiRae and Na YuNa. Liera exclaimed while looking at them.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s amazing that they can still retain their power even after the world has changed so much. That shouldn\u2019t be possible with money alone\u2026.. Political power is really something.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Liera, please keep your basic dignity as an angel.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Huh? I think I saw an angel weeping while clinging to IlHan just now, where did she go?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t cry!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>While the reunited angels were getting into a fight as always, Kang MiRae, who had now regained her composure, spoke to Yu IlHan with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease get on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae, who made Yu IlHan dumbfounded with those limousines, activated the golden combo of an aeroplane, along with several helicopters with 2nd class ability users to protect it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring you to Korea right away, lady MiRae. Lady Na YuNa too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Oh, tell my father that I cannot meet him right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing several ability users trying to protect Kang MiRae and co from the skies as well as the ground, Yu IlHan thought that the money he had his hands on didn\u2019t amount to much.</p><br/><p>Having 2nd class ability users as subordinates couldn\u2019t be done with just money alone. Only a history of loyalty, solidified over the years, could make that possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, was there anything inconvenient while we were away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty. I think you became stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd he turned more handsome too. I thought I caught up a lot, but I guess I\u2019m still far away.</p><br/><p>Well, he did have his own set of loyal subordinates.</p><br/><p>Just that they weren\u2019t human. Thinking that he didn\u2019t have it too bad either, Yu IlHan smiled. In any case, it was fortunate that everybody came back safe. He truly thought that. He somehow felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.</p><br/><p>Everyone, excluding Flemir, who had to lead all the wolves waiting outside the New York gate, headed to Seoul together. Although Yu IlHan felt slightly depressed for not being able to show off his wings, Ruin Calling, the others didn\u2019t notice that. Only Liera laughed.</p><br/><p>Having arrived at Seoul, the group headed to Yu IlHan\u2019s apartment. As everyone was Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates other than the angels, it was nothing strange.</p><br/><p>Well, if you exclude Kang MiRae and Na YuNa that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to sleep here for 3 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was surprised by Kang MiRae\u2019s sudden request. Kang MiRae spoke of her reasons with a very sorry expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019ll get a hotel room if it\u2019s of any inconvenience to you, but if I book a hotel using my name, it is highly possible that my father or brother will come to find me\u2026\u2026 If we stay here, those two will probably not interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead, it would be Yu IlHan\u2019s point of view, that a terrible misunderstanding that may arise!?</p><br/><p>\u201cMirrrr! Let\u2019s wash with Noona!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNa YuNa, you too, don\u2019t run around like it\u2019s your own home, and lower your head right here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason for Kang MiRae\u2019s sudden request was this:</p><br/><p>For Kang MiRae and Na YuNa, who had fought for 2 years and 9 months without rest, mental and physical stress had piled up beyond their limits. They had just avoided death by over exhaustion thanks to Na YuNa\u2019s recovery maagic!</p><br/><p>However, if they went back to their clans now, they would be flooded with work again. Kang MiRae had extremely rationally judged herself that she needed a rest. Whether it was the 2nd Great Cataclysm or the Lightning God clan, she would only be able to work after resting both her body and heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I can only apologize as it\u2019s\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, MiRae-noona is kind. YuNa-noona is kind too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as when Yu IlHan was about to reject, Yumir in his arms, spoke with clear eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, is it no good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as when he was about to reject regardless of Yumir\u2019s eye attacks, those two clear eyes dampened up. Critical Hit on Yu IlHan\u2019s heart and conscience!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I play a little more with these noonas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Who taught him this skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe, me, meee! Mir is so cute, isn\u2019t he! Ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smacked Na YuNa on the forehead for the first time. However, that also implied his permission to stay.</p><br/><p>Na YuNa made a \u2018v\u2019 with her fingers towards Kang MiRae even as she looked about to cry, and Kang MiRae also smiled a little.</p><br/><p>The promised 3 days went past very quickly. Yu IlHan told the state of affairs on Earth to Yumir and the others, and they, told Yu IlHan their story. After hearing that, Yu IlHan\u2019s impression was very simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Mir hard-carried everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI fought hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for his concealment ability, it would probably have been the end the moment they went to the other side. What was more impressive that Yumir\u2019s concealment skill evolved in a way that concealed his allies as well as himself. It was all thanks to him that they could massacre the monsters while enduring daily life in that harsh world!</p><br/><p>A party-specialized evolution\u2026 It was impossible for a natural-born loner like Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan was satisfied that his son grew up to take care of everyone unlike himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, is it really true that only 10 days passed here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, not a single day less or more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. That\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat amounted only to ten days\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the returnees from the Abandoned World went into a group panic after realizing that only 10 days passed on Earth while 1000 days passed in that world, but as all media including the News was the same as before, they acknowledged reality.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was a great fortune that they were strengthened prior to the 2nd Great Cataclysm of Earth. Although, no one could answer why the flow of time was strange in that world.</p><br/><p>[Do you really think that? Don\u2019t you think it has too much to do with you consider it a coincidence, IlHan?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s retort. Yu IlHan heaved a deep sigh even though he had expected that reaction a little. It was annoying enough that he had suffered alone for a thousand years on Earth, but if it was due to him, then how would he feel!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you think that I have something to do with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But it\u2019s too similiar to be a coincidence\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yes, he was in fact a little suspicious. Didn\u2019t Yu IlHan\u2019s dropout period 100 times that of the expected period?</p><br/><p>10 years into 1,000 years; ten days into 1,000 days\u2026 The ratio was too perfect to be considered a coincidence!</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it that there is some transcendent power in the Yu family?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Rather than their own power, I think that their hidden records may be connected to Earth to cause a change.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[I knew it\u2026\u2026 There was no way Yu IlHan is an ordinary human when he has a pancosmic-level title.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you look at me like that, you won\u2019t get answers. And Erta, come with me to the rooftop later.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the millennium of his dropout period, Liera only explained it as an unknown error, and Yu IlHan who was busy living out that thousand years, didn\u2019t look much into it. Even if he did, nothing would change anyway.</p><br/><p>However, Yumir, who was born from Yu IlHan\u2019s mana, ended up being trapped in an Abandoned World. If there was anything different from Yu IlHan himself, it was that he was together with allies, and the Akashic Record was connected to it.</p><br/><p>He came back after spending a thousand days, and only ten days had passed on Earth in the meantime. Looking at the two incidents separately, it could be said to be a coincidence that can happen on a multiversal scale, but connecting Yu IlHan and Yumir\u2019s existence together, the story became entangled.</p><br/><p>[What if that unknown error is related to IlHan\u2019s record?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s nothing \u2018what if\u2019 about it. The other groups will wish to capture Yu IlHan and not kill him.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good thing since IlHan is safer now!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing inside a tiger\u2019s mouth would be much safer than my own position right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, there were too little samples to declare that Yu IlHan was the reason. At that moment, Liera clapped and spoke.</p><br/><p>[Then you can just increase the samples, can\u2019t you? IlHan, you can have a child!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll take the right.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Then I\u2019ll beat up the left.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Spiera and Erta forced Liera into submission when Liera was acting all nervous, twisting up her body, saying \u2018How is it, a genius idea, no?\u2019.</p><br/><p>With the worry that this idiot may commit a taboo if they didn\u2019t make Yu IlHan into a higher existence quickly, Erta spoke.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, I\u2019ll throw this idiot in the recycling bin. Meanwhile, please confirm if there was anything similar between your parents. It should be fine to get only the hints.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then please recycle her properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to go meet grandpa and grandma!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had a glance at Kang MiRae and Na YuNa, who was playing ping pong with the elves, and thought about when they\u2019d leave as this was the third day, as he left.</p><br/><p>After concealing himself, it took a few flap of his wings to arrive at his house. Both of his parents were home, and Yu IlHan entered with Yumir in front of him. Yumir shouted this as he went in the front door even though Yu IlHan didn\u2019t make him to:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, grandma. Hello!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, you\u2019re here\u2026.. Oh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not IlHan!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Quite a lot of time was needed for the house, which flipped due to the sudden appearance of an 11 year-old-looking child, to turn calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about incubation with mana or anything like that, but it\u2019s your son alright. He looks after you. Of course, he\u2019s much more handsome compared to you at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YongHan, Yu IlHan\u2019s father judged, after observing for a while. Yu IlHan added with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also your grandson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the child\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was the mother\u2019s, Kim YeSeul\u2019s, question. Yu IlHan honestly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe died before his birth. Dragons are born from eggs after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, sonny, you became a widower. Aren\u2019t you lonely, Mir?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine because there\u2019s dad. And pretty noonas too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOho? Pretty noonas? Mir, won\u2019t you elaborate more on that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul urged with a bright smile. Unlike Yu YongHan in a slight panic due to this unrealistic situation, she was very different. Moreover, she looked like she had become even younger after all this time.</p><br/><p>Now it was for sure. Unlike his father who was stuck in 1st class, his mother was levelling up! And perhaps, she was at least 2nd class already.</p><br/><p>2nd classes belonged to the top 3% of humanity right now. Although he thought this before, but if he had any talent, perhaps it was inherited from his mother?</p><br/><p>Then perhaps his mother was\u2026? Yu IlHan asked her with a slight nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, was there anything special that happened in the \u201910 years\u2019 youspent in Ya-umin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYa-umin? Ah, Oooh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul tilted her head before laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, nothing happened at all. Even though I\u2019m quite good if I look like this at my age!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm, it seems like she misunderstood. Yu YongHan laughed at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018good\u2019. You\u2019re an old lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, everyone looks at least 20 years younger than you when I go outside. People talk bad about you, and not me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s right about that, dad. Please level up even while taking it easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing safe about levelling up, son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm, it seems like his mother wasn\u2019t it. And from how his dad looked, it looks like it wasn\u2019t him either.</p><br/><p>Yes, of course. The twisted time axis in Yu IlHan\u2019s and Yumir\u2019s trapped worlds were simply coincidence. There was no way such a record would be hidden inside a guy who couldn\u2019t even wield mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his worries ended as just worries, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Although he never doubted the fact that he became this strong precisely due to the thousand years on Earth, never was it fun to talk about it with a light smile. If his parents suffered such pain, then Yu IlHan would also find it hard.</p><br/><p>Now that he settled down, he became hungry. As he couldn\u2019t go back home and eat when his mother was in front of him, Yu IlHan spoke firmly as if he had lent some money to them. It was the privilege of the son.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFood! Food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he looked 11 on the outside, Mir was still 1 year\u2026\u2026 no, 3 years old. When he imitated Yu IlHan while laughing, Kim YeSeul stood up with a satisfied smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make a feast so eat to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she seemed to head off to the kitchen, when she turned back and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so? Who\u2019s my daughter-in-law candidate among those pretty noonas? I\u2019m completely fine with multiple candidates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s completely none!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted Yu IlHan. Although someone\u2019s face passed by in his mind, Yu IlHan denied that and spoke confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no woman in this world that would marry your son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a boast? Then try saying that to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, how could I send this son off to marriage? \u2013 Kim YeSeul about her son\u2019s future, as she headed off to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Only Yu IlHan and Kang MiRae treat Na YuNa like she\u2019s nothing.</p><br/><p>Hard-carried : You grabbed onto the useless ones\u2019 collars and dragged them with you.</p><br/><p>It seems like it wasn\u2019t the first time Spiera and Erta did that before.</p><br/><p>Sons are said to take after their mothers. Yumir takes after both Lecidna and Yu IlHan, but it seems IlHan takes after his mother. FYI, I also take after my mother (Not the translator but author)</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not sure about multiple candidates, but there sure is an angel candidate, mother-in-law!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/>\n</div>"}

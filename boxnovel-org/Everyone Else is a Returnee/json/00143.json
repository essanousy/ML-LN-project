Yay!\u201d (Na YuNa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just your body that\u2019s leaning!\u201d (Kang MiRae)</p><br/><p>[Kyak, a bomb!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You keep covering the screen with those wings!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The members enjoying the game were two idiots and two retorters. The rest of the members were staring at the large screen as they moved their upper bodies along with the game, almost as if it was them who were playing it.</p><br/><p>He could see friendship that couldn\u2019t be created over just ten days. He found it amazing that Liera managed to join that group.</p><br/><p>Yumir seemed like he wanted to join so he let him go, when Spiera approached him in his stead.</p><br/><p>[It seems like there was nothing much.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of them were extremely normal. Fortunately.\u201d</p><br/><p>If any one of the two experienced a thousand years, then they should have reacted to Yu IlHan\u2019s words in some way. Yu IlHan was sure that the two had lived ordinary lives as he had confidence in reading other people\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>[I also received reports from various angels from the two worlds that they went to. The two did indeed spend ten years with others, and they returned with the other humans. Although I can\u2019t be sure yet, there\u2019s a higher probability of some other element being the cause and not the genetic elements.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan laughed as he nodded. Then, he realised the hidden intent in Spiera\u2019s words and asked her while his brows were twitching.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you send me when you could do it yourself? No, well, it wasn\u2019t for nothing since I could introduce Mir to them and I saw their face, but even so.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You should know very well that angels are imperfect. There may be some things that they have missed out. That\u2019s why I wanted you to confirm for yourself.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>In the first place, if the angels were perfect, there was no way they would be annoyed by other transcender factions, nor would there be any traitors \u2013 Spiera added. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t say anything in return after all that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Liera and Erta\u2019s pride as higher angels shot through the skies when we first met, but you just acknowledge that fact\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no progress without understanding of imperfection. Those two are also making progress as they understand that.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t say so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan muttered while watching Liera covering the screen with her wings, and Erta scolding her mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know how much progress they\u2019ve made, from their looks now, they were hopeless. Even though they showed their smart sides in the beginning\u2026</p><br/><p>Although he liked their current states better, he sometimes missed their former figures. \u2013 As he was thinking that, Spiera spoke suddenly.</p><br/><p>[Rather than that, prepare.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare what?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The notice for the Battle of Competition went up. Just now.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s movements stopped momentarily. He felt his relaxing body tensing up in an instant.</p><br/><p>Battle of Competition. Why wouldn\u2019t he know about that? He decimated an entire empire in another world due to that.</p><br/><p>He had a glance at the people who were still playing the racing game and faced Spiera again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you can talk about it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s not much time left. This will be told to all the people of Earth soon.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many days is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[In 3 hours, the stage to pick the participants will be set.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Hours and not days!</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, that\u2019s quite a \u2018lot of time\u2019 you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no need to hurry. Participants selection will be held over 24 hours. In New York, where the battle with the Abandoned World took place.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Well, that place was the best since it was receiving the attention of everyone in this world.</p><br/><p>[Anyone can participate if they want to bring back Traps of Destruction to Earth. Only 1 thousand individuals will gain the qualifications to participate in the competition.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOne thousand\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head. He found something strange.</p><br/><p>If the number of participants numbered so high, was there a need to swallow Venezuela entirely? They wouldn\u2019t need to send a force numbering millions!</p><br/><p>[The rules of the competition differs according to the balance of forces in each world. Although the rule for this time is \u2018Elite Forces Battle\u2019, it is likely that Ferata had undergone an \u2018All Out Battle\u2019 in their 2nd Great Cataclysm.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds horrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>That meant that the empire of Kadra may have spread their forces beyond Venezuela. Thinking about the possibility that he hadn\u2019t prevented the invasion of Kadra empire, Yu IlHan felt the shivers.</p><br/><p>Of course, the empire in question should currently be near extinction due to monsters\u2026.. While he was thinking about that, Spiera\u2019s words hit his eardrums once again.</p><br/><p>[You need to acquire a good position in this competition.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t say it, I\u2019ll do my best but\u2026\u2026 why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Battle of Competition isn\u2019t held that frequently. And Earth right now, is progressing at an incredible rate. I guarantee that there won\u2019t be another Battle of Competition before Earth\u2019s 3rd Great Cataclysm.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>TheBattle of Competition was held in \u2018Lu F\u00fcera\u2019, a higher world under Heaven\u2019s Army. Naturally, no lower existence could enter that world. They could only enter that world in the Battle of Competition that was held regularly. As such, there was no way they could make an exception for Earth.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s instincts flared up after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cA higher world huh. Now that\u2019s making me feel worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>[While I understand what you\u2019re thinking.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Retorted Spiera with a smile.</p><br/><p>[There will not be a case where other transcender factions would invade in a higher world under Heaven. That\u2019s the same as angels invading beyond the Wall of Chaos and fighting against the main forces of the Destruction Demon Army, and coming back alive.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s one right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But that\u2019s\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re right.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan who was pointing towards a cowardly angel who blocked other\u2019s view just as her car was about to be passed by another car, Spiera could only nod.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll see to it that there will be more security in the venue.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. Oh, and get miss Na YuNa a proper angel. Although I don\u2019t care about the person herself, but as it is now, miss MiRae will get caught up in it. Mir will be sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll keep that in mind.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan approached the gaming group after that. The game had just ended and punishment was being brought upon Liera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI win you lose you get the bap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bap bap bap bap bap bap!\u201d</p><br/><p>[When\u2019s the \u2018bruise\u2019 dammit!] (Liera) (PR:Check footnotes, its some korean batsugame)</p><br/><p>1</p><br/><p>It seemed that everyone hated Liera as the simple punishment song was not ending and the total amount of hits was breaking through 300 hits. As he couldn\u2019t watch forever. Ilhan finished the game with a smack on the forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cBruise.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, I love you, IlHan!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah, you didn\u2019t even play, so you get the punishment too!\u201d (Na YuNa)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the household owner\u2019s right. Game\u2019s over, and rest is over too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they might feel a little disappointed as they didn\u2019t fill the entire 72 hours, but there was no more time to waste. Kang MiRae\u2019s expression also changed, it seemed that she noticed that Yu IlHan was about to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn 3 hours, there will be a stage to select the participants to participate in the Battle of Competition held by Heaven\u2019s Army. From what I\u2019ve heard, it has a lot to do with how successfully we can endure the 2nd Great Cataclysm. The details will be explained by Erta.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why am I always in charge of explanations!?\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll explain only once so listen carefully! The Battle of Competition refers to\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s shocking revelation continued. As everyone here knew that Heaven\u2019s Army\u2019s job lay in Traps of Destruction, they understood quickly.</p><br/><p>In the process, Yu IlHan found something new, which was the rules of the competition. He thought that it would be alright with destroying everything, but it didn\u2019t seem so.</p><br/><p>[Each participants will be given a minimum set of safety devices. The purpose of Heaven\u2019s Army is to distribute the Traps of Destructions, not to weaken the overall power of the worlds.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>To do that, every participant will be given a membrane of protection on top of their skin, and that protective membrane will shatter upon receiving a certain amount of damage, and eject the participant back to his or her own world. And the outcome will be decided by how many enemy participants they\u2019ve ejected under the duration of battle, or if the enemy side was all ejected.</p><br/><p>However, even if they won the battle, the ejected participant will not be able to participate again, so the important things lay in preserving forces as much as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if someone attacks with a force that could shatter and kill the participant at the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That protective membrane is the best we can do. It\u2019s a competition to protect their own worlds, so if they aren\u2019t prepared for such things, they shouldn\u2019t participate in the first place.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite cold of you there\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Battle of Competition was largely categorized into Junior and Senior, with Junior being a competition between worlds that are about to experience the 2nd Great Cataclysm, and Senior being a competition between worlds that are about to experience their third or further Great Cataclysm. The form of the competition was a winner-proceeds form, and only the 4 strongest in the Junior and the 4 strongest in the Senior, will be able to get their share of Traps of Destruction made of better materials.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it not a fair league-type competition, but a tournament one?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There are currently 48 worlds qualified to participate in the Junior tournament. We can\u2019t let the strongest thousand of each world fight 47 times. They\u2019d probably rather give up on the Traps of Destruction.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was an All Out Battle and not an Elite Forces Battle, then the situation would probably be more serious. Everyone accepted Erta\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cTop 4 of 48 worlds\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae sighed after realizing the significance of the situation, and Na YuNa looked dejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAngels only tell us things when it\u2019s just about to arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything even if you do know beforehand.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we still wanted to know early\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not all.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Although it would be good if it ended there, it did not. After the top 4 teams on both Junior and Senior, were selected, the classification of Junior and Senior disappeared, and the true finals will start.</p><br/><p>This was also the reason why Ferata invaded Earth before its 3rd Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because there are cases where the participants in the Junior tournament are stronger than the ones in the Senior tournament. However, if the competition ended while the Junior and Senior were still divided, then the Junior will have complaints right? Of course, they can also choose to give up at that point.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yes, the current forces of Earth was considerably strong considering that it was nearing its 2nd Great Cataclysm. Yu IlHan would also be annoyed if he was told not to fight when there was an opportunity to gain more Advanced Traps of Destruction.</p><br/><p>[To sum up. You just have to fight until the end and not lose.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the obvious advice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026We should hurry. We need to talk with the Front Line Alliance, and we also need to negotiate with the government of various countries in order to select a balanced party, and the most high-levelled party as possible\u2026\u2026. Oh, when does the selection end?\u201d</p><br/><p>[24 hours from the installation of the stage.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we need to hurry even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae packed her stuff quickly and called somewhere with her phone. It was probably to head to America.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go back to New York for quite a while, but we\u2019re going back immediately huh. Mr. IlHan, if it\u2019s alright with you, let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I have something to confirm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked Liera.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan monsters participate in the selection?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no restriction in the participants selection!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then elves too?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. In fact, not to mention the participants selection, the entire competition is not that strict. Monsters on human side. People from other world participating. Such things were never considered in the first place. It\u2019s Earth that\u2019s bad!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>So, that was why Ferata thought about participating in the competition with human skins on! Yu IlHan retorted to Liera who was giggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch, absurd, things, are, happening, on, Earth, right, now, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hiik.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan emphasized each word. Veins could be seen on his forehead. Liera was shocked and hiccup\u2019ed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you need to fix those rules in the future, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, sir!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we were the ones who received damage, let\u2019s leave this competition as is, and please do so from next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[We shall.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was ordering around an angel. Kang MiRae and Na YuNa were looking at that scene in amazement, while Spiera and Erta were sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease speak, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan turned his head after making Liera promise him, Ericia was there. She looked very trustworthy from how she approached him and waited for him after noticing that it was her they were talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease call Flemir. He\u2019ll go to New York as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough not satisfactory in your eyes, there are many wolves that are stronger than the people of Earth. Shall I gather all of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, just Flemir will do. Instead, pick the strong ones and let\u2019s make them protect Seoul while we\u2019re away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia left immediately to call Flemir and the other wolves. While Kang MiRae and Na YuNa were making relieved expressions, as they knew Flemir\u2019s strength, the elves approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, shall we gather the elves? If it\u2019s the strong warriors that have directly received training from you, they will step up in order to become your power whenever you wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe elves have it hard in Dareu. I brought the four of you since I couldn\u2019t help it, but I cannot allow any more than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone was smoothly making progress, if he took out any more, then the race may as well go extinct. He couldn\u2019t bring them here.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the four elves here had an average level of 130. As Pate had the highest level at 134, there was no need to call any more reinfor\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He thought up to there when something came up in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPat\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out the epic-ranked bow sleeping in his inventory, Deathgod\u2019s Trajectory, and handed it to him. After looking at that, everyone\u2019s attention was focused on it, not to mention Pat\u00e9.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, such a treasure\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, you think you can use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Although it will be very difficult. I think I can barely do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The user restrictions of Deathgod\u2019s Trajectory was a 3rd class archer main class and strength and agility over 250 each. As Pat\u00e9\u2019s stats focused on strength and agility rather than health, he could barely meet the requirements.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded and extended his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen give me your previous one and use that one from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9 became silent. He looked really feminine with tears glistening, so Yu IlHan pushed him away. Then he spoke to the elves who were looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do well, I\u2019ll make yours too in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do well\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we do well! An epic!\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves burned in passion after thinking that they may be able to wield epic ranked weapons in the future. Kang MiRae spoke in a vain voice after looking at that scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I knew you could create Legend-ranked ones since I saw it\u2026 you could even make Epic-ranked ones\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Living together with Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates for 2 years and 9 months, she now knew that they weren\u2019t human but elves, and that the weapons Vanguard sold world wide was all created by Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>The legend-ranked bracelet she received from Erta before the battle, was of very high quality, and it had helped out a lot in surviving in the other world. She was surprised that he was a smith as well but\u2026.. he could make epic ranked ones too!</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan only tilted his head and spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t make them as I wish, I get one if I get lucky once in a while. I\u2019ll give one to you too if I make one later. Mir seems to like you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMee! What about mee! I\u2019m also close with Mir! Mir totally likes me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I personally don\u2019t like you so no. Ask me again after 300 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>He could reject her so openly! Kang MiRae made a smile while seeing that. Even though it was supposed to be something bad for her clan, she somehow felt satisfied. Her heart fluttered.</p><br/><p>Yes. She was feeling fluffy since it looked like she was receiving special treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRae! You just smirked now didn\u2019t you! If I acquire an epic one, it will be used to help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t smirk at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Kang MiRae was acting clueless, Yu IlHan called Mir into his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile Ericia is away calling Flemir, I\u2019ll go to my workshop for a bit. I\u2019ll do a final check, and make Mir\u2019s new armor too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you can do that in that meanwhile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did indeed return Ericia and Flemir returned to the apartment. Although, he brought back something \u2018he didn\u2019t expect\u2019 on top of Yumir\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>They headed to New York along with Kang HaJin and the Lightning God clan members which Kang MiRae and the rest hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. A strict competition to pick one thousand people of Earth, was waiting for them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.or so it should have been.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>1.

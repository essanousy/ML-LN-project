Clouds are floating under the endless skies, and the birds are singing.\u2019</p><br/><p>[On days like this, Angels like you\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan extended his hand into the air. Eternal Flame and Echjar\u2019s breathing synchronized and the two of them released mana simultaneously. The energy of dragons and the energy of flames fused into one to form a huge wave of force, in the very next moment, Yu IlHan\u2019s domain was declared in this world that had lost its master.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Should be burning in hell!]</p><br/><p>Along with the Declaration skill, the Manifestation skill activated and colored an extremely small portion of the vast world into the color of Yu IlHan\u2019s aura. It was a dominating scene, but Liera, who was watching, screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDangerous! We\u2019ll really be sued!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI re-arranged it so it\u2019s fine.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was no longer a lower existence. He was the master of the vast world known as Dareu, and was also the lord of all dragons! His records were depthless and vast, naturally, the reserve of mana which he possessed was also in a completely different dimension from before. With such mana taking over a portion of Heaven, what would happen? All beings, that is, all the angels of Heaven, recognized his presence.</p><br/><p>[This, absurd\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[A leader has attacked directly!?]</p><br/><p>[E, emergency! It\u2019s an emergency! A leader of a higher existence faction\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan! My God, Yu IlHan from Earth has!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know I\u2019d invade the last stage first, did you? All plot foreshadows in the world can go eat shit!</p><br/><p>However, what Yu IlHan was doing wasn\u2019t anything new either. Until now that is!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shouted in satisfaction after seeing the angels rushing towards him. He brought up his ruling power through the Declaration skill!</p><br/><p>[From this moment on, and for only this moment, there will be a grand event for the announcement of Dragon\u2019s Nest\u2019s existence!]</p><br/><p>Such light words, were not something anyone would expect from a leader of an entire organization. But,</p><br/><p>[Recruiting new members to join Dragon\u2019s Nest! As long as your records are intact, it\u2019s fine even if you completely fall to a lower existence! From an angel into a dragon, an opportunity to be reborn into a cooler self! There are not that many chances nor there is much time, grab your tickets now while they are still available!]</p><br/><p>[What\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>Thought light words, his meaning behind them struck Heaven strong. Of course, the majority of the angels snorted at his words, but none thought that he was lying. Angel to a fallen angel, fallen angel to a gatekeeper. There were plenty of precedents.</p><br/><p>It was just that they thought that Yu IlHan was struggling to increase his forces since his faction was relatively new.</p><br/><p>[This world is the main camp of the Heaven\u2019s Army! I can commend you for having the talen to become a higher existence on your own, but how dare you try to drag angels into becoming mere reptiles! In God\u2019s name, we the angels shall pierce you until you die!]</p><br/><p>[Stab the eyes of that cretin and pull his heart out! Envoys of God, it\u2019s time to execute!]</p><br/><p>So there were so many angels in the main army. Yu IlHan made a bitter smile while looking at the angels that couldn\u2019t be counted with just thousands or tens of thousands. Well, he did know that it was a rather crucial time, but why were they all stuck at home when they had so many lower worlds to attend to?</p><br/><p>It seems like these guys needed a rather striking awakening. Yu IlHan resolved himself and brought up his mana once again.</p><br/><p>[I shall bind myself with the power granted unto me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI thus declare, [I cannot lie.]\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nonsense!]</p><br/><p>He bound himself through Declaration. With this, he could really not lie. Using his power to restrain himself\u2026 such a foolish thing to do!</p><br/><p>However, he needed that right now.</p><br/><p>[God is no longer in Heaven. Your God is creating a new army in order to erase everything. You are all abandoned as a failed project. To the God of Heaven, you are merely luggage that will get in his way.]</p><br/><p>[Nonsense!]</p><br/><p>[H, how dare you try to taint the name of the LORD\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[I shall tell speak again.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s lips curved into a thick smile. With the ensemble of Declaration and Manifestation skills, his expression could be seen from anywhere in Heaven, and his voice was omnipresent.</p><br/><p>[I do not lie. The God of Heaven has abandoned all of you.]</p><br/><p>[Y, you\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Kill him! Punish the evil cretin that taints the name of the Creator!]</p><br/><p>The 7th class archangels that were so hard to see normally appeared all of a sudden here and there. As expected of the biggest faction. Even though Yu IlHan had killed and stolen away many of them, there were so many high-ranked angels left. They were one frightening force alright.</p><br/><p>[How dare you lie!]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s a leader that just ascended! Bring down that false God and butcher him! Such is God\u2019s orders!]</p><br/><p>[I declare in the name of Archangel Miriel! He\u2019s an evil that we must eliminate, more so than Satan!]</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way Yu IlHan\u2019s voice could reach them so easily when they denied everything. However, he could still see ripples here and there. Now, it was time to deal the strongest strike.</p><br/><p>[Open your eyes and see for yourselves. Open your ears and listen carefully.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s lips still retained its smile. Mocking their foolishness, he extended one hand toward his side.</p><br/><p>[From where did your so called \u2018orders\u2019 come from? I can guarantee that they were from the Four Great Archangels rather than God. Isn\u2019t this true, Uriel?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What?]</p><br/><p>[Lady, Uriel\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>He had the strongest trump card that could strip all their falsehood, namely, Uriel. Under Yu IlHan\u2019s orders, she stepped forward but still glared at him once.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite the vicious person you are. You could have told me about this beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no fun though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really\u2026\u2026 take after Gabriel.\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally realized what Yu IlHan needed her for, accepted it and joyfully played her part. Poaching angels! There was no way she would refuse this. In fact, this was natural. Since she had revealed her identity and left Heaven, what was there for her to fear! What was there for her to hesitate! If she could draw in the feeble and ignorant companions to her side without killing them, what was there for her to be indecisive about!</p><br/><p>A ripple spread around to all angels that formed the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>[No way, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s her.]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a lie, she\u2019s a fake! There\u2019s no way Lady Uriel of the Four Great Archangels has joined that evil cretin\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s false. It\u2019s Yu IlHan\u2019s deceit\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Uriel. Everyone, I could not reveal my true feelings until now in fear of Michael\u2019s power. However, please listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel looked down at everyone with her brilliant looks so that anyone could realize it was her. Four pairs of dragon wings being unfolded behind her was a grand spectacle. Everyone could feel her league, grandeur and mana.</p><br/><p>[8 wings\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[That. That\u2019s a lie. That is not Lady Uriel. She isn\u2019t an 8th class either. It\u2019s a dragon! There\u2019s no way a dragon\u2019s wings can represent her league!</p><br/><p>\u201cI.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s nonchalant, yet firm voice broke all suspicions and doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm Uriel herself; one of the former Four Great Archangels, and am now a dragon of the 8th class. I am here to prove the absence of God. The God of Heaven is in no way, the Creator, nor was he a good ruler. He\u2019s merely a tyrant attempting to erase all worlds and create a garden of puppets.\u201d</p><br/><p>[No! That isn\u2019t true!]</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no way that is the case\u2026\u2026 Please, Lady Uriel!]</p><br/><p>[Please tell us that it isn\u2019t true! Ooh, please!]</p><br/><p>Whenever Uriel spoke a line, angels could be seen struggling in various places. They could probably no longer reject Uriel herself as the angels, and even high angels and archangels, no longer tried to attack them.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that it was about time where he could enjoy some popcorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite interesting to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling. I thought that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAah, how did I end up falling for such\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep feeling like we\u2019re the bad guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Uriel\u2019s mass-range mental attack had just begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease listen to my words. The Lord of Dragon\u2019s Nest, Yu IlHan, that you see right here is very rude, arrogant and egoistic, but is a person that tries to protect all who enter his service. Just with that, he is worthy for us to serve!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mental attack did a collateral damage! However, Uriel ignored Yu IlHan\u2019s sharp glare and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had to endure too much sadness until now, and had to watch as countless lives were sacrificed. Order was broken, while law had collapsed. God is attempting to bring doom to all worlds for his desires!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel gave a glance to Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan understood her intentions and took out an intact body of Legna from his inventory. A deformed ring of light and twisted pairs of wings made the angels drink a gasp of air after looking at it. None of them had the Record skill, but could vaguely estimate what power it possessed, and how it was created.</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s voice maxed out in rage after looking at Legna.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is his new army. We were\u2026\u2026 abandoned. He was never the Creator. He requested sacrifices for the greater good, but his ideal of a greater good was merely for the sake of furthering his own trivial desires! Angels of the Heaven\u2019s Army! Please listen to my words\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s eyes glistened in tears. She could probably win the leading actress award with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, do not accept any more sacrifices in vain. By the side of this immature ruler, please protect this ugly yet oh so beautiful world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I sense thorns in your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel ignored his words again and wiped away her tears again. With that, the world temporarily regained its peace. The flames that composed Yu IlHan\u2019s domain was still burning but the angels no longer felt a sense of rejection towards them.</p><br/><p>Was Uriel\u2019s heartfelt persuasion transmitted to them? Little by little, some angels threw away their hostility and approached Yu IlHan and the others. Of course, they could not achieve their objective.</p><br/><p>[I will not accept it even despite that.]</p><br/><p>A voice that snapped the wills of all resounded across the sky. Yu IlHan felt that it was his turn and raised his head.</p><br/><p>He was there. The one that ruled fire, and was the greatest in this God-less world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be here around this time, Michael.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I never knew you\u2019d so fearlessly rush into Heaven. However, Yu IlHan, do you not know that this place is where all power of Heaven is focused? Do you really believe that I only have the power to brawl mindlessly?]</p><br/><p>Michael was inferior to Yu IlHan in all aspects. His flames obeyed Yu IlHan instead and all of his artifacts were influenced by Yu IlHan. However, that was different in Heaven where God\u2019s power ruled. Holding onto the name of \u2018God\u2019s executor\u2019, he possessed the largest fragment of God\u2019s power and would possess a power and mana that equaled any other supreme being!</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan\u2019s expression was still calm even after feeling that vast power.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if that were the case. You lived countless times more than me but there\u2019s no way you can only get into brawls.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then you came here knowing all that? Even accompanied by a traitor\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Michael\u2019s gaze on Uriel glowed strangely. Oh, from his sticky gaze, it seems like they weren\u2019t in a simple relationship either. Yu IlHan instinctively felt so.</p><br/><p>[The fact that Uriel, you are there means that Gabriel is also a traitor! Yes, Gabriel! So he\u2019s the one leading the Garden of Sunset! So you two deceived the Heaven\u2019s Army, the world, and even the Akashic Record!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is you who deceived us. Why did your mind change? You were shining brightly and purely when we promised to protect the world with our power and declared God as wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted Uriel. All angels looked at Michael. They requested an answer from him.</p><br/><p>[I am the same as that time.]</p><br/><p>Claimed Michael.</p><br/><p>[God, has definitely chosen a wrong path. I had to turn my back on him in order to protect his dignity. And yes, I still haven\u2019t changed my mind about that. I will protect the current world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why!\u201d</p><br/><p>[And I will stand above him.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026 was that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel asked back. At that point Michael\u2019s body was wrapped by a mysterious brilliance.</p><br/><p>[I have been enlightened after a bout with that trivial being. I have realized the power I need, and took it. With that, I have become anew. Yes, now that all are looking at me, this is the right time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel panicked. In her scenario, she had no line to counter against Michael\u2019s craziness! However, Yu IlHan made a thick smile after looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, now this is done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is done, Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I shall stop being an angel, Uriel! I will transcend fire and become light! I! AM GOD!]</p><br/><p>Michael released a blinding brilliance. As he had said, everyone could see the fire around him subliming into light.</p><br/><p>Everyone realized. It wasn\u2019t just pure magic power. It was a phenomenon when a being stepped onto a new realm.</p><br/><p>Michael was now reaching the position of God from being just an executor who worked for him. He took in God\u2019s power, and absorbed all the records necessary for him to ascend and reached the realm of supreme beings!</p><br/><p>[The God you want, is here. You need not doubt, nor worry. You shall follow me!]</p><br/><p>Five wings of light sprouted behind Michael\u2019s back. It was a dominating scene. Realizing one\u2019s own powerlessness and growing\u2026 that was only allowed to main characters though! So Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t a main character after all?</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, everything has gone wrong! We need to run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean run. It just became easier to differentiate between ally and enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was still as calm as ever. His gaze towards Michael that ascended to the realm of transcenders even looked like a girl in love.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was worried that he might not hold out because he was so weak. But with this, I\u2019m relieved. At least he won\u2019t die until I kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His calmness even dropped Uriel\u2019s nervousness into naught! She asked, given up.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Lord, do you have anything that you\u2019re afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do. Mom being angry is one of them? So don\u2019t go seducing my dad okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel gave up on understanding. At the same time, Michael held up a spear of light and pointed it at Yu IlHan, while Yu IlHan leisurely created a spear of flames in retaliation.</p><br/><p>[I shall kill you and bring order to the universe!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have killed me a thousand times over using words alone! Why don\u2019t you come at me for real this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>[As you wish! Die, Yu IlHan!]</p><br/><p>Two spears swung against each other. With a vast distance between the two, two transcenders clashed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

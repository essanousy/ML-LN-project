Everyone was frozen stiff, but it wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t know who she was. Rather, it was due to the fact that they knew her too well.</p><br/><p>[Y, you. You should have died!?]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re\u2019s leisurely expression cracked. He had the confidence to face against any other 7th class beings, but the story changed if it was Heli\u00e8na. He had come here precisely because he had heard that Heli\u00e8na had died, but she just showed up right in front of him!</p><br/><p>[I did die. But I came back to life. Tada!]</p><br/><p>[No way. An undead\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>[Do I look like one?]</p><br/><p>[Eek\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>When Heli\u00e8na made a tempting smile and Sati\u00e8re\u2019s body shrunk back all by itself. Of course she didn\u2019t look like an undead. The rosy cheeks filled with vitality, lively eyes and her chest that bounced up and down every time she breathed in and out \u2013 everything about her was filled with vitality!</p><br/><p>The thick magic power she emitted flowed out towards the battlefield. From that moment, many of the small fry started experiencing difficulties controlling their own bodily impulses.</p><br/><p>[How did this happen!]</p><br/><p>[I can feel the energy of the Destruction Demon Army. But she is not one of them!?]</p><br/><p>[She has entrapped that energy. But how\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>Whether it was the Heaven\u2019s Army, the Army of Brilliant Light, the Garden of Sunset, or the Destruction Demon Army, they could not hide their shock after seeing Heli\u00e8na alive and well. The only ones that moved under the cover of the commotion were the ones who knew she was alive since the start!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve shown yourself, hold him still!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m thankful for your words, darling.]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s subordinated to a lower existence as well? \u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know what method you used but it disgusts me. I feel like I\u2019m being toyed with.]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re\u2019s gaze headed towards Yu IlHan \u2013 the lower existence that was wiping out the fallen angels even while the battlefield was in commotion; the one that was wielding the flames of souls.</p><br/><p>It was him. Everything started going wrong after he interfered with matters between higher existences.</p><br/><p>[I really must kill him here and now.]</p><br/><p>[Sati\u00e8re, You. Will. Play. With. Me?]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re\u2019s wings forcefully closed. The distance between Heli\u00e8na and Sati\u00e8re was being closed very rapidly. It wasn\u2019t Heli\u00e8na that was moving, Sati\u00e8re was moving towards her all by himself.</p><br/><p>[Kugh, you damn bitch!]</p><br/><p>[Kyaak, I\u2019m so scared.]</p><br/><p>When Sati\u00e8re focused his heat energy in his two eyes and shot it, the higher existences that comprised the Destruction Demon Army, the Garden of Sunset, and the Army of Brilliant Light stood in front of her in order to protect her. Tens of corpses appeared instantly.</p><br/><p>[How can you so mercilessly slaughter your own fallen angels!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>All the folded wings were unfolded, and Sati\u00e8re\u2019s eyes glowed once again. Two rays of light aimed for Heli\u00e8na, but it was once again deflected by other higher existences. However, Sati\u00e8re didn\u2019t shrink back and continued on with his next attack immediately. The screams of fallen angels dispersed in the air with pitch black feathers.</p><br/><p>[Lord Sati\u00e8re!]</p><br/><p>[My apology, kugh!]</p><br/><p>[Hmph.]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re snorted. He knew very well that her charm would become stronger the more he hesitated. Succubui were the masters of emotions. The best way to win against her was to continuously attack without thinking about anything!</p><br/><p>[Shall we bet on whether I\u2019m able to pull your wings out first or if all the higher existences die on the battlefield before I accomplish it!]</p><br/><p>[Sati\u00e8re. You\u2019re as brave as ever. Though, you\u2019re still as hurried as ever too.]</p><br/><p>No matter how strong Heli\u00e8na\u2019s charm was, she could not perfectly control a 7th class being. It was also like that with the 8th Wing of Brilliant Light, Nati\u00e8re, and the Chief Gatekeeper Kelatuke of the Garden of Sunset as well. Didn\u2019t she shave their will to fight little by little and made them expend their strength on others? Moreover, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s current power was much weaker than before.</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re lacked the slightest intention to allow her the time to do her thing. This was a battle that had the name of the Army of Brilliant Light at stake. Even if all his subordinates died, he could not damage his reputation!</p><br/><p>At that time, Heli\u00e8na suddenly started giggling.</p><br/><p>[Sati\u00e8re, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re mistaking something?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Mm?]</p><br/><p>[Oh, my, you forgot everything because I was too pretty, right?]</p><br/><p>[If those are your final words, then I\u2019ll kil\u2026\u2026 what!?]</p><br/><p>He only thought of killing Heli\u00e8na as fast as possible before erasing Yu IlHan, but at that point, he was already being toyed around with. He had forgotten about the most important thing.</p><br/><p>Think about it, why did Heli\u00e8na show up in the first place?</p><br/><p>\u201cI found a trace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. It was to buy time for Kang MiRae to create a gate that leads to the main headquarters of the Army of Brilliant Light! Sati\u00e8re\u2019s expression turned pale in an instant after realizing that.</p><br/><p>[This, damned!]</p><br/><p>[Kyahahaha. You\u2019re so cute when you panic like that!]</p><br/><p>How could he forget? He had originally come here to prevent the case where higher existences flocked to the main headquarters of the Army of Brilliant Light!</p><br/><p>[You bitch\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>[Even if you look at me with such heated eyes, Heli\u00e8na already has an owner. How unfortunate~]</p><br/><p>[You dare, you dare toy around with the 4th Wing of Brilliant Light!]</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a cheap price for having a look at my face, no?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s smile that leisurely looked back at his killing intent was more evil than anything. The Succubus Queen that played around with the hearts of men \u2013 There were no words on losing in her dictionary! Kang MiRae soon shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you dare!]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re, who had realized his mistake a little too late, hurled all sorts of attacks towards Kang MiRae, but Yu IlHan had already returned to the Flying fortress at that point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHbbbbbbb!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soulflame chains that comprised Falling Down had tangled itself up to form a gigantic shield and defended against Sati\u00e8re\u2019s attack before disappearing. Yu IlHan felt his Falling Down domain being forcibly cancelled and shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, he\u2019s insanely strong alright. I can\u2019t even touch him for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s amazing that you blocked his attack in the first place. Darling, you\u2019re so cool\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say this, Liera, but you\u2019re not that much different usually.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Damn\u2026\u2026 block by magic from a mere lower existence!]</p><br/><p>Although it was from Kang MiRae, the gate had formed an independent sentience and formed itself automatically in midair. As long as the magic was complete, even Sati\u00e8re couldn\u2019t forcibly destroy it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention destroying, it was becoming an even bigger gate by using the magic power he emitted as fuel.</p><br/><p>[I, it\u2019s opening.]</p><br/><p>[It really is opening.]</p><br/><p>[The world of the Army of Brilliant Light\u2026\u2026 The Netherworld!]</p><br/><p>All beings in the battlefield were shocked. The Army of Brilliant Light was shrouded in more secrecy than the Heaven\u2019s Army. Never did they imagine the world where they mainly resided in was revealed like this! From the moment the gate opened, they could feel a transcendental power twitching beyond it, but the Destruction Demon Army did not care as instinct was on a higher rank than reason for them.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the gate that lady Heli\u00e8na has opened!]</p><br/><p>[Kihahahahahahaha! That side looks fun too!]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s prey on the flesh of fallen angels!]</p><br/><p>[You damn maggots!]</p><br/><p>The moment a gate leading to the Netherworld was connected, the alliance crumbled. Although it was unstable from the moment of its construction, who would have known it would have collapsed like this? The fallen angels guarded the gate in panic, but that was no different from raising a shield to defend against the waves. Not to mention the Destruction Demon Army, even those from the Garden of Sunset jumped in on the ride very soon.</p><br/><p>[Things are becoming very interesting!]</p><br/><p>[Fufu, is this the time to choose the place of my death? Mine will be over there. I think a sunset in the paradise of the fallen is quite a way to die too!]</p><br/><p>Matters were enlarged in an instant. When hundreds, thousands and even more higher existences flocked to the gate, an endless stream was formed. The Destruction Demon Army were led by their instincts, while the Garden of Sunset were driven by whim! The fallen angels quickly came to a decision.</p><br/><p>[Return!]</p><br/><p>[We need to go back and block the gate ourselves\u2026\u2026 kugh!]</p><br/><p>[Destruction Demon Army\u2026\u2026 we will not forget this!]</p><br/><p>The figures of fallen angels started disappearing from the battlefield. They had given up on attacking the Heaven\u2019s Army and opted to protect the world they resided in!</p><br/><p>The main enemy in the War of the Wall of Chaos, the Destruction Demon Army, had already formed a flood that headed to the Netherworld, and as two factions had given up on the attack, there was no reason for the Garden of Sunset to attack the Heaven\u2019s Army as well. They also decided to join and watch what the world of fallen angels looked like.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, Heli\u00e8na\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Even Sati\u00e8re who remained until the very end in attempt to block the flow, in the end, decided to give up on it and chose to retreat. Even while his body integrated into a different dimension of space, he glared at the two.</p><br/><p>[I will not forget this insult. I shall definitely snap your necks personally.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t go, and play with me a little more, Sati\u00e8re. You should notice my charm if you stay with me more!]</p><br/><p>The insides of Sati\u00e8re\u2019s head blanked for a moment when Heli\u00e8na winked. She hadn\u2019t said that for nothing. If he stayed here anymore, he would be affected by her charm!</p><br/><p>[Kugh!]</p><br/><p>Sati\u00e8re provoked and instead gotten damage, and decided to leave hurriedly. When that happened, the chaotic battlefield had become considerably quiet.</p><br/><p>The gate still hadn\u2019t closed yet, and the stream of Destruction Demon Army members did not stop, but at least, there were no more that tried to invade Heaven by going over the Wall of Chaos.</p><br/><p>[You really did it\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Titaera muttered in disbelief. Even though she was one of the ones who formulated this plan, she had no confidence in her ability to carry it out! Just as Yu IlHan was about to nitpick with her, Titaera abruptly turned her head towards him even though she shouldn\u2019t have noticed what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>[And so? What is that succubus!]</p><br/><p>[My name is Heli\u00e8na!]</p><br/><p>[E, eek!]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s demonic charm couldn\u2019t be avoided just because one was female. Titaera desperately tried to ignore Heli\u00e8na and complained to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[She should have definitely died! But how can she be alive in this place!? Moreover, I can feel the aura of the Destruction Demon Army from her, but how can she kill those of her own faction without any drawbacks! How is she not chased out of the Destruction Demon Army even though she had gone against their rules!? No, in the first place, why is she listening to you when she\u2019s from the Destruction Demon Army!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it, miss high angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I have any obligations to reply to your question?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether Titaera and Yu IlHan were quarreling or not, Kang MiRae, who now felt her strength draining from her body after the successful mission, collapsed on the spot. Yu IlHan managed to catch her even while replying looking back at Titaera\u2019s scary glare with leisurely eyes. This was a small consideration only possible for a professional loner with the skill of wide vision!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, Miss MiRae. Perfect use of magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae thought that she may have become too simple. She was in a completely groggy state after using one grand magic after another in the midst of higher existences, but she instantly recovered after hearing that line in his arms!</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s smile that looked as if she knew very well how she was feeling made her very annoyed, but Kang MiRae decided to stay still as she didn\u2019t want this moment to end. It was unknown whether Yu IlHan knew of her current feelings or not, but he mercilessly took his hands off her after supporting her up to stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like our end of the deal is complete, so let\u2019s go get the other artifact.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wait. Explain properly about Heli\u00e8na!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this already, but that wasn\u2019t in our contract. Like how you didn\u2019t send out a 7th class archangel while we were doing our mission\u2026\u2026 huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head while coldly replying to Titaera. He could feel two gigantic auras flying straight towards where they were from far beyond the Wall of Chaos.</p><br/><p>[Heli\u00e8na!]</p><br/><p>[Kuhaaaaa! Heli\u00e8na!]</p><br/><p>[Oh my, things became difficult again.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na shrugged her shoulders after hearing the loud roars that filled the battlefield. Yu IlHan narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain, Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh, jeez, it\u2019s embarrassing, you know? \u2026\u2026 don\u2019t ask me twice, darling. Didn\u2019t I say there were a lot of men in unrequited love with me?]</p><br/><p>There were 7th class beings among them too!? Yu IlHan was about to ask that but became silent. The ones that appeared in that place spoke for themselves.</p><br/><p>[You were alive, Heli\u00e8na!]</p><br/><p>[Why is it that you\u2019re with them, Heli\u00e8na!?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at the figures of the two 7th class beings that he could not touch and shouted with a refreshing smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

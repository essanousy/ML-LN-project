I like your daringness.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, I also like my daringness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lightly smiled at Heli\u00e8na who expressed her like for him and did what he had to do first. That was to procure Erta!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere we go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like a kingfisher snatching a fish on the surface of the water and snatched Erta with one arm. Erta, who was suddenly snatched while being tense due to the appearance of two 7th class beings, blushed and spoke in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d ever see proactiveness from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite thankful, but this is no time for chatter.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan showed movements of moving towards Erta, the one who reacted first was none other than Spiera who was leading the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan! Erta is a traitor who allied with the Garden of Sunset and abandoned the Heaven\u2019s Army!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in my eyes, she\u2019s only a lower existence like Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s, what\u2026\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>She is really a lower existence! \u2013 Spiera fell into panic after seeing Erta as a lower existence without joining the Garden of Sunset despite losing her wings.</p><br/><p>However, too many things were happening to for her to judge things slowly. She could have taken her time if it was only Yu IlHan and Erta that were here, but right now, there was the 3rd Battalion Commander of the Destruction Demon Army, the 8th Wing of the Army of Brilliant Light, as well as a Chief Gatekeeper of the Garden of Sunset! This was no time to question Erta.</p><br/><p>Moreover, looking at those mighty Battalion Commanders. Even though the Heaven\u2019s Army was superior in number, right now, they were the most inferior of the groups. Right now, the most rational decision she could come to was\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 I shall question her sins later. Right now, we need to survive this battle.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLater?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan checked with a smile. Spiera gritted her teeth and shouted.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll give her the right to avoid responsibility!]</p><br/><p>\u201cErta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will not be attacked by the Heaven\u2019s Army anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s join hands then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You don\u2019t dare.]</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan tried to join with the Heaven\u2019s Army camp with Erta, Liera, Yumir, and Na YuNa, the Succubus Queen flapped her wings to block his way. Her violet eyes glistened mysteriously with mana.</p><br/><p>[Darling needs to go with me, no?]</p><br/><p>[No.]</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan replied without a change in expression, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s glistening eyes lost power and sank. She immediately realized what was happening to her.</p><br/><p>[Huh, did darling just deflect my charm? No way!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 way!\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was anything that Yu IlHan wanted to try out in Dareu, it was to fight while simultaneously activating the magic formation of Dareu to teleport while fighting. However, in the past, he had no spare magic stones to do that against the dragons, and this time, there were no enemies strong enough for him to use that trick on.</p><br/><p>But now, it became the perfect moment to use that trick. Yu IlHan immediately activated the magic formation and teleported to the middle of the ranks of angels.</p><br/><p>[Hick!]</p><br/><p>[Erta, just what did you do!]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, the first button is buttoned well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had made the situation so that four factions were going against each other, and he joined the Heaven\u2019s Army without much trouble as well. So, it could be said that his plans succeeded perfectly. Although the bad thing was that all the aggro was on him, but he had expected this much to happen!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiera, Heaven\u2019s Army won\u2019t bring a Battalion Commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We cannot call for a Battalion Commander so easily. It is the other factions that are abnormal for bringing so much battle power!]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you guys call for one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I see that it\u2019s definitely the time to do that.]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m really liking you more and more, what do I do.]</p><br/><p>[Give it up, Destruction Demon Army. I\u2019ll eat that man up.]</p><br/><p>[Oh, I never expected such an ignorant beast to understand the emotion of love.]</p><br/><p>[Heli\u00e8na, the alliance with the Destruction Demon Army is over. I\u2019m fine with you doing whatever you want, but you\u2019ll have to pay the price immediately!]</p><br/><p>[Aaah, I only came here for a date. Why is everyone acting so aggressively?]</p><br/><p>Good, just fight like that! And Spiera, you call for your commander quickly! \u2013 shouted Yu IlHan inwardly and prepare for battle. He got on top of the dragon form Yumir\u2019s back, and also let Liera, Erta and Na YuNa on.</p><br/><p>All of Yu IlHan\u2019s abilities would increase by 45% when he fought on top of a dragon. The first 15% was from the effects of the title \u2018Dragon\u2019s Ally\u2019 he acquired when he fought with Lecidna, and the additional 30% was from the Dragon-man resonance.</p><br/><p>On top of that, there was another 30% increase with Na YuNa\u2019s blessing, and the title \u2018Untouchable\u2019 would also add another 45% due to three leagues of difference. In other words, Yu IlHan\u2019s current battle power was at 220%. Also, there would be an additional 160% increase if he used a fire attribute attack. However, he didn\u2019t quite have the confidence to lower the league of 7th class beings with Falling Down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure about the Succubus Queen, but the other 7th classes will be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were planning to fight them after all\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Liera muttered in shock, Erta cast defensive magic on top of Yumir\u2019s body. As she had already consumed the remains of her angelhood, the magic was comparatively inferior, but it was still enough to deflect the magic from ordinary 5th class beings.</p><br/><p>[Arrogant, you do not ask for forgiveness but raise your weapon!]</p><br/><p>The gigantic shark didn\u2019t seem to like their actions though. The first one to move into the deadlock was also that shark!</p><br/><p>[I said you can\u2019t, didn\u2019t I?]</p><br/><p>And the Succubus Queen blocked its way. Her temptress violet eyes \u2013 Yu IlHan felt a slight chill in them. He thought that he may have misjudged things.</p><br/><p>He did not misjudge his own power, nor the enemy\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, he had misjudged the balance between the enemies.</p><br/><p>[Get lost, bat. You cannot interfere with my justified execution.]</p><br/><p>[Oh my, but I don\u2019t think so.]</p><br/><p>Violet-colored mana spread out from her like smoke! That, infiltrated the gigantic shark\u2019s metallic armor and penetrated him. The gigantic body of the shark that was soaring through the space towards Yu IlHan suddenly stopped like it was stuck on something.</p><br/><p>[Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>[Fufu, you thought it would be fine if you were of a different race? Unfortunately, my magic cannot be avoided with those petty measures alone!]</p><br/><p>When Heli\u00e8na extended her two arms wide, the violet-colored mana instantly spread through to the surroundings. The flow instantly covered not only Kelatuke, but the Army of Brilliant Light, the Heaven\u2019s Army and of course, Yu IlHan\u2019s group as well!</p><br/><p>[Yes, you want to go at it this way, right!?[</p><br/><p>The 8th Wing of Brilliant Light, Nati\u00e8re also agitated her mana after feeling that. The three pairs of black wings extended magnificently to draw in the surrounding mana, and shot them as rays of light towards Heli\u00e8na!</p><br/><p>However, not one of them struck the target. Right before they struck Heli\u00e8na, the rays of light all changed directions by themselves. Heli\u00e8na licked her lips with a seductive smile.</p><br/><p>[Nati\u00e8re, you also don\u2019t want to fight me, do you?]</p><br/><p>[This, monstrous bitch\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Nati\u00e8re grit her teeth. The rays of light all bent from Hel\u00e8na to strike Kelatuke, and Kelatuke immediately turned its body as if it had been was waiting for provocation and faced the Army of Brilliant Light. Of course, this was not what it wanted to do.</p><br/><p>[Damn, you bat bitch dare to control my body!]</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it heart-pounding? There, close your eyes and feel it. The blissful feeling that you may never experience in your life.]</p><br/><p>[Are you ignoring the long amount of time I\u2019ve lived for\u2026\u2026 Ahhhhhhhhh!]</p><br/><p>[That damned shark!]</p><br/><p>The energy that the shark spat out swiped against the Army of Brilliant Light. Nati\u00e8re did try her best to defend, but the energy she could not block instantly vaporized a few fallen angels. Heli\u00e8na laughed out while watching that.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing, shark? You need to put more effort into hitting the target!]</p><br/><p>[Heli\u00e8na, you bitch\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The effects didn\u2019t only reach them. Even some of the angels in the Heaven\u2019s Army, started twitching. The majority were male angels, but a few of the female angels were affected as well.</p><br/><p>[Kugh, Spiera-nim!]</p><br/><p>[Spiera, be careful! My body is not listening to me!]</p><br/><p>[You useless\u2026\u2026 eeek!]</p><br/><p>It only took a moment for an internal chaos to occur in the angel camp. Yu IlHan, who thought that higher existences should have high resistance to charm, looked at the battlefield that instantly became a mess and was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>Like this, there was no meaning for him to cooperate with the Heaven\u2019s Army! The battlefield that Yu IlHan had expected was not like this. Heli\u00e8na was clearly stronger than everyone else put together!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made Yumir retreat from the angels causing a mess and checked the state of his members.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problems here.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m also fine, dad!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, she is quite pretty but she still doesn\u2019t match me~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI too\u2026\u2026 can endure, just barely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Yu IlHan\u2019s group, who were objectively the most underpowered group, were safe from the charm! The higher existences really should give up working and start training \u2013 he truly thought that.</p><br/><p>[Darling, you do know that everything is because of you, right?]</p><br/><p>The next moment, Heli\u00e8na appeared in front of Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan thought about using the magic formation again to make some distance, but decided not to after concluding that nothing would change even if he did so, with the situation around him right now.</p><br/><p>Yes, failure was preset upon the moment he tried to use the help of a faction despite being a loner. In the end, he could only win everything by himself!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set things straight. It\u2019s because of you guys touching Dareu, not because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Heli\u00e8na head on. He gripped the spear in his hand, and made Yumir look down slightly just in case he was affected by the charm, and finally lowered his visor to cover his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kill that\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera tried to step up from his side, but Yu IlHan pushed her back. Even though Liera was burning in passion to protect him, it was impossible for her to go against Heli\u00e8na with the powers she currently had.</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s your girl. Oh my, how romantic. But, its alright. I don\u2019t care how many women you have.]</p><br/><p>She flew across the skies as if sliding, and lightly landed on Yumir\u2019s head. Yumir shook his head to shake her off, but if she was shaken off with just that, she wouldn\u2019t be 7th class.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll become mine anyway.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na approached Yu IlHan defenselessly. There were no signs of her attacking. No, she used her ability to protect him last time, so it should be fine to say that she had no hostility.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan hesitated whether he should strike out right now, or wait for a better opportunity, but the moment he hesitated, the physical distance between him and Heli\u00e8na approached 0.</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s hand touched Yu IlHan\u2019s visor. When she pushed it up, Yu IlHan was met with the mysteriously glistening violet eyes.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, you\u2019re looks are my type too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour looks aren\u2019t mine though.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Really? But you\u2019ll change your mind soon.]</p><br/><p>The moment Heli\u00e8na flicked a finger with the other hand, the violet fog that spread throughout the battlefield all gathered towards her. Following that, the three pairs of bat wings extended and enveloped Yu IlHan and Heli\u00e8na, and the full power from the Succubus Queen was focused on Yu IlHan alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni, you\u2019ll really die~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu IlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooh, Uraaaaaaaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>An overwhelming amount of mana, enough to distort space-time, storming around Yu IlHan was a very spectacular scene, but there were two beings in the middle that did not flinch at all. They were Yu IlHan and Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>[Now, please say you love me.]</p><br/><p>Whispered Heli\u00e8na in a sweet voice and took off his helmet. Yu IlHan replied to her with a somewhat dreamy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of my face, I can\u2019t read the text.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You have awakened Unshakable heart Lv Max. This is the highest tier skill in this category, and is impossible to evolve whether independently, or in fusion.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally realized.</p><br/><p>That there had simply been no moment so stimulating that it provoked his skill to awaken, ever since the first Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>N/A</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Some people seem to think that the translator of EER is Koukouseidesu, lol.</p><br/><p>Koukouseidesu, I think you always forget to put this part.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader/Editor: Koukouseidesu</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t omit it from now on\u2026. or in fact, you can just translate EER and you can take the role of translator for realz</p><br/><p>lul I can\u2019t remember since when it was omitted\u2026 lets get this straight guys!

Yu IlHan and the others slowly flew through the airs of the Palladian Empire on the two fortresses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that nothing happened here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan muttered just as shivers ran down in his spine. Something always happened in manga or novels when this line was said! However, Liera calmed him down from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf universe-shaking things happen wherever we go, there\u2019s no way this world was maintained like this until now.\u201d (T/N: \u2018wherever we go?\u2019 looks at title.)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut with Yu IlHan here, I\u2019m not sure what might happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta reacted with a voice full of worry. She thought that if Yu IlHan, who was at odds with all the existing higher existence factions right now, started something big for real, the angels in charge of this world would be the first ones to react sensitively.</p><br/><p>However, it was Yu IlHan this time that sniggered and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine. They can\u2019t do anything. I can speak from experience of having hung out with them for over a thousand years, so you can trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy beloved honey, can we have a little talk over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pushed back Liera who was trying to head-lock him and pointed somewhere. Liera thought she would purposely get deceived and turned around her head, when she was shocked by the pillar of light shooting out from one part of the imperial capital.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething did happen as soon as Ilhan arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! That\u2019s not my fault! Dammit, I knew it felt too serene!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was done in even while knowing that he had foreshadowed. This was disgraceful and greatly besmirched his reputation as a foreshadow meister. Yu IlHan bit his lips while emitting his own mana to imbue into the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic, hurry! Maximum speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll do it even if you didn\u2019t tell me to!]</p><br/><p>The two fortresses sped up immediately. With Na YuNa\u2019s blessing, the two left a trail of white light in the air. The pillar of light was now starting to dissipate, but Yu IlHan knew exactly where that place was. It was none other than the imperial castle of Palladia!</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this is Miss MiRae\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it since anything you say will be a foreshadow, IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh. How am I going to live on like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Flying fortress suddenly stopped in the air. At that moment, Yu IlHan extended his Ruin Calling without any hesitation and jumped down from the Flying fortress. Right now, there was no need to maintain concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Ilhan!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment a balcony on the west of the castle opened and Kang MiRae rushed out. Looking at her, who now had an even more mystic aura around her after a few years, Yu IlHan realized that she had entered 4th class and stopped right in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? Are you really the Mr. Yu IlHan? I just completed a method to go meet you right now\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComing to meet me? How can you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was about to ask but then saw the state of the room beyond the balcony. A mysterious current of mana was raging inside, and in the middle was a vortex of blackish-blue current of mana that lead to an unknown place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately realized the identity of that vortex. Once, those vortices appeared on Earth in a huge scale. However, he did not know why they existed inside Kang MiRae\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t think this was true, did Lanpas start walking on the same development path as Earth? Or did Kang MiRae make that thing? In whichever case, it still did not make any sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss MiRae, that is\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan, it really is you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the one with the ability to answer that question, Kang MiRae, seemed to have a hard time believing that he was here, and only looked at his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my, how amazing. Did you make this with your power alone, MiRae?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul, who appeared a step behind Yu IlHan exclaimed after looking at the vortex inside the room. Looking at her who was flying in the air leisurely, as expected of a mage that manipulated space, Kang MiRae took a step back when some uninvited guests appeared as well.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t tell me this is the place\u2026\u2026 that means a human really, Mm!?]</p><br/><p>A pair of white feathery wings behind the back, as well as a luminescent golden halo above the head \u2013 this could only refer to one being. The limbs of the Heaven\u2019s Army, an angel, had finally shown himself here.</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan hadn\u2019t done anything!</p><br/><p>[I, I never thought you\u2019d be so daring as to walk around in other worlds, Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a 5th class right? To think my name was even to the mobs like you, I did become somewhat famous I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know why the male angel had come to find Kang MiRae, the male angel shivered slightly after looking at Yu IlHan and took a step back. Fear of Yu IlHan filled his eyes. Along with the trembling body, his voice also started to tremble.</p><br/><p>[What do you mean mob. You\u2019re very rude to an angel of the Heaven\u2019s A-a-army!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>All higher existences belonging to a faction can only utilize their powers on a lower world solely in order to protect themselves. Meaning, they could only counteract after being hit.</p><br/><p>Although this shouldn\u2019t be a problem normally since there is no way a lower existence could harm a higher existence first, but Yu IlHan was a super beast that can disintegrate not only 5th classes but a 6th class as well! The angel had actually done well to not run away after seeing him.</p><br/><p>Well, the pride that he was once at the top of his own world made him stay.</p><br/><p>[Wh, why are you here?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pondered. Not about whether he should talk about his objective or not, but whether to kill him or not. However, he came to a conclusion that there was no need to kill him unless he attacked first.</p><br/><p>Although he killed all of the higher existences in Dareu as they were considered enemies, this place was not Dareu. Moreover, if he went around killing the angels just because he didn\u2019t like the Heaven\u2019s Army, the balance of the world will be broken.</p><br/><p>Of course, it did frustrate him that Heaven had abandoned Earth. He was also enraged when they offered him an alliance so shamelessly after all they had done. He still thought that his rage towards Spiera was justified.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t like all angels knew of this fact, and amongst them were probably angels that were doing their jobs for pure intentions like how Liera once was. For example, this angel in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Fine, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t take out his weapon. Of course, the Heaven\u2019s Army was potentially his enemy. He would not go looking for angels to kill \u2013 this was his decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to find my friend, and I found her. I\u2019m going to leave with her if she wishes so, did that answer you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[By friend\u2026\u2026 you mean this woman?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I, is that so?]</p><br/><p>For some reason, the angel started to sweat profusely after hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s answer. Yu IlHan\u2019s glare at him strengthened. Now, it was Kang MiRae\u2019s turn to be confused.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Yu IlHan give off the feeling that he was close to the Heaven\u2019s Army since he had angels by his side all the time? Why do they feel so hostile now? In retrospect, she couldn\u2019t see the angels that were usually by his side, but did something bad happen to them?</p><br/><p>She would be sad since she had a debt of gratitude towards them. However, that meant that his \u2018side\u2019 would be empty, and there would be a chance for her as well? Why did she think of such horrible and disgusting thoughts first? Was she such a bad person? But despite that, she could not hold herself back from her heart pounding whenever she thought that she could stand by his side.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the implication behind him coming to find her before she could go to him, meant that he wanted to meet her? If so, if that was really the case\u2026\u2026!</p><br/><p>Countless doubts and dubious emotions raged inside Kang MiRae\u2019s heart and lead her to a state of confusion, when something made her come to herself immediately. Mystic had judged that Yu IlHan and Kim YeSeul were taking too long and dispelled the concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Whoa!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRaeeeeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Sigh*.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Na YuNa who jumped down even though she didn\u2019t have the ability to fly! Yu IlHan sighed and caught her in the air. Na YuNa, who went into Yu IlHan\u2019s arms like a princess falling into the arms of the prince, giggled and waved her hand towards Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to see you, MiRae!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Did you want to see me, or did you just want to be in Mr. IlHan\u2019s arms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe former weighs sliiiiightly more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was very like her to not deny the latter\u2026\u2026 Kang MiRae only made a vain laugh. The pink-colored hope and dreams inside her had all burst.</p><br/><p>The fact that Na YuNa was here as well meant that Yu IlHan was just going around collecting companions, and also meant that she was later in priority than her\u2026\u2026 And here, she even developed magic to leap through dimensions just to meet Yu IlHan once more!</p><br/><p>Right now, she felt like crying in an unknown dimension somewhere. Seeing her, Na YuNa consoled her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re thinking but it\u2019s not like that, MiRae. I sent an SOS to Mr. IlHan in the first place. That\u2019s why he came to meet me first, it\u2019s not like you were later in priority or anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that consoles me sooo much. \u2026\u2026 And so? Did everything work out well? How about big brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae worried for her brother\u2019s safety even while thinking that Na YuNa was hateful. Na YuNa made a smile and nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything went well and HaJin-oppa is safe as well. Although he was mentally shocked in the process, but the results are fine! But what is that frightening vortex inside the room?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, the vortex! The gate to leap dimensions!]</p><br/><p>The angel, that had shrunk from the presences of the frightening combination of Yu IlHan, Kim YeSeul and Na YuNa, suddenly raised his voice.</p><br/><p>[We need that power! The Heaven\u2019s Army is in dire straits right now!]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, ok. That\u2019s not my problem, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s wrong to bring a lower existence to a battlefield where higher existences are fighting. What do you think Miss Mi-\u201c</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan turned around to Kang MiRae to ask what she thought but was surprised. He thought she was conversing with Na YuNa, but her eyes were still fixated on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, Miss MiRae?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I still can\u2019t believe that Mr. IlHan is in front of me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Very uneasy.</p><br/><p>What was uneasy, was that \u2013 although he thought this wouldn\u2019t make any sense, but still \u2013 she might have a feeling of attraction towards him, just in a very high order of magnitude. If something happened once, it may not happen again, but if something happened twice, it will definitely happen again, no?</p><br/><p>Na YuNa in his arms looked up towards him with warm eyes. As if saying \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 which made Yu IlHan very uneasy and made him ignore her gaze and asked Kang MiRae once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Miss MiRae? This angel seems to be in need of your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, human, please! This is an opportunity to give the Heaven\u2019s Army a massive grace!]</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae spoke with the brightest smile she could make.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have obtained this power in order to meet Mr. IlHan. So\u2026\u2026 I want to use it for Mr. IlHan as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Ooh, shit.]</p><br/><p>The angel sighed. Yu IlHan wanted to sigh as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, it looks like my blood is thicker in my son\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Kim YeSeul, who had set her sights on the \u2018fourth candidate\u2019, had a bright smile.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The only one that has full understanding of Yu IlHan is Yu IlHan himself.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, his companions hadn\u2019t broken away from him!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s an untranslated author\u2019s note 3 \u2013 Merry Christmas!</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t translate since it\u2019s like, the opposite of Christmas\u2026.

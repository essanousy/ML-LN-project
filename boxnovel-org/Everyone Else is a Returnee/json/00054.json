Thinking that she was really an interesting person, Yu IlHan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you give me a suitable compensation, then I have no reason to refuse. But I\u2019m not so sure about magic, but I have no idea on how to amplify holy powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will talk to YuNa about it. Breya, that\u2019s the world she went to, and it probably has the materials to raise holy power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will request the smith as soon as I gather the materials for yours, miss Kang MiRae. I will consider it if you want any specific details.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Khm. If you have the time, then it will be better if we meet up to talk about it. I\u2019m fine with right now too.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought about it for a moment before nodding his head. He wasn\u2019t that busy since he had evolved the Resting skill and advanced to his 2nd class.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing the call, Yu IlHan washed himself and clothed himself. As always, he wore the decolorized jeans, and a leather jacket(this looked quite cool since it was made from the Highland Troll Boss\u2019 skin.), then wore the newly repaired wolf skull mask. When Lita saw that, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>[Phew, it seems you aren\u2019t going on a date, looking at you like that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange, I\u2019m definitely not going on a date, but something\u2019s boiling inside me now that I heard those words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not to mention dates, Yu IlHan had never gone outside with any woman, for his entire life. No one recognized him anyway so there was no need for him to change clothes every day either. Since he wore a fixed set of clothing per season, he looked like [Friend A] from a stereotypical fantasy game.</p><br/><p>Even so, that guy was at least friends with a main character from a game, but Yu IlHan had none of that. How blessed was the life inside a game, where they could count friends with ABC!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Kang MiRae showed that she was extraordinary starting from her choice of venue. It was a high-class tea shop, where each group of customers were given rooms, and where Yu IlHan had never set foot inside before.</p><br/><p>No, in fact, whether it\u2019s high-class or normal, Yu IlHan had no friends so he never went to a caf\u00e9 before anyway.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan arrived at the place, but the shop employees could not find his figure, so he could not be guided by them, but since he was too used to it, it didn\u2019t even make him angry. Only after tapping the counter several times could he be guided into the room where Kang MiRae waited for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Kang MiRae faced him with her mask off. Her beauty, although it wasn\u2019t as much as Na YuNa\u2019s, who threatened those of higher existences\u2019, despite being a lower one, with her neat and dignified aura, she was a beauty who gave an impression of proudness. Of course, to the mentally dysfunctile Yu IlHan, it could not affect him whatsoever.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not have to take off your mask. I only took mine off to show you that I have nothing to hide from you. However, my trust and your trust doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be on the same level. I\u2019m giving you respect including that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>The angels were wary against her, thinking that she was having black thoughts, but Kang MiRae herself just went straight into topic as soon as Yu IlHan sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do know that mage\u2019s weapons are different starting from the materials, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t know that, but he would ask the angels anyway, so that didn\u2019t matter. She nodded at Yu IlHan\u2019s acknowledgement and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I was looking into various things to make a new weapon. However, rather than the blacksmithing skill or other productive skills, the mana crafting ability needs to be high in order to make a mage\u2019s weapon. With my connections, I was hard pressed to find anyone with a level 20 mana crafting or above.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c29.\u201d</p><br/><p>Level 20 was nothing. It was achievable with just making only tens of Traps of Destruction. The moment she heard his answer, Kang MiRae gripped her fists tight under the table. Her mouth was also curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cA basic increase in magic attack and an increase in lightning magic. These two are my two basic requirements. On top of that, if there\u2019s another option attached, then it will help me out a lot in the future\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you also want a beta option?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not compulsory. Beta options aren\u2019t that easy to find.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said that, Kang MiRae\u2019s eyes were glistening. After finding out the \u2018smith that Yu IlHan was connected to\u2019 had a level 29 mana crafting, her expectations were increasing.</p><br/><p>Thinking that she had quite a cute side unlike her cold impression, Yu IlHan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall I hear about that? To make a beta option that you want to have if there is one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe decrease in magic skill reuse delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>At once, it turned into a game talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Palace Magic Chief of Palladia empire had a unique-rank staff, and the option attached to that staff was the decrease in magic skill reuse delay. With that ability, when he killed a 4th class monster alone\u2026 I still cannot forget the overwhelming scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s just a wish. I don\u2019t want such an absurd option, so please just consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it\u2019s the passion contained in her words, or her shining expression, it wasn\u2019t just that much, but Yu IlHan decided not to retort. Moreover, he was thinking of a beta option as the basics, so he was confident in satisfying her puffed up wish.</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was writing down Kang MiRae\u2019s requirements, she asked in careful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also said this over the phone, but can you make a robe for a mage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe materials don\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s cloth or leather, but if possible, I want an option to increase magic ability. The robe I\u2019m wearing right now also has that ability, so if the results are lower than that, I would have to apologize but I won\u2019t trade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat much is obvious. If there\u2019s a beta option, then what would it be\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe robe too!? According to the legends of the Magic Empire, Illta (T/N: That\u2019s one I and two Ls), the robe that the hero was wearing had an option to increase magic recovery. No, it\u2019s not like I want such an exaggerated option\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had to listen to a 5 minute sermon of how great that hero was, from her. Perhaps, the fact that she became a lightning magician was not related to her aptitude, but the heart of a legendary hero-admiring little girl \u2013 Yu IlHan carefully threw away that delusion.</p><br/><p>Next came the negotiation of price. How much should be call? Was a billion won (\u2248870,000USD) for the combined price of the staff and the robe too expensive? But it wasn\u2019t like a smith at the level of Yu IlHan could be seen easily, so couldn\u2019t he just ask for that much? She might not have that amount of cash so should he ask for another thing?</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was rolling his brains, Kang MiRae spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start from 3 billion with the weapon with an alpha option as the basis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf somehow a beta option with a decrease in reuse delay appears, then I\u2019ll give you 10 billion even if the magic abilities lack a little. Of course, I can give you more according to the option.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lost his words when he heard her words which were in a different scale from his own. She lives in a good environment, she\u2019s not ordinary. He did think that, but he had never thought that she was able to give 10 billion won for a single weapon.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae wasn\u2019t just well off. She was extraordinarily well off on an earthly scale.</p><br/><p>\u201c2 billion for the robe. But if it has the beta option I want, then I\u2019ll give you seven. Is it too little? I don\u2019t have a lot of money I can use yet, so if you think it\u2019s too little, then I\u2019ll give you other things as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he had not thought of stripping her whole (T/N: NOT literally), at this opportunity, but the things she offered were of too high level, so his greed wasn\u2019t provoked. Just what was the identity of this woman? He just found it absurd.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will contact you again about YuNa and my brother\u2019s equipments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll request for yours first, miss Kang MiRae. It won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a clean farwell, the two parted ways. However, as they parted, Yu IlHan\u2019s head was seriously complex.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs my ability kinda amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>[To think you\u2019d think about that now, you\u2019re quite amazing as always.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Even when you have seen the absurd amount of results you\u2019ve done until now\u2026 You only accept when money is offered, eh?](Lita)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s actions, after his eyes flipped the moment he got to know of 15 billion won, changed explosively.</p><br/><p>There were two dungeons he had to conquer starting now. Quegna\u2019s dungeon, in which, Quegnae, known for preserving magic power in its bones, were living, and the dungeon where mutated species, due to lightning power being concentrated in it, appeared. (T/N: Should the plural of Quegna be Quegnae? My inferior latin tells me so.)</p><br/><p>The bones of Quegnae were currently at the top of the pyramid of the materials to make a magic staff as of now on Earth. It was only unfortunate that the dungeon was in China, but as it was in a place that was hard to find by other humans, it was also fortunate that it would be cleared out before he went there.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the dungeon with the mutated species was in Korea, so he headed there first.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I\u2019m slightly bothered by the word mutated, but it should be alright, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If any dungeons connected to Abandoned Worlds, then Earth would be ruined.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Even the reports of other angels say that there are no dungeons connecting to Abandoned Worlds other than the troll dungeon in which Reta Kar\u2019iha was in. So relax.](Lita)</p><br/><p>The angels were guaranteeing themselves, but Yu IlHan would get more and more worried the more they ensured as such. He\u2019d rather believe in the weather forecast than the angels!</p><br/><p>Whether she knew what he was thinking or not, Lita only urged him to run faster while grabbing onto his hair.</p><br/><p>The mutated species dungeon was in Gangwon-do. When Yu IlHan arrived at the mountain on which the dungeon was located, the sky was already becoming darker.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan found the dungeon, checked the scale of the vortex, and confirmed that there wasn\u2019t a trace of anything around the dungeon before heaving a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I saw through it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I already said I won\u2019t tackle that any more.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Just how dramatic of a life did IlHan live to the point that he\u2019s happy to see a normal dungeon? Just what did you do?](Lita)</p><br/><p>[It will just make me sadder to talk about it so please don\u2019t touch on that topic, Lita](Erta)</p><br/><p>The level requirement for entering the dungeon was level 70 but Yu IlHan was currently with two angels. When they manipulated, the text on his retina instantly changed into 50.</p><br/><p>[Change it so that it would change back after IlHan enters, and\u2026 done.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[Considering the rate of growth that Earth is undergoing, the fact that such a high level dungeon has appeared is not a good thing. It\u2019s way higher compared to the average of other worlds.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided not to consider that damn \u2018average\u2019 the moment I fought the Shadow Leopard.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Yu IlHan entered the dungeon with the two angels, the level 50 requirement changed into level 70 again. This was the proof that no outside interferences would be able to affect him. This dungeon was one where he could hunt without worries!</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, in China, something which would make Yu IlHan tired again, just as he found an \u2018ordinary life\u2019, was occurring.</p><br/><p>If the distance was a little far apart, then they would meet at least at a later time, but this was occurring in a nearby dungeon to the Quegna\u2019s dungeon which Yu IlHan would go to after clearing the mutated species dungeon!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir Daki\u00e9. The dungeon mutation is going as you ordered. I guarantee that it would be successful this time. There won\u2019t be any interference like last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Did you find out who that damn seed was? Earth is a precious land. Even I do not want it to be invaded by an Abandoned World.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are a lot of worlds connected to Earth. There might be some idiot who might be thinking something crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The moment you confirm that the dimensional connection is successful, then conceal the dungeon immediately. To perfectly connect dimensions, we need a lot of time. You can do that much, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We have an exceptional ally on this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the the interdimensional talk through the artifact was finished, the owner of that voice carefully stood up and grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, I don\u2019t know what suffering I\u2019m going through.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was definitely one \u2018human\u2019 at this place, but there was a voice which replied to his voice. It was an entity which was floating in the air, with a pair of wings behind the back. A male angel.</p><br/><p>[Even though he\u2019s barely on the same boat as a Heavenly power with all the support of the empire, that puny mage think he\u2019s the center of the world. Humans really are disgusting.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that a historical 4th class mage is puny?\u201d</p><br/><p>[HA! Us higher existences exist above 4th class.]</p><br/><p>It seemed that bragging about being higher existences were the same with any angel. However, the man snorted when he heard the angel\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that different since you\u2019re relying on mere higher existences without being able to do anything by yourselves. Anyway, you\u2019ll conceal the dungeon properly, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I said relax. Last time, it became like that since something unexpected happened, but concealing a dungeon with just 1st class monsters is nothing. Unless a higher angel comes near here.]</p><br/><p>Despite the guarantee of the angel, the man shouted in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cA higher angel? You\u2019re saying we may get discovered by them?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You don\u2019t need to worry.]</p><br/><p>The male angel declared proudly.</p><br/><p>[There are no higher angels who would come down to Earth, which has only gone through its first Great Cataclysm, on their own accord!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. No matter how many things are occurring here on Earth, this is just one of the many lower worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Earth was just a small well. It was just that the fact that it was connected to many other worlds made it a little special. A small world that\u2019s not damaged, from a bigger world\u2019s view, Earth was just a small world worthy to be treated as a useful colony!</p><br/><p>As he realized that, as he wanted a bigger world, the man contracted with a mage from another world. The day that contract was fulfilled, the man would earn the world!</p><br/><p>Of course, they did not know\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026that, like there was a damned angel who worked against Heaven, despite belong to it, that there was an angel who came down of her own accord to see a man, despite being of a higher rank.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>1. At the initial stages of the Great Cataclysm, there was a time when Yu IlHan sold some ordinary wild dogs\u2019 skin to the government for a high price. That\u2019s because it was the initial stages, because of Yu IlHan\u2019s dismantling abilities, and the fact that the government wanted to make a tie with Yu IlHan, and some other complex elements that made the price so high. Now, that wouldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>2. Every time I look at the weather forecast, I think \u2013 Adults are liars!</p><br/><p>3. Mages are great. If there\u2019s a knight to protect them, then they will become the ruler of the battefield!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Regular chapter for Thursday(sorry for being late)</p><br/><p>1150KRW = 1USD, you do the maths, I can\u2019t be bothered.</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I will swap them according to the situation.\u201d`</p><br/><p>There was no need to be bent on making high ranked equipments. In the future, Yu IlHan\u2019s enemies would have their own attributes, so if he could prepare several equipments that specialized in each attribute, then what would he fear!</p><br/><p>[It sounds like you\u2019re getting spec\u2019ed up for a raid.]</p><br/><p>\u201c*ehem*\u201d</p><br/><p>Flinching at Erta\u2019s sharp comment, he still managed to calmly treated his injuries. Of course, these were all at a level that could be solved with bloodrink and transcendent regeneration. This was the reason why Yu IlHan could achieve easy victories against 3rd classes even without rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I really need to do something with the dragon\u2019s blood later. It will definitely become something damned good, perhaps better than the bloodrink from troll\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well the effect may be damned good, but your life may be doomed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I just need to raise my extreme poison resistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan Erta had their normal, idiotic banter and was resting from the battle fatigue, when Reta, the observer sighed a little.</p><br/><p>[If I had abilities like yours, then it wouldn\u2019t just have been a dream to save Dareu.]</p><br/><p>Reta\u2019s voice contained deep resentment and regret at her own lack of ability.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wondered what he should tell her. You\u2019ve never been alone for a thousand years so shut up \u2013 and retort? Or console her?</p><br/><p>Judging that they were both wrong, Yu IlHan just licked his lips. Although the counterpart made a mistake in words, retorting about it meant that he would be making the same mistake.</p><br/><p>Instead, he said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve cleaned this part up, so let\u2019s go meet the elf survivors. It\u2019s the hope you\u2019ve found.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Yes. Let\u2019s do that. Thank you.]</p><br/><p>Reta\u2019s voice contained a hint of hope again. This was perhaps the first time Yu IlHan had chosen the correct choice of words, as he never ever chosen a correct option even in games due to his lack of interaction with other people. This was a milestone of growth that would have been impossible without Lita or Erta.</p><br/><p>They left the cavern and charged throughout the wide mountains. Did everything become like this after continuous Great Cataclysms? Dareu had a bigger everything than Earth. Higher mountains, bigger trees, and even bigger flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cInterestingly, there are no monsters around here.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although they may be nothing to you, the aura of 3rd class dragonkin are supposed to be frightening. To the point that it would be impossible for non-intelligent monsters to resist.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had no tracking ability, but since Reta could find exactly where the elves were hiding, he ran in a straight line without the need to side track. At one moment, Yu IlHan also succeeded in sensing the presences of the elves on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it\u201d</p><br/><p>That was also when he heard voices. The place where the elves were hiding became clear. They had dug out nearby trees and lived inside them. The number was 13, and they were all skin and bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I thought the alarm magic trembled for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not broken. Dragons would never use such a soft method.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they had perfectly sensed Yu IlHan\u2019s presence, but their magic seemed to have registered a moment of unfamiliarity. Realizing again that magic wasn\u2019t to be looked down upon, Yu IlHan dropped himself in the middle of the trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t feel anything. Save up energy rather than speaking. There\u2019s still time until the ones who went out to hunt food to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, how much longer do we have to live like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how they didn\u2019t notice Yu IlHan even though he was right in front of them, it seemed like the alarm magic only amounted to that much.</p><br/><p>Since something may go wrong, Yu IlHan first checked their danger levels, and confirmed that they were all below level 50 or just above, before releasing his concealment.</p><br/><p>In fact, he felt quite proud being able to dispel his own concealment, but he didn\u2019t show it on the outside. Erta would tease him if he did.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, it\u2019s a human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans should all have died. Isn\u2019t it a dragon\u2019s transformation?\u201d</p><br/><p>All 13 elves in that area instantly went into panic. The elves hiding within the trees all rushed out and attempted to escape without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>It would be a lie to say that he didn\u2019t feel bad for them, but unlike his impression, Yu IlHan moved ruthlessly. He caught each one of them and smacked them before throwing them to one side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will finish you without pain if you stay still!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Hiccup!\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a complete villain\u2019s line!]</p><br/><p>Nodding at Erta\u2019s comment, Yu IlHan changed his line.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re right. Then. It will be over in a flash so just close your eyes. *creepy laugh*\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s even worse! You\u2019re doing this on purpose, aren\u2019t you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou realized that now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan moved busily even under Erta\u2019s scolding after she realized his intentions. No matter how much the elves struggled, they were dancing on the top of Yu IlHan\u2019s palm, so it took only 18 seconds for the situation to clear up.</p><br/><p>The elves that were thrown against the tree cried tears of sadness as if they had lost all hope, while looking straight at Yu IlHan. The scene was strangely\u2026 erotic.</p><br/><p>Even though there were more men than women here, how come he thought of an ominous scene in an ominous anime\u2026(T/N: *cough* boku *cough* no *cough* pico *cough). Yu IlHan cursed himself for thinking that it was worth coming here just for this scene, but perhaps due to his higher curse resistance, nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, who are you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the legendary polymorph? D, damned dragons\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKi, kill us! We will never leak the positions of our colleagues!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had done nothing other than just making them stay put, he ended up learning that there were others. Yu IlHan seriously considered becoming a detective, and spoke to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to believe it, but I am a human that\u2019s hunting dragonkin in Dareu continent after my interests coincided with that of Reta Kar\u2019iha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReta Kar\u2019iha!? The last hero of the continent\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes all widened. There was no way they could obediently believe in Yu IlHan\u2019s words after their lifestyle until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t believe you. You\u2019re a dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that made Reta Kar\u2019iha like that are also you dragons! We will never believe in you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then don\u2019t. Though, I did have something to ask, it\u2019s fine since I confirmed that there are intelligent species surviving.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019 turned around to leave. Due to his clean entrance and a clean exit, the elves instead became confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you come here because you wanted something!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re planning to kill us all at the same time when our colleagues come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will never go your way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan had spoken nothing, they revealed everything about themselves.</p><br/><p>When he really tried to leave without doing anything, the elves instead became confused and grabbed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cW, wait! If you really aren\u2019t a dragon but a human, then I want to hear your reason in coming here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as planned.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not that you\u2019re doing something bad, but how can you have such an evil smile\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Splendid communication skills.]</p><br/><p>Vaguely listening to Reta\u2019s praises that didn\u2019t suit her personality, Yu IlHan turned around towards the elves. It was good that his helmet prevented the elves from seeing his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got a request from Reta Kar\u2019iha. She thought that she was the last elf, but now that there are survivors here, she was wondering why it is so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can a human\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReta Kar\u2019iha is dead. How can she\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrough some methods, I\u2019m accompanying her thoughts. Do I have to prove this? Would it be enough proof if I show you that the magic formation the empire created is controlled by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no better proof. With Reta\u2019s light test, the elves all instantly acknowledged Yu IlHan in their hearts. They knew very well about Reta Kar\u2019iha, their last hero.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t help her because we were too weak. It really is a sad thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we were scared of death. We could only hide like what they\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, how are you all alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked them again. Even though he thought that there was a huge secret involved, one of the elves gave an answer without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people that called themselves \u2018the Garden of Sunset\u2019 hid us, saying that our world is not fated to end yet\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the\u2026 what was that childish name that sounded like a common guild name in a game he played in elementary school? Yu IlHan became confused, but Erta seemed like she had an inkling.</p><br/><p>[The Garden of Sunset is a group of higher existences that claim that they have the power to read the future, and do mysterious things. Well, they don\u2019t openly oppose us like the Destruction Demon Army and the Army of Brilliant LIght, but they move around in such a strange fashion to the point that we\u2019d rather have them openly oppose us.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, so it\u2019s like a cult.\u201d</p><br/><p>[This matter is the same. Like how they are Transcenders, it would be difficult for them to directly influence a lower world, so they should have contacted the exceptional ones.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. You\u2019re really the best, Ertawagon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, Yu IlHan was becoming more and more unsettled.</p><br/><p>The reason was very simple.</p><br/><p>Like what Erta said just now, the ones \u2018belonging\u2019 to the Garden of Sunset must be lower existences, but not elves, yet strong enough to the point that higher existences chose to contact them. However, as far as he knew, there was only one kind that fit the criteria near here.</p><br/><p>Well, until a moment ago, it did.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it was a dragonkin that hid you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ones that brought the elves to ruin was definitely dragonkin. However, if there was anyone that could protect the elves away from their sight? That also cannot be anyone but the dragonkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The tens of dragonkin that live near here! They said that they are under orders of Garden of Sunset and helped us hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOooh! So it really was like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>They\u2019re doomed!</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it felt a little off to kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>[And here, you killed them ruthlessly too.]</p><br/><p>Of course, he had no regrets. If he had to check for ally or enemy for every monster he met, then he would be the first one to die. Moreover, there was no way he could have imagined that dragonkin were protecting the elves.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t trying to give himself indulgence. From long before Earth met its Great Cataclysm, Yu IlHan had long since set his resolve on living selfishly. From the moment he was left on Earth with just Lita.</p><br/><p>It was just that he became slightly worried that other things may interfere his smooth sailing situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t I end up going against those Garden of Sunset guys at this rate?\u201d</p><br/><p>[They cannot touch you directly. No, they said they could read the future, so they perhaps already knew that the dragonkin will be killed by you. There\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. It will just be a pain for us.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders. Now that he had massacred the ones belonging to the Garden of Sunset, there was no way he could know what they were up to, nor did he care about it.</p><br/><p>The only objective Yu IlHan had when coming over to Dareu was to obliterate the dragonkin! There was no need for him to take interest in other matters. He just had to fulfill his original objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just keep hiding here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I have no intentions in leaking where you live, so don\u2019t worry. Oh, but if you tell anyone that you saw me, then I\u2019ll definitely kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Hiccup!*\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan answered the elves and turned back before asking Reta if it was fine now.</p><br/><p>Reta said she was satisfied.</p><br/><p>[Even if it\u2019s to let them live in peace, we need to kill all the remaining dragonkin. Please help, Yu IlHan-nim.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.</p><br/><p>Although he was a rookie, wasn\u2019t it Yu IlHan\u2019s field of expertise as a deathgod?</p><br/><p>Reta acquired more motivation after learning that there were still members of her own race left. Yu IlHan left once again with her and Erta, who was facepalming while thinking about what the Garden of Sunset was up to again.</p><br/><p>Even though he had predicted that he would be facing 4th class dragons before he managed to finish the 3rd class dragonkin off, regardless of whether Yu IlHan was obliterating dragonkin or not, or whether he was simply walking around the continent, the dragonkin in Dareu did not notice Yu IlHan\u2019s hunt.</p><br/><p>Nothing happened to the formation either. The journey was smooth to the point that Yu IlHan was slightly disappointed.</p><br/><p>17 days had passed.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had finished killing 10 thousand 3rd class that the class advancement quest required him to, and he finally resolved to go against the 4th class dragonkin.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Pervert Yu IlHan who now becomes disappointed if the journey is without plot twists.</p><br/><p>Pervert Yu IlHan who now has a higher level of communication ability thanks to the accompaniment(?) of the angels.</p><br/><p>Just as planned \u2013 the origin of evil smiles.</p><br/><p>The higher existence organisations mentioned until now are the Destruction Demon Army, Army of Brilliant Light, Garden of Sunset, and lastly, the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>Many readers worry about getting experience and the difference in level between MC and people of Earth. It\u2019s very natural for you to think so. IlHan is so monstrous. BUUT! You should realize from the experience patterns, but it\u2019s not that higher levels give you loads of experience. That is also why it\u2019s harder to level up as you become higher levels.</p><br/><p>For example, a level 176 dragonkin give you less than 60 million exp, but a level 109 troll boss gave 8 million. In other words, You\u2019d have killed a lv 176 dragonkin if you killed 7~8 troll bosses. Moreover, as seen from the story, IlHan started hunting from dragonkin that were just above 100, no? In other words, he didn\u2019t earn that much experience. Now it\u2019s different though!! 4th classes give 100 millions minimum!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Transcenders \u2013 higher existences.</p><br/><p>(Think saints/deities in CD)</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

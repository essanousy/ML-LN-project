Its height was around 2.5m? Moreover, its strangely thin body looked weak to the point that it might get blown away with a breath.</p><br/><p>However, its real strength was nothing like that.</p><br/><p>Its body hidden under the black hood had an enormous power capable of easily making even the Highland Troll Boss kneel, and the pitch black scythe that it was swinging around flew at Yu IlHan as if to cut apart his neck.</p><br/><p>If the first strike was aimed at Yu IlHan, even he would be hard pressed to see through it. Of course, as it couldn\u2019t see him, it had attacked Erta.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a mutation that hasn\u2019t been recorded yet, and one that appeared after evolving by monsters eating each other! It\u2019s fortunate that it\u2019s not fully grown, but its behavior patterns are still unpredictable so be careful!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan answered extremely shortly and moved his body. Jokes disappeared from him, meaning that the situation was not that leisurely.</p><br/><p>The strongest weapon he had, the pile bunker, had already been destroyed, and the strongest weapon after that was only the Deathgod\u2019s Black Spear.</p><br/><p>His armor had a special ability, but now that the possibility of a surprise attack had all but disappeared, it had no other advantages than its sturdy defensive power. Although not a short time had passed since Earth went through the Great Cataclysm, this was the greatest crisis that he had met so far.</p><br/><p>{Record!}</p><br/><p>That damn record! Someone might even think that it was the only word it knew. With its shout, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t think to block the oncoming scythe and avoided.</p><br/><p>As he had already seen the results of its terrifying attack, he knew very well. Yu IlHan could not win against it in strength. That didn\u2019t change even if he activated Superhuman Strength.</p><br/><p>However, if someone asked if Yu IlHan could not defeat it, he would laugh at that person. What Yu IlHan had trained for a millenim was his martial arts techniques, not his skills, levels, or strength.</p><br/><p>This moment would become the moment where his true ability would be revealed instead.</p><br/><p>{You\u2019re quick. Give me that too!}</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t hurry in attacking it. If it was a situation where he overwhelmed the other, then the best attack would be to suppress it in strength, but confronting a strong, sturdy, and moreover, unpredictable opponent, he had to see through his opponent first.</p><br/><p>{Youuuuu!}</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me. That\u2019s it, come on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Ilhan taunted it and moved his body again. Its body, and the area of its movement, the radius of its attacks, the power behind it, the probability of change \u2013 he looked through all of them.</p><br/><p>Its scythe was swung around several times as if to reflect its madness, but it couldn\u2019t catch Yu Ilhan. Yu IlHan did his best to see thorugh it with his eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Erta shouted in shock.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, it\u2019s magic!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTch.\u201d</p><br/><p>How good would it be if it kept continuing as a physical fight? However, reality wasn\u2019t that easy. Its fighting power included magic, which was still unknown to Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>[From below!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHup!\u201d</p><br/><p>While shouting, Yu IlHan kicked off the ground. However, those movements weren\u2019t exaggerated, and of the kind where he could take it back at any time.</p><br/><p>As he had expectd, immediately after he moved away from that place, a spike emitting a black aura shot up from the ground and branched through the air. At the same time, the main body of the monster also assaulted Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that its attack pattern is obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>It is fortunate that its weapon mastery was very low compared to my estimations \u2013 thinking wholeheartedly, Yu IlHan stepped on the ground lightly in order to avoid the deathgod\u2019s scythe.</p><br/><p>Thanks to that, a black spike touched his armor, but fortunately, the high defensive power of the armor completely blocked the attack.</p><br/><p>{Recooooooooord!}</p><br/><p>The monster crazily roared while swinging the scythe all over the place. All of those attacks became blades of wind and assaulted Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>Every time the weapon was swung, Yu IlHan movd his body according to the trajectory that he had seen and ran forward. If he didn\u2019t, he would have to allow an attack from the spikes behind him!</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after its scythe was swung diagonally to the right, Yu IlHan struck out his spear while running into it. To observe anymore, its attack was too sharp. so there was a need for him to limit its movements by attacking it.</p><br/><p>There was a near 100 levels of difference between Yu IlHan and the deathgod. His spear strike, which originally should not have damaged it in the slightest, called for a miracle with his amazing techniques and the perfect weapon.</p><br/><p>It reached and wounded the monster\u2019s physical body which was hidden behind the black hood pefectly by ripping through it!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>{Kuaak!}</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crit, but it\u2019s only this much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clicking his tongue, he moved his body. However, he did reach a small achievement, since the blades of wind stopped after it was attacked and stunned for a little.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan instantly moved backwards and reorganized himself. He swung the spear to shake off the black traces that clung to the end of his spear, and prepared to attack while sorting out his breath.</p><br/><p>{Weak, you\u2019re weak. You\u2019re weak but strong. Give me your record!}</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spikes shot up from the ground, and its scythe didn\u2019t end with just a swing but gave rise to blade like winds. Yu IlHan felt like he was playing a nightmare shooting game, which he had once played, but for real.</p><br/><p>At those times, a tiny mistake led to his plane exploding, and now, if he misstepped, his body would be ripped apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kuaaak!}</p><br/><p>Concentrating to the extreme, like when he made the steel spear, Yu IlHan moved his body. He safely passed through the baptism of attacks, and attacked the deathgod once again, and after confirming that he inflicted some damage, he would retreat backwards.</p><br/><p>He would ignore a few of the spikes that attacked his amor, avoided the blades of wind and the scythe itself somehow, and attacked.</p><br/><p>A critical hit would allow him another chance to attack it due to its weakness being exposed, but if it didn\u2019t he would retreat without regrets. All of his movements were repeated as if set up with the deathgod beforehand.</p><br/><p>Little by little, but surely, he could see damage accumulating on the deathgod. Its hood became increasingly tattered, and its wounded physical body was spilling out black auras.</p><br/><p>Unbelievably, Yu IlHan was seeing through all its attack patterns and trajectory.</p><br/><p>[Amazing.]</p><br/><p>Erta subconsciously muttered before covering her own mouth. It was because she was afraid that she might disturb Yu IlHan\u2019s concentration.</p><br/><p>Accumulating skills and using them well in real life were completely different. Aren\u2019t university entrance exams the same? Some may bring out achievements more than usual, while some would earn a pathetic result due to nervousness.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was neither. He solved exactly what he learned, and got what he exactly knew. The frustration of his own ability being underevaluated was unimaginable for him. To whom could he speak his frustration if he was improperly judged? He was a loner too!</p><br/><p>As such, he would make it so that he wouldn\u2019t have to speak about it at all. To not be stubborn saying that he couldn\u2019t bring out all his ability due to nervousness, to be acknowledged with his real ability.</p><br/><p>The current situation wasn\u2019t at all different. He would die if he could not bring out all the techniques that he had accumulated, so Yu IlHan was moving around with his best.</p><br/><p>No one would listen to his excuses, so as to not give excuses to anyone.</p><br/><p>{Kuaaaa, painful. Body is burning. How are you weak but strong? Give me your record. Make me understand. I want to know. I want records. Records, RECORDSRECORDSRECORDSRECORDS!}</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the number of wounds increased on its body, its accuracy of swings of its scythe became lower, but instead, the speed and its destructive power increased. The blades of wind didn\u2019t disappear, and attacked him twice by coming back on the same path once reaching a certain distance, and the spikes from the ground became thicker and its number increased.</p><br/><p>No matter how perfectly Yu IlHan had seen though the monster, he couldn\u2019t block all its attacks. Slashes increased on his armor, and even his helmet and the mask inside had scratches. If his protective equipments all broke off, then he would really not be able to endure for long.</p><br/><p>It really was a teeth-clateringly powerful strength. Yu IlHan could feel the power of mana fully, which he couldn\u2019t with Kang HaJin.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, I will definitely wield mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>{RECOOOOORRRRRD!}</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be defeated like this. He had to give out a single attack that could change the situation even if he had to undertake danger!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kicked off the ground, ignored the spikes, avoided the blades of wind, parried the scythe attacks, and pierced his spear right on top of its face.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>{Kyaaaak!}</p><br/><p>At that moment, a huge spike shot out from inside its hood. This was never included in its pattern until now, so this attack wasn\u2019t something he had predicted.</p><br/><p>Moreover, its target was Erta on top of Yu IlHan\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>Frightened, Yu IlHan moved his body. In that process, his arm was caught by the spike, and the armor at that part ripped apart like paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you alright!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><br/><p>I am used to pain. It\u2019s alright since I\u2019m used to it! \u2013 Yu IlHan muttered as if to hypnotize himself and retreated.</p><br/><p>From his wound, bright red blood dripped out and colored the highland red. What was more serious was that his wounded part was becoming increasingly black.</p><br/><p>[Not even extreme poison resistance can block\u2026\u2026 No, curse. Its attack has a frightening power of a curse dwelling in it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will do something about it anyway if I survive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. Rather than that, Yu IlHan, I think me not being here should help you more.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Will you be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, the monster was reacting more to Erta rather than Yu IlHan. (T/N: Duh, Erta is Lv 300+). Erta definitely realized that its target of attack was Erta herself.</p><br/><p>And if Yu IlHan got wounded while protecting her again, then Erta wouldn\u2019t be able to endure that.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was instead worried for her departing from him. Since, for some reason, she could not even bring out her already restricted angel power.</p><br/><p>The special characteristics of this dungeon were attacking her. She didn\u2019t know what it was, and how to avoid it. That unreasonable violence was assaulting her.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m a higher existence. You need not worry.]</p><br/><p>Seeing though Yu IlHan\u2019s worry, Erta spoke courageously before departing. At that moment, the deathgod\u2019s scythe aimed at her, but both Erta and Yu IlHan had predicted that.</p><br/><p>At the same time she dodged that, Yu IlHan\u2019s spear strike struck its shoulder. It was a frightening attack that pulled aggro away from her.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>{Kyaaak!}</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know if it dies right? Go take a stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, don\u2019t die.]</p><br/><p>Leaving those words, Erta flew away like an arrow. Yu IlHan also realized after seeing that she was flying to a certain destination without hesitation. It wasn\u2019t that she had only gone away just to relieve Yu IlHan\u2019s burden on the battefield.</p><br/><p>After sending her off, Yu IlHan faced the deathgod. As the fact that the feeling on his cursed arm disappearing made him nervous, Yu IlHan strangely did not feel any fear.</p><br/><p>How? He asked himself and realized. It was a truly simple reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there is a foreshadow that hasn\u2019t occurred yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was joking around \u2013 meaning it was still doable.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan blew away all the pain and worry with a smile, and confronted the deathgod which became more insane after Erta left.</p><br/><p>Then he threw his body towards the storm of mana, in which, death was dwelling.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Right now, ???: \u201cThe exit disapeaaarrred!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Regular chapter\u2026 you might have seen, but there are 2 in the queue right now\u2026 but I have no more in stock\u2026 you gotta wait for tomorrow\u2026. Wait\u2026 I\u2019m meeting Kobatochandaisuki and Ensj in real life tomorrow\u2026 you gotta have to wait more I guess\u2026</p><br/><p>I still wonder what that unocurred foreshadow/flag is\u2026</p><br/><p>Also, people ask : Is MC becoming death\u2019god\u2019 becoming an actual \u2018god\u2019? Will this affect the relationship between him and Lita in some way?</p><br/><p>The answer is NO. \u2018deathgod\u2019 is just a name of a job. (Think shinigami). The deathgod in this context has no relation to an actual god whatsoever. The reason I translate it as \u2018deathgod\u2019 and not \u2018reaper\u2019 (They\u2019re the same thing) is because author uses both the korean version of a reaper (literally translated to \u2018deathgod\u2019) and reaper, written in English.</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

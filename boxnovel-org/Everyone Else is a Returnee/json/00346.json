What spread out in front of them was the limitless skies, along with the clouds that filled it, as well as\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the first time we meet like this, is it not, Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>Satan was standing amongst the mountain of angel corpses. The thirteen wings behind his back flapped loosely as if mocking Yu IlHan and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy word, all the angels were\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSatan, what did you do! All of these innocent angels\u2026\u2026. Although Yu IlHan did something similar in the past! But even so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still believed in you in one corner of my heart, Lucifer\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ex-angel dragons became enraged and Uriel shed tears filled with sorrow and disgust. Satan made a bitter smile for a moment after hearing Uriel\u2019s words, before shrugging his shoulders.</p><br/><p>[You should have trusted someone else who you could place your trust in, Uriel. I was your enemy from the moment I created the Army of Brilliant Light. Didn\u2019t you know that?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You and the four of us were of one mind. Me, as well as Gabriel as well as-.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stop dreaming, lady.]</p><br/><p>Satan sighed. With a voice that sounded neither like the truth nor the falsehood, he blamed Uriel.</p><br/><p>[It was only you that thought like that in the first place. All of us five were aiming for different objectives.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLucifer, no, Satan\u2026\u2026! I am sure of it now. You are our enemy! Unforgivable, a treacherous existence that has to be killed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel abruptly turned around to Yu IlHan. She felt like a little child that asked her parents to scold her opponent after having a quarrel, so Yu IlHan ended up laughing even though the situation was urgent. Then, he scratched his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have been able to minimize damage if I came here a little earlier. I hurried a lot but it still turned out like this. It hasn\u2019t been that long since you came here too, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are quite smart, fellow. Well, you can hear that loud noise over there, right?]</p><br/><p>Satan pointed his hand beyond the Wall of Chaos. Yu IlHan nodded his head. He already knew who were clashing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael and Greed\u2026\u2026no, the God of Heaven, I guess? I think they\u2019re still fighting with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, what did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others doubted their own ears after hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s words. The leader of the Destruction Demon Army was actually the God of Heaven? What sort of connection did the two have? Yu IlHan just replied nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s nothing surprising. Even the ex-Archangel Satan made the Army of Brilliant Light and my old man Gabriel made his own faction too, so there\u2019s no way their master, God, couldn\u2019t do the same thing? Hey, even I could have done it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you really do it too\u2026\u2026 no, no, no. That\u2019s not the important thing here. So did you just say that God, is the leader of the Destruction Demon Army himself\u2026\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, did no one actually realize that? There will never come a day where I\u2019ll hand down the mantle of foreshadow master to you guys. Such a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy head hurtsssss!\u201d</p><br/><p>The others all fell into confusion at the same time! And Satan wasn\u2019t an exception either.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026 how did you know that?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if I really have to tell you, but fine. It\u2019s a special service from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and explained in a warm and kind voice to Satan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are quite a lot of capable people in my group. There\u2019s even one that can discover worlds that each factions have been hidden away or even interspatial dimensions.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Discover, hidden worlds\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I happened to have the ability to erase them and bound them to our world.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s definitely an interesting topic. Yes, I also had a time when I found fun in hiding things. So you\u2019re saying that you erased them all and made them yours?]</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, and among those worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nonchalantly uttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas Greed\u2019s, that is, God\u2019s, flesh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Flesh\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s group also understood when he phrased it like that. Na YuNa widened her eyes and exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one that looked like someone swallowed it whole and vomited it back out with stomach fluids splattered all over it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder of that disgusting scene, Miss YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t complimenting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan with an unpleasant expression as he raised his hand. Inside there was a small vortex, and everyone realized that it was a very small interspatial dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt my level, creating such an interspace isn\u2019t hard at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, so cheeky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, this means that it isn\u2019t hard for Greed to, right? And inside his own stomach too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Indeed\u2026\u2026 that should have been the safest place.]</p><br/><p>Even Satan didn\u2019t know about this. God did not reveal everything to him after all. If he knew everything, then Satan would have already found numerous ways to screw God over.</p><br/><p>Satan didn\u2019t know the process of making Legnae and Archlegnae, and did not know what mechanism God\u2019s so-called new world will run with. No matter how capable he was, there was a limit. However\u2026\u2026 if he thought about it, it was actually quite possible.]</p><br/><p>[Yes. Perhaps someone like him can do that. And you\u2026\u2026 and your comrades, opened the doors to that hidden world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, the mage on our side is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae blushed. She might die of happiness if he praised her any more. Yu IlHan smiled at her and continued explaining to Satan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how amazing I am, there was no way I can see through his real identity just with one meeting with him. But then, I got a piece of his flesh, and something that was deep inside his body, so wouldn\u2019t it be strange if I didn\u2019t know anything about him? Moreover, there are plenty of samples around me that contain traces of God\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That maybe from him devouring angels and acquiring a tiny portion of God\u2019s power\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that one, God\u2019s power that the Four Great Archangels \u2018and you\u2019 shared. A portion of that was with him as well. So, who else could it have been apart from God himself? Greed is the fallen God, the same God that was chased out by you five, and the same God that vowed to avenge the betrayal of his children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Satan decided to give up on this battle of smarts with Yu IlHan. It would in fact, be better for his mental health to converse with him under the assumption that Yu IlHan knew everything.</p><br/><p>He was the worst kind of monster since genesis. He was a talent that could achieve everything he wished for and still have room for more. He would truly stand with his chest held high, in a place where the God of Heaven, Michael, Gabriel nor Satan, could stand.</p><br/><p>Satan felt his heart thumping. With the existence of Yu IlHan, his plan would be a success. Without hiding his joy, he stopped Yu IlHan; not doubting that he would speak of even more amazing things!</p><br/><p>[Then I ask, Yu IlHan. \u2026\u2026What was inside!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRecorded gods, and the new record storage that he tried to make using them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>No, but even so\u2026 Satan became speechless because he didn\u2019t expect this. Yu IlHan finished off with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, God can\u2019t do anything now. He\u2019s doomed. Legna or Archlegna, he can\u2019t even make a single one of them, much less anything else. Even if he tries to make a new record storage by gathering new gods, they\u2019re all within my group now. So, in the end, he will have to kill me, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to win against me even if he dies and revives three times. So, it\u2019s game over.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Pff\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The dumbfounded Satan burst out in laughter.</p><br/><p>[Puhahahahahahahaha! Keke! Kehihihihihihi! Oh, my stomach hurts! Kuhahahahahahaha! Wheeeeeew!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWas that so funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The best! It is the best! Yu IlHan\u2026\u2026 You just gave me the greatest joy of my life! This is really amazing, I will admit it! You are the best across all worlds! Aaaah, I knew I was in the right to have let you go! I would have been in so much trouble if I killed you by mistake.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Lucifer actually praised someone else this much\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel, who knew the past Satan, muttered in a voice of disbelief. However, Yu IlHan nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, as expected of a leader, he knows his stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, of course I do! That is why it\u2019s even more funny! Loooool, I want to show you the serious expression he made when he mentioned the new world he was going to make!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. And so\u2026\u2026 are you forfeiting because you know everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s cold words run inside Satan\u2019s ears the next moment.</p><br/><p>Satan stopped laughing and raised his head. The thirteen wings reflected the ripple inside him and trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>[Forfeit? Me? Forfeit what? I\u2019m not four-feeted at all, fella.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the third time already. What I meant is that\u2026\u2026 you have already given up on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I did? On myself?]</p><br/><p>Satan asked back and concentrated mana on one hand. He, who was greater than any other mage in the world, had the ability to manipulate magic that was twisted to the point that no one could tell the original source of, or type magic.</p><br/><p>The magic in his hand was also a high-levelled one that looked extremely difficult to block or dispel.</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know what kind of misconception you have, but my fellow young transcender. I have never stopped believing for one moment. I\u2019ve been proceeding towards my destination all the time, and I\u2019m planning to arrive there soon. And that is why you are wrong. Or\u2026\u2026 should I let you experience it for yourself!?]</p><br/><p>The sphere disappeared from his hand. It was a magic that could strike anywhere with unknown effects! However, Yu IlHan extended his hand as if he knew what was coming.</p><br/><p>Then, he pulled Uriel into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel, hugged by the son of the man she likes, thought \u2018perhaps it would feel like this to be hugged by your own son?\u2019 and was slightly happy even while feeling awkward, the sphere that appeared where she was disappeared after being gazed at by Yu IlHan. Satan\u2019s expression turned strange.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could have made you aim for Uriel and not me? What could have allowed you to kill my father Gabriel by yourself? Why is it that you are trying to get yourself killed by me at this point in time, especially now that Michael is being killed by God and victory is oh so close?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, you\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I was suspicious, I\u2019m sure of it with that attack just now. I would be an idiot if I hadn\u2019t realize with all these hints.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spoke with a strange conviction.</p><br/><p>With the sharp and cheeky expression of the high school boy trapped in a little kid\u2019s body, five minutes before the ending of an episode of an anime, he asked Satan. (T/N: Conan probably)</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to kill God, the ones that stole God\u2019s power must all die, right? That is why, you five were unable to kill God in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Satan closed his mouth. Uriel widened her eyes. The others were shocked.</p><br/><p>Satan eventually nodded his head.</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>Like the culprit confessing his crimes, he admitted to Yu IlHan\u2019s claims powerlessly.</p><br/><p>[You are correct.]</p><br/><p>In just the right time, the Wall of Chaos started collapsing. Soon, Michael\u2019s aura could no longer be felt while God\u2019s own presence increased. He had managed to recover his powers and became slightly stronger.</p><br/><p>The final battle was coming.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

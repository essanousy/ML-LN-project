However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even glance at the legless emperor, and struck out his spear while looking at towards the knight.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s spear trained over a millennium, and the knight\u2019s fist, which had gone through hundreds of years of battle, clashed!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s two-handed spear strike, and the opponent\u2019s fist clashed head on and caused a boom under the ground.</p><br/><p>However, the one to step back first in that monstrous clash, was Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaar!] 1</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t believe it. The opponent\u2019s attack did not contain a lot of mana, and he was single-armed too! But even after that he couldn\u2019t endure it? His psyche took a good churn.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s be serious. No matter how weakened he is, he\u2019s still a 4th class, and he\u2019s the highest levelled one too if I exclude the higher existences I met before. There\u2019s over a hundred levels of difference and he has learned an advanced martial art as well. Moreover, he\u2019s the first one to have seen through my concealment.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes changed. His stance became more meticulous, and his spear twisted at a weird angle and aimed for the opponent\u2019s heart. Synchronizing his breathing and mana, he focused everything on the spear tip.</p><br/><p>Although he did say that it was fine because of the armor, and he could run at anytime, to Liera, that was only to make her relax.</p><br/><p>If he could not kill him here, this guy may recover using some strange methods and invade Earth again, so there was no way he could leave behind a potentially dangerous element!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026! You\u2019re only a mere 3rd class, but how?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the surprise was the same for the enemy. It seemed that he had realized that Yu IlHan was not a simple bomber, but a trained spearman. Yu IlHan smiled and charged forward again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry blocking again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll block it a million times!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another clash. Although he tried to add a fake to his hand or shoulder movements, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t that effective against an opponent who has learned an advanced martial art. Yu IlHan was the one to retreat in the second clash as well.</p><br/><p>However, with this, he was finished measuring the opponent. The opponent really was not hiding any of his power.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me! My defense will not crumble with just this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan laughed and re-gripped his spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really think I wouldn\u2019t know that you are calling for reinforcements by causing this mess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Illusion magic and protective magic was a finished story, and since Yu IlHan had destroyed them both with the explosion, anyone could approach this place.</p><br/><p>This knight was considering the scenario where he couldn\u2019t block Yu IlHan, and was dragging this fight out.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The knight bit his lips, it seemed that Yu IlHan was right.</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan charged forward was exactly at that moment. The moment his psyche took a slight shock and power left his body for a brief moment!</p><br/><p>[So sneaky!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me an expert of psychological warfare! Hah!\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of Yu IlHan\u2019s spear, purple flames and Blaze intertwined and created a violent flame. Perhaps the opponent realized that Yu IlHan was now doing a full-out attack, it seemed that the knight with lacking mana gathered whatever energy he had in his body and prepared to counterattack.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Elbani, that is\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou vile creature, this, is human will\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He focused his mana as if to make his remaining arm explode, and was subliming it into something other than mana! It was a beautiful energy that made one forget about the battle and look at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this, my\u2026\u2026. Kyahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, that was that, and opportunity was still an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Just before Yu IlHan\u2019s spear clashed head on with the opponent\u2019s fist, an Untraceable Trajectory Yu IlHan had struck out beforehand ripped his neck apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhp, Huuuuup!\u201d</p><br/><p>What was really amazing was that the fist did not even tremble with that attack. As expected of an advanced skill that is equal to the Spear of Untraceable Trajectory! And!</p><br/><p>\u201cKyahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Spear of Untraceable Trajectory, has become level 27. It becomes possible to attack faster, more secretively and consecutively.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Critical hit, has become level 51. The critical hit rate increases.]</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan\u2019s spear seemed to clash with his fist, yet another invisible spear strike created a second hole in his neck!</p><br/><p>[Oh my god, two at almost the same time!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unless Yu IlHan was some single-episode monster that came out in Power Rangers, there was no way he could receive a full power hit head on, is there? In fear of getting hit by the remaining energy in the fist, he hurriedly retreated and landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhp, Kuhuk\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it seems he was overly worried. Although the opponent tried to attack Yu IlHan with purely superhuman willpower, the moment Yu IlHan\u2019s second strike landed as a critical hit, the option on the Eight-tailed dragon spear activated and scattered extremely poisonous material fog.</p><br/><p>This poisonous fog was difficult to endure even with Extreme poison resistance. And this time, the opponent had inhaled it directly through the windpipe, so the result was obvious. However, the knight still muttered more words even while trembling in this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow, can\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, is human will!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, bas\u2026\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while coughing out blood due to using an advanced spear skill twice almost simultaneously, he kept mocking the knight. If there was a mocking competition, gold would be his!</p><br/><p>However, Liera managed to read the deep rage inside his light words. She had seen so much of him hiding his true thoughts inside his light actions for a millennium.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she was also fed up with those humans with their multiple rulers. If there was any time she felt disgusted for humans in her time as angel, it would be right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really have to do this! Did you really have to destroy a castle with an entire history of a whole world, and step on the dreams and hopes of everything that grew in it! Did you have to kill the imperial family! And even the descendents who knew nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026knew nothing? And did you really have to skin innocent people all the way on Earth? huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems Yu IlHan\u2019s patience was near the limit. He asked the knight who was coughing out blood with a bright smile. At that moment, the knight\u2019s eyelids trembled and he shut his mouth.</p><br/><p>Of course. This was about invading an entire world. There was no way an imperial bodyguard knight would not know when he protected the emperor right by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you make me accept it, then I\u2019ll let you go, so please speak. Hey, I\u2019m giving you the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Yu IlHan softly. The knight seemed to stutter before opening his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, has something to do with the fate of our world\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. And that fate looks to be sure now. From now, you will be destroyed. I\u2019ll make it so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made a thick smile. Unconcealable killing intent could be felt from his light words. Liera, who was quietly watching this entire conversation playing out in his embrace, thought \u2018How cool!\u2019 as expected of a hopeless angel.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa, hak\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you, you talked about human will or whatnot, but that wasn\u2019t even funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his Eight-tailed dragon spear. As he had serious injuries, and even had holes in his neck 2, and even directly inhaled the poisonous fog, he would die even if he left him alone, but it didn\u2019t fit with Yu IlHan\u2019s personality to leave the enemy alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are not human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple flames and Blaze burned. Perhaps this, too, has something that was more than just mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are trash worse than monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he threw his spear, it flew as and struck as if the spear was meant to be in that place, and pierced the head of the knight. Blaze, which gave the greatest pain by burning extremely brightly, severed his life the next moment.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 23,820,227,405 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 257 Elbani Da Qurad.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m still not levelling up. That\u2019s really frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>How many would this \u2018Elbani\u2019 guy would have killed in order to reach level 257? Yu IlHan stuck out his tongue at the overwhelming weight of time, and approached the last man here.</p><br/><p>\u201cS, spare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted the emperor in despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cW, we only wanted a safer dungeon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, aaaah\u2026\u2026 so that was it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t understand at all, but Liera seemed to have instantly understood it.</p><br/><p>[This world, was just before the 3rd Great Cataclysm, right? Earth is just before its second.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You should know that there is a limit to the materials of Traps of Destruction in Heaven\u2019s possession, right? Among them, the quantity of materials to make Traps of Destructions to safely entrap more and stronger monsters, amount to even less. There is not enough to go around to every world. However, every world would want to get their hands on it, right?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s why, at certain intervals, Heaven\u2019s Army opens the Battle of Competition between worlds that are about to meet their next Great Cataclysm. The winner takes the Traps of Destruction.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Just by attaching the word \u2018competition\u2019 it wasn\u2019t like it could beautify the cruel word \u2018battle\u2019. Anyhow, having heard that, he wanted to ask about the rules of the battle, or about the balance of power between worlds, or about the list of matches, but he had no time to listen to any of that.</p><br/><p>If there was anything important, it was that,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, these guys would sneak into Earth with the help of traitors, and become spies in the Battle of Competition to make Earth lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Bingo.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>I knew it! It really wasn\u2019t just a simple invasion! Only now did everything become clear.</p><br/><p>Nothing changed the fact that these guys were bitches, but it was good to find out what these bitches are trying to do!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, why didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s forbidden to say it beforehand. And these guys know already because they have a prior experience in their 2nd Great Cataclysm. And since you\u2019ve heard it from them, it\u2019s fine for me to tell you as well. Moreover, even I didn\u2019t think that there would be a world that would cause such an absurd thing like this just because of the Battle of Competition\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he felt refreshed. Since he was, it was time to finish his this. Since he had stirred too much a mess, he felt people approaching this palce.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan approached the emperor with a spear in his hand, the guy shouted in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you kill me, the emperor of Kadra empire, there will be a disaster! You must not kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, yes! The demonic beast that is contracted to the empire will rampage around in rage! If that happens, it will be the end of everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while exclaiming, he swung his spear without hesitation and severed the emperor\u2019s neck. Yu IlHan snorted while looking down at the emperor, who had an expression of fear until the very moment he died.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking as if giant robot will come out of the pentagon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What if it really happens?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s the karma of this empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innocent civilians will be massacred just because the emperor was killed?</p><br/><p>No matter how rotten and hypocritical this empire was, there was no way they would treat its people as if they were insects, was th\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[Kgaaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yu IlHan could hear a roar from far away as if to smash apart his na\u00efve thoughts.</p><br/><p>He knew just from the cry. Whatever this cry belonged to, it had an absurd amount of power!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at the dead corpse of the emperor with dizzy eyes before muttering in vain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026 oh shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>These bitches were really bitches until the very end. No, calling them bitches was an understatement.</p><br/><p>[What are you going to do, IlHan?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI dunno. If I go back to Earth, I\u2019ll try visiting the Pentagon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, yes. I\u2019ll go together with you. So what about now?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Well, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan heaved a deep sigh. He would welcome that beast if it just stomped on the leader-class people of this empire, but the probability of that was infinitely close to 0\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I take care of it since I caused it? \u2026\u2026. I really don\u2019t want the innocent people to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>[How can you be so merciful at such critical moments\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, shaddap\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could see that the knights that were approaching this place had already stopped due to that cry.</p><br/><p>Well then. What did he have to say in order to use them well.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pondered on such useless questions as he prepared for battle.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Those who were curious about how the emperor keeps his power, should have understood the means after reading this chapter\u2026.. probably T^T</p><br/><p>The method Heaven\u2019s Army uses to manage the worlds is \u2018Provision of Traps of Destruction\u2019 from beginning to end. Without this, all worlds will become doomed.</p><br/><p>So is it possible for those that disguised themselves in human skin, to act as spies in the Battle of Competition! \u2013 This will be handled later with more content on the Battle of Competition.</p><br/><p>In fact, IlHan\u2019s current attitude is quite hypocritical. It\u2019s not like I created the perfect saint from the beginning either. However, I think I can promise you that he will walk his own path without wavering. Perhaps one of the enjoyable elements of this series if how the character known as Yu IlHan develops throughout the story, or so I think.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>~~~</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/><p>1.

The three enemies with distorted wings and halos nullified the surrounding mana on the moment of their appearance and emitted a merciless aura while aiming for the group!</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[This is making me craz\u2026\u2026 uwaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>Mystic, who was recovering the destroyed enemy\u2019s halo and body, suddenly screamed. Their attacks were all directed at the fortress!</p><br/><p>[They\u2019re trying to erase any and all traces because darling may record it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s it! If we go back alive, IlHan will understand anything and everything about this hidden being and any kind of foreshadowing will get destroyed!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ll all die while we talk about foreshadows!]</p><br/><p>Liera felt like she would let go of her spear in nervousness if she didn\u2019t crack a joke. Well, of course, everyone here knew that Liera was trying to calm everyone here down in Yu IlHan\u2019s stead, but even if she could replace Yu IlHan in jokes, she couldn\u2019t in fighting power. Heli\u00e8na despaired as she was feeling powerless.</p><br/><p>[I should have honed other abilities and not just my charm\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Where was that confidence where you could charm any other beings other than master!?]</p><br/><p>[Well, if I was 7th class, then I might, but right now\u2026\u2026 no.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na said words of forfeit towards Mystic who was shouting at her while busily dodging all those beams from the three enemies, and slapped her cheeks.</p><br/><p>[No, fine then. I can\u2019t fall back here. Even if they are not life-forms at all, as long as they have intelligence and are capable of movement\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHeli\u00e8na, don\u2019t push yoursel\u2026\u2026 eeek!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Liera was about to say to Heli\u00e8na to not push herself too hard, she received a critical wound from the beams of one of the enemies. If she maintained her vibrations at maximum output, she could have distorted its trajectory, but her mana was not infinite.</p><br/><p>Orochi also returned to the front lines after recovering his two bones thanks to the fact that the first enemy died, but all he could do was to hold one down. And this was only possible because he took one down and acquired some of its records.</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9, who had the ability to manipulate higher existence undead, was protecting the others, but he was in no condition to attack. So, if Heli\u00e8na didn\u2019t do something, they would be in danger of being wiped out.</p><br/><p>[Liera, switch.]</p><br/><p>[Your ability doesn\u2019t work though. Don\u2019t push yourself and just focus on controlling Thous\u2026\u2026 Hiik!]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>Two of the unidentified non-life forms closed in on Liera after she became a little sluggish due to the injury. Seeing that, Heli\u00e8na bit her lips and shouted to Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>[Blessing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t need a blessing from a recorded god~?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But right now, I need even that! Isn\u2019t it the goddess of beauty? Make me more charming already! To the point where I can even charm non-life forms!]</p><br/><p>\u201cEeek, to think there would come a day where I would use this blessing on anyone other than myself\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that she did have something after all! Even while not being willing to use the blessing, Na YuNa knew that this was no time to hold back as the situation was very serious, and started chanting. Although she didn\u2019t like Heli\u00e8na that much, she didn\u2019t want Liera to get hurt either.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrighter than the stars of night, more translucent than the dew of dawn, fresher than the morning wind, higher than the sun at noon, casting a deeper shadow than the afternoon shade, redder than the evening sunset, o, beautiful goddess! Please grant your touch to the one who desires your beauty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prayer actually sounds polite!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whatever the prayer\u2019s contents were like, the effect was great! Pink-colored aura that floated out from Na YuNa soon covered Heli\u00e8na\u2019s entire body before she emitted an insane amount of charm. The transformation was very drastic, and it even felt like Heli\u00e8na was the avatar of the goddess of beauty herself.</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na closed her eyes once and opened it again. It felt as if pink steam could be seen around her.</p><br/><p>[Fuu\u2026\u2026 Haaa\u2026\u2026. Good, this is it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, uurgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN, no, not anyone other than His Majesty\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the effects amplified the more beautiful and handsome the blessed one was, the ones facing Heli\u00e8na had a hard time standing now. Kang HaJin came to a realization after seeing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuNa, you\u2026 I saw you approaching sir IlHan after you prayed from time to time\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaJin-oppa, shh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[With this.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na saw that Liera was being relentlessly pushed back due to the lack of magic power, and flew forward without hesitation. A stronger magic power was emitted from her.</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t you try resisting again! As I am now, I have the confidence to charm even stones, wind, and the sun!]</p><br/><p>[Identifying priority elimination target\u2026\u2026 ta, tar\u2026get\u2026]</p><br/><p>Did the blessing actually work? The moment one of them spun its halo in a weird angle to attack Liera, the halo stopped movement after it came into contact with Heli\u00e8na\u2019s magic power. Heli\u00e8na reckless thoughts, that she could just increase the absolute quantity of the magic power to overwhelm the ability to nullify magic power, had worked! This was also proof that they didn\u2019t have absolute resistance against magic power!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeli\u00e8na!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Retreat and regroup, Liera! Hey, you there, look at me!]</p><br/><p>[Elimination, target\u2026\u2026 priority, elimination\u2026\u2026 identifying, aim, a\u2026]</p><br/><p>Despite having lured one, Heli\u00e8na immediately emitted her mana against yet another one! She was no longer moving out of fear. Even though the injury on her abdomen hadn\u2019t completely healed yet, her movements didn\u2019t contain any hesitation.</p><br/><p>If she fell back just because a single wound, then she wouldn\u2019t be able to effectively transmit her explosive charm! More beautifully, more charming and fatally! She was doing this as if she was going to break through Yu IlHan\u2019s Unshakable Heart!</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 Oh, my, now that I think about it, if I assault darling in this blessing, wouldn\u2019t I immediately succeeded in a night? Should I think about the name of the child already?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you anymore! Neverrrrrrrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Aim, fa, iled. Elimination tar, get priori, ty, mov, ed, to, top.]</p><br/><p>[Chan, ging, ene, my, danger lev\u2026\u2026. Evaluation failed. Evaluation impossible. Changing mo, de.]</p><br/><p>Their voices snapped. Their actions became even more unnatural, and even the beams that assaulted the group on the moment of their appearance halted. The vibrations of the halos also died down.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the most important fact was that the group\u2019s usage of mana became much more liberated. This was proof that their halos and wings were affecting a lot of the mana of this world!</p><br/><p>[Ladies, can\u2019t you use some long-range magic as soon as possible? This unni can\u2019t hold for long!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have done well, succubus\u2026\u2026! Here\u2019s a big one!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the others regained control of their mana thanks to Heli\u00e8na, Erta clenched her teeth and created a huge magic formation in the air.</p><br/><p>What popped out from it was a literally gigantic, lump of mana. It was a super-sized magic bullet that contained all the mana of the group, even Mystic\u2019s, into it!</p><br/><p>[Increasing danger evaluation of enemies.]</p><br/><p>[What the heck is that!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing I did was compressing and changing the hardness of the mana! Even if they have resistance against mana, they shouldn\u2019t be able to resist pure destructive\u2026\u2026 force!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Now they\u2019re wasting so much mana like that!]</p><br/><p>\u201cStill better than you! Go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gigantic magic bullet assaulted them and exploded. As the magic bullet came into contact with them, all the magic that restrained the magic bullet was dispelled, so the mana would go berserk! Erta only took time to control the berserk of the mana to damage their halos and wings.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>And her calculations weren\u2019t wrong. The magic bullet was designed to create a severe backslash to the one that dispelled the magic restraint had splendidly done its job and ripped their wings and halos to shreds.</p><br/><p>[Serious damage. Impossible to restrain the energy of the old world.]</p><br/><p>[Retreat, or, re, inforcements needed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mana cycle came back to normal!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNice going, Erta!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul, having trained countless years training magic, was not so dumb to miss this opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cO, space and time! Dull the fangs of those trying to harm us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Could this be called anything other than \u2018miracle\u2019? In this wide world, only the three monsters with ripped wings stopped their movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone other than MiRae, we need to kill them now! And they said they\u2019ll call for reinforcements so MiRae should prepare magic to flee! We need to go to a dimension where they can\u2019t come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Haaaaaap!]</p><br/><p>Having recovered enough to use the pile bunker again, Orochi shot out bone spears from his two arms and killed one of them. Not breaching Yu IlHan\u2019s expectations, he had achieved a splendid double kill by himself!</p><br/><p>The one that was aiming for an opportunity was the same for Pat\u00e9 as well. He scattered the curse of corrosion to restrain the enemy movements, and made his undeads charge against one of them and shouted with a voice of resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccompaniment to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Khaaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s go together!]</p><br/><p>An even bigger explosion than the magic bullet occurred. He made the corpses of higher existences explode using the power from the blessing of the god, so nothing could be said about the power of the attack! If Yu IlHan knew about this, he would be sad, but for now, survival was their foremost priority.</p><br/><p>When the enemy\u2019s movements stiffened even more thanks to Pat\u00e9\u2019s explosion, the others also attacked relentlessly. There was no winning against a many on one! In the end, they were destroyed.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[Lv 5?? ???????????????????]</p><br/><p>\u201cI get that those damned things are at least level 500!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something to be happy about! Rather than that, Kang MiRae, what about the dimensional gate!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was no longer a problem of being helped by Yu IlHan or not. If they don\u2019t go back to his side immediately, they may all be wiped\u2026\u2026!</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate the enemy.]</p><br/><p>However, Kang MiRae was slightly late. It seemed as if they had the ability to summon their allies forcefully the moment their activities were halted, and nine of them appeared through a dimensional gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where are they all coming from!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Extremely dangerous target.]</p><br/><p>[Changing priority to second.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminating target. Unknown element.]</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan\u2019s ally. Eliminate, necessary.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not to mention very suspicious words, they were scattering foreshadows that they\u2019ll eventually face Yu IlHan like it was nothing! They just barely defeated three, but now nine of them appeared, so the group despaired.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 I guess I can only do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Kang MiRae bit her lips after looking at that. As Liera and Heli\u00e8na thought, Kang MiRae also believed that Yu IlHan had left the group to her. Especially, as she was the one who was in charge of everyone\u2019s safety with her dimension magic, she could not let anyone go back with any more injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, help me do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As nine of the mana restraining things blocked the liberated flow of mana again, Kang MiRae focused everything on the God-ranked circlet, the Crown of Wisdom, and agitated her mana. Not to mention her precious magic-stuffed cookies, she drank all her potions and amplified her mana!</p><br/><p>And that brought results.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it. I can do it. I can do it\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>[Eli\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>However, even if she could bring out her mana, she could not make a large enough gate for a person to pass through due to the external pressure. If so, she would find a way to use this small gate. Although she had never tried this before, she had to make this succeed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeli\u00e8na, stop them from moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The power of the blessing and the mana will soon\u2026\u2026 Kugh, I can tie them if it\u2019s for a brief moment!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI need that brief moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na listened to Kang MiRae\u2019s request. The moment the nine enemies froze stiff in their places, a small gate, enough for a pencil to pass through, appeared on one of their bodies before disappearing.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Along with the gate, their body part also disappeared.</p><br/><p>[Missing part of body. Unable to resist.]</p><br/><p>\u201c!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I know! Meid\u014d Zangetsu\u2026[email\u00a0protected]##$#!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just the start!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once wasn\u2019t the end. Tens, hundreds of warp gates appeared instantly before disappearing, and the nine enemies that had to endure that instantly became honeycombs.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Like that, nine of them all died and collapsed. Perhaps they had no time to call for reinforcements this time, as even though the group was left absent mindedly watching the scene, no other beings entered the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa\u2026\u2026 ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRae!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae collapsed after succeeding in creating a \u2018miracle\u2019 beyond her capabilities. Na YuNa hurriedly held her, but she had already lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 What did Kang MiRae just do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seemed that it counted as a miracle. My holy power was consumed in enormous quantities.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liera asked absent-mindedly without even taking care of her wounds, Na YuNa also replied absent-mindedly. It was at that moment.</p><br/><p>[Now Dareu is safe. Everyone, please come back as soon as you can.]</p><br/><p>At the greatest timing, Yu IlHan\u2019s voice could be heard from the communication device. With all the external elements that closed the world gone, the connection finally stabilized. Liera looked down at Kang MiRae who had lost consciousness before voicing out in a slightly shocked tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, the thing is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that IlHan didn\u2019t call the others on purpose. It was because Dareu amidst of the Great Cataclysm was dangerous that he had held them from entering! He would have never imagined that they would experience such a thing, right?</p><br/><p>Some of you might say \u2018why didn\u2019t Heli\u00e8na use Na YuNa\u2019s blessing from the beginning?\u2019 and to answer, as you have seen in the story, Heli\u00e8na had refused Na YuNa\u2019s blessing until now. However, we don\u2019t know what caused her a change of heart, but she had decided to ask Na YuNa for help.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

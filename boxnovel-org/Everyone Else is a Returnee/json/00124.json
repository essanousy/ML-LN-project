Especially Ericia, as she reached level 98, she was the highest level amongst Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>However, if level decided everything, then Yu IlHan wouldn\u2019t have been able to roam around Dareu while bringing ruin to everything. Of course, even Ericia couldn\u2019t win against Yumir. It was the same with the elves too even though they were equipped with legend ranked equipments.</p><br/><p>Yumir, who perhaps inherited a little too much of his father\u2019s talent, raised his skill levels the fastest, with the highest being concealment at level 70.</p><br/><p>Since none of Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates could find him if he decided to conceal himself properly, when sparring, they\u2019d try to catch him before he went into concealment but end up missing him and be KO\u2019ed with a wind bullet to their backs. That was the same when all of them fought together against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s the Imperial Prince, we can\u2019t lose so easily like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to hit him somehow before the barrier dispels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even if we break his concealment, it\u2019s still hard for us to win against him in close combat\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWind magic is scary too. Dragons\u2019 chantless casting is so OP.\u201d</p><br/><p>As seen, perhaps due to his father, or perhaps Lecidna had talent for physical combat, but Yumir\u2019s close combat was also very fast.</p><br/><p>As weaponry like the spear and the sword were meaningless once he reverted back into dragon form, he focused on physical combat, but as a result of his \u2018focus\u2019, Physical Combat has reached level 60 in the two months.</p><br/><p>Physical Combat level 60 might sound like it\u2019s quite low, but if you consider how Mirey, who trained in the sword and physical combat for hundreds of years in Dareu, had Physical Combat skill at level 50, it was very high. Of course, it could be hard to simply compare because she focused more on the sword.</p><br/><p>[Mir is the best.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNoona\u2019s the best too!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Owwwww, so cute.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera, who received a critical damage to her heart due to Yumir\u2019s ambush attack, just hugged him and rolled on the ground. Erta was a little jealous thinking that they looked like a mother and son playing around, but eventually decided to not mind about it so much; she monopolized him when it was magic training session anyway.</p><br/><p>[Are all dragons like this? He\u2019s exceptional even in regards to wielding mana. I\u2019m even thinking it was a miracle that Yu IlHan massacred them all.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s Mir\u2019s dad after all.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Checking Yumir\u2019s current state, who had been reborn in the past two months to become a fighting power that didn\u2019t lack in any part, the angels were only dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>On the outside, he was just a seven year-old kid, who was as cute as an angel, but the contents were a monster that could fell a normal 3rd class monster with ease.</p><br/><p>Yumir didn\u2019t only go through technical development. He really arduously cannibalized on his kin and raised his stats permanently along with his levels. Levels didn\u2019t increase that much, but his stats did so every so often, so it was even more of a profit.</p><br/><p>However, to the 4 elves and the wolfkin princess who intended to support their lord, it was very insulting for them to lose against his son.</p><br/><p>\u201c3rd class. If we just earn 3rd class, then we maybe able to win against the young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what is the Imperial Prince also undergoes 3rd class advancement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we want to finish our class advancement missions fast and win against the young master even once before he advanced to his third class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia ate wolf meat again and again. She wanted to grow until she was able to undergo 3rd class advancement missions until the barrier was dissolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t lag behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I want to receive His Majesty\u2019s love, I need to be at least the strongest among the subordinates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPat\u00e9, please restrain yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, the elves could neither raise their stats with wolf or dragon meat, nor could they raise their levels, so their sense of crisis was the highest, and desperately put in their efforts into getting stronger. From how it made them rise to new heights, it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p><br/><p>And Yu IlHan of course influenced his subordinates\u2019 growths. To be exact, it was his Rule skill. The more his subordinates thought that they wanted to get stronger for Yu IlHan, the effect of the Rule skill also expanded.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that Ericia wouldn\u2019t follow Yu IlHan from the bottom of her heart, but it wasn\u2019t like that either.</p><br/><p>Not only dragons, but the majority of the monsters worshipped power, so it was natural that Ericia was smitten with Yu IlHan\u2019s abilities, and the fact that Yu IlHan gave her all the wolfkin meat also served to bring out her loyalty towards him.</p><br/><p>Ericia was now bound to Yu IlHan for her life anyway. It was unknown before she was subordinated, but now he even respected her and gave her things, what good would it do for her to hate him?</p><br/><p>Of course, she also had some expectations to be given an amazing artifact like the elves if she appealed her loyalty while serving him.</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just \u2018some\u2019 expectations. Her master made legend ranked equipments like nothing so perhaps she would get one too!</p><br/><p>Like that, Yu IlHan succeeded in receiving her loyalty without him knowing. Of course, whether or not Ericia\u2019s expectations were fulfilled was up to whether Yu IlHan felt like it or not.</p><br/><p>Well then. What the \u2018served\u2019 being was doing right now, was of course, making artifacts. Not those that would be released through Vanguard, but for himself.</p><br/><p>He also had made plenty of large scale install-style weapons to be used in large battles too. It was now time to make things for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, Let\u2019s make some weapons, and since my current armor is of the fire attribute, let\u2019s make one of the water attirbute, yes. If it\u2019s possible, I want to be able to move around freely in the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Humming, Yu IlHan spun around the hammer on his left hand.</p><br/><p>Well, of course, it was fun to make items to sell, but the most enjoyable moment was none other than when making stuff for himself!</p><br/><p>Above all, whether it was the standard-tier weapons, or the specialized ones, he could not use 4th class materials. Not only was it bothersome once an annoying user restrictions popped up, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t want to give them what he had to use for himself either.</p><br/><p>However, now that he was thinking about making things for himself using 4th class materials, he was feeling hyped. He really was a pervert.</p><br/><p>Spiera couldn\u2019t hold it and ended up interrupting him.</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t your spear and your armor already splendid?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>To be exact, it was already above her own artifacts. Even though it was just made from lower world materials!</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan firmly shook his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at my spear for example. The attack power is so high so I can use it anywhere, but against non-dragons, it isn\u2019t even worthy to be called \u2018epic\u2019 ranked. I can\u2019t rely on this forever. Well, of course, it would be the best if I make a weapon that fits all situations\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just as he was about to continue, something flashed in Yu IlHan\u2019s head again. It was not different from a blueprint that added more flesh to his imaginations before.</p><br/><p>The inspiration was so sudden, and the next moment, it tried to leave. However, he would absolutely not let it go this time!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan urgently took out a piece of paper and spread it on the anvil and drew the scene in his head.</p><br/><p>From another\u2019s view, they would call it a Hollywood overaction, but as he was as focused as the first time he watched porn, he didn\u2019t even now how he looked right now.</p><br/><p>And Spiera, who watched him from beginning to end, knew too well what Yu IlHan was drawing.</p><br/><p>[Is this\u2026\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a magic formation?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Drawings and symbols, and \u2018language\u2019 that even Spiera, who lived for quite a long time in Heaven\u2019s Army, could barely understand. Moreover, this \u2018language\u2019 looked quite familiar, it was definitely\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[The Trap of Destruction. Oh my word\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>The decisive reason why Heaven\u2019s Army could manage so many worlds, the prison that attracted and entrapped monsters. The ancient language of magic that was used in creating Traps of Destruction that had the power to create Dungeons, was being filled with on Yu IlHan\u2019s blueprint right now!</p><br/><p>[Liera! Erta!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>In fear of interrupting Yu IlHan\u2019s work, Spiera shouted to Liera and Erta through the whisper function in angel\u2019s ring. The angels, who were in the middle of \u2018helping\u2019 their trainees with digestion, tilted their heads at their superior\u2019s call even though they were only 20 meters apart, but still headed towards her anyway.</p><br/><p>[I need to make them suffer a little more.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[What is it? We\u2019re in the same place so why is there a need to\u2026 call\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta was the first to notice Yu IlHan\u2019s performance. She realized that Yu IlHan was having an out-of-session art time, and after realizing what he was drawing on there, she looked closely in disbelief.</p><br/><p>[How does Yu IlHan\u2026?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I wanted to ask you that. Did you teach it to him?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Erta ended up smiling in futility when she heard Spiera\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>[You should know better than me that I\u2019m not at a level where I can teach this to others.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I wonder if he learned it while creating the Traps of Destruction.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s no way he could understand the meaning behind that language so much with just that.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Spiera firmly shook her head. Continuing, her sharp gaze was directed to Liera, but she had her jaws agape in joy looking at Yu IlHan\u2019s work. Spiera came to a conclusion quickly.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not this idiot either, then\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Of course, she\u2019s an idiot. As such, if Yu IlHan learned the language of Heaven, then it\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u2026is self learned, or so Erta was about to reply when she realized something. There was a skill amongst the numerous maxed out skills in Yu IlHan\u2019s posession, that could influence this situation.</p><br/><p>[Language skill\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[What did you say just now?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Language skill. His Language skill is level max.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Spiera became speechless. What could she do when it was the Language skill that reached the extreme level? She had never even seen such beings before!</p><br/><p>She eventually ended up watching Yu IlHan\u2019s blueprint design along with Erta and Liera. There was nothing else she could do!</p><br/><p>An unknown amount of time passed, and Yu IlHan put down his pen.</p><br/><p>However, what he said with his mouth was neither exclamation towards himself nor any satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hatred?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, magic stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ouch.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>He smacked on Liera\u2019s forehead after seriously replying to her joke. Then, he said some unbelievable things.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need the magic stone of a higher existence. At least 5th class. It looks like I need to eventually fight them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You really are cocky, thinking you want to fight higher existences for supplying materials\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not now. So I can\u2019t make this now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan rolled up the blueprint and threw it inside his inventory. He decided to feel satisfied with just being able to leave behind his inspirations on paper permanently. Now, he had no choice but to make things with whatever materials he had</p><br/><p>\u201cOne whip, one hammer, and one armor. I think that should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was it not a spear? It was because his progress on Great Cosmos-severing Spear he was learning under Spiera was halted nowadays.</p><br/><p>Was it because he succeeded in putting the power of the sword into the spear? He trained while thinking that he wanted to imbue the power of a whip or a blunt weapon into the spear, but it was Yu IlHan being greedy for too much. Although it was becoming faster and sharper, it was just that.</p><br/><p>Of course, Spiera was already plenty shocked at his current progress, but Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t so satisfied. That was why he was creating a weapon that was not a spear.</p><br/><p>Although his weapon mastery was already at max level, there would be some insights if he fought an expert with that weapon. He wished that that insight would add onto acquiring the Great Cosmos-severing Spear.</p><br/><p>He felt that the strategy to focus on the spear was gone at this point, but he couldn\u2019t help it as this was also to learn an advanced spear technique, or so he excused himself.</p><br/><p>His intentions behind creating weapons was very clear.</p><br/><p>Now that he could not set an objective like \u2018I\u2019m going to fight against such and such monster\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m going to have to fight under such and such environment\u2019, he could only make an all-rounder weapon that could be used under any conditions.</p><br/><p>Mana crafting was the same. Rather than emphasizing on a certain objective, he created an environment to bring out the best of the magic stone\u2019s capabilities. He couldn\u2019t make any more \u2018specialized\u2019 weapons like the Eight-tailed dragon spear that did not do its \u2018rank value\u2019 under some conditions.</p><br/><p>[Insantely Passionate Spiked Black dragon whip was completed.]</p><br/><p>[Destruction-calling Titan\u2019s Resonance Thunderhammer was completed.]</p><br/><p>The results were splendid. Both the whip and the hammer were completed into legend ranks, and as Yu IlHan wished, they were good weapons that were near perfection onits own. Above all, he was satisfied that there was an unexpected blow.</p><br/><p>Of course, the one he was more satisfied with was the hammer.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, hammers are all about ringing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you going on a solo-raid or something?]</p><br/><p>A gigantic hammer that was purely made from Karrows\u2019 dragon bones. The hammer had a special option attached that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t intend for, and he felt that it was appeared after considering his achievements in the process of mana crafting.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that it came to this, let\u2019s polish the dragon bone throwing spears, and shields too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You really make a lot out of dragon bones.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI used so much, but I still have around 200 dragons worth of materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan polished thousands of throwing spears along with shields and other support-type equipments he made for fighting dragons, before going into making the armor.</p><br/><p>He pursued universality for his weapons, but armor was a different story.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Yu IlHan\u2019s current armor, \u2018Iron-armored fire dragon\u2019s Biting Dark python Fullplate armor\u2019, endure almost all environments due to its overwhelming defense stats and high fire attriubute resistance, which was came in handy in most battlefields?</p><br/><p>As such, Yu IlHan wanted to make an armor that covered his current one\u2019s weaknesses. Yes, like what he muttered last time, he wanted to make an armor for an underwater battle!</p><br/><p>[*Groan*, this human really is\u2026\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Rejoice, Spiera. You will feel that strange feeling a lot more from now on!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[That surprisingly does not make me happy at all!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>On the blackish-red thin armor that Yu IlHan created while investing dragon bones and all the bones of the demon wolf, Quesad, Yu IlHan thought of the snowy plains while undergoing mana crafting with the magic stone that Quesad dropped. It was the record he had the most in relation to water.</p><br/><p>The rest was bringing out the suitable options for underwater battles out of this record. That was Yu IlHan\u2019s specialty.</p><br/><p>[Chilly Blizzard tyrant\u2019s Mixed bone Fullplate armor was completed.]</p><br/><p>And his mana crafting succeeded in bearing fruit.</p><br/><p>[Chilly Blizzard tyrant\u2019s Mixed bone Fullplate armor]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 7,300]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 11,500/11,500]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. 90% increase in water attribute resistance.</p><br/><p>1. 50% increase in water attribute attack power.</p><br/><p>3. Becomes able to create ice by using water and mana. This ice can be freely controlled, and the hardness increases according to the amount of mana and water consumed.]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 Dragon Slayer]</p><br/><p>[An attribute-specialized armor that was born from a smith that wields the power of miracles. It is an armor that reflects the crafter\u2019s will to survive under any extreme conditions.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>And quite a lot, in a direction that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t intend for.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>You\u2019re weak.

However, Yu IlHan had the subclass Dimensional Traveler, once he activated his Dimensional ruler skill, he could prevent other higher existences from entering Earth. Yu IlHan was only preparing for cases where the Dimensional ruler skill could not impede the invasion.</p><br/><p>And so, he thought that he wouldn\u2019t be caught up in the conflict for the foreseeable future\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if I want to stop the really scary guys, I think I have to become stronger, much stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Just how strong are you going to become? You\u2019re already comparable to the majority of 7th class beings!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because that is not enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the Cradle of Miracles only stimulated the energy inside him, and did not allow him to reach greater realms. No, it probably was, but the speed was so slow that it would take him more than just a millennium or two to become a higher existence like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need more samples.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So, what are you going to do specifically, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll participate in whatever the higher existences are doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been approximately ten months since he did not meet with the angels belonging to the Heaven\u2019s Army. Yu IlHan and the others were going around various worlds to gather the people of Earth, and take in the mankind of doomed worlds other than when they were training inside the barrier. From some time ago, neither Yu IlHan\u2019s group nor Kang MiRae\u2019s could feel the presences of the angels no matter which world they went to, not to mention other higher existences.</p><br/><p>However, Heli\u00e8na suddenly said something completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s likely to be darling\u2019s fault.]</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fault? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Didn\u2019t the information about the main headquarters of the Army of Brilliant Light leak thanks to you? Did you really think that they would stay passive?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the headquarters of the Destruction Demon Army is also known to everyone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, all the more reason for a mess. They should be having a blast by now.]</p><br/><p>A smile of satisfaction appeared on Heli\u00e8na\u2019s lips. Even while thinking about how Heli\u00e8na\u2019s smile could be so evil, he was afraid of himself that got used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do we need to go to the HQ of the Army of Brilliant Light?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a no, darling.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na immediately replied.</p><br/><p>[Visiting a world ruled by the leader himself is completely different from visiting a higher world. You can only go after you have, at the very least, become a higher existence. I like destruction and murder, but I would really prefer if darling didn\u2019t die. I\u2019ll die with you if that happens.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan treated the main headquarters of each faction lightly until now, but it looked like there was something that he didn\u2019t know about until now. It was alright within the Heaven\u2019s Army, though\u2026\u2026 Hmm?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Now that I think about it, I never felt a being that transcended 7th class while I was in Heaven. Is that because I cannot sense God?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, perhaps God does not exist after all?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHeli\u00e8na, don\u2019t speak nonsense. God exists. \u2026\u2026Though, I cannot be sure about whether he really exists in Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s reply to Heli\u00e8na felt dejected for some reason. She herself had her suspicions as well. Yu IlHan reached the conclusion that probing any further was not a wise thing to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the main HQ is no good, we can settle for the branches.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good idea. Higher existence factions become stronger according to the number and size of the worlds they own. And so, they should be entering a phase where they nibble away at each other\u2019s worlds prior to the big war. Meaning, there is likely to be a war of unprecedented and truly epic proportions in the near future.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s voice was getting agitated as she replied. Yu IlHan was slightly afraid of her now since she looked like she preferred that outcome above all else, and asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t they weaken each other out if we just wait? They\u2019ll quit their focus on Earth too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What are you saying, darling? This is all a war for Earth, you know? Their final objective is Earth.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was silent for a moment. He felt very perplexed. Until now, the back story about this world was always skipped without much attention, but it seemed like he couldn\u2019t just pretend to not know about it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk about it, Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is up with Earth so that makes all those damned bastards aim for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There was a prophecy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damned prophecy again.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So what happened was\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Just as Heli\u00e8na was about to speak, she looked around. A month and a half remained until the barrier of the Hourglass of Eternity dispersed for the eleventh time. Everyone else was focused on training or hunting monsters while those that gathered around Yu IlHan were Heli\u00e8na, Kim YeSeul, Kang MiRae, Na YuNa, and Liera.</p><br/><p>[I want to talk with darling alone, so can everyone else leave?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? I\u2019m never letting you do anything suspicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera desperately rejected that, but Yu IlHan shook his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to listen to her story so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting. Is it a story that I can\u2019t hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, it\u2019s meaningless for anyone other than darling to hear it. It\u2019s best for only darling, who\u2019s the ruler of the Earth, to hear it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I guess I can\u2019t help it. Girls, let us give them room for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul slowly nodded her head and made the others back off. The girls, lead by Liera, protested a lot, but they couldn\u2019t help but back off in front of Kim YeSeul\u2019s soft yet subtly menacing hand gestures.</p><br/><p>[Then\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na checked the surroundings two or three times again, and even proceeded to make a simple barrier before finally turning around to Yu IlHan and speaking.</p><br/><p>[The prophecy came from the Garden of Sunset. Have you heard the rumor that the leader of the Garden of Sunset possesses prophetic powers, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded after glancing towards Liera who was looking at him beyond the barrier. He had heard from her, during the war for Dareu.</p><br/><p>[Yup, his power should be real. It was also him that said that I will eventually stand next to the Fifth God as well\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s blushing cheeks and meek demeanor was very adorable. She was embarrassed of her emotions even while saying that.</p><br/><p>Just this made her look pure and na\u00efve, but \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 were words that were the polar opposite of Heli\u00e8na, and Yu IlHan ended up thinking that all girls were horrible liars.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s why everyone is wary of the movements of the Garden of Sunset. But from some time onwards, the leader started focusing his attention on Earth, which hadn\u2019t even experienced a Great Cataclysm yet.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It was me who found that out. The leader of the Garden of Sunset is a man, and I could seduce any kind of man at that time! I also heard about the prophecy of the Fifth God from him then. Oh, I did have to run away right after hearing that.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 Sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The war for higher worlds happened because of that? Perhaps the reason the Destruction Demon Army, who only wanted destruction, aimed for the Heaven\u2019s main headquarters because of that as well.</p><br/><p>It made sense. And that made him more frustrated. He finally accepted why he acquired the Record skill.</p><br/><p>[Anyway, after I learnt that, I spread the information everywhere. \u2026\u2026 Can you ask me why?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? For the Destruction Demon Army?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, because only when all the factions got caught up with Earth would I have a chance to meet you darling.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became silent. Well, indeed. If the matters surrounding Earth didn\u2019t become so big, he would have never come into contact with Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he realized that, his forehead twitched.</p><br/><p>The leader of the Garden of Sunset prophesized about the Fifth God, and Heli\u00e8na had spread around the information to agitate all of the factions after finding out. Wasn\u2019t that too natural?</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. I was used by the leader of the Garden of Sunset. He used me as compensation for telling me the information that I will eventually come into contact with the Fifth God. Of course, it was much later when I realized that.]</p><br/><p>That simultaneously implied one more thing. Rather than just aiming for Earth, the leader of the Garden of Sunset\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntended for my growth? Before I was even born?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, that\u2019s the conclusion I arrived at. The Garden of Sunset, the leader at least, wanted to make you a God.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I could become strong, although it was very annoying, was because I was dropped out on Earth. Then he even foresaw that I will be left alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Probably? \u2026\u2026Or perhaps, he may have intended for that.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was dumbstruck. What was the Heaven\u2019s Army and the Garden of Sunset\u2019s agenda to interfere with his growth and his life? They just decided to make him a God? And started fighting over Earth all on their own\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>It felt very unpleasant. He especially didn\u2019t like the word \u2018prophecy\u2019. That was cheating. He could just say \u2018I saw this coming\u2019 or \u2018I knew this would happen\u2019 no matter what the outcome was!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t just avoid walking on the path laid out in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered Yu IlHan while gritting his teeth. Whatever they wished for, Yu IlHan would do his own thing. And if possible, in a way that they didn\u2019t expect as well.</p><br/><p>[Now, I spoke about almost everything I could, darling. \u2026\u2026What are you going to do?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what am I going to do, I\u2019ll just continue doing what I was about to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s voice that replied to Heli\u00e8na was freezing cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stealing higher worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not what darling originally was going to do though!?]</p><br/><p>Shouted Heli\u00e8na in shock. Yu IlHan ignored her and gathered everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s war! We\u2019ll be preparing for war now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pancosmic Loner(-\u3055\u3093) was seriously pissed now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She gives out an overwhelming pressure even while sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at those wings. It\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Army.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones that abandoned us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t bring myself to like them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike Erta who meticulously hid her presence even while on Yu IlHan\u2019s head, the person sleeping on the bed was blatantly exuding her presence, that even the elves could notice her existence.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan found the situation too absurd, and so, he checked her face from the side two or three times.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s her alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she became prettier than what he remembered, she was definitely the other contractor angel, Lita. Above all, the sub class given to him, Angel\u2019s Partner, was telling him that she was definitely his contractor.</p><br/><p>This person, is Lita.</p><br/><p>The person in question was sleeping like this even though she made someone worry so much? As he had planned, he should punish\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c*Sigh*.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026. couldn\u2019t do that, so Yu IlHan tapped on the end of the wings, making them contract into the shoulder blades (although, there was only one pair of wings before), before turning her body upright and covered her body with the blanket.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.It\u2019s the first time I see His Majesty with such gentle eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it His Majesty\u2019s lover? To think he\u2019d seduce a higher existence, he really is His Eternal Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJirl, His Majesty is a solo. He must be. So shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that she was in a comfortable position, Lita\u2019s creased expression relaxed.</p><br/><p>Even Yu IlHan\u2019s facial tension relaxed after thinking that this figure looked more like a next door noona (PR: Noona = elder sister in korean), rather than a higher existence.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he felt that it was fortunate that Lita was well, turning his head around, he saw four elves staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four elves who looked a little like they swallowed poop, simultaneously denied reality and shook their heads. Yu IlHan snorted before exiting the room and closing the door, before explaining to the elves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s no big secret, I\u2019m in some form of contract with the angels and there will be a lot of cases where I move with them. There was also the angels\u2019 help while driving out dragonkin from Dareu, so I want you to forget your grievances with them, at least to the ones around me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Your Majesty\u2019s order, then we abide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t dating her, right? Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put salt on someone\u2019s wounds like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan first explained to the elves about the items in the apartment. Of course, they did not comprehend modern lifestyle, but he just skipped the details and said \u2018it\u2019s an artifact so do as I say\u2019, which they obediently accepted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two women should use this room, and the two men should use this room. Although there\u2019s no bed at the moment, I ordered it so it will arrive soon. Of course, if you want to date one another then I have every intention to give you a separate room. That\u2019s it. Questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>The archer, Pat\u00e9, abruptly raised his hand. He, was a beauty (male) with white skin and wavy blond hair that looked like it could harbor the morning dew.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m for Your Majesty all the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear that from a male. Next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, the thief, Phiria, spoke in a small but firm voice. She had a slightly short stature, but her short black hair and her cold eyes gave out overwhelming charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to train with Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater. Next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing they\u2019re curious about even though they came to another world? Yu ilHan, who remembered that the first elves he had met had some intelligence, despaired at the fact that there\u2019s no other interest for the elves other than himself and battle, but it was too late by then.</p><br/><p>Yes, it was all fine if they were satisfied with it. Since he brought them here to Earth, it would be good if he made them stronger. Thinking that, Yu IlHan decided to wash up first.</p><br/><p>However, just as he threw his clothes, there was something else he thought of.</p><br/><p>\u2018To think of it, those guys don\u2019t even have any clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although, that wasn\u2019t the only thing he should be worried about.</p><br/><p>The most important issue was their appearances. Since they couldn\u2019t be with Yu IlHan 24/7, there would come a time where they would have to act alone, but as long as they were elves, it was a problem about how to hide those ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have asked Erta for some artifacts to hide their ears too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew you\u2019d need that, so I brought some artifacts that have both translation function and body part transformation function. No lower existence should be able to see through them.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan turned around just as he was about to take off his pants. It was, as expected, Erta who was there.</p><br/><p>[You saw, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, did you see too?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I did.]</p><br/><p>Exchanging words, they both sighed. Yu IlHan put some hot water on the tub and immersed himself, and Erta transformed into palm-size, and sat on one corner of the tub.</p><br/><p>[The war is over for now. We don\u2019t know when the Wall of Chaos may open again, but they did say that we\u2019re past the critical point.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Lita\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s Liera now, not Lita. She was promoted.]</p><br/><p>So angels change their names upon promoting. While Yu IlHan was feeling a strange sentiment, Erta tapped on the water in the tub and continued.</p><br/><p>[Her achievements were great. Although she was reckless from the beginning, she seemed to disappear mid-way, and appeared after pulling out the roots of a portion of Destruction Demon Army inside the Wall of Chaos. And that was the finale. Even Spiera, who was involved in her promotion, was shocked, they say.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some frightening achievements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shouldn\u2019t be at fault for thinking up of a monster rather than an angel.</p><br/><p>[Although the time is quite coincidental, it has only been 5 hours since the war of the Wall of Chaos had ended. Liera didn\u2019t report to anyone and came straight here after the Wall of Chaos closed. Even if it\u2019s you, you shouldn\u2019t not know what her actions mean, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t not know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan laughed bitterly before replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe should be very tired. Lita, no, Liera knows that my bed is the best bed in the world, custom ordered from my calculations and pre-investigation as a master of resting.</p><br/><p>Erta was never more frustrated than now about how she couldn\u2019t use her powers as a higher existence on Earth. If she could just beat him up!</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t say everything, so she could only\u2026</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Yes. So, look after her a lot.]</p><br/><p>\u2026say that.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan exited his bathtub after finishing his refreshing bath time after a long while. He then put on some new clothes, and threw the four elves (after separating them to male and female), who were standing there absent-mindedly even though he had assigned them rooms.</p><br/><p>After that, he bought a ton of underwear and clothes from a nearby shop, and distributed them the earring shaped artifacts he got from Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, these clothes are so comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe underwear are too small, Your Majesty. Both my chest and my hips are tight\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go buy them yourself later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves now were no different from Earthlings after they wore clothes of Earth and wore the earring artifact, other than how they were too pretty.</p><br/><p>It was funny since they looked so off, but now, there was no way the police or the military would stop them. Although, the scouts from the model industry, or idol office producers may do that!</p><br/><p>Good, now, the urgent fire was put out. There were still mountain loads of things to do, but there was something else he had to do before he started working hard again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. You guys have a rest too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll sleep with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sleep by yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Firmly declaring that, Yu IlHan returned to his room and snuggled next to Liera, who was sleeping in the proper position right now. He thought of the time when Liera slept next to him before she was dragged into the Wall of Chaos.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re going to sleep next to her?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can wake her. It\u2019s also not like she minds either, from what I saw last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>She doesn\u2019t mind so he\u2019s safe! \u2013 if Liera heard that, she wouldn\u2019t know whether to smile or cry. With such a comment, Yu IlHan closed his eyes. Erta found that absurd and retorted.</p><br/><p>[Yes, do that\u2026\u2026 It will be the best reward for her.]</p><br/><p>\u201cZzz.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta spoke that out loud, intending Yu IlHan to hear it, but the person himself fell asleep in 1.5 seconds and didn\u2019t hear it.</p><br/><p>[Hey!]</p><br/><p>Momentarily, Erta even doubted whether Yu IlHan did that on purpose even while knowing about how the two girls felt towards him, but seeing a human and a higher angel having a good sleep, she became sleepy, and she also slept next to Yu IlHan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The first one to wake up was Erta. Well, it was her who had the least fatigue, so it was natural.</p><br/><p>\u2018Although I did give out energy to Yu IlHan due to the Angel\u2019s Support skill, but I didn\u2019t use the final method until the end. Although, it\u2019s more correct to say that there was no situation that arose which required me to.\u2019</p><br/><p>There was no need to overuse the Angel\u2019s Support skill as an active skill while fighting the other dragons, and Teraka was an opponent he couldn\u2019t win against by any means. Whatever Yu IlHan experienced, there was no \u2018middle level\u2019.</p><br/><p>Erta thought of the moment they met with the dragon Teraka. It was close even thinking about it now. Really, it was a miracle that it was a higher existence, and that Lecidna received its \u2018shell\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll raise the child well.\u2019</p><br/><p>Dragons were horrifying and annoying to have as enemies, but the dragons acting on the humans\u2019 side were several times more reassuring. Thinking of the egg that should still be in Yu IlHan\u2019s Cross Bag, Erta nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now that I think about it, the rewards aren\u2019t given out yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan would be surprised when he receives the rewards. Erta thought of such a scene and giggled to herself, when she found that there was a thin and long spear next to the bed.</p><br/><p>[Huh?]</p><br/><p>A very sharp spearhead, and the spear body that was made from unknown metal, definitely showed that it was a high ranked artifact. However, it wasn\u2019t Yu IlHan\u2019s work. It lacked a certain elaborateness to have been made by Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what was that thick pink aura around the spear? It wasn\u2019t normal mana, nor was it an attribute force made with a special magic stone, so that is\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Tap</p><br/><p>The moment Erta\u2019s hand touched the spear, a flawless hand extended from the bed grabbed onto the spear. The owner of the hand, Liera, glared at Erta with scary eyes.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t touch it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Liera\u2026\u2026 I already saw it.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Dang.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Erta sighed while looking at Liera who turned her head while flinching, and shouted.</p><br/><p>[How can you receive a recorded god\u2019s blessing even though you\u2019re an Envoy of God!!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[But I was about to die, I couldn\u2019t help it!]</p><br/><p>Liera shouted shamelessly without making excuses. Before, her eyes were brown with a tint of purple, but now that she received a blessing of a god, her eyes were giving out unrealistic red light, like rubies.</p><br/><p>Erta asked, her expression was also a little red.</p><br/><p>[Aren\u2019t you embarrassed?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s there to be embarrassed about? I\u2019m proud.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>So angels become so frightening when in love\u2026 Erta just laughed in dumbfoundedness and confirmed the information of the spear.</p><br/><p>[Apocalyptic-ally Beautiful Steel spear Blessed by the god of love]1</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Epic]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 7,500]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 All options are applied as long as the love is kept</p><br/><p>1. All abilities increase by 40%</p><br/><p>2. Creates a huge shockwave by consuming mana every critical hit.</p><br/><p>3. Will not receive critical hits as long as the user is grabbing the spear, and dodge rate increases by extreme amounts</p><br/><p>4.

It evolves according to the growth of the user\u2019s love.]2</p><br/><p>Yes. Liera could escape the crisis thanks to receiving the blessing of the god of love in the crisis of death!</p><br/><p>[*Screams*!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta puked out blood. She felt her hands and feet getting the shivers just by reading the abilities of the artifact! It was a splendid hand crusher from the name to the description!</p><br/><p>Looking at such Erta, Liera embraced the spear and spoke proudly.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the sword that IlHan made for the first time. Although, it\u2019s a spear now.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You hid such things in secret!? It sure has amazing power to attack a person\u2019s heart just by reading the information on it.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no such function though\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>While the angels were chatting, Yu IlHan woke up due to the blinding green text that appeared on his retina.</p><br/><p>[You have achieved one of the conditions to be blessed by the god of smithing. You will receive the blessing once you fulfill another condition.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what did he do to fulfill something! Yu IlHan who woke up from sleep, could find the mini sized Erta floating in the air, and Liera who was hugging a spear that was giving out overwhelming force.</p><br/><p>[Oh.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Her eyes widened when she looked at Yu IlHan who woke up with a shout, but she eventually put on a bright smile like a blooming flower and spoke.</p><br/><p>[IlHan, I\u2019m back.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u300c\u201cWelcome back\u201d\u300d</p><br/><p>-Fin-3</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan laughed faintly and replied when Liera said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Let me have a look at that spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was Yu IlHan\u2019s best attempt to resist since he felt that something might end if he said \u2018Welcome back\u2019.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The elf imperial bodyguards have hit max on loyalty.

Yu IlHan explained to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe barrier will disperse shortly. The moment it breaks; the effects of the slowing magic will increase greatly so we need to be prepared for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, there was that, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I wanted to adapt to my body better\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tweak it in the future so don\u2019t worry about it, Orochi.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That sounds very unsettling since it\u2019s you who\u2019s saying it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cleaned up the various equipment within the barrier and collected the Cradle of Miracles. Although he couldn\u2019t reach the realm of higher existences during this time, he had an enormous harvest, so he decided to leave it at that.</p><br/><p>Even excluding him and Yumir, a few people, including Liera and Heli\u00e8na succeeded in resonating with the power of dragons, and the outlook for the rest of them was anything but bleak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can feel my body becoming heavier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026its breaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Erta, who was sensitive to mana, said that, the barrier of time that looked like it would last an eternity shattered in vain. The majority of the people who spent a year and a half within the barrier, felt dizzy after feeling the flow of time that started again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, it really was less than an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuugh, I feel extremely heavy now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu IlHan did warn them beforehand, the slowing magic cast over Earth wasn\u2019t something that could be avoided just by being aware of its existence.</p><br/><p>The three clan masters could now move normally under the effects of the magic, thanks to their training in the past year and a half but they had to clench their teeth due to the overwhelming pressure. They even had the urge to just let go of everything and go with the flow of magic!</p><br/><p>\u201cOur clan will be confused if they see us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust with you three acting at your normal speeds, it would help them recognize the existence of the magic. By then, they would be able to grow as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is hellish\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, they knew that this was what was best for Earth, they could not complain anymore. Yu IlHan handed the three a \u2018few\u2019 weapons and other equipment that he had made in his spare time in the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cArm your clan members with these. They\u2019re legend-ranked for the most part, but well, they should suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m frightened myself by not flinching despite the appearance of several legend-ranked artifacts\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ll gladly take the items though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lord Susa, I mean, Yu IlHan! I shall loyally serve you in the future as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell no, I don\u2019t need another loyal servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had already told them the code of action, there was no need to hesitate. The clan masters all quickly went to their places.</p><br/><p>They had a lot of talent in the very beginning, so they should be able to endure in this insane Earth and in the future as well. That went especially for Carina Malatesta and Michael Smithson who had to protect each other. As for Takagaki Asuha\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan didn\u2019t want to think about her for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Should we keep doing what we were doing before?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master, do I really go around like this?]</p><br/><p>The one that called out to him was of course, Orochi. Orochi, having been enchanted to the body that was \u2018slightly\u2019 modified from Echjar\u2019s remains, could proficiently control the body now, but it seemed like he had become embarrassed after exiting the barrier.</p><br/><p>[To think that I have to walk around in this embarrassing form\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Embarrassing form?! It transcendentally surpasses your original body of a lower existence!]</p><br/><p>Echjar, enchanted in the Body of the Human Dragon, shouted as if to curse Orochi, but Yu IlHan ignored that. Echjar did not know what Orochi meant. What Orochi meant by \u2018embarrassing\u2019 was not referring to the physical body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassed since you can\u2019t control the body properly yet, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s it. These muscles, these bones, these flesh \u2013 they\u2019re all leagues above mine. I can still feel creaks here and there.]</p><br/><p>[Fu, at least you know your own place.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, Echjar.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan could freely use creation and subordinate every single one of them, he wouldn\u2019t have fought with Echjar for over a year. Even Orochi, who had hung out with him for years and eaten many, many thought-souls had difficulty controlling that body. How better would any others do?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best. I believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m honored.]</p><br/><p>[Master is horrible! You\u2019re horrible!]</p><br/><p>He checked the state of his companions, and then the state of Earth. Of course, not that anything much would have changed since not even an instant had passed.</p><br/><p>In fact, as the three clan masters killed the demons that spawned on Earth for quite a while, the density of high-level monsters had decreased as well. Of course, they\u2019ll keep appearing in the future, but now that there was a system that sucked the mana out of Earth and sent it to Dareu, there would hopefully be no more cases of a massive monster outbreak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn workaholic~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the barrier broke, Yu IlHan gave them an occasional break. Thanks to that, everyone was in their normal conditions, so there would be no drawbacks in acting now. Kang MiRae\u2019s expression darkened after Yu IlHan declared the resumption of work.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do we need to be apart again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what will happen. \u2026\u2026 Should we reorganize the teams?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiRae. Youuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae swiftly rejected Yu IlHan\u2019s proposal. Since the two had to stay as leaders of the two teams, and therefore, she could not go with him, she would take the opportunity away for others as well! Na YuNa clung to her with narrowed eyes, but her expression was very firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Flying fortress was enhanced as well, so you also need to train to get adapted to the holy region too, YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a sneaky excuse! You just made a sneaky excuse just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty\u2026 I cannot protect His Majesty by his side\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, Pat\u00e9! The undead are going berserk!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fuu, it\u2019s the same teams again\u2026\u2026? If it\u2019s masters wish, I shall follow. Fuu\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The reactions from his subordinates weren\u2019t that good either. So many people didn\u2019t want to be apart from him! Well, it was an emotional thing, but Yu IlHan felt like he was losing his sense of identity and felt awkward. If he called himself a loner now, then he\u2019ll get beaten up, probably.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, we all became stronger, so can I at least go to IlHan\u2019s side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen, so please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018what will happen\u2019? There are only trash!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera also grumbled. No matter how long she was with him, a lover\u2019s heart made her wanted to be by his side at all times.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it really be two months until we meet again? This is not some fairy tale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than meeting once a year. Next time, let\u2019s take it a little slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGaaawd, did I quit being an angel to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I trust in you the most. I\u2019ll switch you out as soon as Orochi gets adapted to his new body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen okay\u2026\u2026.. Kiss me here. Quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera only got off Yu IlHan after getting his confirmation and a kiss. Then she got on the Flying fortress along with the others that all glared at her.</p><br/><p>When Mystic left for another world without being able to acquire a body until the end, there were four people on the Guardian fortress \u2013 Yu IlHan, Kim YeSeul, Heli\u00e8na and finally Orochi with Echjar\u2019s body. It was a strange composition of members.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son\u2019s popular alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it though\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2019s new dream is to make a baseball league with my grandchildren!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean nightmare.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu, if you leave it to me, I can do my best.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Welp, this was bad. He put her mother in his team to restrain Heli\u00e8na, but somehow, the two were getting along better as time went! Yu IlHan looked at his next hope that was Orochi. Orochi avoided his gaze.</p><br/><p>[My new body sure doesn\u2019t listen properly to me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps he had to call Liera back right now? Yu IlHan seriously pondered, but he still drove the Guardian fortress anyway. His destinations were the other worlds where survivors of the Front Line Alliance may live. Once he gathered them all, it would be the turn for other big clans.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many more people would come with us\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, I\u2019m curious about how many more moths are there too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, watch your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I only wanted to say that darling is as bright as the sun.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Thanks to you, I could finally meet the one I love.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan remembered Carina Malatesta\u2019s words. He wanted to believe that there were more that thought like her, and had the same intentions and will as her.</p><br/><p>There were those that wanted to return, and those that wanted to protect them. If that was the case, shouldn\u2019t he at least give them the opportunity? He couldn\u2019t let himself play on the palms of others for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still have a lot of places to go to, so let us hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, we should.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked down at the slowly flowing Earth as well as the ones that were moving on top of it, before activating his Warp skill.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a new thought twitched in his mind, but he quickly buried it deep inside his head since it was too embarrassing. Only Heli\u00e8na had sensed a change in his expression and let out an adorable smile.</p><br/><p>After that, the group travelled to many other worlds. Worlds where everyone lived peacefully, worlds where everyone fought desperately in their own ways, worlds where the fighting had ended, worlds where they found a way to communicate with the monsters, apocalyptic worlds, dying worlds, dead worlds.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s Record skill greedily found and sucked new records, and numerous people were saved by Yu IlHan as well. More \u2018moths\u2019 that wished to protect Earth joined, but the ones he encountered the most weren\u2019t them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take us in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe plead you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Lord God, please be with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were the ones that were struggling to survive in a world where mankind had lost hope. The moment they found a new hope known as Yu IlHan, they tried not to let him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cOoooooh, Supreme being! We shall follow you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damned SIMPLETONSSSSSSSSSSSS!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was once or twice, he could cope with it, but when the same thing happened for the seventh time, he ended up exploding.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that Earth has it WORSE! Huh? Even if you come to Earth like that, you\u2019ll die with the slightest tickle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we cannot endure in this world with our power any longer! Even if that place is dangerous, it\u2019s better than this place where there is no hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me. A false hope is much more cruel than despair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when Yu IlHan over-exaggerated the situation on Earth, the ones that lost their worlds did not back down, and Yu IlHan had no choice but to take them back to Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod dammit. Why are there so many doomed worlds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s because there are countless worlds, and the people of Earth were scattered across those countless worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m collecting dragon balls\u2026\u2026 ugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst the doomed worlds, there were surprisingly worlds where elves took the role of mankind. Majority of elves died to the monsters that became stronger after several Great Cataclysms, and only the extreme minority survived. And somehow \u2013 they might have realized that Yu IlHan had the status of an emperor in Dareu \u2013 stuck to him and did not get off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will lead us well if it\u2019s you that receives the love of countless elves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! You damned things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the hell am I your \u2018Your Majesty\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like that, Earth was prospering, in a way that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t intend for it to. Yu IlHan\u2019s sighs increased as the days went by as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many days was it again until I can use the barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, around 5 days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there will be at least two more doomed worlds\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan creased his expression and activated his Warp skill. But when he arrived at the destination, he tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no angels in this world either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but the one before didn\u2019t have any angels in it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There was none before that either, even though it was a world filled with vitality.]</p><br/><p>[There was none before that one either. Of course, it was a world that prospered without master needing to do anything, though.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan absent mindedly thought that some internal conflict was happening within the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>The War of the Wall of Chaos was not too long ago, but it looked like these higher existences were up to something again. How the hell did they manage to endure until now with the pace at an incident erupts? A curious thing\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t care about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll have to face it one day, but for now, do as you wish, darling.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then. Let us look for people to take back.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Time passed. Yu IlHan and his companions had another ten or so training sessions within the barrier of the Hourglass of Eternity. Despite that, Yu IlHan could not reach the realm of higher existences. He still lacked the decisive element.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally reached the conclusion that he had to gather records of more higher existences.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

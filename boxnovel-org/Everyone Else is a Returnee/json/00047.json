The trolls didn\u2019t notice him. Yu IlHan held up his spear, and threw the spear, which did not lose its sharpness at all even in that intense fight, to attack the three trolls.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 520,938 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 518,556 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 549,289 experience.]</p><br/><p>A flash like charge and lightning strikes. The shot which was unbelievable whether it really was used by a human who could not use mana, killed a troll with a single precise piercing attack with every attack.</p><br/><p>A perfect surprise attack secretive enough for the other trolls to not notice!</p><br/><p>Yes. He just killed 3 second class monsters with a surprsie attack right now.</p><br/><p>[Kill 2nd class monsters with a single surprise attack 100/100]</p><br/><p>[Kill a 3rd class monster with a single surprise attack 1/1]</p><br/><p>[You have fulfilled the job advancement criteria.

That was incomparable to a 1st class. It wasn\u2019t for nothing that the difference in experience became big between 1st and 2nd class monsters. It was because it was a level that is absolutely impossible to be reached if not fulfilling certain criteria.</p><br/><p>On top of that, Rookie Reaper, which Yu IlHan had earned with the most monstrous condition of all 2nd class over all the worlds, was a class with a monstrous power. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was made only for him. It has a power that would look down on normal 3rd classes so there was no need to say anything more about it.</p><br/><p>However, those things weren\u2019t important to Yu IlHan. He had already cornered the reaper with only his 1st class. It didn\u2019t matter how much power his 2nd class gave him.</p><br/><p>What was more important was that he had levelled up. The increased level that occurred in the process of the wall blocking his growth becoming completely tattered. Due to that, his health had completely been recovered!</p><br/><p>That was enough for him!</p><br/><p>As such, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even bother properly reading the text that appeared on his retina. He only ran quickly after conforming that the trolls died and that he had levelled up.</p><br/><p>10 seconds were left of the promised 30 seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>{You\u2019re weak, you\u2019re too weak!}</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease make oppa not diiiiie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Holy Knight Kang HaJin was desperately enduring against the attacks of the reaper. He also possessed exceptional ability, but this was only possible with Na YuNa recovering his health.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how did that guy, hold on, Kuhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Give me your life!}</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t diiiiie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin\u2019s struggles and Reaper\u2019s violent attacks, on top of Na YuNa\u2019s baptism of chants made the battlefiled a pit of chaos. Unfortunately, the two angels who were not of help in this battle at all could only pray for their victory from afar.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s fine if Kang HaJin dies, but Na YuNa will also die at this rate!]</p><br/><p>[You really have no blood or tears.]</p><br/><p>[If Na YuNa dies, then I\u2019ll resent you, Erta!]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t say unpleasant things and wait!]</p><br/><p>Erta, who found peace somehow as Yu IlHan was alive, and Feyta, who was about to cry since the one she protects seemed about to die.</p><br/><p>While the two angels, with different minds, were verbally fighting, Kang HaJin\u2019s armor finally shattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cKahak!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Die!}</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaak!, no!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Na YuNa, who was only chanting towards Kang HaJin until now, spread her arms towards the reaper for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cPleae punish that bad guuuy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Brilliant pink light spread out from Na YuNa\u2019s two hands and struck the Reaper. Reaper, who got attacked by her directly, as it didn\u2019t prepare for it, unbelievably flew away for tens of meters before striking the ground. Its figure was even more pitiful than when Yu IlHan fought it.</p><br/><p>{Kuhaaaak!}</p><br/><p>[Just what the hell is that woman!?]</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s the child who will save humanity!]</p><br/><p>Her attack had a tremendous power behind it. Of course, although it was also thanks to her affinity, a god\u2019s power, overwhelming the reaper, who looked like a bad guy from a glance, Na YuNa\u2019s power was also enormous.</p><br/><p>To the point that it made the Reaper\u2019s health, which fell while fighting Yu IlHan, but was recovering during the fight with Kang HaJin, fell by an enormous amount and stunned it!</p><br/><p>There were two problems. One was the fact that that stunned state wouldn\u2019t last long, and another was that the power that Na YuNa had, had been depleted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do, Oppa, ruuuun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also, got stunned\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin replied while clenching his teeth. Due to the shock he received from the Reaper being too big, he could only move his mouth.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t get inflicted by a curse thanks to Na YuNa, but if the Reaper awakes from the stunned state, then there would be no next. He would really die.</p><br/><p>Fuck! \u2013 The moment Kang HaJin muttered, someone whispered to him while lightly grabbing his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me in on the party.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin subconsciously nodded his head. At that moment,</p><br/><p>[You have received a new party member.]</p><br/><p>[Party members : 3]</p><br/><p>The senses exclusive to a party extended to enwrap the new member. Kang HaJin finally realized the situation and opened his two eyes widely. He couldn\u2019t see as the stun didn\u2019t wear off yet, but it was clear who joined his party.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came back\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan quietly whispered and kicked off the ground. Kang HaJin finally could see his back figure.</p><br/><p>The pitch black armor, which was scratched and even destroyed here and there, and the shoulders that looked safe despite all that.</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin subconsciously became relieved. Then, he felt a strange emotion after realizing that he was becoming relieved. He, who had proactively solved all things in his life until now, had no experience in becoming relieved by leaving a task to another person.</p><br/><p>However, regardless of whether Kang HaJin realized his new feelings or not, Yu IlHan coudn\u2019t care less. He only ran courageously. With his newly acquired powers, while holding the spear in his hand tightly.</p><br/><p>The Reaper was still under a stun, with all its weaknesses exposed, and did not notice Yu IlHan approaching him.</p><br/><p>Of course, Yu IlHan wouldn\u2019t become dejected even if the Reaper was waiting for him with its full health. He had already seen through the Reaper\u2019s everything. He had analyzed and saw through everything that it could do, so there was no way he could be afraid.</p><br/><p>{Kahak, humans, new record! Record!}</p><br/><p>The Reaper\u2019s stun was wearing off. While speaking nonsense, it stood its body up. However, it still could not notice Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>That was only natural. The fact that it had found Yu IlHan at first was also because Erta was by his side, not because it had the ability to see through Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was currently running on the ground alone, and Erta was watching from behind, and his already powerful concealment had been enhanced.</p><br/><p>With a small smile, Yu IlHan activated the Superhuman Strength. With all his muscular power focused on his two arms, he struck the spear without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>That spear magnificently struck the Reaper\u2019s chest, where he had pierced thousands of times until now.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>At the last moment, the Reaper lifted its head up. The moment its eyes met with Yu IlHan\u2019s, Yu IlHan realized an unexpected fact.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t \u2018it\u2019. To think that Yu IlHan, who read an enormous quantity of books, had made an error of generalization, he should be embarrassed.</p><br/><p>At that moment, even more amazingly, the Reaper opened its mouth.</p><br/><p>[Th, thank you\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>A voice, that was not like a metallic roar from the depths of hell, but a clear and beautiful female\u2019s, could be heard. Just from the voice alone, it wasn\u2019t one that fit a battle scythe but one that fit more with a field of flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan answered that by clearly taking the Reaper\u2019s life by twisting his spear. At his merciless actions, the Reaper seemed to make a small smile, before collapsing at that place.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 31,969,409 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 55. 4 Strength, 2 Agility, 2 Health, 2 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 157 Reta Kar\u2019iha.]</p><br/><p>[Death Collector activated. You have absorbed and stored the power of life of Reta Kar\u2019iha.]</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had earned an experience that numbered 8 digits. Shocked, Yu IlHan turned his head around just in case, but it seemed that Kang HaJin and Na YuNa had levelled up properly as they became lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu. It was a really strong guy. I never met such an enemy even during my 10 years in the Hell Tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was very twisteeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>When their safety was confirmed, the two finally became relieved and conversed. Yu IlHan also became relieved after confirming if there was any enemy in his surroundings.</p><br/><p>And he took out a bone knife, in order to dismantle Reta Kar\u2019iha.</p><br/><p>[Stop there.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s a girl!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s a girl!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had no profane intentions at all. So what if a monster was of a specific sex? The only important things were whether its skin was tough, or whether its bones were hard, or whether it had a magic stone \u2013 just these three!</p><br/><p>However, the next moment as he was about to act, the body of Reta Kar\u2019iha collapsed on the ground seem to emit a faint light, before it became black ash. Yu IlHan thought it was a pity while looking at that, but Erta, Feyta, Kang HaJin and Na YuNa all stiffened after witnessing the same scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cHup.\u201d (T/N: This is like a sudden deep intake of breath)</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought \u2018no way\u2019 but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So there is something that only those guys know.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who intuitively realized that, also stiffened along with them, as to not be cast out by them. An action copy skill, that could be called a control C, control V! His skill activated splendidly and succeeded in not giving his companions any strange feelings.</p><br/><p>[No way, it really was a Breaker.]</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan desperately endured his urge to ask what that cool name was, Erta, who flew to Yu IlHan\u2019s head explained in a small voice.</p><br/><p>[The ones who are taken over by monsters\u2019 mana due to swallowing a magic stone are called Breakers. They become black ash when they die, as you see there.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally knew. So, Reta Kar\u2019iha was not a monster but an actual woman. Although, it was unknown whether she was a human, an elf, or another intelligent species.</p><br/><p>However, there were two positive things. First was that there was a black colored magic stone left at that place. Second being the pitch black robe and the pitch black scythe remaining.</p><br/><p>Of course, the angels were rejoicing due to another fact.</p><br/><p>[Ah, the dungeon\u2019s entrance opened![(Feyta)</p><br/><p>[We came back with our own abilities. So Reta Kar\u2019iha really had the secret to it. Although, it\u2019s unfortunate that we could not hear that through her own mouth.](Erta)</p><br/><p>(T/N: I will try to put which angel is speaking when there are many\u2026 It\u2019s not easy to recognize them just through the speech, there\u2019s a tone of speech in Korean that gets lost in translation\u2026)</p><br/><p>Erta spoke while looking at Yu IlHan quietly. Straightening his shoulders firmly, Yu IlHan complained to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m looking at you because you\u2019re so handsome. Why, bitter?]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s counterattack abilities were also increasing day by day. Clicking his tongue, Yu IlHan could only acknowledge that.</p><br/><p>There was not a single solved puzzle. Instead, the suspicion only became deeper. A mysterious dungeon which restricts even the power of a higher existence. A 3rd class breaker, which there was no way it could be on Earth. And an Abandoned World.</p><br/><p>He did not know just what was occurring on Earth.</p><br/><p>Just one fact was sure \u2013 Yu IlHan had won.</p><br/><p>And survived splendidly.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Arc finished!.</p><br/><p>Baits will be thrown continuously.

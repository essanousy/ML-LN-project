This was an absolute condition applied to any and all worlds, even higher worlds weren\u2019t an exception to this rule.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t absurd monsters born with a level above 270 as a result of a catastrophic cluster of mana, but no matter how \u2018hard\u2019 the \u2018world tried\u2019, there was a fundamental difference in the amount of records and mana between higher and lower existences. If they were born here and there, then the multiverse would have collapsed long ago.</p><br/><p>[If it was that easy, then the Destruction Demon Army should have destroyed the Heaven\u2019s Army long ago. In fact, the Destruction Demon Army numbers the most among the 4 factions. There are many monsters born with really high levels in worlds after the 4th Great Cataclysm. Although the trail to become a higher existence is as hard as anyone else, if the Destruction Demon Army reaches their hands out\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo even Dareu may have given birth to many Destruction Demon Soldeirs.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes, if it was maintained that way.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pointed at the golden storm of mana that was arising on the ground and asked Liera. Liera became speechless.</p><br/><p>[Uh, so, it\u2019s\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>It was a storm that raged as if every item containing mana was being sucked into it.</p><br/><p>The life form raging at the center, definitely possessed the violent presences of higher existences Yu IlHan had felt many times while living with the angels, attacking the fallen angels, and when he met Teraka in Dareu, the one that became a higher existence as a dragon.</p><br/><p>[It looks like there was a mistake!]</p><br/><p>Replied Liera in the brightest way possible. However, her expression was still not that pretty to look at, and she couldn\u2019t hide her despair.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan just firmly accepted those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was wondering why you weren\u2019t saying that nowadays.\u201d 1</p><br/><p>Rules becoming twisted and broken just on Earth was nothing new anymore. Moreover, Yu IlHan was always waiting for this to happen. Experience given from 5th class beings was always welcome. Their magic stones were even more warmly welcomed.</p><br/><p>Liera became worried after seeing Yu IlHan licking his lips.</p><br/><p>[What are you going to do?\u2026\u2026.Kill it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t. In fact, the Deathgod skill is still maintained right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Deathgod skill\u2019s activation requirements were loosened once he entered the 90s, and currently, at 99, it was strengthened to the extreme compared to level 1.</p><br/><p>Before, his buffs would be reset if he didn\u2019t kill an enemy within 5 minutes of each other, but right now, even if he didn\u2019t kill continuously, he could maintain the buffed state for one hours and 30 minutes.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was nothing to stop the skill from being cancelled if he failed in killing the enemy in one strike, but the duration being lengthened by 18 times was a huge boon. Especially in situations like now where he found a monster after playing around a lot!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s around 5 minutes left I guess. Although, it would be fine if I can get just a single hit in.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You do know that the situation is much different from the time you attacked a fallen angel in surprise, right\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he attacked the fallen angel in surprise, his conditions were too good. Not only was there Na YuNa, the strongest buffer in the world, he had also learned about the weakness of the fallen angels from Liera. If he attacked the head or the heart recklessly, he wouldn\u2019t have killed them so easily.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan dared to say that his current conditions were much better than that. Two years had passed, and although his level didn\u2019t rise by much, his power was incomparable to before. Just speaking about the Deathgod skill, although 80% was the limit at that time, right now, it was possible to enhance everything by 90%. Blaze, his Spear techniques, and other weapon mastery as well as support skills had developed a lot as well.</p><br/><p>And decisively, he was now with the Destroyer\u2019s Flying Fortress. The flying fortress was treated as his equipment, so not only did it receive the effects of the enhancement from the Deathgod skill, it also received the benefits of a surprise attack!</p><br/><p>Liera saw that Yu IlHan was completely rearing for battle, and spoke after looking at the golden storm of light that was slowly dissipating.</p><br/><p>[It is not far from birth. If you really need to kill it, you need to do it now when its ego still hasn\u2019t taken root.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t you have any plans on waiting? If it was the birth of a simple monster, I wouldn\u2019t care, but this is an unprecedented incident. 5th class and above can no longer be considered \u2018monsters\u2019. I mean to say that it might not be born evil.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera, you should know this, but.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan activated the greatest attack system on the fortress, the Hundred Eyes, before replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like gambling that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>If that was a harmless existence, then all was well. He would welcome that at any time. Perhaps that being might understand Yu IlHan\u2019s intentions and even support him.</p><br/><p>However, what if it was like any other monster born on Earth, born with the resentment and killing intent towards Yu IlHan? If Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment wore off, then he would be threatened with death. No matter how strong he was, he could not sustain a full frontal fight with a 5th class being without the help of the Deathgod skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd in fact, I don\u2019t really like the concept of good and evil either.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan was a man who could only act after judging the good and the evil, then he wouldn\u2019t even be standing here right now. He would have died long ago.</p><br/><p>Despite what kind of grand schemes one may have, once the standard of good and evil became oneself, then it only becomes hypocrisy. So, he does not judge the good and the evil. He only killed due to necessity and for survival.</p><br/><p>In that, was neither good nor evil. Only life.</p><br/><p>[Okay, I get it.]</p><br/><p>Hearing his firm reply, Liera also did not say anything and took a step back. Yu IlHan thought that Liera may have perhaps mentioned that just in case he hesitated, but he didn\u2019t pay any heed to that and just focused on deploying the destruction mirrors.</p><br/><p>One hundred mirrors floated on top of the flying fortress, and tilted at precise angles, as if they were preparing to focus their power into a single point. This was the \u2018one point focus\u2019 mode that Yu IlHan had prepared for scenarios like this.</p><br/><p>[Wow, that\u2019s amazing\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is. How many magic stones do you think I\u2019m using to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The most grand and overwhelming aura made Liera swallow in nervousness. She was sure that even she wouldn\u2019t be able to block all of that without coming out unscathed, even if she were to release all of her power as an angel.</p><br/><p>Even though the feathers of the fallen angels were from higher existences, now that they were separated and lost their lives, it had to be weaker than the time they were in active use. However, Yu IlHan had focused all of that power and stacked it in order to bring out a power that could harm higher existences. That, was a blessing and simultaneously a disaster, born from power and technology.</p><br/><p>A set of weapons made for mass destruction. What that was aiming at was of course the central regions of the storm occurring on the ground. Although it hadn\u2019t even taken shape yet, the absurd amount of mana could still be seen. Yu IlHan finished the minute adjustment of the trajectory and smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven magical girls are the weakest when they\u2019re transforming.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I like how you say such words without hesitation.]</p><br/><p>He was confident that he could kill the enemy with just this, but as the opponent was a higher existence, he decided to put another measure as insurance. Never would Yu IlHan get struck on the back of his head due to carelessness. He had learned countless patterns of sure-fail tactics from novels and their protagonists!</p><br/><p>[IlHan, hurry up. It will awaken and move soon.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t tell me that, I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He activated Dragonic Blood and Blaze successively. As always, he had made it white using Eternal Flame. The location he placed the power of the flames was of course, the central regions of the destruction mirrors. Liera shouted in shock.</p><br/><p>[Such a thing was possible?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a part of my equipment. Although, I do wish I can acquire the blessing of the goddess of fire with this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He always failed when he got greedy. He shook off his regrets about the blessing of the goddess of fire with a light smile, and shot the weapon before that thing actually found consciousness and stood on guard. There was no need for any grand movements. It was just enough for him to grip his left hand more.</p><br/><p>[Kyak!]</p><br/><p>Just as Liera instinctively shrunk her body and stuck to Yu IlHan after feeling the scale of the compressed mana, the destruction mirrors shot out a ray of white light without the slightest bit of vibrations.</p><br/><p>It was compressed to the extreme that the ray of light that was thinner than a fishing line not only contained the mana contained by the hundred destruction mirrors, it also had the power of Blaze enhanced by Dragonic blood.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>In that instant, the line connected the sky with the ground, and struck the center of the storm at a speed that could not be followed with the eyes. Yu IlHan made the flying fortress charge towards the ground the moment he was sure that his attack had succeeded.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dead yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then why are you dropping the fortress!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch closely!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flying fortress rapidly shot towards the ground! With the \u2018sudden descent\u2019 option, this speed had plenty of room for improvements!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t amount to much, let\u2019s add the weight of the inventory.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What do you mean not much it\u2019s becoming fasterrrrrrrrrrrrrr!]</p><br/><p>The ground neared. Yu IlHan covered the flying fortress with a spherical barrier to protect the crucial parts of the fortress, and covered that barrier with Blaze. This was a perfect artificial Meteor!</p><br/><p>[So you can do everything with Blaze!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only pitiful that I can\u2019t use Dragonic blood simultaneously yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>The power of the stacked rays from Hundred Eyes was so strong that the 5th class enemy that appeared after the storm had dissipated due to the sheer force, couldn\u2019t move even a little. As the ground neared, Yu IlHan could also confirm the figure of the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, dang.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that place was the figure of a feeble, pretty lady that even made Yu IlHan hesitate for a moment. The enemy that couldn\u2019t even move due to a perforation on the chest was leaking tears from its clear eyes as if to provoke Yu IlHan\u2019s empathy!</p><br/><p>[A, a woman!?]</p><br/><p>Liera shouted in panic. Just from the scale of the storm, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if it was bigger than the golem that he fought in Lanpas, but what actually appeared had the figure of a human! And moreover, she was such a feeble and delicate and beautiful lady!</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>And this guy here didn\u2019t consider that at all and still made the flying fortress charge without stopping! There should be a limit to how dried out his emotions can be!</p><br/><p>However, there wasn\u2019t even any time for Liera to say anything. Yu IlHan would not stop at all, and before she could do anything, the figure of the woman disappeared as the flying fortress flattened her!</p><br/><p>A sound, if that could be considered a sound at all, resounded across the lands. The enormous weight of the flying fortress had just struck the ground, despite the \u2018shock absorption\u2019 from the higher existence, so that was nothing strange.</p><br/><p>The extreme ray of energy followed by the charge of the flying fortress split apart the region at the point of collision and brought about a large scale earthquake, but as Yu IlHan had immediately collected the body of the higher existence the moment he killed \u2018her\u2019, the ground was of no concern for him.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[??? ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? Lv 3?? ???????]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, these question marks again.\u201d</p><br/><p>[IlHan, you just!]</p><br/><p>No matter how you looked at it, it was a \u2018good\u2019 existence! \u2013 just as Liera was about to say that, a screeching woman\u2019s voice rang out in Yu IlHan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[Hey! You! You really had to kill that!?] (????????)</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I had to kill that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spoke as if he was expecting that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you become a pro loner like me, you would be able to differentiate fake tears. How dare you try to deceive me when you were just born.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.Huh?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.Tch.]</p><br/><p>Liera tilted her head after finding out the situation a little late, and the thought-soul of the higher existence ???????? acknowledged that she was inferior to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[Uuuuuugh, again\u2026\u2026another being I can\u2019t win against!]</p><br/><p>While the unexpected farewell and unexpected meeting happened in silence, only Orochi was swallowing his frustration.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>There are quite a lot of things he can do with Blaze! But he still hasn\u2019t mastered it yet!</p><br/><p>Will Orochi be able to win against a higher existence\u2019s thought-soul?</p><br/><p>1. She said the same thing when 10 years became 1000 years.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

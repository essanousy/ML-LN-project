It really is horrible now that I look at him again. I\u2019ll be instantly crushed if I went against this guy head on.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, he was considerably strong even among the 7th class ones. If it was me, I couldn\u2019t have killed it one on one. It was only possible because Nati\u00e8re was there as well.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na was having a bloody fight with Liera until just a moment ago, but when Yu IlHan took out Kelatuke\u2019s body, she didn\u2019t lose the opportunity to appeal to him and flew towards him. She wanted him to pamper her since it was thanks to her effort that he acquired this body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thanks. Thanks to you, I have another opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ufufu.]</p><br/><p>In the past, he was affected by Heli\u00e8na\u2019s charm, and fought with the 8th wing of Brilliant Light, Nati\u00e8re in vain and in the end, took his own life. However, the magic power remaining within the body was enormous and the body had repaired itself, and right now, it had completely recovered and made people wonder if he was really dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now I need to\u2026\u2026 dismantle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You look more serious than ever before, master\u2026\u2026. Sometimes, I envy your useless passion.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it\u2019s useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised the Eight-tailed dragon spear and put on a fire. This was the translucent flame that Yu IlHan only became able to use after receiving the blessing of the goddess of fire, and with the effects of all sorts of titles and skills as well!</p><br/><p>The compressed flame that stayed at the tip of the spear was very faint, just enough to be visible, but the power it contained was frightening. Just this could be the reason why Yu IlHan could receive the blessing of the goddess of fire.</p><br/><p>[I can feel the energy of dragons as well.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Blaze enhanced by Dragonic blood, plus Orochi\u2019s flame, the purple flames, as well as the Eternal Flame put together.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If the Heart of Fire that master possesses is added to this, I think you may be able to enhance it even further.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that after I finish this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He held the spear by the end of the shaft and pierced the blade into Kelatuke\u2019s head. If he was alive, even that would have been hard, but right now it was unable to resist. The blade went in smoothly like it was cutting tofu. Yu IlHan raised it little by little while taking deep breaths. Blood scattered everywhere, but he caught them all using the container he had prepared beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I think this will work.\u201d</p><br/><p>His speed with the spear became faster. The gigantic armored shark over hundred meters in size showed more and more of its inner flesh when Na YuNa shouted in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan! I want shark\u2019s fin soup~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I boil soup with this guy\u2019s fins, it would be enough to feed all the people who entered the barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m hungry as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you eat a lot of dragon meat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShark meat looks tastier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was dismantling Kelatuke with the intention of reinforcing the Flying fortress, but the rest of his companions only wanted to eat shark meat.</p><br/><p>In fact, shark meat was very good as a food ingredient if you left aside the fact that it rotted pretty fast, but Kelatuke\u2019s meat had a lot of mana and would not rot even if it was left out for 100 years. Somehow, as a cook with level 100 Cooking, Yu IlHan also had the urge for shark sushi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 Well, I have no need for the flesh so should we eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re eating it\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cleanly separated all of its bones and the metallic armor, cutting the soft fins and flesh into chunks suitable for making sushi. He cut the fins into pieces to boil it into soup, cut the flesh into sashimi and thicker slices, grilled it, boiled it, etc\u2026\u2026 looking at the cooking Yu IlHan, Kang MiRae and Na YuNa somehow felt a sense of defeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t make doenjang-guk\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that Mr. IlHan is cooking for us, but this somehow feels wrong. Is this really fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, quickly! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cooking also became faster when he got used to it. Yu IlHan used a mere three hours to cook enough shark cooking to feed even the 8 thousand children of the Dragon\u2019s Army. Since he used the Cradle of Miracles to cook, the toxicity was not that high either!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026My.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak, so delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae and Na YuNa were feeling awkward, but all that flew away after tasting the shark meat food, and they started focusing on the cooking. The others were the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, how did you get the fishy smell out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA drop of breath works wonders against shark\u2019s smell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mom\u2019s loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Kim YeSeul admitted her defeat!</p><br/><p>[Kelatuke didn\u2019t become 7th class to end up as a bowl of shark\u2019s fin soup\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLife would be no fun with a set destination.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It should be more fun than becoming sushi at least\u2026\u2026 ah, so delish. Darling really can do anything.]</p><br/><p>Kelatuke\u2019s body was very huge, and even though they had their fill, more than 95% of the body was remaining. Yu IlHan cut apart the flesh into suitable pieces and stored it inside his inventory, and finally started on upgrading the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic, what do you think this fortress lacks as the main system?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well, common sense?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot the one that you lack, but what the fortress lacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Materials?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my mistake to ask you. The answer is defensive power.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Flying fortress had the ability to cast a barrier over itself at the expenditure of mana. If it came down to it, the barrier also protected the fortress from the shock when it smashed into places to attack. However, in Yu IlHan\u2019s mind, that was not enough when attacking higher existences. Barrier cast by mana could easily be ripped apart even by him as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, now I\u2019m going to enhance the barrier with the metallic armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Such an absurd thing again\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>To say it again, Kelatuke\u2019s body was ginormous. Of course, it was no problem to envelop the entire fortress with the armor he possessed.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan first mana crafted each of the metallic scales so that it became transparent, and installed scale shooters on the outer perimeter of the Flying fortress so it could naturally launch scales and cover the Flying fortress when the barrier activated. It was a device that reacted to a certain type of mana, and it was a very delicately designed engine, but to the master of magic engineering, this kind of device was as easy as pie.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s also possible to just shoot the scales with the launcher, and it can also shoot out the scales from the barrier when the stress on the barrier is too high.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not the end, right? There\u2019s no way you would stop at just there.]</p><br/><p>Of course, there was one more part left. It was the enhancement of the barrier itself! If rotation was applied to the barrier, the armored scales on top of it would spin like mad like a drill, and once the Flying fortress charged forward in that state, it would literally grind apart anything on its path!</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s not human!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll stop being human. No, I\u2019ll surpass all humans! Mystiiiiiiiic!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stop being so light hearted at such a serious moment!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had to consume a considerable amount of 5th class magic stones for this process. As all the work was done under meticulous planning and design and with over-the-top materials, success was predestined! The most frightening drill across all universes came out of it.</p><br/><p>[Annihilator\u2019s Flying fortress was complete.]</p><br/><p>And it finally happened \u2013 the \u2018it\u2019 that Yu IlHan had been waiting for.</p><br/><p>[Annihilator\u2019s Flying fortress]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Eternal]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 100,000,000/100,000,000]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 Yu IlHan]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Recovers durability by absorbing the mana and life force of nearby enemies.</p><br/><p>2. Automatically shoots down all entrants without permission.</p><br/><p>3. Grows by absorbing records of various beings.</p><br/><p>4. Flight enabled. Sudden acceleration, sudden levitation, sudden falling enabled.</p><br/><p>5. All items within the fortress as well as the fortress itself is treated like the user\u2019s equipped item. The ones in party with the fortress\u2019s user may receive protection from the fortress, and will be treated like a member of it.</p><br/><p>6. 20% increase in defense power and attack power of all artifacts in the fortress.</p><br/><p>7. 20% increase in defense power and attack power of all artifacts in the fortress.</p><br/><p>8. Able to attack and defend using a special barrier.</p><br/><p>9. Chances of miracles increase within the holy region.]</p><br/><p>[A creation that surpassed technology, records, and miracles. It is not yet complete due to a single missing piece, but it will be completed soon.]</p><br/><p>[You have created an Eternal-ranked creation. You have acquired the title, \u2018Surpasser\u2019.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, our dear Flying fortress! Became a rank higher than God! Yu IlHan wanted to cry tears of joy.</p><br/><p>However, the title that he acquired after making the Eternal ranked treasure tugged at his mind. Surpasser? What did he surpass? What was the ability of the title? There was nothing that he could understand about it.</p><br/><p>[What is it, darling?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he wanted to explain it to the others, the only one that acquired this title was him. They would not be able to understand.</p><br/><p>Although it was slightly different from what he had expected, he had succeeded in upgrading the Flying fortress so he decided to leave it there.</p><br/><p>However, Mystic, grabbed him just as he was about to turn around.</p><br/><p>[Master, I feel strange.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, is the common sense you didn\u2019t have about to appear or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I feel like I need to cough but it\u2019s stifled! Uaaaaaaaaaah, so frustrating!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that the \u2018missing piece\u2019 was what made her frustrated. However, if he knew what it was, wouldn\u2019t he have completed it immediately? He shrugged his shoulders and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I tickle you or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, what did you do to the fortress! I\u2019m frustrated! I feel stifllllllled!]</p><br/><p>Even after that Mystic screamed about being stifled for quite a while, but there was nothing Yu IlHan could do. He asked Orochi to do something, but Orochi only sighed and replied like this.</p><br/><p>[When a woman is frustrated and angry, it\u2019s best to just leave her alone rather than asking why. That\u2019s the best way to minimize damage.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOoh, aren\u2019t you wise?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master\u2019s an idiot! Orochi\u2019s even more of an idiot!]</p><br/><p>When he told the others that the Flying fortress was now of Eternal rank, the others were confused at first, but then become shocked at the fact that there was a rank above God at all. Even the most experienced one, Heli\u00e8na, made an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>[Eternal? It\u2019s the first time I heard of that, darling. I\u2019ve seen quite a few blacksmithing masters in my life\u2026\u2026 but even they couldn\u2019t make anything better than God ranked.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019re witnessing the birth of an item that had never existed since the conception of the Akashic Record.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The first\u2026\u2026 perhaps. Fufu, I\u2019m happy that I can spend this time with darling.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one here. I\u2019m here as well, and IlHan is mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The upgrade of the Flying fortress was finished successfully. Although he did spend all of Kelatuke\u2019s metallic armor, the results were good so Yu IlHan was satisfied. Moreover.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t have to do the impossible-impossible. I still have his bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s still something left\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>However, Kelatuke\u2019s bones had another use from the beginning. Yu IlHan piled them up on one side of the barrier and took out a portion of Echjar\u2019s bones on another. Then, he took out Echjar\u2019s DRAGON HEART, and the Heart of Fire as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now, don\u2019t approach this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>He warned the others with a firm voice, and took off everything, including the gauntlet made from Chaos Will\u2019s remains as well as the Infernal dragon body. Orochi asked him.</p><br/><p>[Do you think you can make it now, master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded without hesitation, before taking out an anvil and a hammer and taking a deep breath.</p><br/><p>He had enough materials. He also had a clear objective known as the Eternal rank.</p><br/><p>Now, it was finally the time to complete his ideal armor.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The crafting scene is getting a little long, but this is the most important crafting process in the entire storyline so I cannot skip it. I\u2019ll try to make it as interesting as possible!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>A whopping $722 in just one night\u2026..</p><br/><p>The queue is now $622.

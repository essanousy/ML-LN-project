That\u2019s fortunate\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Whoaah?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ugh, I thought I\u2019d have a little more time, but any more is\u2026..]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, soon, my]</p><br/><p>And the voice disconnected there. Yu IlHan stood there in confusion and tapped his cheeks. Mystic asked.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing, master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you couldn\u2019t hear that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I did, it was definitely the voice of that angel that was with you before.]</p><br/><p>If he heard it alone, he might have treated it as his own illusion due to his longing, but it seemed like even Orochi heard that.</p><br/><p>[There was another angel?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yes. There was.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no doubt about it. The calm and cold voice definitely belonged to Erta. He couldn\u2019t forget that voice. The hearty\u2026\u2026 actually, not so hearty, but still good \u2013 ally had been with him from the beginning of the Great Cataclysm until just a few years ago!</p><br/><p>The problem was how her voice could be transmitted to the Yu IlHan who was inside the barrier made by the Hourglass of Eternity.</p><br/><p>\u201cA recorded file?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It was live.]</p><br/><p>Orochi immediately retorted to Yu IlHan\u2019s words. However, he only pouted and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut unless she\u2019s inside the barrier, that is impossible. The time inside the Hourglass of Eternity cannot be recognized outside the barrier. No, actually, there is a trace that Erta left within the Hourglass of Eternity, did she use that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nothing would come out of asking me.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought about that, but nothing came out of it. He did not know the reason she could transmit her voice to him, nor did he know the reason she did so, but once the barrier dispels and he went outside, he would probably find out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s finish it off quick and find out what\u2019s happening outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So everything ends in work?]</p><br/><p>In any case, he felt a little better after hearing Erta\u2019s voice. He shouldn\u2019t judge from the voice alone, but it seemed that she was still doing well. Moreover, since she sought Yu IlHan out first, he would be able to meet her sooner or later. Thinking about that, he subconsciously smiled.</p><br/><p>[So, what was that just now?]</p><br/><p>Mystic was full of questions, but no one answered her. Yu IlHan only took out new 4th class magic stones. Tens of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I should add some functionalities while I\u2019m at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master has it good, enjoying such a life. A certain someone died immediately after birth.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTo set an alarm function on the entirety of the formation\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Time would flow rapidly when Yu IlHan was absorbed in something. One hundred 4th class magic stones disappeared, one thousand more disappeared, and ten thousand more disappeared. In that time, the magic formation was being changed from the very foundation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll become a mess once the barrier opens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they would immediately realize at that moment. They wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, though. The ancient elves were quite capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re even better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan while feeling the presence of Liera behind his back. Of course, one of his hands was still on the ground and the other was pulling out the mana out of the magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the battle training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI finished it for now and let them rest. But why are they so good? Especially the elves. They had tremendously high skills for their level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because they struggled to survive amidst dragons until now\u2026\u2026 But finished? Why did you finish it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera gave a smack on the back of Yu IlHan\u2019s head since he never turned around even though she was here, before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only a day left before the barrier dissipates. They can only go against higher existences if they recover their full conditions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are something. You were like that this entire time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even feel the flow of time honestly\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally realized that he was in contact with the magic formation for quite a long time. He checked on the magic formation for now, and it seemed that he would be able to finish within the allocated time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then you go rest too, Liera. I\u2019ll finish this off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Shouldn\u2019t you be saying that you want to rest with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, as long as Yu IlHan had work remaining, Liera had to give up on the short romantic night before the battle. It was her own fault for falling for him despite knowing that. However, she was also past the point of no return, since she thought that that his such figure was still cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rest. You shall regret missing this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wait, Liera, Erta gave me a message over the barrier, is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErta did?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even let Liera put up her pride as a woman and changed topics. However, as his new topic was very unexpected Liera still obediently participated in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth had already lost its connection to Heaven. But now that you\u2019ve activated the Hourglass of Eternity here in Dareu, perhaps that was transmitted to Erta. If there is an artifact that activates the moment the Hourglass of Eternity does, then it\u2019s not actually impossible\u2026\u2026..But.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s voice whispered into Yu IlHan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Erta say something to you? Be honest with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much. She only said it\u2019s fortunate or whatnot. Perhaps there\u2019s a limit to the message, but it was soon disconnected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunate, fortunate, she said. Ufu, it won\u2019t be so \u2018fortunate\u2019 soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s face had a dark smile as if she was drawing a foreshadow. It was a smirk that did not fit her usual bright self!</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, it\u2019s quite exciting to imagine Erta\u2019s crying face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bully her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably bully her the most though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I bully her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that. You\u2019ll probably be in the dark for all of eternity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the dense Yu IlHan, realizing the truth from that much clue was impossible. Liera did not speak anymore and went away.</p><br/><p>Perhaps she was still not used to her lower existence body, and she had to rest after the two weeks of unending battle. In fact, even if Yu IlHan assaulted her first, she would have to refuse. Of course, not that this made Yu IlHan not bad\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally raised his head to see Liera. She approached him and kissed his lips like a bird pecking on food. He widened his eyes, but loosened them soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel energized now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was not the passionate romance that she wanted, this was probably good in itself \u2013 as Liera became happier with Yu IlHan\u2019s smile, she decided to let him go for today.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan returned to work, and Liera went into the Flying fortress to let her tired body rest. And before a day went past, Yu IlHan finally finished modifying the magic formation.</p><br/><p>18 minutes prior to the barrier\u2019s dispelling time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was close.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had more time and funds\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m frustrated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crammed in so many new functions, what else can there be!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ancient elves did indeed install a magic formation difficult to find in any other world, and the time that the magic formation had experienced bestowed it history and power to heighten it further.</p><br/><p>However, the magic formation prior to Yu IlHan\u2019s tinkering, compared to the magic formation after Yu IlHan\u2019s modifications differed overwhelmingly. If the former was the 3rd class Yu IlHan, the latter could be called the 4th class Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>First, the already fast activation time was shortened even further, and the mana ripples in the activation sequence was reduced to the minimum to increase efficiency and secretiveness, and the magic formation additionally sensed any beings that were not allies that tried to come in contact with the formation, and told Yu IlHan the location. To top it off, he set a debuff to limit the activation of movement-class skills and magic.</p><br/><p>To sum up, like how the Heaven\u2019s Army or the Destruction Demon Army were tremendously strong in their own territories and had easy time defending against invaders, Yu IlHan had also acquired near complete control over Dareu!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s still lacking\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll be satisfied with this for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really don\u2019t stop anywhere. Auh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make weird moaning sounds and focus on control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as you say it is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who now had to control two holy regions after the Guardian fortress was made into a holy region, had become very sensitive. Even while receiving Liera\u2019s glare, she did not let go of Yu IlHan\u2019s hand. Though, she would have to since the barrier would be dispelled at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, is everything over now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe preparation for the beginning has ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lightly replied to Pat\u00e9 before looking around to the elves and wolfkin. He nodded lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now is our turn. It will be our turn until the very end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the time was short, they had experienced a training where they were squeezed to their limits, and their pressure was as if they wiped out several higher existences already. Yu IlHan laughed and turned around before taking a short breath.</p><br/><p>Now, he really had to kill higher existences with them. He had the confidence to.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright now too, are you not, Miss YuNa?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it since there\u2019s no time. Tch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa let go of Yu IlHan\u2019s hand as if she couldn\u2019t help it. It seems that she wasn\u2019t lying when she said it was difficult, as she immediately creased her brows, but the flow of mana in the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress was still stable.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it had been some time since he had acquired the Hourglass of Eternity, never was he as tense as this time. Where was this nervousness coming from? Anxiety? Excitement? Fear? If not that, then expectation?</p><br/><p>\u2018Good, I want to become a higher existence by the end of this war.\u2019</p><br/><p>He had no plans to join the Heaven\u2019s Army, or the Destruction Demon Army or the Garden of Sunset. Yu IlHan wanted to become a higher existence independently, on his own, with his potential alone.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably nothing \u2013 even Chaos Will from Earth had done it, so there was no reason why Yu IlHan\u2019 couldn\u2019t. Yu IlHan dispelled the barrier after setting a grand objective that would put anyone to shock.</p><br/><p>And time started flowing again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves, who were waiting in fear, looked for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is nothing changing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought all of them would attack us, whether it\u2019s the Destruction Demon Army or the Garden of Sunset.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied to them while finding an area where there were the least number of higher existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cConcealment is casted over all of us. Not to mention higher existences, even their grandpas won\u2019t find us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this is our turn, right? How long are you going to hide in fear? We\u2019re going to be the ones invading this time, and beating them up. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cU, understood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was still unsatisfied with their mental education, but he couldn\u2019t help it. They would be able to come to themselves once they actually fought higher existences, so he immediately\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan stopped mid way through the activation. Although it was very far, he could feel something that was moving in a straight line towards them.</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan had mentioned just now, they were under concealment, so no one should be able to find their locations\u2026.. if there was one, there\u2019s\u2026</p><br/><p>Erta.</p><br/><p>He turned around to Liera, but now that she was no longer an angel, she didn\u2019t seem to have found her yet. Yu IlHan thought about what to do for a moment, but decided to wait.</p><br/><p>The wait was not long. As Dareu had ascended into the realm of higher worlds, any higher existences could utilize their full powers without holding back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera soon noticed and voiced out. Her face contained confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, how hurried can she be!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the Heaven\u2019s Army may already be here in Dareu. What we saw maybe just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta soon showed herself below the clouds. Not accompanied by any other angels, she alone was flying here with a pair of white wings.</p><br/><p>[Liera!]</p><br/><p>Shouted Erta. Her expression was twisted like an orc that had its food taken away.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, she\u2019s an enemy after all?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to have Erta as his enemy! \u2013 Yu IlHan bit on his lips and when he was about to take out his spear, Liera shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNah, she\u2019s on our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh? She just said \u2018I\u2019ll kill you\u2019, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Lieraaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026There\u2019s something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta rage that seemed to fill the world with anger and Liera\u2019s bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan only tilted his head in confusion.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Her rage is justified!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Y\u2019know. This morning, I was like \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m finally clearing my debt today!\u201d Then sometime later, someone just threw me an entire day\u2019s worth of money of sponsored chapters\u2026.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s also an unwritten author note 2, which goes \u2013 \u201cI won\u2019t be doing two chapters tomorrow. I think that it\u2019s better to focus on quality rather than pumping out chapters without quality.\u201d\u2026.. But author has to consider the plot\u2026. so guess what. there\u2019s still $100 in queue!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

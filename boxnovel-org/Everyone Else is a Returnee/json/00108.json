It\u2019s just that good of a weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I really like your positive attitude.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also like myself like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wipe your tears before you say that.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>His energy drained, Yu IlHan made another bow. Fortunately, no useless user restrictions were attached this time, and it ended at legend rank. Of course, its general power didn\u2019t even come close to half of Deathgod\u2019s Trajectory, but for Pat\u00e9 it would still be very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo since it\u2019s late, let\u2019s stop here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He checked the state of the meat and blood in the bucket and poured some more blood before cleaning away the remaining tools.</p><br/><p>However, he realized something just as he pushed the bucket onto one side of the workshop; that his strength was too high.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? I didn\u2019t even activate Superhuman Strength though.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because you\u2019ve acquired your 3rd class. Moreover, you didn\u2019t forget that you have a completely different number of stats compared to other humans because of your thousand years of training, right? Oh, there\u2019s also the status increase reward from Heaven\u2019s Quest.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>That was true. As he always fought against stronger beings than himself and higher levelled beings than himself, he had forgotten that he was way above average.</p><br/><p>[And here, I thought that you\u2019d use up all dragon corpses here.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cInvestigating the situation, and contacting the Lightning God Clan comes first. I should decide how many and what kind of equipment I need to make after that. I\u2019ll also decide on the date of selling the higher equipments at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everything was smooth on the outside, he wouldn\u2019t know the truth unless he investigated properly. If it was Lightning God who always acted on the front lines against the monsters, then they would be able to give him the necessary information.</p><br/><p>[I think you\u2019re overthinking it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ll see about that.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Even when Yu IlHan returned to the apartment with the two angels and the still sleeping Yumir, the elves were still sleeping. However, when he started making some ramen with a lot of meat, they woke up immediately and shot out from their rooms.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, this smell is!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think there is a smell that provokes the desire to eat so much\u2026 This world really is\u2026\u2026 Whoa, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>To the elves who just started eating meat after eating vegetables for their entire lives, the smell of ramen, the alpha and omega of instant foods, would be fatal.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since he had not pulled back on the meat, this ramen had enough power comparable to the bonus dungeon\u2019s boss that appeared after the last boss in an RPG.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m very sorry! We\u2019ve slept without a care in the world! We should\u2019ve protected you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they were just woken up, their faces should have been horrible, but these guys\u2026 were camera-worthy despite just waking up. If Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t \u2018trained\u2019 by Liera\u2019s appearance, his heart would\u2019ve pounded like mad!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s protecting who? Just sit down and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t want to see an elf eating ramen\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You will see even cooler things in the future so look forward to it, Liera. You\u2019d be so surprised.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>As they hadn\u2019t eaten anything for the entire day, they deliciously ate the ramen Yu IlHan gave them with a fork. Of course, it wasn\u2019t that Yu IlHan was just watching, but he activated the Rule skill and subordinated them and even confirmed their stats.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, they\u2019re quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of the best elves among the survivors, their status points were unbelievably higher than normal. Was it like this since he picked out the geniuses from an entire race of elves?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only that. Not only did they have a considerable number of skills, their proficiency and mastery were also very high perhaps due to their long lifespans. They were much higher than what Yu IlHan had expected.</p><br/><p>There was something else that he was surprised with.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, your dismantling skills are all considerable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*. Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he replied while eating, Jril spoke after coughing. To them whose survival was a battle, gathering and dismantling skills were a must!</p><br/><p>The angels finally noticed his intentions.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re going to let these guys do the dismantling!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Dismantling 3rd class dragonkin isn\u2019t possible by just anyone!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ignored them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to do after you eat. Of course, I\u2019ll do some strict teaching so please be prepared for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re prepared for anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Pat\u00e9 in a confident voice, but would they be as confident after hearing what they needed to do? Oh, if he gave them the rewards he had already prepared after they finished their job, then they\u2019ll cry tears of joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Liera, hand Mir to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Here.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera handed Yumir in her arms to Yu IlHan. The elves who were engrossed in ramen finally noticed him after he was in Yu IlHan\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that child? He looks handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe also resembles His Majesty. Is it his little brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son. Oh, and he\u2019s a dragon as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves became speechless at Yu IlHan\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>However, it was also tiring for Yu IlHan to explain everything to them. He just said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has the blood of a dragon who saved you and hid you so don\u2019t hate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO, of course. Even if it isn\u2019t, he\u2019s the son of Your Majesty, how can we\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The female thief, Phiria, replied absent-mindedly. At that moment Yumir woke up from sleep due to the noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woke up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, oh it\u2019s dad! And the pretty noonas too and\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir checked Yu IlHan, Liera and Erta with a smile, but screamed the moment he confirmed the gazes of the four elves and shot up to his feet before going around to Yu IlHan\u2019s back and sticking on his back. Yu IlHan\u2019s back was warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, who are those people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are my subordinates. They\u2019re gentle so you don\u2019t need to be scared of them. They won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t explain like elves are some herbivore animals!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt while replying. Yes. This child was born just today! There was no way a 6 hour-old child would kindly greet and ask for a name to anyone just because that person was is with his father.</p><br/><p>However, Yumir\u2019s reaction was outside of Yu IlHan\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way they\u2019re looking at me is scary. I\u2019m still weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed. I\u2019m hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he desperately activated the concealment skill with all his magic.</p><br/><p>What was amazing was that he actually succeeded disappearing from the elves\u2019 view even with a level 1 concealment!</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, where did His Highness go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? He was just here until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s Concealment skill grows rapidly.]</p><br/><p>[Yumir\u2019s Concealment skill has become level 10. Due to the resonance between the rider, he can borrow a little of the rider\u2019s concealment ability when close to the rider.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s mouth gaped. The angels were the same.</p><br/><p>Yumir was still rubbing his face on Yu IlHan\u2019s back in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>[IlHan\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera was about to say something, but Yu IlHan stopped her. This was because he knew better than anyone else.</p><br/><p>Yumir, this guy, really, resembled Yu IlHan in every way. Not only his ability, but his personality, and even the talent to become a pancosmic loner!</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good thing. Even so, there\u2019s no passive concealment, no?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201c*Groan*.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Yumir who was activating concealment while burying his face on his back, Yu IlHan felt an indescribable feeling, but he sighed before taking him off and hugging him.</p><br/><p>His concealment forcefully wore off, and the elves could finally see Yumir again. Yumir realized that and caused a mess while trying to escape Yu IlHan\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to hide again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are hiding because you\u2019re embarrassed that you\u2019re weak. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY, yeah\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was something decisively different about them, it was this.</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan rejected everyone else in the world in order to stand up alone, then Yumir wanted to hide because he was embarrassed at his weak self. A dragon\u2019s pride was expressed in a strange way after meeting Yu IlHan\u2019s ability!</p><br/><p>However, in Yu IlHan\u2019s thoughts, it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you just have to become strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m still weak so I want to hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. But even so, these guys are my subordinates so it\u2019s alright. They won\u2019t laugh at you or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Yu IlHan glanced at the elves, and the elves who read the situation immediately agreed and bowed towards Yumir. Yumir still wanted to hide as if he was not calm yet, but as he couldn\u2019t hide from the concealment master, he decided to listen to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll endure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Not hiding when you want to is also training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir nodded. Yu IlHan\u2019s child education stepped off successfully.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan confirmed with the elves who were dumbfoundedly looking at the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou done eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves cleanly ate the ramen without leaving a single drop. Yu IlHan\u2019s evaluations on the elves increased.</p><br/><p>After washing the dishes, Yu IlHan lead them and went to the workshop again. However, he let Liera take care of Yumir and made them look after the house. After all, he couldn\u2019t let him see the dismantling of his own kin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, what is that flame in the furnace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite a marvelous place, to be protected by angel\u2019s magic\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out a few dragonkin corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now, you will dismantle this guy with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragonkin? We will do your best!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Phiria replied with conviction, Yu IlHan added with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c30 thousand of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Phiria answered. Well, it was natural, since her dismantling skill level was higher than the rest perhaps due to her job as a thief who used daggers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next 3 hours is training. After that, you have to dismantle using your own power. No training or hunting until you finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if you finish I\u2019ll give the equipment I made to you guys. They\u2019re really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan said that, the elves\u2019 eyes changed. They also knew that the equipment he supplied to the elves were not his best.</p><br/><p>However, they would get better weapons just by doing simple labor? Their already maxed loyalty maxed even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely do them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s the spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s dismantling education was strict. However, in front of the burning passion of the elves, their dismantling skill level grew rapidly, and when they wasted about one thousand dragonkin as practice, they were at a level where they could dismantle 3rd class dragonkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, you just need to do it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking out a few dragonkin for them to dismantle in the workshop, Yu IlHan started his own work. That was the soul enchant he had delayed until now.</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019m doing it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out the Black bone giant spear. The spear was beautiful after it was finished polishing. He was sure that there would be no spear stronger than this, at least against dragonkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul enchant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deathgod-class skill that Reta had. This was the moment when the skill that may disrupt the balance of matter if used properly, was activated on Earth.</p><br/><p>[Krararararararar!]</p><br/><p>Orochi realized that Yu IlHan was trying to take his thought outside and roared in delight.</p><br/><p>If he was just taken out, then it would shatter into smithereens in an instant, but Yu IlHan was already holding onto the new body for it, the Black bone giant spear. Which was once a part of its own body, but was now better!</p><br/><p>Soul enchant. Fortunately, it had similarities to mana crafting which he had insights on just now.</p><br/><p>Making an already perfect weapon advance to a new realm by adding a soul fragment that was in perfect harmony with it; freeing that thought within the weapon in order to extract the potential of the weapon to its very limits.</p><br/><p>The harmony of the Black bone giant spear and the Orochi was of course, the best. Orochi\u2019s thought settled on the spear without any hesitation, and at that moment, the Black bone giant spear twisted as if alive and changed form.</p><br/><p>The spear body became longer, and the spearhead colored in purple and turned even sharper. Above all, it gave out an overwhelming aura.</p><br/><p>[Eight-tailed dragon spear was completed.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, soul enchant, has become level 13. You can now bring out the power of a soul more easily.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan burst out laughing, the Orochi, which now became a part of the Eight-tailed dragon spear, roared as if to warn him not to laugh.</p><br/><p>As expected, he could now understand a little of how equipments are named.</p><br/><p>Although it looked like the options disappeared while the name was compressed into a simpler name, the reality wasn\u2019t like that. Instead, in the process of the alpha, beta and gamma options merging into one, it would make a unique name for that artifact.</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan wanted, he would be able to revert their names back to the really long names, but he didn\u2019t want to. He respected Orochi\u2019s will to leave behind its name, and could also see the options contained in that name.</p><br/><p>[Eight-tailed dragon spear]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Epic]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 7,000]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 15,000/15,000]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 A deathgod with the power to wield souls.]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Purple flames can be activated.</p><br/><p>2. Can attack after splitting the spearhead into eight.</p><br/><p>3. Sprays poison upon critical hits.</p><br/><p>4. All abilities increase by 120% against dragonkin.]</p><br/><p>[An existence of literature was recreated by a crafter that wields the power of souls. As the crafter\u2019s power to wield souls increases, and as the records pile up, the weapon will evolve.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, the second epic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t make this purely with blacksmithing and mana crafting, this was meaningful in the sense that he gave rise to a 2nd epic with his own hands. Moreover, the evolvable point made Yu IlHan happy.</p><br/><p>Although the ability to amplify deathgod-class powers were gone, this could be said to be enhanced in the fundamental way of the weapon. He felt good since it felt like he had found the correct path.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I message them around this time? They should be sleeping around now if nothing\u2019s happening, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re planning to make weapons after you send them a message, aren\u2019t you?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain, don\u2019t read my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The time was already nearing 1 a.m. If she was sleeping, it would be bad to wake her up. Yu IlHan turned on the messenger and sent Kang MiRae, the clan master of the Lightning God Clan, that he returned to Earth.</p><br/><p>However, the message was read instantly and he got a phone call. As soon as Yu IlHan received the call with round eyes, a screaming woman\u2019s voice could be heard. It was Kang MiRae\u2019s.</p><br/><p>[Mr. Yu IlHan!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan realized that something had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for not receiving your call for the past few months. You should know from Mr. Kang HaJin, but I went to an Abandoned Wo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s it! Abandoned World!]</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae rarely shouted. Yu IlHan only blinked his eyes in surprise.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to ask back because he didn\u2019t know why she was so flustered.</p><br/><p>[Today! Just a while ago, it was found that a dungeon in Korea was connected to an Abandoned World. It\u2019s already at the point where it can no longer be sealed, and it merged with Earth and it\u2019s all chaotic! Mr. Yu IlHan. It\u2019s really fortunate that you didn\u2019t come back too late\u2026..!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan momentarily couldn\u2019t answer and pondered seriously on the spot. He could only think this.</p><br/><p>Hey, is my existence on Earth the problem?</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Your first training partner is not a monster but a corpse!</p><br/><p>Shy dragon Yumir. His concealment will not stop evolving until it becomes the strongest in the world!</p><br/><p>There should\u2019ve been other things that happened on Earth even beore you came back, IlHan! Don\u2019t worry!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>His existence is causing problems everywhere\u2026.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

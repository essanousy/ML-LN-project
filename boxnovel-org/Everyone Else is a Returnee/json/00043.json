This was the moment where his strongest weapon, which helped him at decisive momements, was destroyed completely. Until he could find an object to replace the Giant\u2019s Rubber String, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make another pile bunker again.</p><br/><p>Of course, the pile bunker really did bring out the effects of extreme modification. There was no troll which would still be alive even after it had its brain matter crushed, spine destroyed, body bisected, and its heart ruptured, as of yet on Earth.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 7,854,557 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 109 Highland Troll Boss.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the title \u2018Not two hits, nor three hits, but one hit\u2019. If you kill an enemy in a single strike, the experience earned and the possibility of acquiring a magic stone increases by 20%]</p><br/><p>[Kill a 3rd class monster in a surprise attack 1/1]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan recovered the remnants of the pile bunker in an instant while in midair before landing on the ground safely by using the troll\u2019s corpse as a foothold.</p><br/><p>Looking behind, he could see two humans and a scorpion who could not get themselves up properly due to the shockwave of the bone nail striking the ground.</p><br/><p>If there was any common points between them, it was that they were looking at Yu IlHan with disbelieving eyes. Loner Yu IlHan, who wasn\u2019t used to receiving attention from others, shyly spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, continue with whatever you were doing just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man shouted in frustration, but the priestess shouted as if afraid of missing this opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you help us kill that scorpion, we\u2019ll give you everything other than the poisooon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this idiot. Whoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that the priestess, Na YuNa, was sure that the man couldn\u2019t kill the scorpion by himself. This could be said to be a lack of trust in her companion, but could also be said to be that she had the ability to judge the situation cool headedly, unlike her clumsy outer appearance.</p><br/><p>The man stopped bickering with the woman as the scorpion\u2019s poison needle assaulted him after getting balanced faster than him. Meanwhile, Yu IlHan thought about her offer for a moment before nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! See, oppa!? I said he was kind riiiight!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, fuck. I don\u2019t know anything anymore, dammit all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin replied as if slightly relieved, slightly hurt, but slightly despairing tone before posturing himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs YuNa said, if you help us, we\u2019ll give you everything other than the poison!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that couple\u2019s relationship quite interesting? \u2013 With such useless thoughts, Yu IlHan took out his spear and postured himself. Then, at the same moment as the scorpion assaulted towards the man, he kicked off the ground.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the strength from the superhuman strength skill was maintained. He\u2019d finish that scorpion off within that duration!</p><br/><p>\u201cHup!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time as Yu IlHan flew at it, the scorpion swept its scorpion tail on the floor. Kang HaJin dodged it by jumping backwards, but Yu IlHan coudln\u2019t care less, so he just charged forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he swung his spear with all his strength to slash the tail mid way!</p><br/><p>{Kukyaaaakagagak!}</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he so\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>You should think about how to strike hard now, since the scorpion is rampaging all over the place, if you have the time to exclaim!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan really did that. The spearhead, which didn\u2019t lose any strength even after cutting off that thick tail, and struck the scorpion\u2019s head after slashing through the air!</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Fuu, Chasing Strike!\u201d</p><br/><p>A skill! So envious!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan momentarily thought that, but Kang HaJin\u2019s skill, which struck the scorpion\u2019s chest with a bright pink light, was weaker than Yu IlHan\u2019s normal attack under superhuman strength mode. Feeling a crack appearing on the expectations he had of mana, Yu IlHan asked Erta in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot all skills are like that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not all humans are you.]</p><br/><p>Anyway, Kang HaJin did his role sufficiently. It was because his skill, Chasing Strike, was a special skill which would become stronger, affected by the attack which attacked the target previously.</p><br/><p>When a chain of strong shock was applied, the Giant Death Stalker ended up falling into a stunned state, and Yu IlHan, who would never miss the enemy\u2019s slight change in sttate, didn\u2019t miss that opportunity and attached himself on top of its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuuuuup!\u201d</p><br/><p>His spear strike had already drilled a sufficient wound on its head. What was Yu IlHan\u2019s specialty? Wasn\u2019t it kicking where he kicked before?</p><br/><p>As if being possessed by a woodpecker, he clung onto its head by clamping his legs around its head, before striking down the same place with his spear held in both of his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, fuck, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s what anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa spoke a line that didn\u2019t fit the situation, and Kang HaJin, who once again received a buff from her, gave up everything and charged like Yu IlHan before beating up the scorpion.</p><br/><p>[Kku, Kkuweeek!] (T/N: This is a little like \u2018yelp\u2019 in English, but scorpions don\u2019t \u2018yelp\u2019\u2026 hence literal raws)</p><br/><p>When the chain of strikes full of Yu IlHan\u2019s superhuman strength, and, although Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know, the buffed attack of a 2nd class warrior was added, the scorpion collapsed, not being able to endure having its most lethal means of attack destroyed.</p><br/><p>Cruely, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t stop thrusting his spear until he was sure that it was dead.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 2,479,989 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 95 Giant Death Stalker.]</p><br/><p>As they weren\u2019t in a party, the experience was solely taken by Yu IlHan. Kang HaJin, who only realized that the scorpion was dead after Yu IlHan stopped his attacks, made a bitter expression after realizing that they weren\u2019t in a party.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, we can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a profit just killing the Giant Death Stalker safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really really strong! It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen someone stronger than oppaaaa!\u201d (T/N: Savage)</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin seemed to have a crack on his pride as a man after hearing Na YuNa\u2019s innocent comment. Of course, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less if his pride was wounded or not. He started dismantling the scorpion the moment it died, and as they said in the beginning, he was pulling out the poison gland.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. I\u2019ve taken out all the poison within this thing\u2019s body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin, who expressed his appreciation obediently while receiving the poison needle and the venom sac, was a calculative man when it came down to it. In contrast, Yu IlHan went into working with the rest the moment their transaction ended.</p><br/><p>Although there was no magic stone in the Giant Death Stalker, its carapace was absurdly hard, and the meat looked very delicious at a glance.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finished dismantling it while humming, and continued on to the Highland Troll Boss, while Na YuNa and Kang HaJin were looking at him working with absent-minded gazes after they received the Death Stalker\u2019s poison, while Erta, was interrogating Feyta.</p><br/><p>[You intended to receive help from Yu IlHan from the beginning, right?]</p><br/><p>[N, no.]</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re honest, I\u2019ll forgive you.]</p><br/><p>[In fact, I did intend that!]</p><br/><p>[Angel Sleeper Hold!]</p><br/><p>[You liar, *Screams*!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWao, angel-nims seem to be close!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my eyes, it looked like divine retribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Yu IlHan subconsciously exclaimed. It wasn\u2019t because he became satisfied after looking at the angels becoming closer to each other, nor was it because he got goosebumps after listening to the couple\u2019s conversation.</p><br/><p>It was because a magic stone popped out from the giant troll\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Angel Cross Choke, wait, what!?]</p><br/><p>[3rd class magic stones are appearing already!? *Screams*!]</p><br/><p>This was the moment when the opportunity for evolving the Resting skill, which he had lost previously, had come again, in a more perfect manner. That was because the 3rd class magic stone was from a troll, which had a Resting skill.</p><br/><p>Although there was no differentiation on the types of monsters from which the magic stone had to be acquired from, it was needless to say that the magic stone from a troll, which had a closer affinity, was better than one from the shadow leopard.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t need to make them aware of Yu IlHan\u2019s skill by evolving it right now. Yu IlHan cleaned the magic stone well and put it inside his Cross Bag before continuing with the dismantling of he troll. Forgetting about Na YuNa and Kang HaJin who were making absent-minded gazes at the flash of appearance of a 3rd class magic stone.</p><br/><p>Around that time, the duration of the superhuman strength ran out and he suddenly felt extreme fatigue, but Yu IlHan didn\u2019t stop. His techniques were good to the point that it would sufficiently make up for the deficiencies in his strength.</p><br/><p>What was amazing, was that Na YuNa, who was looking at that process, activated her skill suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake that person stronger, yapp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spoke out in surprise. When the light pink colored magic, which came from her stretched hand, cameinto contact with Yu IlHan, the fatigue which covered his entire body eased up a little.</p><br/><p>He thought that it was a recovering ability befitting a priestess, but what was more amazing was that even though Yu IlHan didn\u2019t show it much on the surface, she had noticed something wrong with his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have good eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan could only say that sourly. Na YuNa obediently accepted his praise and straightened her waists.</p><br/><p>The already plump chests were emphasized, so Yu IlHan turned his gaze to the troll in embarrassmnet. Only Kang HaJin was making a strange expression as he understood Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Highland Troll Boss was a treausre without wastes.</p><br/><p>He was thankful that it had died in a single strike without any words, but not only had it left behind a magic stone, it also left behind a tough hide, strong bones, muscles and tendons which seemed like they were processable into Giant\u2019s Rubber Band, and lastly, blood which looked thicker than other trolls! Adding meat on top of this, there really was nothing to throw away.</p><br/><p>Even though it may not have had the slightest intention to become like this, Yu IlHan would still express his thanks to him. He would even hold X to pay respects if there was a keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning to go back, but if it\u2019s alright with you, won\u2019t you come back with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was being joyful over his harvests, a line which was out of his expectations could be heard. It wasn\u2019t Na YuNa, but Kang HaJin, who was wary of him at fist, who talked first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have noticed as you received Yuna\u2019s and my id cards, we\u2019re a Korean Clan, who\u2019s proactive as a small-scale team of elites. Honestly speaking, your fighting skills are jealous-provokingly good. To the point that I want to receive you as a clan member despite my pride.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoow. That\u2019s so good! MiRae will like it tooooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing that his words were an offer, Na YuNa became delighted while clapping like a seal. The angel, Feyta also brightened up.</p><br/><p>[Yes. It\u2019s good to work together! It\u2019s an advantage of the race known as human race to fill what each other is lacking!] (T/N: The only thing MC lacks is his communication skills)</p><br/><p>And Yu IlHan retorted with a kind smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Groan*, although I did know you would answer that, you are quite firm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan only smiled when he heard that, and didn\u2019t say anything else. Of course, like a loner, his insides were boiling up.</p><br/><p>There was no one who could intrude on the territory of loners. Social butterflies would interact with other social butterflies, but loners would even reject other loners.</p><br/><p>Filling what each other lacks? That really is an advantage in a group. However, Yu IlHan had never benefitted from that. It was because no one had looked at him until now.</p><br/><p>Until now, Yu IlHan endured if things were lacking. Do you think I\u2019ll go over to that side just because you want to be together with me since my skills are exceptional? There is a limit to looking down on loners.</p><br/><p>There was no way that Kang HaJin would know of the path and experiences that he had been through until now. It might have bee na big decision for him to say to come with him, and might have wanted him as a companion for real. Perhaps, he really did want to associate with him. (T/N: Note that Kang HaJin is around 30 years old (other world included) while MC is 1020 years old)</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t accept his offer positively despite knowing that Kang HaJin didn\u2019t</p><br/><p>have any malicious intentions. His twisted personality couldn\u2019t be helped. He will think like this in the future.</p><br/><p>Unless, a huge situation where he has to change his reasoning occurs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiing, I want to hunt together though, it sounds like so much fun though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s so strong, so we\u2019ll be able to meet him again in the future. Try tempting him again then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu\u2026 Okaaaay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Conversing such things blatantly in front of the person in question, Kang HaJin bowed his head with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, you saved us yet again just now. If you contact us we will give you twice, or even three times the compensation. Then we\u2019ll take our leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see each other again! Definitely!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Phew\u2026 that steel like human.]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s not see each other again, Feyta.]</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin, who was clear with his finishing, and Na YuNa, who clung to him even though it had been a little since they even met. Finishing farewell with the two contrasting people, Yu IlHan watched them disappear over the horizon. Until the point that he was sure that the passvie concealment would activate again.</p><br/><p>And when he became sure of that, he spoke in a delighted voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I evolve the Resting skill now!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[How can there be such a my-pace human\u2026?]</p><br/><p>It seemed that the conversation they had until now couldn\u2019t affect Yu IlHan at all. One could only marvel at Yu IlHan\u2019s train of thought, thinking, and doing what he wants.</p><br/><p>However, perhas this was the source of power that made Yu IlHan endure for 1000 years? While thinking that, Erta smiled and decided to look at his work.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Chapter isn\u2019t over yet.</p><br/><p>x key: the key pressed when paying respects\u2026 (T/N: I looked it up, apparrently, it\u2019s from Call of Duty)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I wonder how priest-classes get their exp\u2026 if you heal without being in a party, then\u2026 Or is the heal not effective if not in the same party\u2026?

He looked like a 15 year-old, but his actions were natural even if you take 10 years away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child dragon in Yu IlHan\u2019s arms thought about something after hearing the natural reply and asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI aimed for the moment he used a large-scale magic that had me in the range and moved to Earth with him. As he had broken the rules of the Destruction Demon Army, he fell to a lower existence, his mana leaked out, and from there, it wasn\u2019t that difficult to win against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHing, I can\u2019t do that. I won\u2019t be able to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who understood everything with Yu IlHan\u2019s simple explanation, bit his lips and grumbled. Yu IlHan smiled by at the sight of his son struggling, and patted his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, of course now. Even I wouldn\u2019t be able to win if not for such a cheat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in the end, dad won and the dragon died. Then dad is stronger\u2026\u2026 but I\u2019m too weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>The standard of strength for a dragon was cold-blooded and frightening. However, the words he added made Yu IlHan smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir still has a lot of time. You can become plenty stronger in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike that dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u2026. You\u2019ll need a lot of time, but yes. Definitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if I don\u2019t become stronger right now, I\u2019ll only be a burden to dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fight against such guys all the time. And you are already of plenty help to me right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to fight with dad though\u2026\u2026 Hing, but that dragon is still impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that Yumir had taken quite a shock after looking at Echjar. In addition, Yu IlHan also thought that Echjar\u2019s appearance had not been a good influence on Yumir.</p><br/><p>As he had grown shockingly fast until now, it would be fine if he had confidence in his strength now, but such an absurd monster had appeared and snapped his confidence in half! Moreover, it was a dragon species as well! Now, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if he thought his powers were nothing in the face of overwhelming might, and lose his will to progress.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought about what he could do to cheer him up again, and remembered the reason he looked for Yumir in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad has brought a lot of dragon mean. You\u2019ll become stronger faster if you eat them. I\u2019ll give you Teraka and Echjar\u2019s meat as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuu, I\u2019m always receiving things from dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, it seemed like he had completely fallen into self-denial mode. Yu IlHan thought that there was still time to puberty since he was still young despite being big, but perhaps that wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan had no experience rearing a child, he could not judge how to console the current Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, eeeei.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just as the daddy Yu IlHan was looking for a way out, Yumir cheered himself up. Perhaps due to not being with Yu IlHan since young, he had grown up to be a confident child.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll find something that I can do for dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already giving me so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan voiced sorrily to Mir. However, Yumir shook his head and spoke as if he had already decided.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a daughter-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need one. You\u2019re still too young for marriage\u2026\u2026 but who said that to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mir asked back in shock when Yu IlHan said that he didn\u2019t need a daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just what can I give you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can just become stronger. With dad. You have to eat meat and train as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing \u2018stronger\u2019, he looked more cheered up than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll become strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat a lot and become a lot stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to become stronger than that dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good, he had climbed over the big hill. Yu IlHan stroked Yumir\u2019s head as he grew relieved. Perhaps because his mind was sorted out, Yumir stroked his own stomach and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there should be no battle for a while, so let\u2019s eat up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Yumir, Today, he would host a banquet to celebrate the day he acquired a 6th and a 7th class dragon corpse\u2026\u2026I mean, to celebrate the first victory of the alliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s call them all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the guys dismantling dragons over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll eat their own dismantled meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who became busy because he now had to cook all the cooking ingredients that had piled up in his inventory, walked to the kitchen inside the mansion. Yumir also wiped away the last bit of tears on his eyes and followed his back.</p><br/><p>The news about the obliteration of the Destruction Demon Army invasion party, and the death of Echjar, the 13th Battalion Commander that came for revenge, rapidly spread to each of the factions.</p><br/><p>Everyone in Dareu had felt his descent, and he did not come back after disappearing, so only an idiot would not notice his death.</p><br/><p>[The 13th Battalion Commander\u2026\u2026.? That dragon died? And in Dareu, a colony of dragons?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not sure about 6th classes, but it has been thousands of years since the last 7th class being died.]</p><br/><p>[Will there be a large-scale war again? To think such a battle would occur not on the Wall of Chaos, or Earth, but Dareu instead\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The death of a Battalion Commander was definitely not light. There may be a shift in balance that could possibly bring about further chaos, so not only the Destruction Demon Army, and the other factions didn\u2019t really welcome this matter either.</p><br/><p>And the most important piece of news in this matter was not the dead Echjar, but the identity of the one that killed him.</p><br/><p>[So?]</p><br/><p>[Who did it? Which faction do they belong to?]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s.]</p><br/><p>[Definitely from Heaven\u2019s Army. But I don\u2019t know who it is.]</p><br/><p>The ones that survived the battle after the Destruction Demon Army were obliterated were only angels. Other than the Heaven\u2019s Army, it was difficult for the other factions to find proper information. As such, they could only judge with what little clues they had.</p><br/><p>[The last he was seen was him attacking the Heaven\u2019s Army. Echjar, who was enraged at the death of his successor, went to Dareu, but died just like that\u2026\u2026 I do not understand what kind of method was used.]</p><br/><p>[It was confirmed that he had teleported through dimensions. A sudden, forceful teleportation that pulls every bit of the surroundings\u2026\u2026 this is impossible with just magic alone. There was a skill involved here.]</p><br/><p>[The 6th class high angel there was definitely called\u2026\u2026 Spiera? She was an angel that was predicted to reach 7th class within the next thousand years. However, it should have been impossible for her\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[I cannot understand what is happening.]</p><br/><p>They stopped their thoughts there. They only put up their guard against the Heaven\u2019s Army and forceful dimensional teleportation. As Yu IlHan had expected, the attention and wariness towards him was targeted towards the Heaven\u2019s Army instead.</p><br/><p>However, the Destruction Demon Army was different. Although all forms of communication was severed from the moment Echjar was dragged off to Earth, the one they clashed against the most was Yu IlHan, and they had collected a lot of amount of information about him.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, it\u2019s definitely that human. Everyone felt that Echjar had lost his qualifications as a Destruction Demon Army member, right? He made that happen.]</p><br/><p>So, it wasn\u2019t that difficult for them to find out who and how Echjar was killed.</p><br/><p>[That human? The one that Teraka set his eyes on?]</p><br/><p>[Teraka was killed by Spiera. That courageous and beautiful angel!]</p><br/><p>[Spiera, she\u2019s a woman I want to trample on one day. She\u2019s as stiff as she is lovely.]</p><br/><p>[Everyone shut up, we are talking about Yu IlHan right now.]</p><br/><p>Inside a temple so huge that hundreds of pillars exceeding 300m tall had to support the roof, several monsters were giggling unpleasantly around a round table that had a fountain of boiling blood in the middle. Any one of these monsters could destroy several worlds.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>[I haven\u2019t heard of that name before.]</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s a lower existence.]</p><br/><p>[A lower existence? I was called here because of a lower existence? Oooh, very surprising.]</p><br/><p>Not many worlds could host all of these frightening monsters.</p><br/><p>The name of this world, where everything was gigantic and overwhelming, was Elo Katra. It was a higher world located beyond the Wall of Chaos, where the war between the Heaven\u2019s Army and the Destruction Demon Army happened the most frequently, and was also the main headquarters of these predators.</p><br/><p>The \u2018mankind\u2019 of this world became extinct long ago as a thick fog containing curse and heat, one that made breathing impossible for any beings lower than 4th class, had covered this world. The weather changed according to the ruler\u2019s whims, and so, even the most rigid of plants could not grow and withered easily.</p><br/><p>And so, those that were able to endure living in this world were all strong and vicious. The Destruction Demon Army was just the most vicious of the bunch.</p><br/><p>And the ones here were those that were not lacking in any way to be among the best of the best. The conference of the Battalion Commanders of the Destruction Demon Army. This was the identity of the frightening meeting. Although not all Battalion commanders had come, this number was still very splendid!</p><br/><p>[Is it important that he is a lower existence? Isn\u2019t it more important that he killed Echjar!]</p><br/><p>From the mouth of the 8th Battalion Commander of the Destruction Demon Army, Zenusva, a breath like magma flowed out. It was a giant bird that was made of pure mana fire.</p><br/><p>[A strong pillar of the Destruction Demon Army had disappeared! Are you going to just laugh over his death!]</p><br/><p>[Echjar\u2019s mana was vicious alright.]</p><br/><p>[His curse was even more vicious. But, didn\u2019t you say he fell to a lower existence? Isn\u2019t it possible for him to die then? Is it something to be so surprised about?]</p><br/><p>[What IS surprising, is that a mere lower existence has the power to lower a 7th class Battalion Commander to the same level.]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s definitely something we can\u2019t overlook.]</p><br/><p>The 10th Battalion Commander, Melohinne, nodded her head. It was one of the rare female commanders, and excluding her frozen white skin and a 20m tall stature, she was a very beautiful lady even by human standards.</p><br/><p>She continued speaking in agreement to Zenusva.</p><br/><p>[Then we can just make him join the Destruction Demon Army.]</p><br/><p>[Oh, that\u2019s good!]</p><br/><p>[What!?]</p><br/><p>Zenusva shouted in surprise. However, the majority of the Battalion Commanders in this conference liked her suggestion very much.</p><br/><p>[The one that killed a Battalion Commander!?]</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s precisely why we need to bring him in. Whether it\u2019s petty tricks or whatnot, it\u2019s the undeniable truth that he killed Echjar, no? I can\u2019t wait to see how he grows up in the future. Oh, and I\u2019m also curious about how he looks. Very, very much.]</p><br/><p>[Yes, I\u2019m also curious about what his face looks like.]</p><br/><p>[But Melohinne, no ordinary size should satisfy you.]</p><br/><p>[Fufu, shut up.]</p><br/><p>[The one that massacred the Destruction Demon Army so much, as a member\u2026\u2026 no.]</p><br/><p>Zenusva, who was listening to the opinions of other Battalion Commanders, sighed a little, but still shook its bird head and muttered.</p><br/><p>[Is that so? Yes, this was our way of doing things. It seems that my brain has rotten from the long years of peace.]</p><br/><p>[I did hear that the Heaven\u2019s Army has their eyes on him.]</p><br/><p>[We can just tell him what happened with Earth. Then, he will never be able to choose the Heaven\u2019s Army. Well, then. Let\u2019s hurry while he\u2019s still in Dareu. We still can\u2019t go to Earth yet after all.]</p><br/><p>[Earth? Heaven\u2019s Army? Someone explain.]</p><br/><p>A charming woman with three pairs of bat wings behind her back, the 3rd Battalion Commander, Heli\u00e8na, asked and Zenusva palmed its face with a sigh, when the Battalion Commanders that did not know the specifics all closed their eyes. Just with that, the thoughts in Zenusva\u2019s head was transferred to them.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, quite the interesting man indeed.]</p><br/><p>Hearing everything, even Heli\u00e8na started to take interest in Yu IlHan. Melohinne, who half expected things to come to this, roared at her.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s mine.]</p><br/><p>[Well, wouldn\u2019t he like me more?]</p><br/><p>[It doesn\u2019t matter who takes him. What\u2019s important is the matter about how to bring him to the army.]</p><br/><p>[Yes. That\u2019s my field of specialty indeed.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na stuck out her red tongue and licked her upper lips and glistened her eyes charmingly.</p><br/><p>[No man can reject me. He might have killed a dragon, but he shouldn\u2019t be able to win against the power of the Succubus Queen.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was a guy that could reject the full on advances of a 6th class angel blessed by the god of love, and the woman who was blessed by the goddess of beauty, but Heli\u00e8na was overconfident in her ability and ignored that vital piece of information.</p><br/><p>That day, another Battalion Commander headed to Dareu once again.</p><br/><p>The war for Dareu had just increased in scale by an entire order of magnitude.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>If every kid was like Mir, then Earth in 10 years would have become a planet of war.</p><br/><p>The Destruction Demon Army has a mysterious way of thinking. Would Heli\u00e8na be able to put up her pride as a woman?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll say this because I predict a comment like this will appear, but there are no more additional heroines. (T/N: Does that mean Heli\u00e8na counts?)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How to soclalize with social butterflies.</p><br/><p>At that moment, *rumble*, a stomach rumbled. It wasn\u2019t Yu IlHan, but from the woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought of eating a lobster\u2026 looks delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re thinking such things while looking at a monster which might have killed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the two famished people, Yu IlHan ended up instinctively asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I grill it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yu IlHan\u2019s words, the woman\u2019s expression turned bright and nodded. The man was making a fed up expression. This told them that he was the only(Yu IlHan) normal person in this place. (T/N: Again, \u2018only\u2019 written as Yu IlHan)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finished dismantling and was taking the the carapace, well, not exactly a carapace, but something that didn\u2019t lose out to one in hardness; and the poison needle that it never had the opportunity to use, when Na YuNa hopped towards him and stood in front of the scorpion meat that he had piled up. After that, she put her hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake poison disappear from them, yapp!\u201d (T/N: \u2018yapp\u2019 is like \u2018avda cadavra\u2019)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s magic!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The poison disappeared!]</p><br/><p>Momentariliy, a light pink light appeared, covering the pile of meat before disappearing. This was the moment when the poison from the scorpion meat, which needed poison resistance at least to eat, disappeared.</p><br/><p>[A truly amazing ability. I heard you were blessed by the Goddess of Beauty, but you really do have an amazing holy power.]</p><br/><p>\u201c*Spit*. I knew pretty ones were no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain someone checked on the bathroom mirror whenever he levelled up to see if he became any better, but an innate one was even blessed by a goddess! As always, Yu IlHan\u2019s unreasonable rage was rampaging.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saved us and even cooked the scorpion. Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, a pretty lady was thanking him with a bright smile so he couldn\u2019t get angry. Although she did seem to have a screw loose, she didn\u2019t seem to be a bad person. Of course, he didn\u2019t want to get involved much.</p><br/><p>However, one thing he did mind was that whether this woman was putting her life and the scorpion meat on the same level or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cNa YuNa, how many times did I say that a misunderstanding might occur if you keep acting friendly like that towards a person you met for the same time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe even fought together in LA though? Moreover, Feyta told me that he\u2019s a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Sigh*\u2026\u2026Anyway, thank you for saving YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded, took out the Metal Heart skewers before skewering the scorpion meat. But then, the woman approached him saying she would help, and made him frightened.</p><br/><p>Just what was this extreme level sociability skills!? Social butterflies were always a problem, approaching loners without considering what they think. Even though his loner-power would be revealed in an instant and the mood becomes awkward!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, such pretty skewers. This is also the thing that pierced the pincers a moment ago, right? So pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pierced those pincers with a skewer? You even sliced its head off in an instant too. Just what\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the woman who obediently exclaimed in praise, the man was slightly vigilant against Yu IlHan, but Yu IlHan thought that that was the normal reaction.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Yu IlHan was no different to him in the sense that he was suspicious of them.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was so curious. He only fought trolls until now from the moment he entered the dungeon, but how could they meet scorpions!</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t that because the scorpions couldn\u2019t find you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. It isn\u2019t. Please tell me it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grilled the scorpion meat, which its poison was gotten rid of, after putting some salt on it. Not long later, a fragrant smell better than troll meat could be smelled. Even the man, who looked as if saying \u2018I want none of this\u2019, approached the fire due to the savory smell.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even have a cooking skill!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I do have one, but this is just salted grills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two starved people started eating as soon as the skewers were grilled.</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan filled his stomach already with the troll meat, he only ate one and gave them the rest, but the taste was amazing that it made him touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I will also kill the scorpions in this dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I already knew you would say that.]</p><br/><p>Scorpion skewers became today\u2019s hot item and they sold out in 10 minutes. However, while Yu IlHan was recovering the skewers and was cleaning them, Na YuNa approached him and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you bored alone? Do you want to party with uuuus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Walking next to such a pretty girl like me in a party is happiness itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao! Oppa, I was rejected instantly! Even though I\u2019m so pretty!\u201d (T/N: \u2018Wao!\u2019 is her catchphrase, a changed version of \u2018Wow\u2019)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin laughed at her, before bowing down to Yu IlHan politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank you for saving YuNa. However, there is a saying to not trust anybody within the dungeon. Even if that person is someone with a guardian angel, and someone who has saved my party member. I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re planning to leave. Although I have nothing to repay you with right now, if you contact me with this number later, then I will definitely repay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan agreed with the fact that one shouldn\u2019t trust anyone within the dungeon. Of course, he had no experience going to another world, so he didn\u2019t know if it was true or not.</p><br/><p>Thinking that he was a cold person, Yu IlHan accepted the id card. A company name he seem to remember from somewhere and the name, Kang HaJin. No, the id card itself looked very familiar.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it. It was the same id card as the one the Empress, Kang MiRae, gave him.</p><br/><p>Although something sparked in his head for a short moment, as Yu IlHan believed that he would not get involved with them anyway, he ignored that.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He answered like that, but as Yu IlHan didn\u2019t roll around on the ground nor did he have a mud shower whilst saving them, he didn\u2019t plan on contacting them just for the rewards. Maybe this man knew that?</p><br/><p>He might have just wanted to appeal that he wasn\u2019t a ruthless person, who runs away after being helped. He just looked funny since Yu IlHan could see what he was thinking, prideful and wanting to stand out in front of a woman. He even looked a little cute.</p><br/><p>Befitting a loner, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t hide his rude emotions and laughed while receiving the id card. Then, Na YuNa approached him while hopping, again.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had to close his eyes when he saw the enormous pair of mounds which were unhidable even with the priestess outfit. She was stimulating the sexual desire of someone who doesn\u2019t react unless confronting a higher existence. She was really someone who was blessed by the Goddess of Beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cMine too! Call me any time. We\u2019re planning to go back to Korea after we get what we need in this dungeoooon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNa YuNa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyak! There\u2019s no problem saying that though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s id card was the same as Kang HaJin\u2019s. While looking at Na YuNa being dragged by Kang HaJin by the collar, Yu IlHan put the id cards he received into the Cross Bag. Then he muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll meet in this dungeon again, obviously.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Stop predicting the future.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m planning to follow their back in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s even worse!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have no choice if I want to kill scorpions!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ahh, how pathetic.]</p><br/><p>The fact that Erta thought he was slightly cute, at the same time as thinking he was pathetic, was a secret.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t follow them right away. He didn\u2019t know when the concealment would activate again, and above all, now that he is not fighting any monsters right now, he was planning to finish the mana crafting work.</p><br/><p>Only after Na YuNa and Kang HaJin\u2019s shadows disappeared over the horizon did he sit down and prepared to work. Of course, as this was no smithing work, the only things he needed were his body, the materials, and the magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do what?]</p><br/><p>\u201c3rd class magic stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were three things he needed to enhance: his armor, the pile bunker, and the ammo.</p><br/><p>Although he could not acquire any magic stones in the Metal Heart dungeon, with LA\u2019s Overflow last time, and the trolls he killed in this dungeon, the number of 2nd class magic stones were honestly overflowing. He even had no hesitation in enhancing a one-time-use pile bunker ammo.</p><br/><p>The problem was the only 3rd class magic stone he had. With which one should he use so that other people will say he did good? No, well, other people shouldn\u2019t know this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing he grabbed was the armor. As it was already a legend rank, he thought that it should have the most growth if he used the 3rd class magic stone, and there was also the reason that the magic stone was from the shadow leopard, which specialized in concealment.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Erta also say so? That the result would be different according to the characteristics of the magic stone used in the mana crafting process.</p><br/><p>He originally wanted metal spikes to shoot out from everywhere, but as he had to focus his firepower in one shot, he decided to enhance the performance of the armor itself rather than attaching such additional functions.</p><br/><p>The characteristics that the armor already has, and the characteristics that the magic stone of the shadow leopard has, also, the characteristics of Yu IlHan himself were matching. In this trinity-like situation, Erta also looked forward to what kind of product will be born</p><br/><p>Of course, if she said that out loud, Yu IlHan would become dejected, but as mana crafting was even affected by the abilities of the mana crafter, there was no way she could not look forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan closed his eyes. The mana crafting, which grew to almost level 30 due to Heaven\u2019s Quest, activated and made the armor and the magic stone emit light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everything else is okay. More secretively, more fatally. A power that befits of the path I\u2019m treading\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s steel-like will aligned with the power of the magic stone to lead it. The perfect affinity between the magic stone and the armor, on top of Yu IlHan\u2019s own affinity, made a shiver-inducing energy, as Yu IlHan had the same affinity.</p><br/><p>A dark black light absorbed all light from the surroundings to increase its own size, before disappearing as if nothing was there in the first place.</p><br/><p>[Shiveringly Hard Shadow Leopard\u2019s Black Fullplate Armor was completed.]</p><br/><p>[Shiveringly Hard Shadow Leopard\u2019s Black Fullplate Armor]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 5,300]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Defense increaes by 40%</p><br/><p>2. 50% increase in attack in a surprise attack]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 2,700/2,700]</p><br/><p>[An ambusher\u2019s armor made for the one who walks in shadows. The firm and secretive body movements are like those of a leopard hunting in the darkness.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan exclaimed in delight the moment he checked the options of the finished artifact. Seeing something he exactly wanted, he felt full despite not eating anything.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s because you already ate.]</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I enhance the pile bunker then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He ignored Erta\u2019s tackle. Erta was also wondering how he would enhance the pile bunker, so she didn\u2019t complain being ingored. It was as planned.</p><br/><p>[Mana Crafting really did bring out results better than you expected, but even so, wouldn\u2019t it be insufficient to kill a 3rd class monster in a single strike? As you\u2019ve confroned the shadow leopard already, you should know of their strength. Are you calculating properly, Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, didn\u2019t I say that I always calculate everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t joke around and tell me properly.]</p><br/><p>Erta said while getting slightly angry. As he knew that she was looking forward to his work, Yu IlHan asked her back while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, do you know when the moment is, that a human becomes the strongest?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know. Maybe when one\u2019s protecting something important?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out the pile bunker, a few strands of Giant\u2019s Rubber Band, and 3 2nd class magic stones while declaring.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just before death. A human becomes the strongest just before death.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Yu IlHan thought that it was the same with an object.</p><br/><p>That was because he had never seen a decisive weapon that wasn\u2019t a one time use.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a light novel called Kaze no Stigma. The main character uses a wind spirit, but he didn\u2019t awaken when his lover died, but awakened when he was about to die. Toika was someone who thought a lot about that during his middle school days. It\u2019s such a pity that the author died early.</p><br/><p>The man and woman duo became mob aggro(before they knew it) for MC\u2019s hunt.</p><br/><p>The answer was mana crafting! One hit for me, one hit for you with a pile bunker!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Enjoy~! I can\u2019t remember Kaze no Stigma anymore\u2026 it was ages ago when I watched the anime\u2026</p><br/><p>EER will be on Kobatochandaisuki now.</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

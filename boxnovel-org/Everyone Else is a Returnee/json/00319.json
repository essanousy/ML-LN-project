No matter how good he was at predicting foreshadows, wasn\u2019t this a little too much?! Was this a type of foreknowledge too? \u2013 just as he was thinking about such childish things to escape reality, Uriel spoke to him.</p><br/><p>[You have nothing to fear. Gabriel has already predicted that you shall be safe until the very end. Of course, the foreknowledge isn\u2019t always correct\u2026\u2026 but we shall help you so that it will become as such.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could have done that until now\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[We did, we did a lot. However, Yu IlHan, you do not think that the worlds you have been to are all the worlds, do you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, it feels bad since I sound like I\u2019m making excuses but\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no way the things I have seen are everything. I\u2019m not God so I can\u2019t see everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Thank you for\u2026\u2026 being understanding.]</p><br/><p>Right now, she was saying this \u2013 while Yu IlHan was cleaning up the mess that the Heaven\u2019s Army had made, Gabriel, Uriel and some other angels were concentrating their efforts into places unknown to him. Annoyingly, he couldn\u2019t really deny that.</p><br/><p>However, Uriel\u2019s words hadn\u2019t ended yet.</p><br/><p>[However, you are right. The blame is ours. I am not going to deny that. I will receive the price for all of it. If my puny life can set everything straight, I would have done so already, but precisely because that wasn\u2019t the case is why I lived on and struggled. And right now, I could finally meet you in this place.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while listening, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t stop grumbling. Yu IlHan\u2019s greatest objective in life was to churn the guts of all beings that he has grudges with.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sooo thankful. Countless beings were fighting for my sake? That sounds harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey, didn\u2019t I say that foreknowledge isn\u2019t omnipotent? Uriel has really suffered.]</p><br/><p>[Gabriel\u2026\u2026 I haven\u2019t suffered at all. The one to suffer was you.]</p><br/><p>Very slightly, Uriel blushed at Yu YongHan\u2019s, no, Gabriel\u2019s words. Yu IlHan, who saw that only Uriel out of the Four Great Archangels was indifferent to him and thought that she was quite special among the four, realized that it wasn\u2019t entirely like that, and continuing\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheating? While your son is in a world of trouble you leave mom and go out with a pretty woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I do not know anything like cheating, son. I don\u2019t.]</p><br/><p>He felt like there was an emphasis on \u201cI\u201d, implying \u2018don\u2019t you know already?\u2019 and made him annoyed.</p><br/><p>However, just as he was going to say he didn\u2019t know about anything like that either, several faces of women popped up in his mind so he could only stay quiet. Gabriel spoke as if his son was adorable.</p><br/><p>[Give it up and accept all of them. This dad does think that love which extends between each other is very beautiful, but I also think loves takes many different forms apart from that, especially with someone as bright and brilliant like you. The new child with the blessing of the god of love should also know that and will understand it.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m going to destroy everything you know from your memory. If you say later that you saw my first night with Liera, then I\u2019ll overturn everything even if it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Unfortunately, I can\u2019t see such detailed things.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan put 5 hostility points onto his father. Seeing the father and son having an embarrassing conversation, Uriel interfered between the two with bright red cheeks.</p><br/><p>[Well! It is not long until the final showdown. If you have cleared up your talks, then it\u2019s time to act!]</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you stay 100 meters away from dad. I\u2019ll extract one drop of blood from you everytime you smile at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuu.]</p><br/><p>Even while being on guard against Uriel, he took the Trap of Restoration from his father and passed it to Mystic. Mystic didn\u2019t receive it willingly and narrowed her eyes instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you high and mighty from birth, master, eh? Never did I imagine that you were the young master of one of the Four Great Archangels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut unlike a certain someone who was born a higher existence, I was born as a level 1 human who couldn\u2019t even use mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth spoon should shut up and activate the Trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the hell\u2019s an Earth spoon! You dragon spoon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Earth spoon. Since it\u2019s come to this, let\u2019s do one more thing too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Earth spoon! Damn you!\u201d</p><br/><p>(T/N: The \u2018spoon\u2019 is reference to the proverb \u201cBorn with a silver spoon in the mouth\u201d)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately activated his creation ability to add something new to the Trap of Restoration. Receiving that, Mystic immediately realized the change and widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally really.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll nag you to death if there\u2019s any unnecessary casualties, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust do it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic threw the Trap of Restoration and activated it. At that moment, a strange wave was released from the Trap of Restoration and engulfed all the Traps of Destruction in this world.</p><br/><p>Then, it released all the monsters inside.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what is this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Son!?]</p><br/><p>Not to mention Uriel and Orochi, even Gabriel hadn\u2019t seen this with his foreknowledge and called out to him in shock. However, Yu IlHan just snorted at them and stepped forward before activating Manifestation and Declaration simultaneously. Of course, he had already dispelled his concealment.</p><br/><p>[Look at me.]</p><br/><p>With the support of Manifestation, the range of Declaration expanded to all of Heishia. His voice resounded across the entire world, and the monsters that were released from the dungeons, the humans that were shocked at the sight, as well as the ones that were just living their own lives in secluded places all \u2018discovered\u2019 Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[Those with malice against humanity. Those with hostility against the continuation of mankind. Those who wish to grow as you lust for the flesh of those I desire to protect.]</p><br/><p>His Declaration continued. The huge mana he possessed instantly neared depletion, but drinking Breath made of Echjar\u2019s blood, he finished his words.</p><br/><p>[You shall all die.]</p><br/><p>That was enough. The living monsters in the mountains, hills, skies, seas, volcanoes, caves, everywhere \u2013 had all collapsed and\u2026\u2026 died on the spot.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Manifestation, has become level 32.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Declaration, has become level 57.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone watching lost their words. However, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t care about them at all. With the annihilation of all the monsters, mana instantly filled the world, and the Traps of Restoration absorbed all that mana and spread it to the other Traps of Destruction in an increasingly shorter intervals.</p><br/><p>All the Traps of Destruction changed into Traps of Restoration in an instant. In the future, neither Dungeon Breaks nor Overflows would happen in this world.</p><br/><p>No, not only that.</p><br/><p>[I am the God you have been waiting for.]</p><br/><p>Shamelessly shouted Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[So obey me.]</p><br/><p>His mana was already nearing its limits, but the endlessly filling mana supplemented the mana consumed in the Declaration skill. In other people\u2019s view, he looked like he had an endless supply of mana.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was in fact nervously checking the time that he could maintain the two skills simultaneously. In the first place, it was a miracle that he could stay standing in a lower world that wasn\u2019t even in his own domain. It was more so considering that it hadn\u2019t been long since he had ascended into his place as a leader of a faction.</p><br/><p>[Son, you really are\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so surprised? You can do it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gabriel was the leader of the Garden of Sunset at the same time being one of the Four Great Archangels. Yu IlHan estimated that his father\u2019s concealment had deceived everything and pioneered a unique realm for him to become a higher existence, and it was in fact true. It was just that he was mistaken about one thing \u2013 the limits of Gabriel\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not sure about a world under the Garden of Sunset\u2019s rule, but in another lower world, I can\u2019t really do that. Moreover, it also takes quite a lot of time to change from the Gabriel form to the Garden of Sunset leader\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it like you\u2019re some transforming robot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Interrupting his narration of his back story, Yu IlHan firmly received all the gazes of all the people that looked up at him. The people all seemed to be confused, but the ones that experienced the miracles eventually reacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe? He has really come for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn place of the angels that abandoned us! He has come!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the one looking down at us from up there, is God! He has come to take us all in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there were many that felt hostile as well. However, the vast majority had shining eyes while they looked at Yu IlHan. Even the ones that held some hostility could not deny that the monsters were annihilated thanks to him.</p><br/><p>Like that, Yu IlHan showed them overwhelming power and amplified their minute hope with the following words.</p><br/><p>[I shall lead you to a place with a new hope.]</p><br/><p>Civilization would probably collapse. Every one of them will be put in the middle of battle. They will meet a big threat to their lives.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they may meet an even more frightful and cold environment than this place. Perhaps they may regret their choices and may wish to return. However, Yu IlHan forced them to choose nonetheless. Although he couldn\u2019t stay here and protect them, he could take them in and head to Dareu.</p><br/><p>[Will you follow me? I shall take you all in when all of your wills turn into one.]</p><br/><p>He uttered some cool words, probably taken from a book somewhere. Mystic thought that he was like a drug dealer, while Orochi thought that true scammers were really different.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Uriel was still slightly out of it thanks to the grandeur that Yu IlHan showed with his Declaration skill, while Gabriel was slightly depressed because his son had surpassed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone spoke. He was one of the generals that fought against monsters in the front lines with the surviving humanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone else spoke. He was a lonely man who stood at the peak of what little humanity left here, and could no longer be called emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease lead us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone else spoke. She was an old woman who lived as a mercenary all her life fighting monsters before dropping out after she had lost a leg and the people important to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate those that try to step above us\u2026\u2026 dammit, I guess I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>And someone despaired. He was the knight captain of a ruined country that felt disgust for being swayed around by higher existences at whim, but could only grab the thread of hope that was given to him.</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded his head with a smile. His figure filled the eyes of all of mankind in this world.</p><br/><p>[I shall lead you all to my world.]</p><br/><p>[You have received the obedience of all surviving mankind from the lower world Heishia. The world of Heishia enters your domain.]</p><br/><p>[The world, Heishia, fuses with Dareu.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s return to Dareu first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked back at the others while the entire world of Heishia was being twisted and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, you prepare an excuse for mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ugh\u2026\u2026 was it really a good choice that I ended up making her give birth to IlHan? I knew I should have had a daughter instead of a son!]</p><br/><p>[Gabriel, fight on.]</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s shy cheers did not help Gabriel at all. While Gabriel heaved sighs after sighs, the fusion of dimensions finally happened.</p><br/><p>This was also the moment the \u2018first stage\u2019 Yu IlHan had aimed for in the scattering Traps of Restoration, at the same time being the moment that solved one of his doubts completely, it was also an unprecedented time where a combined front of higher existence factions had formed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

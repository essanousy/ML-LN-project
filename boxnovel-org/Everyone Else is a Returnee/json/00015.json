Erta seemed to be pricked by something as she didn\u2019t receive Yu IlHan\u2019s gaze straight on, and retorted in a small gaze whilst turning her head away.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because it was the solution that uses the least amount of energy\u2026\u2026Probably\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cEnergy?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Connecting to other words was something that had already been done before, and it\u2019s not hard to revive the severed connection. What\u2019s left is touching up on the small details and setting for the quest-and-reward system. Now, if the Earthlings receive quests that are suitable for themselves and pile up their experience and records, then they\u2019ll be able to grow their anti-monster capabilities faster.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s the most reasonable method?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s so.]</p><br/><p>Erta, who had regained a bit of confidence after seeing Yu IlHan\u2019s positive attitude, retorted as such while looking at him.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan waited for this opportunity before asking with the saddest expression that he could muster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Erta was at a lost for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIF everyone else is going to and fro from those other worlds, then me? What about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You were a loner anyways, so there probably won\u2019t be a lot that changes though?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so! You know? Even so!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had never felt such a violent rage in all of his thousand years.</p><br/><p>He was angry at the overall situation, but most of all, he was angry at Erta\u2019s words, that couldn\u2019t be said to be that wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I answer when my mom asks me why I didn\u2019t go to another world!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Answer that you have nothing to learn about anything that can help with your life in such a place!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I some middle schooler who doesn\u2019t want to go to school!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although I think it\u2019s very pitiful, it\u2019s useless to talk to me about it as this wasn\u2019t my decision.]</p><br/><p>Erta, who had reached her limit, eventually had to present a suitable argument like a coward as she pretended not to know anything.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who had lost the energy to retort, was mindless for a moment. With a sigh, he sat up on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, well, I can\u2019t do anything even if I complain to you. So in the end, I can\u2019t go to another world.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you become a higher existence, then who knows.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how many years would that take?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It should be less than the time that you\u2019ve lived up until now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s so comforting, hey!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he woke up and went to the kitchen, his mother and father were conversing with each other with serious faces-. On the lit TV, people were talking about the notice that had been sent to all of humanity, but it was accompanied by another shocking story as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cA state of emergency?\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was shocked and mumbling at the news that he was seeing for the first time, his mother noticed him and spoke.</p><br/><p>(T/N: his parents may refer to themselves as \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also know about it, don\u2019t you son? Right now, the outside is dangerous. Whether it\u2019s school or work, everything has stopped. Meanwhile, the military is conducting a large scale monster extermination. I heard they won\u2019t allow the monsters to appear on the roads where people live, at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that the government had also realized that they couldn\u2019t have people go through their daily lives anymore. Perhaps, the other world quest notice might have sped up their decisions.</p><br/><p>In truth, this was something that had occured in every other country that possessed a proper government.</p><br/><p>Everybody had realized that they needed to maintain the survival of the people first before being able to strive for a normal everyday life in the changed world, and so, under the majority of the countries\u2019 decisions, it had been decided that they would stop the flow of history for a bit.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in that time, people would receive strength from other worlds. Not a power that would disappear like bubbles, like it had four days ago, but a power that would remain with them even in the future.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yu IlHan felt hope. Those upper echelons were only putting up temporary measures, like paying a card debt back with another card, but the humans on Earth were seriously considering the change they had to meet while they were moving.</p><br/><p>Humanity will be able to adapt to the levelled-up Earth. As they always did. Excluding me. As they always did. \u2013 He thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, dad. Have a safe trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this father hasn\u2019t even gotten a 2nd class in all the 10 years that I was over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because the military is clearing up the monsters doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t appear on the streets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the other world isn\u2019t safe anymore as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>While time was stopped on Earth, there wasn\u2019t a case where a human would die or get injured while in another world. However, from now on, it would be different. As the price for being able to acquire a strength that wouldn\u2019t disappear, humanity now had to accept the danger that came with it. Even so.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, it should be less dangerous than staying here on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, do everything you can do to not feel regret afterwards. You shouldn\u2019t but your life on the line, but on this changed Earth, you can only live by accepting danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doing everything that was possible, doing everything that was impossible until it was possible \u2013 this was one of the beliefs that supported Yu IlHan\u2019s foundation.</p><br/><p>Perhaps his words, which contained his honest intentions, had moved his mother and father as they smiled bitterly while standing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then I\u2019ll go. You too, son. Don\u2019t give up just because you can\u2019t use mana and put your efforts into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, his father was the one to disappear first. He had gone to another world in an instant.</p><br/><p>However, his mother didn\u2019t do the same. Instead, she looked at Yu IlHan with a worried face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, mother\u2019s thinking is a bit different to your father\u2019s. Although effort is important, you can\u2019t overexert yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat overexertion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it you who\u2019s going around and hunting monsters with a mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was found out!? At this unexpected situation, Yu IlHan froze just like that. He was aware that his figure, which had been fighting against monsters, would be broadcasted publically, and he had also meticulously prepared for that, but even then\u2026\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you perhaps think that mother wouldn\u2019t even recognize my own son? Even if you wear a mask and different clothes, I can notice you instantly. How could I not know my son?\u201d</p><br/><p>The power of blood was truly amazing \u2013 Yu IlHan muttered in his heart when he heard his mother\u2019s words, which caused him to raise both of his hands and feet in defeat.</p><br/><p>To think that the concealment which could fool the world, and even God, was unable to completely fool his mother\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMother doesn\u2019t know how you became so strong. I\u2019m proud, but also worried. But son, you know how scary those monsters are, right? Nobody knows what may happen in what place. So always keep your guard up and move with room to spare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother\u2019s nitpicking only sounded affectionate when he heard it after such a long time. His mother finally seemed relieved after Yu IlHan nodded repeatedly. Then, she added on after putting a serious face back on again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the ones you have to be the most careful about are humans. From now on, there will be a lot of people who will be stronger and more evil than the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you know, then it\u2019s okay. My proud son. Mother will go to Ya-umin again, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t do anything dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to the conversation with his mother, Yu IlHan, who had calmed down quite a bit slapped his cheeks and muttered to himself as if he was making a resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should do my own work.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll be going back to heaven for a bit. I should bring back the reward for the Executor quest as well.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy me an ice cream on the way back.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he had been too immersed in the excitement that had come from the profit that the Direwolf and the Brown Bear had given him, he had forgotten about the existence of the quest. Well, they said that they would give him something, so he had no reason to refuse. He happily sent Erta off without forgetting to tell her to buy ice cream, which he had a sudden craving for.</p><br/><p>After he did that, he was really alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomehow, I\u2019m reminded of my dropout days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he complained in a small voice, he left his home. His destination was the nearby storage facility that he had bought with his money at a speed that was like grilling beans with lightning.</p><br/><p>How foolish was it to acquire a storage building at night to use the next day!? However, he didn\u2019t need anything. With cash, everything was solved. The Republic of Korea was a good place to live for those who had a lot of money. Although, he didn\u2019t know that until now, since he hadn\u2019t had any money before!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan arrived at the storage, which would be his workshop from now on. He had only prepared the basic equipment like a fireplace and an anvil due to the urgency. There were many lacking aspects, but as he didn\u2019t even need to do any proper work in the foreseeable future, it was alright.</p><br/><p>Well, that was because the only materials he currently had were bones and leather. In other words, things that he didn\u2019t need to temper. He was itching to hammer some metal, but the situation didn\u2019t allow him to.</p><br/><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that he couldn\u2019t do anything at all. Raw leather would rot if left like that, and it was the same for the bones that was dotted with impurities and full of oil! The reason he came to the workshop was to process them before it became too late.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan fully mobilized all the knowledge that he had piled up over a thousand years, and began to process the leather and bones in the best way that he knew. After the things that could pollute the precious materials, such as blood and flesh, were removed perfectly, the leather would go through an additional tanning process. He had already sold all the materials aside from the ones that he needed, so he could avoid working all day.</p><br/><p>Even while processing all that leather, Yu IlHan didn\u2019t sweat a single drop. It was only possible because, in the first place, he had a different base strength when compared to others, and it had further increased when he had levelled up to 24.</p><br/><p>All the work was finished. He would be able to create something with the bones right now, but the leather was the problem. Just the tanning process itself would take several more days, and when he thought about the hardening process, which would come after, he might have to forget about wearing an armor that could cover his entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, when the armor is finished, wouldn\u2019t it have no meaning, since my level would be too high at that point?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was like that, he would kill stronger monsters to earn its leather, and when he created an armor with that, then his level would\u2026\u2026 there was nothing more of a wast of time than this.</p><br/><p>[You can process them with magic.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re back? Even if you say that, I can\u2019t use mag\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s words trailed off midway after he confirmed Erta\u2019s appearance. It wasn\u2019t because she hadn\u2019t bought him ice cream.</p><br/><p>It was because the Erta before him had a similar stature to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>He first doubted whether or not it was really Erta, but after he had confirmed that it was really her, who, he didn\u2019t want to admit, had a truly beautiful face, he fell into thought, realizing the cause soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiantification magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Instead, my previous appearance was caused by shrinking magic. Just what did you think I was?]</p><br/><p>Erta sighed as she held out her hand.</p><br/><p>[Hold this hand. I\u2019ll transfer the rewards to you now.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was slightly overwhelmed due to the holiness that he somehow felt coming from her, which wasn\u2019t present while she was palm-sized, obediently held out his hand and grabbed hers.</p><br/><p>The moment after, he felt an extremely cold, but a bit soft, and horrifyingly delicate, touch as a few strings of words popped up in his view.</p><br/><p>[Heavenly Quest 001. Executor mission completed!]</p><br/><p>[All stats have increased by 1.]</p><br/><p>[You are the one who has most successfully completed the quest amongst quest applicants. A special reward has been added.]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired Eternal Flame.]</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal Flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>While he urgently let go of her hand, thinking that he would start to feel strange if he continued to hold it, Yu IlHan looked towards Erta\u2019s face with an expression that seemed to say, \u2018I don\u2019t remember receiving something like that though?\u2019 Then, Erta gave a small smile as she raised her other hand.</p><br/><p>[Look.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the fireplace that he had prepared, a bright red flame was burning despite the fact that he hadn\u2019t put down any fuel.</p><br/><p>[An inextinguishable and living flame that can continuously grow. It\u2019s a precious flame from heaven. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that you\u2019re in the initial stages of the Great Cataclysm, it would be absolutely impossible to receive this reward with a quest of that level, so please realize the value of this flame.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just with Erta\u2019s explanation, he had more than realized the flame\u2019s value. The Eternal Flame burning inside the fireplace was acting cute while it changed its appearance, as if it knew who its master was. The word \u2018living\u2019 wasn\u2019t at all exaggerated when used to describe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a truly fitting reward for me\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew you would say that. Rita insisted strongly.]</p><br/><p>\u201cRita did\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was no longer listening to Erta\u2019s words. To think that it was an inextinguishable and living flame. Various thoughts came to mind. This would help a lot when he had to process large amounts of metal in the future!</p><br/><p>[And\u2026\u2026Rejoice. For you, who can\u2019t go to another world, heaven has prepared a second quest.]</p><br/><p>And so, he had to take a lot of time to listen to and understand Erta\u2019s following words.</p><br/><p>[From now, you have to install dungeons on Earth.]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Mom: Why are you so stubborn about not going to another world! Even next door Johnny is going obediently!</p><br/><p>The quest rewards won\u2019t be experience, but status, item, skills, and such.</p><br/><p>If you are curious about MC\u2019s feelings, then click this. (T/N: subtitle says \u201cI\u2019ve never felt such a violent rage until now!\u201d)</p><br/><p>Answer, there was a special quest for the MC!</p><br/><p>Just because he\u2019s creating dungeons, the novel won\u2019t turn into a dungeon-management novel, so don\u2019t worry\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I keep thinking that the mother is no one ordinary. She can see through his ability, and even see through his concealment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

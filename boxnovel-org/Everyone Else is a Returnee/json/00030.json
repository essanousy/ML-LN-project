To think that such a small lump of metal twisted such a large amount of space, separated it and maintained it!</p><br/><p>Although he had seen the scene where the Trap of Destruction was being activated, it was a different feeling to see and feel the scenery inside after coming in the dungeon himself. Moreover, even the feeling of the air was different to the outside!</p><br/><p>The unknown that he loved the most, the unknown which burned his passion for adventure! He fell into a deeply moved state and looked around him.</p><br/><p>While looking around, he found a huge grey colored lump of metal rolling around the corridor. For some reason, the excitement which boiled until now, cooled down instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, novel MCs will shout \u2018This is the metal I was looking for!\u2019 like a fool and run to it then get messed up, but I already know the fact that it\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You sound quite disappointed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I feel like when I was spoiled by mom on The Sixth Sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>His unknown emptiness couldn\u2019t be described by anything. He didn\u2019t know whether to be angry or be sad!</p><br/><p>While grumbling, Yu IlHan took out a weapon from the cross bag. There was a more suitable weapon to confront hard lumps of metal, rather than a spear which used slashing and thrusting as its main attack.</p><br/><p>That was a weapon which had a huge axe blade on the head, and a heavy hammer on the other end. An ivory colored weapon made entirely out of the Shadow Leopard\u2019s bones, starting from the handle to the axe blade!</p><br/><p>[Heavy Battle Crusher]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Rare]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013</p><br/><p>Hammer : 1,250</p><br/><p>Axe : 1,270]</p><br/><p>[Option \u2013 weight increases by 50% upon hitting]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,350/1,350]</p><br/><p>It was a masterpiece which had an alpha option even without going through mana crafting. The options attahed was a weight increase option which maximized effects in an environment where hammers or axes would be used!</p><br/><p>Althoug the rank was rare, in fact, it was rare to go above rare in this world. Yu IlHan\u2019s ability, pulling out one rare or above after another was the abnormal one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I will be able to make better metallic weapons when I clear this dungeon and come out so I will have to throw this away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Moreover, Yu IlHan had no ability to become friendly with others, so he couldn\u2019t \u2018pass them on\u2019 to lower levelled people like in other RPG games. Such a good weapon will be thrown away!</p><br/><p>When one felt empty, everything else felt empty. With an empty feeling, Yu IlHan dashed with the axe held high, and shouted while striking down his axe on the lump of metal, feeling empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo croak!\u201d (T/N: This will become a thing from now.)</p><br/><p>[What do you mean, \u2018feel empty\u2019? It\u2019s your full strength!]</p><br/><p>The axe with an enormous amount of strength concentrated on it dug into the lump of metal with strong strength with another level stronger due to the 10% increase due to concealment. It recognized Yu IlHan the moment it was attacked, but since it was in the middle of being beaten up, it couldn\u2019t resist properly.</p><br/><p>And just like that, it split into halves.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 137,928 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 51 Metal Heart.]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit has become Lv 4.]</p><br/><p>[You have awakened Blunt Weapon mastery Lv Max. You can evolve this skill if you have the skill evolution materials.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stopped for a moment. He had never thought that it would end in one hit. Since it ended so easily, he thought that it may be an enemy which revived until it became powder, but it wasn\u2019t that. That was just the end.</p><br/><p>However, the next moment, he pretend that he was expecting it to end with a single strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe title is really \u2018One hit for you, one hit for me\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think it would be an instakill even without a critical but, yes, you did well.]</p><br/><p>After checking that there were no enemies around, Yu Ilhan lightly recovered the axe and looked at its body. At first, he thought that a huge pumpkin was rolling around, but it was made from countless lumps of metal gathered together.</p><br/><p>Amongst those countless metallic lumps, there was a lump which emitted a blackish light so that made him assume that it was the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did say to pull out he heart\u2026\u2026 But its body also seems to be quite hard, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The body is just a bit stronger than steel, but the Metal Heart\u2019s heart is a metal that\u2019s in a different dimension. Not only it is the hardest part, it is also the nucleus which contains all its mana. Although, that is also the reason why Metal Hearts don\u2019t have any magic stones.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan struck its body again and made the heart appear. Surely, that thing emitting a wondrous black light looked like it was something good.</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan, who looked at it after pulling it out, Erta explained.</p><br/><p>[Metal Hearts, when they notice the enemies, they send their unique mana from their metallic hearts into the part they want tostrengthen. Originally, it\u2019s a monster even people with 2nd jobs have a hard time to hunt. Normally, one would distract its attention from the front, and another one would ambush it from behind.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Ertawagon.\u201d(E/N: ertawagon?)</p><br/><p>He did think that he had hunted a 2nd class monster, which was above lv 50, too easily, but there was a reason. Metal Hearts were weak to ambush.</p><br/><p>Well, although everything was weak to ambushes, Metal Hearts were especially so. They can only use their strength after noticing their enemies \u2013 how weak was that!?</p><br/><p>However, life was something where you could be backstabbed at all times. Being arrogant after killing just one just might send him to hell. Even in novels, side characters were cleared up like that.</p><br/><p>He had to run away without hesitation if about ten appeared at once, so he proceeded inside the dungeon while not loosening his tension.</p><br/><p>And one day passed.</p><br/><p>[You have become level 38. 2 Strength, 1 Agillity, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>There was no twist nor counterattack. Metal Hearts were beings which had less population in the first place. He was so bored in adventuring the dungeon, to the extent that he would call out \u2018jackpot\u2019 when he found a Metal Heart after walking for 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>As soon as he found them, Yu IlHan struck them down with his axe, and the Metal Heart which could not notice Yu IlHan in his concealment, always allowed him to succeed in his ambush and they got split into halves.</p><br/><p>As Erta said, the Metal Hearts were disposed of in not two hits, nor three hits, but in one hit. When the fight ended like that, he would just senselessly break its body, take its heart out and put it inside his cross bag. And it was an infinite cycle of that.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan muttered in a tired voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere dungeons such an unemotional place?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re just abnormal. Just how did you master blunt weapon mastery to the max as well?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that ten thousand different weapons all end up to be the same, once they\u2019re trained to the extreme, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, how about I hit you about ten thousand times?]</p><br/><p>No matter how he thought about it, there was quite a distant to the dungeon adventuring that Yu IlHan had dreamd about. This was just labor.</p><br/><p>Moreover, as the period he stayed in the dungeon got longer than he thought, he now had to take care of his meals with the jerkies he had brought.</p><br/><p>So, the menu for his meal had turned into a choice between cheese jerky or beef-rip flavored jerky.</p><br/><p>If he knew such things would happen, he would have brought BBQ flavered ones too!</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see Rita.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why so sudden\u2026.. If you really want to meet Rita that badly, then don\u2019t you just have to become a higher existence quickly? Nobody interferes love between higher existences.]</p><br/><p>Erta threw a slightly suspicious line, but the hungry Yu IlHan didn\u2019t look into it.(E/N: IlHan is frustrated \ud83d\ude09 )</p><br/><p>\u201cRita always cooked me rice.\u201d (Author\u2019s note #4)</p><br/><p>[You want to see her with a reason like that!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the jerky is delicous.\u201d</p><br/><p>[In the end, aren\u2019t you eating the jerky deliciously!?]</p><br/><p>The time Yu IlHan sensed the change while exploring the dungeon with the nitpicky Erta, was two days after that. It was a change incomparable to the mana crafting process with the angels who came to find him mid way.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, isn\u2019t that guy a bit bigger?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It is. Monsters also have their individuality like humans so it is obvious that they look different.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even so, isn\u2019t it a little too bit for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the conversation they had after encoutering an enormous cave in the dungeon.</p><br/><p>Until now, Metal Hearts were exercise ball-sized, had become massive beanbag-sized!</p><br/><p>[Even so, it\u2019s the same Metal Hea\u2026\u2026No.]</p><br/><p>Erta, who was nonchalantly replying, momentarily closed her lips and looked at the large sized Metal Heart in the middle of the cave. Yu IlHan waited for awhile before she flabbergastedly shouted.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a Big Metal Heart!]</p><br/><p>\u201cDrag that bastard who named them with such little enthusiasm in front of me, right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not the time to joke around. Although it\u2019s only a word difference, Big Metal Hearts are 20 levels above Metal Hearts. Just how did something so strong appear already?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat just makes it 71 though?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s level judgement senses had been paralyzed after he defeated the Giant Leopard and the Shadow Leopard. Although, with his ability, it was very reasonable that he was numbed.</p><br/><p>Erta also nodded his head with a \u2018huh?\u2019 after thinking for a while.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true. isn\u2019t it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fine if I just run if I think I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he spoke like that, Yu IlHan had no thoughts in running away. Although it was with help, he had finished off the Giant Leopard when he was level 24. His current level was 38, so just from his pure level of ability, it didn\u2019t lose out to the time he was buffed by the Empress.</p><br/><p>Moreover, at that time, he had just one steel spear, but currently, he had an amazingly strong weapon!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith a single strike from this, that will also just!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing he took out from the cross bag was the pile bunker which had an imposing manner. The idiotic-level-sized weapon boasted of an imposing manner that no one else on Earth other than Yu IlHan would be able to use it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was already loaded to the 3rd level. When Yu IlHan placed it on his shoulders, Erta sighed as though she gave up.</p><br/><p>[How is it that the time that the things this human makes become useful always arrives at some point? So frustrating.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pile bunker was a weapon which only focused on attack power and threw away all the other necessary requirements for a weapon. Portability, secretiveness, agility, anyway, the user of the weapon had to make up for the rest.</p><br/><p>And so, this was the most suitable weapon for Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kicked off. The Big Metal Heart was enjoying its freedom whether Yu IlHan was jumping or dancing, rolling around within the cave.</p><br/><p>While looking at it, he took 3 big steps and jumped into the air on his 4th step. The figure of him proceeding forward in the air while moving his feet looked like Michael Jordan\u2019s airwalk.</p><br/><p>[You need to prepare in case it doesn\u2019t die in a single strike!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>After retorting roughly to the point that it made her wonder if he really knew it or not, Yu IlHan picked up the pile bunker. He jumped so high that its enormous body was under his feet!</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after Yu IlHan whispered, the pile bunker\u2019s bone ammo cameint ocontact with its body.</p><br/><p>The moment the sharpened bone dug through its metallic body and got buried inside it, the pile bunker, which was provoked, released the 3rd stage, 2nd stage, and the 1st stage lock at once and transferred the enormous strength that the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band had on to the bullet. As a result, with a sound like an exploding grenade, the pile bunker spat out the bullet.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, a bone bullet which was longer than 2m pierced through from its head to its roots!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The main character of The Sixth Sense, Bruce Willis, was in fact \u2026\u2026[email\u00a0protected]##@$&amp;*(!</p><br/><p>Ertawagon : A parody of Speedwagon, which appears in Jojo\u2019s bizzare adventues, and likes to give out explanations.(E/N:jojojojojojojojo)</p><br/><p>ten thousand different weapons all end up to be the same, once they\u2019re trained to the extreme(): It appears a lot in Wuxias. Everything is the same when approaching the limit, so if one becomes proficient in one weapon, he can use other weapons proficiently as well. Of course, Yu IlHan isn\u2019t like that, but he just got proficient in everything!</p><br/><p>Always cooked me rice : A famous(T/N: Only in Korea) line throughout the pokemon series.

The author\u2019s planned ending is NOT a harem\u2026 Just that I don\u2019t believe it since his previous two was both harem (One with 7 girls and one with 2)</p><br/><p>When I said that he retracts those lines, I mean that he just says that he won\u2019t say anything about this being harem or not. NOT that it IS a harem.</p><br/><p>Btw, his previous two works are called [Infinite Competitive Dungeon Society] and [Devil King], both of which aren\u2019t being translated yet.</p><br/><p>THERE WILL BE SLIGHT SPOILERS IN THE NEXT LINES SO YOU\u2019RE READING AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, now that Rita appeared again, I remember. Rita is actually suppose to be Lita.</p><br/><p>To spoil a bit, see that all the angels end with a \u2018ta\u2019? Rita, Erta, Fashta, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s for 5th class angels. When Rita/Lita becomes 6th class, she becomes Liera. 6th class angels end in \u2018era\u2019. The only other 6th class angel appearing in the story so far, was \u2018Spiera\u2019.</p><br/><p>Also, somebody mentioned Nephilim in the comments in the previous chapter\u2026 NO! THERE IS NO CROSSBREED BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANGELS\u2026 well, the angels aren\u2019t actually that different. Rita was once human, as Erta once also was\u2026 becoming \u2018angels\u2019 just means that they had become a higher existence. \u2018angels\u2019 are just a group amongst those higher existecnes, so they aren\u2019t \u2018real\u2019 angels in a sense.</p><br/><p>Editors notes</p><br/><p>so you might get some wacky as names</p><br/><p>poor Ilhan, sorry to ruin your ships guys, unless of course Ilhan becomes an angel too</p><br/>\n</div>"}

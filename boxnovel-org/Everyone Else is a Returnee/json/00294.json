He realized that the seal he had engraved in order to track Yu IlHan had disappeared. Yu IlHan only laughed when he saw that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t possibly think that I didn\u2019t know about it, right? What you guys utilized in the process of making the seal was fire and records. And I\u2019m ahead of you in both of those fields.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What?]</p><br/><p>The one that replied was Raphael. It was a magic that took him a long time to do it in secret, and in actuality, Yu IlHan was revealed in front of everyone like this. But what? He knew from the beginning? Then why was he affected by the magic initially?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked around to everyone with a thick smile on his face. Angels that thought that they had cornered him; Archangel Michael clad in fire; Army of Brilliant Light that acted confused; Destruction-loving perverse beasts of destruction from the Destruction Demon Army; as well as the mysterious perverts, the Garden of Sunset \u2013 he looked towards all of them and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment the figure of Yu IlHan turned into a black fog and melted into thin air.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What?]</p><br/><p>Raphael finally realized that something was strange. The ones that rushed into battlefield were Yu IlHan and Yumir, two of them, but the one revealed by Michael\u2019s magic just now was Yu IlHan alone!</p><br/><p>But then, where was the dragon? No, what was that thing which looked like Yu IlHan that appeared in front of them? Was it really Yu IlHan?</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>Raphael was given the answer the next moment. Just barely after looking at the spear that had impaled his abdomen.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was never there in the first place. He deceived Raphael to and attacked him with his maximum power at the perfect timing.</p><br/><p>Raphael\u2019s shoulder blades shattered, and two pairs of wings were ripped out.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026 deceived me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who, deceived who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Yu IlHan in a cold voice. Raphael became speechless at that. At least, he didn\u2019t have the qualifications to denounce him. He coughed out blood and asked.</p><br/><p>[How did you do it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThough I hate to say it since the feeling is like I\u2019m a villain from a movie if I explain in this situation\u2026\u2026but, it\u2019s an artifact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flamesoul Dragon Body, to be precise, it was the power of the Body of the Human Dragon. He separated a portion of his mana as well as the combined magic from Michael and Raphael to make it look believable, and while that attracted the gaze of all beings here, Yu IlHan had brought out all his powers as a Deathgod to attack Raphael with Yumir. It was a very simple process.</p><br/><p>[Simple? The technique that deceived all 7th class beings including me\u2026\u2026 is simple!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was simple for me. Well, then. How long are you going to act like you were done in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Raphael had an innate recovery power. Of course, Yu IlHan\u2019s attack was strong, but that wouldn\u2019t make him immobile.</p><br/><p>In truth, Raphael clicked his tongue the moment he heard Yu IlHan\u2019s words and disappeared only to reappear in another place. The place beside the strongest man here, Michael.</p><br/><p>[Raphael, your body?]</p><br/><p>[I am fine.]</p><br/><p>Michael also met him with a slightly nervous gaze. He probably felt something after seeing that his proud \u2018flames\u2019 didn\u2019t work against Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[He\u2019s an ominous guy. He just accepted the magic even while knowing about it. It shouldn\u2019t be for a petty reason like \u2018to attack you\u2019\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Kugh\u2026\u2026 Be wary against him, Lord Michael. We do not know what else he may be hiding.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was amazed after seeing Raphael relatively fine even though he looked to be on the verge of death just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>However, that was enough. The guts, bones, flesh, the white blood, as well as the white feathers on his flaming spear allowed him to get whatever records necessary from him.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Michael, don\u2019t tell me the reason you came here was.]</p><br/><p>The 2nd Wing of Brilliant Light, Anafi\u00e8re spoke in a voice of disbelief.</p><br/><p>[To kill Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>[To be exact, it\u2019s to prevent you from protecting Yu IlHan. If you do not stop us, then we are only thankful\u2026\u2026 how is it?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Although we are fed up with Yu IlHan\u2019s actions, he\u2019s nothing compared to your mindset and actions. Did you shake hands with the Destruction Demon Army? Even though you\u2019re the prided \u2018Heaven\u2019s seeds\u2019?]</p><br/><p>Michael shrugged his shoulders and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>[I do not like the idea of borrowing power from those filthy beasts, but I can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s to stop another disturbing element from rising. It was an insulting and demeaning negotiation.]</p><br/><p>[You really are\u2026\u2026 Move out.]</p><br/><p>Anafi\u00e8re relayed an order to the fallen angels even while thinking it was absurd. The next moment, all the fallen angels that filled the battlefield started to show strange movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan tilted his head in confusion while collecting the remnants of Raphael. Although fallen angels being hostile against angels was a usual thing, they were currently moving like they intended to protect Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you up to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though, just until now, he was helping the angels exterminate the traitors, and were killing fallen angels? Just why did they try to protect Yu IlHan now?</p><br/><p>At that moment, something flashed by Yu IlHan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it something like \u2018Only we can touch that guy!\u2019 or stuff like that? It feels disgusting so stop it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt strange since he somehow felt like he was the protagonist of some romance novel now, and shouted out in shock. Of course, Anafi\u00e8re only felt that it was tragic.</p><br/><p>[To think we need to\u2026\u2026 *crunch*, protect him!]</p><br/><p>[Lord Anafi\u00e8re, do we really need to protect that? Wouldn\u2019t Lord Satan\u2019s thoughts have changed by now?]</p><br/><p>[Do not try to question his orders. Until the moment he orders us otherwise, we\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Anafi\u00e8re bit his lips as he turned around as if to protect Yu IlHan. In his hand was a gigantic bloody great sword.</p><br/><p>[Need to protect Yu IlHan. Crissi\u00e8re, Sati\u00e8re, I presume you know what to do?]</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>[Yes!]</p><br/><p>The 3rd and 4th Wing of Brilliant Light stepped against the one from the Destruction Demon Army, Keshein, that appeared through blood. He only laughed.</p><br/><p>[You guys are too weak\u2026\u2026 I only want to hunt that human over there.]</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s see you blab on!]</p><br/><p>They all charged. Flashes of light and blood flew. The 5th class higher existences also acted according to their factions as well. Even though the objective of this war had completely changed, its intensity only rose in scale.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s an interesting scene.]</p><br/><p>The Heaven\u2019s Army that executed its traitors through Yu IlHan\u2019s power was now trying to kill him with the help of Destruction Demon Army, and the Army of Brilliant Light that had received tremendous damage from Yu IlHan now had to protect him just because of orders from Satan, while the most objectively inferior group in this battle, the Garden of Sunset, watched on in curiosity.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t want to agree with them, it was very interesting scene even to Yu IlHan as well. It was very interesting, but.</p><br/><p>[You have mastered the skill, Record.]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the qualifications.]</p><br/><p>[All of your records gather. You are newly recorded in this sole world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan called out the Cradle of Miracles in the air and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when was this your stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan!?]</p><br/><p>Someone, who realized the intentions behind his movements shouted. However, it was too late by then.</p><br/><p>[Dad, I\u2019m ready.]</p><br/><p>Reported Yumir quietly. Yu IlHan replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mir. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m also ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Cradle of Miracles explosively expanded in size and enveloped Yu IlHan and Yumir. They resonated with it while emitting intense amounts of mana, and the Flamesoul Dragon Body followed soon after. The energy of dragons, and the energy of fire that were all under Yu IlHan\u2019s rule amplified within it, compressed after, then repeated the cycle of amplification and compression.</p><br/><p>[All titles disappear with their effects remaining intact. You become a being that cannot be defined by any language.]</p><br/><p>[All the blessings of gods you have received is cancelled. You now have direct dominion over those attributes.]</p><br/><p>[The effects of the title, \u2018Surpasser\u2019, is added to the records. You are no longer bound by anything.]</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame only collected her consciousness with her master in joy, but Echjar still couldn\u2019t believe it even though he was at the center of all this.</p><br/><p>[Th, this human, this mere human! My lord has really\u2026\u2026 really?]</p><br/><p>Red light filled the world. Michael finally felt a sense of crisis for the first time after arriving at this world.</p><br/><p>[W, we need to stop him. It\u2019s happening much faster than we expected!]</p><br/><p>[Stop him. Attack! I said stop him!]</p><br/><p>[Dammit!]</p><br/><p>All angels and Destruction Demon soldiers rushed towards him. The fallen angels desperately attempted to stop them, while the gatekeepers watched on with joy. One of the gatekeepers spoke with a laugh.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s too late. You cannot stop him! It\u2019s the birth of the Fifth! The latest but the brightest of them all! The Fifth!]</p><br/><p>[Of them all\u2026\u2026? You mean to say that he\u2019s bigger and better than your own leader?]</p><br/><p>[The Lord has spoken as such, and we only faithfully believe his words!]</p><br/><p>The prophecy from the ruler of the Garden of Sunset. The same prophecy that was known to everyone through Heli\u00e8na, and the same one that everyone was wary against. Michael shouted while clenching his teeth.</p><br/><p>[Kill him!]</p><br/><p>The flaming spear thrown by Michael was blocked by Anafi\u00e8re. As he was lacking in power to fully defend against Michael, he was pushed back mercilessly while coughing out black blood, but despite that, Anafi\u00e8re stopped Michael with all his power. A similar scene was happening with Crissi\u00e8re, Sati\u00e8re, and Keshein.</p><br/><p>[Ki, Kikik.]</p><br/><p>[Dammit!]</p><br/><p>[Lord Satan, O LORD SATAN!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t care no matter how much of a mess the battlefield came to be. What was important to him right now was only himself.</p><br/><p>Everything that he had memorized and recorded from the moment he was born, the power of higher existences, and the fragment of God that he could finally acquire from Raphael! The records and sources of power that ruled and evolved worlds he had acquired from countless higher worlds!</p><br/><p>A single line of text appeared on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina.</p><br/><p>[You may become the one that encompasses all, but you are still lacking something.]</p><br/><p>[However, you may now acquire a new subclass to replace Angel\u2019s Partner. There is something that you need amidst them. You already know what you require.]</p><br/><p>1. [Woodworker]</p><br/><p>2. [Blacksmith]</p><br/><p>3. [Musician]</p><br/><p>4. [Tamer]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>179. [Leader]</p><br/><p>Leader. A leader was a very common subclass possessed by those with qualities to harmonize other people and lead them. A subclass that gave bonuses when partying, and also one that amplified in effect the more personnel he or she led. The subclass that almost all clan masters possessed.</p><br/><p>And now, that had appeared as a selectable option in the list. There was no reason to speak of. It was because party play didn\u2019t suit a man like Yu IlHan. If he didn\u2019t create a fleet after becoming the Dimensional Traveler, there would never come a day where leader appeared as one of the available subclasses.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite the stubborn guy even in my opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHaaaaaaaaan!]</p><br/><p>The angels that broke through the fallen angels attacked him mercilessly. However, the words from the gatekeepers from the Garden of Sunset were right, and none of their attacks reached Yu IlHan. In fact, the mana they used was swept up in the resonance and only gave Yu IlHan additional power. This applied to any attacks that came his way.</p><br/><p>Michael and the other angels were all acting in vain. If they really wanted to prevent Yu IlHan from becoming a higher existence, they should have run away with all their might. Of course, that would only delay his awakening by a little!</p><br/><p>[Dad is a cool dad. You always were, and you always will be. We all believe in dad.]</p><br/><p>Spoke Yumir. He was really an honest and cute kid. He was only dumbstruck when he was first born, he could say this honestly now \u2013 That he could step forward because he was here; that he could truly become happy as Yumir appeared in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Mir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan patted Yumir\u2019s head. Then, he raised his head, and chose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll become a Leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>[All qualifications have been fulfilled.]</p><br/><p>Reported the Akashic Record. As always, the green text appeared on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina.</p><br/><p>As well as the retinas of all higher existences here.</p><br/><p>[A new higher existence faction \u2018Dragon\u2019s Nest\u2019, is born.]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>You have all waited for a long time. Here it is finally</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>ANNNNNNNNNNND a massive cliffhanger xD</p><br/><p>Okay some people were confused about chapters next week (tomorrow onwards)</p><br/><p>Two chapters will go up tomorrow (two sponsored)</p><br/><p>depending on sponsor status, two more will go up on Tuesday</p><br/><p>After that, there will be a Thursday regular, then Sunday double regular. (Somehow that sounds like Baskin Robbins icecream lol)</p><br/><p>Then we\u2019ll be back to regular schedule for the week after.</p><br/><p>Current sponsor status is still $122 as these two chapters are regular chapters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

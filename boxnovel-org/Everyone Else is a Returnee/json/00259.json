Kim YeSeul\u2019s smile became thicker.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I expect the second grandson soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera tapped her ample breasts as if to say \u2018leave it to me\u2019. Yu IlHan changed topics from this embarrassing chain of events with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo mom, I can ask you what happened to you until now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, my son. Instead\u2026\u2026 talk about yourself to mom, alright? Everything that happened to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, there was no need to hide it anymore. Kim YeSeul looked at her son\u2019s unshaken eyes and let out a small smile before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, then\u2026\u2026 I should talk about how I first came to this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid mom come here when the people of Earth were sent to numerous other worlds in preparation for the Great Cataclysm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Mom calls this place the \u2018Model Garden\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you came here alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul pointed at the objects in her surroundings and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how panicked I was? I couldn\u2019t even see properly, nor did I know where this place was. I couldn\u2019t even tell if I was sitting, standing or lying down. When I was dropped in such a world, there were horrifying monsters, though, they\u2019re not here anymore. They couldn\u2019t hurt your mom at all though.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if the people and the monsters native to that world could not hurt the people of Earth due to the contract with the Heaven\u2019s Army. However, this shouldn\u2019t have been the case here. This world, the \u2018Model Garden\u2019, was devoid of any records of the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>Instead, he could feel the aura of the Garden of Sunset. In other words, the Model Garden was a world under the management of the Garden of Sunset.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll that mom could do was to breathe. It was good that I did not become hungry no matter how much time passed. And when some more time passed\u2026\u2026 Oh, did you meet the spirits of this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. They became mom\u2019s friends. The reason I could feel mana was all thanks to them as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After first feeling mana and becoming able to wield it, Kim YeSeul did not count the flow of time and focused on training in mana. In fact, she couldn\u2019t do anything else but that.</p><br/><p>There were no teachers to teach her magic, so all she could do was to emit mana and roll it around in space, and ironically, that allowed her to learn the magic related to space-time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you found out already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul pointed at the surface of the ware. The water bubbles that she was handling with mana before, the water bubbles that should have fallen to the surface and be merged with the water were maintaining their form as if they were solid, and were rolling on top of the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything in the Model Garden is halted. Whether it\u2019s time, or space. Trying to forcefully move mana inside it allowed me to naturally develop the abilities to manipulate them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be as easy as you say. Your talent must be amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, I\u2019m not so sure about that. Anyway, I learnt magic like that. Following that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excluding the fact that he couldn\u2019t train to become able to wield mana, what she had experienced was very similar to what Yu IlHan himself had experienced. Yu IlHan licked his lips in search of something to say, but couldn\u2019t say anything. No one could measure another\u2019s pain. Kim YeSeul smiled slightly as if she understood him and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been since I started training magic? Anyway, I then had the confidence to win against the monsters in the Model Garden. At that time, the spirits requested that I follow them for the first time, and I erased the monsters along with them. It was an endlessly long fight, but they couldn\u2019t harm me. Mom could only win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how your level rose?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three in this place were all at level 299, but Yu IlHan had reached that level through killing numerous higher existences to the point that even he himself thought he was OP, while Liera had broken through her limits after a long period of training. However, there was no way they could just accept it with \u2018Oh that\u2019s what happened\u2019, just because they were told that Kim YeSeul\u2019s level was 299.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt did. It did a lot. The last one just allowed me to get to level 299.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how many did you kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said last time, I did not bother counting their numbers while fighting, nor did I bother counting the time. Just remembering is a little painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe spirits gave mom a present. Son, you\u2019ve heard about the Garden of Sunset, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an artifact that allowed me to come into contact with them, and go to the world where all the other people of Earth were. Mom used that and could finally go to Ya\u2019umin. And when I did, I saw the ladies of the district.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Kim YeSeul escaped the Model Garden and arrived at Ya\u2019umin, the other people of Earth had just arrived in Ya\u2019umin. It was akin to how no time would pass if Yu IlHan spent two months in the barrier created by the Hourglass of Eternity.</p><br/><p>Although there was a huge difference in scale, it was definitely something similar to what Yu IlHan and Yumir had experienced while they were apart, had happened to her as well. At the time she realized that her countless years of time was less than an instant, how would she have felt. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t possibly imagine.</p><br/><p>However, her voice was still very calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that was nothing strange. Magic to conceal my true self was simple. And like that, I\u2019ve hidden my true self and lived there for 10 years. After that, I came to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the records about you in the Akashic Record were deleted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the time I lived in Ya\u2019umin, that is.\u201d</p><br/><p>That meant that, Kim YeSeul was level 299 upon the time she returned to Earth. During the Great Cataclysm, the strongest of Earth was not Yu IlHan but his mother!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became dumbfounded. Let\u2019s leave aside the fact that he may not have noticed since he couldn\u2019t even wield mana at that time\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, ex-angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, I really didn\u2019t! I was completely in the dark about this!? I don\u2019t get how I couldn\u2019t know but I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Liera\u2019s eyes, it seemed that she really didn\u2019t know. Well, this shouldn\u2019t only apply to Liera, but all the other angels dispatched to Earth. Although his faith in the Heaven\u2019s Army had disappeared long time ago, he thought once again that they were not a reliable organization!</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul\u2019s story still had a little bit left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd while I was going back and forth to Ya\u2019umin like that, the Garden of Sunset contacted me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it an offer to become 5th class under the Garden of Sunset?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was about the magic formation. The magic formation that the Destruction Demon Army and the Army of Brilliant Light schemed with. I\u2019ve got information about those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo they were in it as well\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that I should just open a barrier and hide without ever coming into contact with those formations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s head tilted for the first time. Kim YeSeul\u2019s lips had curved into a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, mom was actually suspicious of the Garden of Sunset. If everything went normally, I would have been with all the other ladies, but somehow, only mom was dropped in this Model Garden. Moreover, I\u2019ve heard that this place was under the jurisdiction of the Garden of Sunset, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange if I thought that all my suffering was because of the Garden of Sunset, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also thought that.</p><br/><p>Of course, he did not know how they snatched Kim YeSeul in the middle and drop her in the Model Garden, nor did he know why their target was Kim YeSeul. Perhaps Yu IlHan and Kim YeSeul really had hidden talents, and the Garden of Sunset had schemed to take the two after knowing that beforehand.</p><br/><p>If not, it was also possible Kim YeSeul was dropped in the Model Garden like how Yu IlHan was dropped out on Earth simply because \u2018God couldn\u2019t find him\u2019, but the probability of that would be low. No, in fact, Yu IlHan even doubted that his dropout was a \u2018mistake\u2019 in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I did the opposite. Since you weren\u2019t here, IlHan, I asked MiRae, YuNa, and Mir and started erasing those formations. However, the result was this. Moreover, now I\u2019m back in the Model Garden and not Ya\u2019umin, so\u2026\u2026 they gave me the right advice after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just a day or two that they were unable to comprehend what the Garden of Sunset was thinking. Yu IlHan delayed his judgement on whether they wanted something from Kim YeSeul or not. Right now, there was something more important than that.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026And so, mom. How long have you lived after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said that time did not flow despite living countless years in the Model garden. Then, now that 3 years had passed and Yu IlHan had come here, how much time did she spend in this place? Is her existence even true?</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c3 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3 years. Son. Mom\u2019s confident in her ability to count time now. As far as I know, it has been exactly 3 years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Strength drained from him. No, wait. Yu IlHan also didn\u2019t experience any gap in time after his 1 thousand years of being a dropout, so perhaps this was normal.</p><br/><p>Anyway, this was very good. It was very good that Yu IlHan could find his mother like this. It was good that he didn\u2019t take any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Should I hear from you next? Mom has confidence to not be surprised no matter what story you will tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I do feel that what I\u2019ve experienced is tiny in comparison after hearing you, but\u2026\u2026ok, here it goes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought of something while speaking. This was the first time he spoke about his millennium dropout period. And in such a strange place as well, to his mom who looked to be about in her mid-twenties too\u2026\u2026 he made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fall somewhere strange, but rather was left alone on Earth\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan compressed his story as much as he could. About four chapters of worth if it was written. However, that was enough for Kim YeSeul to understand about him. What the two have experienced, in the end, were similar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened. My son, you\u2019ve suffered a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that what Kim YeSeul had experienced would be even more harsh than him, but Kim YeSeul thought the opposite. Yu IlHan looked at Kim YeSeul\u2019s eyes becoming red and hurriedly added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said this from the beginning, but I wasn\u2019t alone. Lita\u2026\u2026 Liera was there with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, dear\u2026\u2026 you\u2019ve suffered, haven\u2019t you. My baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she heard all of Yu IlHan\u2019s story, she should realize that he had lived for over a thousand years. However, Kim YeSeul did not care about that and embraced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the scene was very strange on the outside, Yu IlHan felt like a heavy load being lifted off him when he was embraced by his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026. It was hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stayed in Kim YeSeul\u2019s embrace. He was laughing and crying at the same time and even he thought it was weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, you come here too, my other child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, me? But I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Liera ended up in Kim YeSeul\u2019s arms. How long had it been since she had forgotten about the existence of a mother? Liera felt the wonderful feeling of motherly love after a long time. She subconsciously relaxed.</p><br/><p>In the unflowing world where space and time had stopped, the three stayed still like that for quite a while.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

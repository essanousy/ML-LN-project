Do you realize what kind of doom you\u2019re bringing upon yourself\u2026\u2026!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I sure do know what kind of doom awaits you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>Just why were their death threat repertoires all the same? Perhaps because these guys were all just minor mobs in their respective factions? Yu IlHan thought that it was very unfortunate, as he pierced the neck of the last remaining member of the Garden.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 278. 1 Strength, 1 Agility, 2 Health, 1 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv321 El Phisadein.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, the one that easily killed dragons was easily killed by His Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how strong has His Majesty become?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was even worried that they would get bored of whispering all the time like that. With a bitter smile, he was about to pick up the corpse of the leader-like being amongst this group of Garden of Sunset beings here, when he felt something and exclaimed. There was an abnormally large jewel between his neck and heart, and was emitting a mysterious light.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this guy has a magic stone? I finally get to see some more magic stones, eh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera was dumbstruck at his comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re speaking as if using 5th class stones are the natural\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed so much, so I should at least get this much, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Until now, he somehow had horrible luck with magic stones against higher existences, and including this fight, he had acquired a total of three 5th class magic stones. One for upgrading Yumir\u2019s armor, and one for making a new part of Yu IlHan\u2019s armor with Chaos Will\u2019s remaining half of the body, would still leave him with another one!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen with these, I should\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majestyyyy!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan could not continue to ponder where to use the new magic stone. When all the enemies died, the elves in that place rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, *sob*, you were too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is His Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe became a lot stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the passionate elves as if they were fans meeting their idol in person, not to mention Yu IlHan, his allies were all dumbstruck as well. In what world would Yu IlHan be loved and attended to so much!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you became cooler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was already cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but he became a lot cooler!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, how did you become stronger than that? It has only been 5 years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, first quiet down.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves that rushed as if they would pour kisses on him all became muted at Yu IlHan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The company were speechless yet again. They were shocked when the elves accepted when Yu IlHan deemed the Garden of Sunset as enemies, but looking at things now, that was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also really glad to see you, but it doesn\u2019t look like the situation will allow us to do much. Isn\u2019t that so, Mirfa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirfa, who was silently grabbing on to the end of his sleeves among the elves, stepped forward while lowering her head as though she was thankful that she was remembered.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was worried that something might have happened to her since she had the artifact to control the formation, but fortunately, it seemed like both her and the artifact were safe. Mirfa, who predicted what he was thinking from his gaze, spoke with a small smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not bring it out. They were also aware of the existence of the magic formation, and they seemed to be looking for a way to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I obliterated the guys here, even idiots would notice something. It won\u2019t be strange even if they tried to tinker with the magic formation now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, to destroy the magic formation that became one with the continent itself, even higher existences would have to put in a sizable amount of effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably, it just needs to endure for a little while as I modify it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cModify? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was unsure about implementing a whole magic formation on the continent from scratch, maintaining and upgrading the already existing formation wasn\u2019t that hard for him. Especially with his top-of-the-line mana crafting techniques and magic engineering knowledge!</p><br/><p>Mirfa realized that Yu IlHan hadn\u2019t just become stronger physically during the past 5 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Your Majesty is always above our imaginations\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Mirfa represented the elves, Ericia did so for the wolfkin. She had already reached 4th class, and perhaps due to that, her beauty had become more shiny than before.</p><br/><p>No, she was literally glowing from her hair and body right now. Before, she was a wolf with black hair, but perhaps this is due to the fact that she received the essence of the moon while acquiring 4th class? Her hair and eyebrows had changed into a lightly glowing silver. This was proof that she had become incomparably stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you protected the elves until now huh? Thanks. Receiving you as one of my subordinates is one of the best choices I made in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan praised her while stroking her hair, Ericia relaxed her icy expression and made a small smile. From the fact that her silver wolf ears above her hair were twitching seemed to imply that she was feeling rather happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlemir, you worked hard too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. I only protected Lady Ericia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind her was Flemir standing with a stiff expression as ever. It seemed that he had become stronger than before as he had expected. Well, they did experience the 4th and 5th Great Cataclysms, so it would be strange if they didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that you guys are safe, Ericia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Master, does that mean\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of a beast, she read the minute emotions in his words and voiced in worry. Yu IlHan made a small nod and raised his head. All the wolves and elves were looking at him right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d all listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you mean the fight against the Garden of Sunset?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you fight them in other places already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ignored the baptism of questions and spoke as shortly as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhiria, as well as the elves and wolfkin that were with her, had all died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wha\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone became depressed other than the extreme minority that predicted this would happen. The reactions of the 3 of the 4 elves under Yu IlHan were the most intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? She was the fastest and most secretive of the four of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I may be very rude but\u2026\u2026 did you confirm her death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, Pat\u00e9 was the most calm of them all. Yu IlHan nodded with a bitter smile, before taking out the corpse of the member of the Garden of Sunset he had killed before.</p><br/><p>Two daggers and a whip fell out from the shock. Not only that, even the armor that was worn by layering several times around the body was Phiria\u2019s. It did not take long for the elves with the long lifespan to realize the meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhiria\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhiria\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the moment she acted separately from you guys, she became their primary target. It was because her equipment was too strong. It seemed that they thought that no one would know because they wiped out all of Phiria\u2019s company, but\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as Yu IlHan had the Record skill, no one could hide the truth from him. Of course, this was only meaningful if others believed his words, but the ones here were those that definitely believed in his words.</p><br/><p>It was quite sorry for the loner Yu IlHan, but right now, Yu IlHan could only think about answering their trust.</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9 asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, then her body\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wish for it, I can take you to the scene\u2026.. However, I could not find her remains with my power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I take you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9 shook his head. when his eyes affixed on the ground looked at Yu IlHan again, his eyes were burning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should have other things to do right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you catch on fast, Pat\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s lips curved into a smile. Pat\u00e9\u2019s rage spread among his allies faster than Yu IlHan\u2019s flames could, and the mood that welcomed Yu IlHan disappeared among the elves and in place was a violent rage and wish for vengeance. It seemed that levels weren\u2019t the only thing that they had developed during the past 5 years.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan continued to speak in order to not dissipate their rage, and to sharpen their fangs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you vaguely know already, but Dareu has entered the realm of higher worlds. As you did not expect it, I did not expect this either, and I only came here a step too late but\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze stayed on the corpse of the higher existence for a moment, and especially on the pair of daggers that were on the ground next to it. The moment he saw that, Phiria\u2019s figure flashed by in his head, and his next words were stuck in his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shit, he really wasn\u2019t used to losing this like this. Since he had never got something in life, he was hundreds of times more sensitive to losing his things that he had acquired after much effort!</p><br/><p>Things wouldn\u2019t be this way in the future. Never, not even one!</p><br/><p>He swallowed the \u2018something\u2019 that was about to shoot out from his throat and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the Garden of Sunset and the Destruction Demon Army has entered this world, and perhaps the Army of Brilliant Light and the Heaven\u2019s Army may try to step in later. However, the important thing is this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Declared he while stabbing his spear into the already dead higher existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsider all four of them enemies. Everything other than you on this land is your enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your highness!\u201d (PR: Ok it wasn\u2019t quite originally like that but code geass anyone?)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s voice was very firm, and his subordinates gave a short but clear answer. They had neither doubts nor fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, bury your condolences to your dead colleagues in your heart. We will only acquire qualifications to send them off after everything is over. \u2026\u2026.Mir, let\u2019s have your mother\u2019s funeral at that time as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, this is war. No, to be exact\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at the state of equipment that the elves had, which were tattered as they were not maintained for over 5 years; the magic formation which the higher existences may tinker with at any moment, the Flying fortress that still had an incomplete holy region, as well as the tired elves and wolfkin before raising his hand.</p><br/><p>On his hand was the Hourglass of Eternity. This grew with him, and now that he became level 278, he could use this miraculous artifact to cover a region that he couldn\u2019t even imagine before, when he first acquired it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s war preparation time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan gripped his hand, the light that fell from the Hourglass of Eternity covered Yu IlHan and his group; the elves and wolfkin; as well as the boundless forest and the Flying fortress. The elves and wolfkin were only blinking in confusion, and when Yu IlHan saw that, he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have some sleep first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if we sleep in this situation\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you do sleep in this situation\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Embracing the two months of freedom that were only allowed to them, Yu IlHan spoke in a playful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurprisingly, nothing would have changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Once the owner of an inventory dies, the contents are returned to the faction that he or she or it belonged to, and this was actually mentioned by Erta before! And finally, not all higher existences are in possession of subspaces! It\u2019s mostly a specialty for angels and the fallen angels. IlHan\u2019s mother is amazing!</p><br/><p>The Hourglass of Eternity is activating! A prepared loner is going to be frightening!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

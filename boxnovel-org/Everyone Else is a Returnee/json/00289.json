Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and repeated his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it seems like God ran away from home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, since Ramiel didn\u2019t know anything either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera seemed to be in thought for a moment. Erta looked like she saw this coming, and Heli\u00e8na only made a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom when?\u201d</p><br/><p>And Liera asked. This was probably the most important question. Yu IlHan felt that what should have come had finally come and replied with a strange expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little before the Army of Brilliant Light formed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s eons ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera ended up screaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s before I was even born! And probably before humanity even appeared on Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like God is God after all, since he predicted what Heaven\u2019s Army will do all the way back then. No, perhaps it\u2019s a rigged match between those higher ups, but that\u2019s even more amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see you amazed by something like that! Uaaaaaa, I feel like I became an idiot, a huge idiot! *cries*.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, there. I know you must be feeling sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera ended up letting out streams of tears while in Yu IlHan\u2019s arms. Yu IlHan understood her well. Rather than just that, he could almost understand the defectors from the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta looked at Liera with a jealous gaze but still sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of the absence of God that there were so many traitors within the Heaven\u2019s Army? Thinking about how the Army of Brilliant Light may have seized control of the central parts of the Heaven\u2019s Army is horrifying\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But it was definitely the Heaven\u2019s Army that asked the mage lady and darling to create a gate that connected to the main headquarters of the Army of Brilliant Light. If the Army of Brilliant Light had indeed seized the central parts of Heaven, they wouldn\u2019t have used such a self-destructive method like that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the Heaven\u2019s Army had long since split into two sides, just that us lower ranked angels never noticed it. If so, just what kind of foolish things were we doing until now\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu.]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s sighs deepened. However, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s expression instead became brighter.</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it interesting? Thanks to the fact that the gate to the Netherworld opened that day, the Army of Brilliant Light received attack from all other factions. Heaven\u2019s Army would have gained some room to breathe\u2026\u2026. If you look at it another way, Heaven\u2019s Army was saved thanks to darling.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 That makes me feel uneasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was as if Yu IlHan had been playing on top of God\u2019s palms all this time. And this was about a God that had deserted his place too! However, Heli\u00e8na giggled and rejected his opinion.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you already know, darling? The ruler of the Heaven\u2019s Army is not omniscient nor omnipotent. If so, there would be no need for him to create an army and command the angels. And no traitors would have been possible, nor would there be a rise to any other factions. So don\u2019t worry about it too much. Perhaps someone may have prophesied your birth and growth, no one can know exactly what path you\u2019re walking. That is solely up to you. Right?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 Yes. That should be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s words were probably correct. Her firm words made Yu IlHan relieved. Really, Yu IlHan rather reluctantly appreciated her consoling him with the words that he really needed.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became scared the more his emotions towards her changed for the better. Succubus Queen was great alright, achieving something against him that had the max level Unshakable Heart.</p><br/><p>As if understanding what he was thinking, Liera asked him with a slightly worried gaze.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 So IlHan, what are you going to do from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll need to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan creased his forehead. However, from the moment he killed Ramiel and absorbed his records, what he had to do next was pretty much set in stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to hold off attacking the Heaven\u2019s Army for a while. It seems like I need to solve this matter about the Army of Brilliant Light first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yu IlHan say he\u2019ll \u2018resolve\u2019 the matter concerning an entire faction, Liera ended up bursting into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, you play big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the point Heaven\u2019s Army and the Army of Brilliant Light are trying to use me as a tool, I find these two very spiteful, but at this rate, the Heaven\u2019s Army may be swallowed by the Army of Brilliant Light. And that, is not a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes sank deep. The hair that extended out from his helmet grew longer and emitted heat. His hair was now covered in fire, affected by his emotions. This was proof that he was slowly escaping the realm of physics.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I attack the Heaven\u2019s Army now, then I\u2019ll only be doing a favour for the fallen angels. Even though they\u2019re the most dangerous of the bunch\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then are we going to focus on attacking the Army of Brilliant Light now?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, to be exact, I need to weed out the traitors in the Heaven\u2019s Army first. The Army of Brilliant Light will come next.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling, are you\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na read the confidence in his words and asked him while narrowing her eyes.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026able to discern the traitors of Heaven now? Before they become open about it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 So cool.]</p><br/><p>Unlike Heli\u00e8na who just exclaimed, Liera and Erta shouted out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Just how!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the leaders of each faction will be able to differentiate them, but that\u2019s none of my business, and anyway, since it\u2019s possible for me, I can only say that I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan as he finished dealing with this world. Still on Yumir\u2019s back, the two synced their breathing as they arranged the mana of this world. The group thought that these two had changed from before and just quietly watched.</p><br/><p>And in fact, he was indeed different from before.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel like I can see ahead a little now.\u2019</p><br/><p>After the fight with Ramiel, he felt that there really wasn\u2019t long until he reached the realm of higher existences now. According to his predictions, he would be able to ascend into a higher existence that can command a faction once he mastered the Dimensional ruler skill and the Record skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough, nothing fits me worse than an \u2018organization\u2019\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve come a little too far for that, son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, I also think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied to his mother with a bitter smile, and scanned through his forces on the two fortresses. Then, he nodded his head in satisfaction and gave a glance to Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss MiRae. I have something to ask of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having predicted what he was going to say, Kang MiRae made a fed up expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll say you want to split teams again right! You\u2019re being too harsh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But both the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress are unnecessary in tracking and killing traitors. So, Miss MiRae, please go around other higher worlds belonging to the Destruction Demon Army, the Garden of Sunset, and the Army of Brilliant Light. I\u2019ll send you the coordinates now. I\u2019ll give you a route so that you can progress continuously without any obstructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too harsh. You\u2019re the one who always does the dangerous things\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s eyes were filled with worry. Yu IlHan let go of Liera who was still in his arms, then arrived in front of Kang MiRae after sliding through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. I can\u2019t slack on this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>He told her in a serious tone while grabbing her hand. Facing Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes that glowed in red due to thick mana, Kang MiRae could not say anything. How could she refuse? This man was really evil and sneaky!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 Okay. But I\u2019ll be angry if you get injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I won\u2019t get hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026\u2026 Kyaak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan transmitted the records to her while replying playfully with his true heart. Transmitting records to others so naturally was also a part of the grown Record skill\u2019s power. Kang MiRae was surprised at the newly etched records in her mind, but still accepted all of them while clenching her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Fuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. My head aches a little but\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s done now.\u201d</p><br/><p>These records couldn\u2019t be received by just anyone. She could probably accept them since she already wielded dimensional magic. Of course, the God-ranked circlet on her head should have played a large role as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan once again grabbed her hand before letting go and stepped back. He decided to pretend to not see Kang MiRae\u2019s disappointed expression, and spoke to Heli\u00e8na that was staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeli\u00e8na. Please protect them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 Oh?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na reacted sensitively. Her eyes were smiling.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re leaving me? With these kids?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything since you\u2019re bound to my Rule skill anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But weren\u2019t you unsettled until now?]</p><br/><p>Hearing Heli\u00e8na\u2019s sharp remark, Yu IlHan was silent for a moment before he revealed the true reason.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 I need someone to protect them just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like Heli\u00e8na that much since she acted as if she knew everything about him. Her warm eyes didn\u2019t sit well with him either. He stuck out his tongue at her and turned around, but he was annoyed since she looked like she even found that joyful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera, Mir. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it, dad!]</p><br/><p>Liera was one that he could trust his life with, and Yumir was his partner that should become the answer to his path to a higher existence. From now, these two were enough. Any more than this would only affect his concealment, but to Liera, the fact that she was chosen was the most important.</p><br/><p>\u201cBleh. Bleeeeeeeeeh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Lady Leytna\u2019s name, I hope she gets hemorrhoids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrow up already. You\u2019re being embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smacked Liera on the forehead as she was teasing the others, and hopped back onto Yumir\u2019s back again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContact us frequently!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lightly waved his hands towards the others and activated the Warp skill without any regrets. He traced the tracks of the traitors that were recorded in Ramiel\u2019s records.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Warp, has become level 66.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWirepa\u2026\u2026 this is quite a big world, you know, IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I also stayed here a lot. This world is also considerably important since it\u2019s gone through the 6th Great Cataclysm as well\u2026\u2026. Don\u2019t tell me you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. There\u2019s a traitor here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan created a flaming spear on his hand and threw it without hesitation. The spear that was flung so hard that it left his field of view, disappeared completely after leaving behind its achievement on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 366 Mita.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. One down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera was shocked at his mutters.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed him? Just with a simple throw?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean simple. It was my full power attack with Absolute Accuracy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t accept this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon the other side of the world became noisy. That was probably not just because an angel had died, but also because that angel was a \u2018traitor\u2019. Liera sweated cold sweat, but traitors were to be killed on sight even when she was an angel so she had less objections now when Yu IlHan killed angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to the next world now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cooly replied and threw his spear once again. It impaled and incinerated the heart of a traitor without fail, and Liera was frozen on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026 There are that many traitors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust watch for a moment, Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan as he created three more spears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you that the Heaven\u2019s Army is in dire straits, much more so than you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three spears thrown from his hand killed yet another three traitors. At that point, all the angels residing in Wirepa had realized that an unknown entity was punishing the traitors.</p><br/><p>[Uh!?]</p><br/><p>[Just, what is\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[My God.]</p><br/><p>The traitors trembled, but they couldn\u2019t do anything since they knew that they would be attacked by angels as soon as they did something strange. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t miss a single one and killed all of them. Murky grey blood scattered in the sky.</p><br/><p>[Traitors\u2026\u2026 there are so many traitors.]</p><br/><p>[Just who? Just who is enacting punishment!]</p><br/><p>[Is it the four Great Archangels\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t move from now on! Anyone that moves is a traitor!]</p><br/><p>The many branching roots of the Army of Brilliant Light started being pulled out one by one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

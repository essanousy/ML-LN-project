However, when he tried appraising the spear while staring at it intently, Liera threatened to cry so he could only give up. Only Erta, who knew the answer to Yu Ilhan\u2019s dilemma, observed the situation while letting out a soft sigh.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, just obediently receive your rewards.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Heaven Quest 006 Dareu extermination, complete!]</p><br/><p>[All status increased by 5. Strength increases additionally by 10.]</p><br/><p>[You have learnt the active skill, Rule, you can take in subordinates, and the ones subordinated to you by this skill cannot harm the ruler due to a restriction stronger than that of being in a party. You will be able to govern the beings under you better as the skill level rises, and will be able to accelerate their growth. Currently, as of level 1, you can take up to 5 subordinates. You cannot activate the skill without the other party\u2019s agreement.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The skills given to you by Heaven are always related to the accumulated record and achievements you acquire. You know why you got this skill, right?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yes, of course. It\u2019s just that he had too many suspicions.</p><br/><p>Honestly, it was a good thing. He was worried that the elves that followed him to Earth were too weak, and although he was a little bitter that he was doing so with the help of the skill, but he cold now completely believe in the elves.</p><br/><p>Joy and sadness, guilt and a sense of safety, etc \u2013 such complex feelings enveloped Yu IlHan. Erta, who saw him, added with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>[Originally, we thought that the lower stage version, Lead, would have been sufficient, but your achievements were so great that it got upgraded automatically. You should\u2019ve seen the angels\u2019 faces.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s IlHan, this much is only natural.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Also.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta pointed to Yu IlHan\u2019s Cross Bag. The moment she did, the Cross Bag amazingly disappeared!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan. You\u2019ve perfectly cleaned up Dareu which could have upset the balance due to being connected with Earth, and even supported the intelligent species there to the point that they can develop further. The merits from that is extremely high, and therefore, Heaven has decided that we\u2019ll give you the inventories of the angels that died during the war at the Wall of Chaos this time.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan blinked his eyes; he didn\u2019t quite understand what she was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you said inventory was magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>[To be exact, inventories are born with interspace creation magic. And when the owner dies, it isn\u2019t impossible to hand over the ownership to someone else. It\u2019s a similar concept to how you became the owner of the elven empire\u2019s magic formation.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t give it to me when I wanted it so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Would we kill a fine angel just to give you an inventory? Also, it\u2019s impossible anyway if the receiver cannot wield mana.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>It was too correct to say anything. So, in the end, the rewards this time were too coincidental.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, where did my Cross Bag go?\u201d</p><br/><p>He always wanted an inventory, but Yu IlHan had profited immensely due to the weight transfer function and the remote collection function attached to the Cross Bag. It would be difficult for him if they suddenly disappeared now.</p><br/><p>[Along with the destruction of the Cross Bag, all its contents were transferred to the inventory. The options the Cross Bag had were also applied to the inventory as well. However, remote collection and weight transfer might have changed scales so please practice it.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>With those words, she tapped her hand on Yu IlHan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Marvelously, Yu IlHan could comprehend how the inventory was transferred to him, and what he had to do in order to use that inventory at the moment she touched him.</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t see with his eyes since they weren\u2019t on Earth, the interspace was something that Yu IlHan could access at any moment in order to take something out. This was the moment that Yu IlHan had received a fragment of a higher existence\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>[You received the possession of an inventory. The total space equals the interspaces of twelve lower ranked angels. They have the following options, and the abilities will increase according to the growth of the owner\u2019s magic.]</p><br/><p>[ 1. Weight transfer, control.]</p><br/><p>[ 2. Frozen time.]</p><br/><p>[ 3. Remote collection of possessions.]</p><br/><p>He immediately felt what happened. Although he had to control the Cross Bag with the weight control option, now that it became an inventory, there was no need for that. Therefore, the weight control option was merged into the weight transfer option. And that, was a dream combination.</p><br/><p>Now, Yu IlHan could transfer, specifically, a 100,000 tons, or 10 tons even if the total mass in the bag was a million tons.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm. If it\u2019s with my strength now, how many tons can I handle?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You will need practice.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The second option, the frozen time inside the interspace, seemed like a characteristic of an inventory. Of course, there will be no rotting inside, so the Cross Bag option would disappear.</p><br/><p>Also, what was transferred completely in itself, was the remote collection of possessions. Perhaps due to the increased affinity towards the inventory rather than the Cross Bag, he could now take out several items in several different locations at once, and it also became easier to set a direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, it\u2019s getting close to my ideal!\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you tell me before you reach it, I\u2019ll stop them from becoming things that we might get sued for.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s to the point that he was granted an inventory, he must have really cleaned up Dareu.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>How did he manage that when there were 4th classes everywhere? Liera found that absurd, but Yu IlHan and Erta did not mention the details, since she wouldn\u2019t believe it even if they did.</p><br/><p>After receiving all the rewards, Yu IlHan went to the elves\u2019 rooms to use the rule skill, but the elves were sleeping on the floor as there was no bed, with each sex in their respective rooms.</p><br/><p>Well, although they said that they will serve the emperor, or that they had nothing that they were curious about, they had just come to a completely different world, leaving their homeland and choosing to believe in Yu IlHan. They were probably nervous, and tired. That was normal.</p><br/><p>However, they relaxed thinking that this place was where Yu IlHan lived. The elves were all sleeping with na\u00efve expressions.</p><br/><p>Although the scene was sexy rather than cute due to their appearances, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle while looking at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese airheads.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who\u2019s saying that to who?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Who are these elves? I need to erase them for me and IlHan\u2019s future, right?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[And here we almost had a heartwarming scene\u2026\u2026 Liera, since you got promoted, stop being an embarrassment.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>A little more, and the guard towards the elves went down.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t activate the skill without the opponent\u2019s agreement, he decided to delay that and exited his house.</p><br/><p>Why? Of course, it was to work, since he had a proper rest. The three things that Yu IlHan liked the most were sleeping, eating, and doing manual labor! Of course, only after the word \u2018alone\u2019 was attached after it.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan headed to the underground level of the building in his possession nearby the apartment. His workshop was still placed in a position where no one could enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI left for three months and this place looks fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flicker, flicker. Eternal Flame, which met its master after a long time greeted him while swaying. Yu IlHan threw some 3rd class magic stones and dragonkin meat into the furnace and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot for you to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame rejoiced. It seemed to. Of course, it was fine even if it hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d just force feed it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Well, then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Time to smith \u2013 was what he thought when something popped up into his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t chose my subclass!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought you were delaying it intentionally!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Rarely, there were people who were stubborn about not getting a subclass immediately after getting a main class, thinking that they might be able to get a better subclass if they waited a little.</p><br/><p>Of course, this didn\u2019t apply to Yu IlHan. He just forgot about it until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s anything similar to God\u2019s Hammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Since you said that you fulfilled another requirement, wouldn\u2019t it give you something similar?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately called out the list of available subclasses. However, as if it was mad at him for not choosing it as a main class, there was no smithing-category subclass no matter how hard he looked.</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to the influence of leading the elves, there was something like \u2018newbie monarch\u2019. But even so.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect so much anyway, so let\u2019s just choose an ordinary blacks\u2026\u2026 Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ignored the temptation of numerous subclasses and was about to choose blacksmith but he stopped in panic. Since this was something she was used to, Erta and Liera\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change much.</p><br/><p>[Did some revolutionary job appear or something?]</p><br/><p>[Monster Lord or ruler?]</p><br/><p>\u201cClose, Erta. It\u2019s Dragon Rider.\u201d</p><br/><p>[ 27. Dragon Rider]</p><br/><p>In contrast to every other subclasses highlighted with green text, only Dragon Rider was colored in gold. Quite blatantly, it was as if all others were no good!</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard someone getting a Dragon Rider as a subclass, not main, even with my lifespan as an angel\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[At this point, it\u2019s as if someone\u2019s interfering, preventing you from becoming a blacksmith.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was because of you at the time of the 2nd class advancement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring his words, Erta continued.</p><br/><p>[But it will be good to choose Dragon Rider. There\u2019s no need to hesitate.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[What will he do even if he does? Didn\u2019t he kill all the dragons?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s because Yu IlHan has a dragon egg.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Ah, yeah. You sure did.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera decided to stop thinking.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did hesitate since he wouldn\u2019t be able to acquire a smithing class until he acquired his 4th class if he let it go like this.</p><br/><p>However, he also thought that there was a reason the angels emphasized it so much, and ended up choosing it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a different feeling to when he acquired Angel\u2019s Partner spread within himself through the mana. Hotter than anything, but disappearing like an illusion! Like steam!</p><br/><p>There were almost no changes to his physical body and it was the same for his magic. It was just that his mind was ruled by the feeling that there was an additional virtual engine that moved his body.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan instinctively realized. That this \u2018engine\u2019 he newly acquired, would not be activated properly without a dragon.</p><br/><p>[You have become a Dragon Rider. You may now contract a dragon. All abilities increase by 20% against dragonkin.]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the passive skill, Dragon-Man Resonance. All abilities increase by 10% when fighting together with a dragon, for both the rider and the dragon, and increases by an additional 10% when riding the dragon. The resonance amplifies if a lead-category class is also applied to the dragon.]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the active skill, Dragonic Blood. You can enhance your active skills by borrowing power from your partner, and will be able to enhance your skills in a variety of ways according to the traits of your partner, and the skill level. You can also enhance passive skills that has an active ability.]</p><br/><p>[There are no dragons which you are in a contract with.]</p><br/><p>The angels were right. Under the condition that there was a contract-able dragon, Dragon Rider was a combative subclass!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed in relief thinking that his choice was right.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people would also choose this combative subclass but I was about to become a blacksmith without knowing anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not that there are no combative subclasses, but you can\u2019t simply assume that anyone can become a Dragon Rider!]</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t surprised since it was Yu IlHan they were talking about, naturally, Dragon Rider subclass wasn\u2019t seen very often.</p><br/><p>How can an ordinary human, or even other races, be in an equal standing with a dragon that even they have hard time talking to?</p><br/><p>Dragon Rider was only acquirable by Yu IlHan only because he had a power that overwhelmed them and was also in a party with them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, even if one becomes a Dragon Rider, it was difficult to find a dragon who would obediently become a human\u2019s ride, so there were many who couldn\u2019t use their rare subclass for their entire lives\u2026\u2026. No, even those who luckily became a Dragon Rider were also like that.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan was currently in possession of a dragon\u2019s egg, and also had the skill, Rule. There would be no other precedent like him.</p><br/><p>Just that, he would have to suffer quite a lot until the dragon matured into an adult.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I should hatch the egg first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out the egg from his inventory. Looking at the egg that was still emitting bright golden light, Eternal Flame rejoiced with bright light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t eat this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the flame became smaller as if in shock. Yu IlHan spoke to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really can\u2019t. We\u2019re going to incubate this guy from now on. I\u2019ll add you with supplementary fire so you will control them and awaken this guy, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt as if the Eternal Flame nodded. It probably did. He could only believe so.</p><br/><p>Nodding, Yu IlHan took out his spear and called out purple flames and put it on the bottom of the furnace. The Eternal Flame greedily absorbed the purple flames and changed color into a strange one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m adding Blaze too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the Eternal Flame wouldn\u2019t even know what Blaze is. Yu IlHan took out an intact mana potion he had left even though he used a lot of them in Dareu, and activated Blaze while sucking on it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Eternal Flame made an exaggerated reaction as if it would say [Oooh!? OOOOOOOOOOHHHH!] if it was able to speak.</p><br/><p>If everything it had eaten until now was normal coffee, this strong aura would be a super concentrated espresso! The golden fire burned violently and emanated its joy in all directions.</p><br/><p>[You really did it.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t get what\u2019s happening but I do get that it\u2019s amazing!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You should just honestly that you don\u2019t know anything.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Blaze was a monster that ate up mana. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t hesitate and put the egg inside the furnace.</p><br/><p>It would be difficult with just purple flames and Blaze, but since the everlasting flame that controlled both of those flames didn\u2019t forget Yu IlHan\u2019s warnings, it gently received the dragon\u2019s egg and transferred the heat required for the egg to hatch.</p><br/><p>If dragons were looking at this scene, they might have declared war on Heaven, saying that they needed Eternal Flames to incubate their eggs.</p><br/><p>However, was it insufficient with just Blaze? The egg that glowed due to the heat in the furnace seemed to emit light before stealing Yu IlHan\u2019s mana additionally on top of the Blaze that drained his mana. It was a considerable amount as well.</p><br/><p>Since this was an important occasion such as the birth of a dragon, it wasn\u2019t so surprising. Yu IlHan just thought that the birth of a dragon was quite an event, and obediently handed over his mana.</p><br/><p>Since there was the highest-quality mana potion on his mouth anyway, he wouldn\u2019t collapse from mana overexertion even while Blaze and the egg drained him.</p><br/><p>When he emptied about 80% of the mana potion, he finally saw some reaction. The light emitted by the egg seemed to get even brighter before a crack appeared on top of the egg. The angels looking at that scene both said a line each with round eyes.</p><br/><p>[Now that I think about it, it\u2019s the first time in my life as an angel that I see a dragon hatching.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s also the first time for me seeing an angel receiving the bles [email\u00a0protected]#$%#$#!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>While Liera prevented Erta from speaking, and punished her, the crack on the egg gradually became bigger. THe moment the crack went from the top to bottom in a zigzag manner, the egg completely cracked apart with a \u2018pak\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiya!\u201d</p><br/><p>What came out of the egg with a lively shout was a child looking around 2 years of age. Like a phoenix born from fire, it charged out from the furnace and landed on the ground. That figure, didn\u2019t look like a newborn at all. It was a 10/10 landing.</p><br/><p>With white skin, golden eyes, and black hair despite being born moments ago, it was a healthy boy.</p><br/><p>His appearance was extraordinary as expected of a dragon, but even though the child was seen for the first time, the facial features looked quite familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Moreover, this guy even spoke with liveliness as well. Not dragon tongue, not english, but in Korean.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally noticed that something was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Where did you learn Korean from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom dad\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Yu IlHan\u2019s trembling voice and question, the dragon-child answered himself, although, without confidence. After a while, he seemed to have thought of something as he clapped with hands while speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf mom lays the egg, dad wakes me up! Mom said that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s dad! I learnt from dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s quite interesting \u2013 thought IlHan and turned his head.</p><br/><p>Something flashed by his head at that moment which was the sentence in the letter that read\u2019 \u2018If my child can take you on even by a half\u2019.</p><br/><p>At that time, he only thought that she meant for him to raise the egg well. However, looking at this child, correction, looking at this child that had clearly received \u2018Yu IlHan\u2019s influence\u2019, it didn\u2019t seem that those were her only intentions.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, it must have happened the moment Yu IlHan\u2019s mana was supplied to the egg.</p><br/><p>In an instant, all the incidents were linked in his head. The questions he had were solved just like that. In the first place, Lecidna had no intentions on concealing it in the first place.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even have the energy to get angry, but he couldn\u2019t endure without getting angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, this marriage scammer\u2026\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that Lecidna had not been a housewife, but a dragon at a marriageable age looking for a partner.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Someone mentioned about weight control option, but it\u2019s possible to decrease the weight, but impossible to increase it!</p><br/><p>(Untranslatable pun)</p><br/><p>I went over the quantity since I couldn\u2019t cut it off in the middle. Inventories and subclasses and everything took too much content\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>IT\u2019S A BOY HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. GOT YA THERE.</p><br/><p>Those who questioned that whether it was possible to put in life forms inside the bag, I\u2019m not sure. And those who questioned why it was possible to put the egg in the bag, I don\u2019t know either.</p><br/><p>But, looking at that scene, it seemed like the egg was still \u2018unfertilized\u2019?</p><br/><p>PR: Liera\u2019s spot as Ilhan\u2019s wife got robbed</p><br/><p>TN: Liera:[Call me mother]</p><br/><p>dragon:[Noona!]</p><br/><p>(Infinite cycle of above two lines)</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

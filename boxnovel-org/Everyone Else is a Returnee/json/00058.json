It was now time to go to China.</p><br/><p>However, when he did say that, his mother\u2019s reaction was like this:</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing out again? Then mom will go to Ya\u2019umin for a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid some good seafood appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother seemed to be enjoying her life in her own way. Eating away at the stew made with unknown animal\u2019s meat on the table, Yu IlHan was satisfied. Human adaptability was truly amazing.</p><br/><p>He washed himself clean after the meal, and having refreshed himself, he restocked his weapons in his workshop, as he had planned. First, he restocked the short spears which he used in the mutated species dungeon, since he threw them everywhere, then repaired the pile bunker with all his heart, since he had to use the remaining ten shots properly.</p><br/><p>He also repaired his other weapons and his armor. He saw that, somehow, the attack power and the defense increased as he repaired them, but he decided not to mind.</p><br/><p>[Aren\u2019t you using that 3rd class magic stone? Even if you use one for Empress\u2019 weapon, there\u2019s one left.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yu IlHan restocked, but did not make any new weapons, Erta asked in confusion. Then, Yu IlHan replied while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I can\u2019t think of anything to make. It\u2019s not time to swap armor yet, and the spear is plenty strong too. Making sub-weapons is a waste of mana too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why aren\u2019t you making accessoires?](Lita)</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lita said something completely unexpected. Like a boxer who was about to faint from being hit from a dead angle, Yu Il Han asked back in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAcc\u2026essories?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s heart pounded. He couldn\u2019t not think back to the games he played before the Great Cataclysm. In reality, they had no use other than for decoration, no, more like, they were made for decoration(!), aren\u2019t they just as important as weapons and armor in games!</p><br/><p>Putting Lita on his palm, Yu IlHan opened his mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain that in a little more detail?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not every artifacts are armors and weapons. Mana crafting is processing the crafter\u2019s will by borrowing the power of mana and imbuing in an item. So, it doesn\u2019t have to be armors and swords.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for using the word \u2018detail\u2019, just go straight to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uh, like I said it\u2019s\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Why Lita was pondering, Erta replied in place of her while laughing with a \u2018heh\u2019.</p><br/><p>[It means that you have a lot of equipment slots left.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, much more direct!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t only games. In fantasy novels, too, don\u2019t those main characters break through crises with a special power imbued necklaces/rings/tattoos/bracelets/anklets/earrings/etc? Lita and Erta were saying that Yu IlHan was capable of making such artifacts.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also thought it was possible. No, rather, unlike armors and weapons which had a clear purpose of either blocking or attacking, he thought that the range of effect an unassuming accessory could have maybe much more than those.</p><br/><p>[So, are you going to make anything?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I like rings!](Lita)(T/N: This sentence can also mean \u2018I would like a ring!\u2019)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. It takes a long time to make one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uh\u2026 yeah\u2026\u2026](Lita)</p><br/><p>While Lita was getting dejected for some reason, what the thousand year virgin decided to make was a bracelet.</p><br/><p>He extracted the most intact part of the giant thunder bird and processed it into an ordinary bracelet. It was a thin leather bracelet that would fit inside a gauntlet.</p><br/><p>That, which looked more like an armband than a bracelet, looked very ordinary, but the materials weren\u2019t from a 3rd class monster for nothing, so it was tough to the point that ordinary swords wouldn\u2019t be able to damage it at all.</p><br/><p>[Good idea. The spoils of war you\u2019ve earned this time is not suitable to make a necklace or an earring.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, I only made it since it takes the least time to make.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ok\u2026\u2026](Erta)</p><br/><p>Now, while even Erta was getting dejected for some reason, Yu IlHan prepared to mana craft. On one hand was the leather bracelet, and on the other was the bigger magic stone of the two 3rd class thunder bird magic stones.</p><br/><p>However, what was more important than the materials was his will. Taking a deep breath, Yu IlHan closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the pitch black vision and silence, what Yu IlHan thought of was the lightning vortex that the thunder bird had made. Even if it wasn\u2019t to that extent, Yu IlHan wanted a protective membrane before his armor was pierced.</p><br/><p>A brilliant light formed. The positive light that told him of the mana craft\u2019s big success. This light, which other people with mana crafting would see once in a year or so, was something that Yu IlHan saw more than sunlight.</p><br/><p>That didn\u2019t mean that this was from luck. It was because he had a deep understanding of the technique known as mana crafting.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had the record of killing the thunder bird himself, and the bracelet and the magic stone was from the thunder bird as well. This was, really, textbook mana crafting.</p><br/><p>Of course, there weren\u2019t many people who didn\u2019t know of this fact, but it was hard to do it the textbook way. Everything in the world was always like this.</p><br/><p>[Quick Lightning Storm\u2019s Gold Leather Bracelet]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 1,700]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 20% increase in mana recovery speed; when hit, it\u2019s possible to create a lightning storm. Limited to once a day.]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 1,150/1,150]</p><br/><p>[An artifact with concentrated power of lightning imbued into it. Inside it dwells a strong and violent power of a monster.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The option that the Empress, Kang MiRae, wanted so much, was attached on this bracelet! Of course, since Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t use mana yet, increase in mana recovery speed was useless.</p><br/><p>He briefly pondered on whether to sell this to Kang MiRae or not, but since it had the option he himself wanted as well, he decided to wear it himself.</p><br/><p>Gaining money was nothing bad, but safety was above all! Moreover, since the results were better than he had thought, he got slightly scared. That was because he felt that a high level of danger, befitting those stats, would come at him.</p><br/><p>[What\u2019s up with you, IlHan? How can you make the things that are on the same level as a kingdom\u2019s treasure, so easily?](Lita)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s nothing, considering he made a spear that could pierce a 2nd class monster\u2019s skin, with pure steel.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Lita was surprised at Yu IlHan\u2019s ability, but as Erta had already given up, she was replying quite comfortably.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, after he checked the bracelet\u2019s options, prepared to go out along with the confidence that he would be able to take care of everything even if another monster on the same level as Reta Kar\u2019iha appeared.</p><br/><p>His destination was the central mountainous regions of the Shandong Province of China, where it was famous for the city, Qingdao. Resolving to himself that he would not eat lamb kebabs, or drink Tsingtao, and that he will go straight back home after clearing the Quegna dungeon, he headed to Incheon Airport. To stowaway, of course! (T/N: I know nothing about China, and this whole paragraph maybe horribly wrong. Thanks to ensj for \u2018Tsingtao\u2019, cuz Qingdao and Tsingtao are written in the same way in Korean, I dunno what it is tho)</p><br/><p>The airport was crowded with people. Now that high-level people were getting their 2nd classes one after another, the sky roads were opening more and more.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many courageous people who left home to tour, but in the world, there were many people who had no choice but to take one.</p><br/><p>There really were a variety of people at the airport. Businessmen, an ability user wearing an armor, people in military clothes\u2026\u2026 There were some who Yu IlHan was familiar with, but Yu IlHan felt like their reunion was foreshadowing something and became worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I swear I will finish my service properly and go marry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the country will let you go, second lieutenant Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can block me from marrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The figures of colonel Yoon DaeHan, and second lieutenant Han YeoRang, who he had met during the initial stages of the Great Cataclysm, while he was going around everywhere killing monsters.</p><br/><p>He thought that those two wouldn\u2019t be together, with the difference in their ranks and all, but now, from the unusual-looking black military outfit, it seemed that they now belonged to the special forces.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also immediately realized what special forces they were in. Suppression, that was the only thing. (T/N: Remember Suppression nicknamed Depression?)</p><br/><p>\u2018I do want to contact them now that I\u2019ve met them\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though he now could gain an enormous amount of money through the transaction with Kang MiRae, he did not change his mind to sell the mass produced equipments to Suppression. Since his aim was to make other people defend against monsters better.</p><br/><p>It would be better to contact them through the people he knew, and now would be the best opportunity, but no matter how he thought about it, he had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>The feeling that he would get caught up in a new quest, if he talked to them, assaulted him. There were many planes departing from Incheon Airport anyway, and from the look of it, they should be leaving on a military plane, so his and their paths probably won\u2019t cross each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, let\u2019s leave it to another time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Why did special forces such as Suppression come to Incheon airport when they had the military airport? They had some tearfully unfortunate circumstances, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[Suppression Guardian Forces will depart in 30 minutes.]</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, only the Incheon Airport had military forces that protected airways from monsters.</p><br/><p>Yes, they had neither money nor soldiers! Just where did that much national defense budget go, he didn\u2019t know, but anyway, Korea didn\u2019t have an enough number of military ability users to spread them out to different airports.</p><br/><p>The reason they showed up in Incheon Airport was also because of that. No, perhaps, they maybe the Guardian Forces themselves. Since they all belonged to Suppression.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ignored the soldiers and proceeded forward. He checked the plane going to his destination, and quickly got on board. HIs stowaway was already at an art-level.</p><br/><p>His concealment, which no modern magic or science could see through, carried him safely inside the plane, and just as he was about to lie down on an empty seat, he had a thought.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait, this wouldn\u2019t have happened if I applied for a passport last time, would it?\u2019</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s good that you know now.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Zzz.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Carrying Yu IlHan, who had a late realization, the plane flew towards China.</p><br/><p>As soon as he got off the plane, Yu IlHan ran across the city with the help of Navigation Erta. (T/N: I wanted to put Erta-vigation, but oh well\u2026)</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is a total mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like Korea did well in defending against monsters, but most of China barely retained their city form; it was that tattered and ruined. High-rise buildings fallen over like dominos were everywhere, and smaller buildings were worse.</p><br/><p>In the cities where restoration was underway, there were countless wanderers without homes. There was no way they would find Yu IlHan, but every time Yu IlHan came within their vision, he stopped slightly. He had remembered back to when he fought the huge bear in Seongbuk-gu, last time, when many people were running away from their homes.</p><br/><p>If he said he was comfortable while looking at them, then he would be lying.</p><br/><p>[All existences have the right and obligation to live with their own power. It is not necessary for you to mind them](Erta)</p><br/><p>[You don\u2019t need to help them. You just have to protect yourself.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>The angels seemed to have noticed where his gazes were going. To them, who encouraged Yu IlHan with quite the cold words, Yu IlHan replied to them with a bitter smile and hurried on.</p><br/><p>He wanted to help the people in crises if it was possible. If it did not put him into danger, he could move while being resolved to get injured.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of kindness or because he was an idiot, but just that it felt disgusting to see his own race dying in front of his eyes. And honestly, rescuing humans felt quite good.</p><br/><p>But that was it. The most important thing to Yu IlHan was Yu IlHan himself. He did not thing arrogantly that he would be able to save all the pitiful people in the world. It was unfortunate, but a life was too short even to live for oneself. (T/N: I like his philosophy)</p><br/><p>How long was it to the dungeon he was aiming for? To shake the bad feelings off, Yu IlHan wanted to get in battle quickly. It was fine even if it was a strong opponent. Rather, he wanted to fight one.</p><br/><p>However, as if she knew what he was thinking, Lita muttered with a stiff voice.</p><br/><p>[This is dangerous.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[What is?](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta didn\u2019t seem to notice anything. Yu IlHan first stopped and asked Lita.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it now? Did a 4th class monster appear nearby?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Something like that.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[Wait, I did not feel anything. Lita, just what happened?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Dungeon concealment. I think we grabbed onto the tail of the traitors. And one that\u2019s more serious than we think.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Erta became speechless from the seriousness in Lita\u2019s voice, since she had never heard her speak like that before.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yu IlHan sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew, I wondered when it would be. It\u2019s fortunate that I got to know it beforehand, this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The part you\u2019re being relieved about is strange!](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta shouted in rage, but Yu IlHan replied while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? It makes a huge difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was different from the time when he had to fight against Reta Kar\u2019iha.</p><br/><p>The fact that the overlord of concealment, Yu IlHan, saw the crisis coming, and could move against it.</p><br/><p>The meaning of that, wouldn\u2019t be known by his enemies.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>1. Erta\u2019s completely tamed\u2026</p><br/><p>2. Lamb kebabs are best in Qingdao. Guo Bao Rou is good as an alcohol side snack as well. Chinese food are good as snacks to go with alcohol! Is it just that? Erguotuo jiu with menbosha are hmmm\u2026 Yeonnam-dong(T/N: This is in Korea) is quite good. I recommend the chinese restaurant, Hyang-mi. (T/N: He lists all that chinese food (which I have no idea what they are), but since he had never gone to China, he mentions a restaurant in Korea, lol)</p><br/><p>3. Yoon DaeHan and Han YeoRang is planned to keep appearing to appeal the pitiful \u2018strong friends\u2019.</p><br/><p>4. I repeat, but the mage is very powerful! They become invincible if they have a knight protecting them!! If they don\u2019t walk around alone like a fool, then would there be anyone who can kill them? (T/N: I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 MC can)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>So\u2026. someone on LCD said they don\u2019t want culture censors\u2026 should I not censor them anymore then? Author sure censored it (which is why I did so in the first place)</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t be bothered to change them back now, but I sure can do it in the future chapters.</p><br/><p>Also, I changed monster speak to be in {} when they\u2019re originally in [], but in the future chapters, monsters may speak in human language\u2026 what do I do\u2026?</p><br/><p>And dang, today\u2019s EER chapter (Raws) end on a cliffhanger (With MC getting stabbed)</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

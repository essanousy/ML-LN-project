You think this is SMOOTH!? Yes, right now! We\u2019re \u2018smoothly\u2019 dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael Smithson despaired. It felt like the tentacles that battered against his shield would pierce him along with the flimsy thing at any moment. Yu IlHan tilted his head and called for Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t let them die. Just enough so that they don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil! DEVILLLLLLL!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Krhaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]</p><br/><p>Normally, the three would not be able to go against the demon by themselves. However, the holy maiden with unbelievably good looks and ability backed them up so they were boosted to a point where they could just barely be able to confront it with the three of them!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I can see their coordination and strength increasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. If the others were able to resist even a little against this slowing magic, then I\u2019d be able to bring them here and train them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hurried about it, and let\u2019s raise them up first, son. We have plenty of time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, I guess\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t look after them forever. Yu lHan left the three to Na YuNa and Erta and turned around. He still had a lot of other things to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I have a wonderful crafting time now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But why are you looking at me, master?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you probably know the reason more than I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Flying fortress experienced a lot of things in its growth. Thanks to the growth potential it had as a God-ranked artifact, it could use the records it had absorbed now to enhance the functionalities of its artifacts by boosting their durability or the like.</p><br/><p>However, just that was not enough. Using the materials from countless higher existence\u2019s remains in Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory, he would be able to make it grow and reach greater heights!</p><br/><p>[Any more is impossible, IT\u2019S IMPOSSIBLE!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first will be \u2018Thousand Eyes\u2019. You know what I\u2019ll do, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You insane master!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gathered all the remaining feathers of angels and fallen angels and started crafting 900 more mirrors. Mystic had grown until now, and she should be able to control a thousand mirrors at once!</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t, I cannot do it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can do it. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be able to endure in the upcoming war!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Tyrant! You tyrant!]</p><br/><p>Since he had experience making those before, he didn\u2019t require much time while making those mirrors. Yu IlHan\u2019s working speed that became faster and faster the more he made them was enough to attract the attention of others that entered the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me and do your own thing everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made 900 mirrors in under 14 hours. Then, he seemed to ponder on something before making another four of them. He used all the remaining materials to make four of the biggest and baddest mirrors!</p><br/><p>[Why four? Is it because 1,004 (Angel)?] (T/N: 1,004 sounds the same as \u2018angel\u2019 in Korean)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because the enemies would be surprised if they see four more even though it\u2019s called \u2018Thousand Eyes\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Yeah, I did kinda expect it to be something like that.]</p><br/><p>Hundred Eyes to Thousand Eyes \u2013 the transformation in the scale and power of the artifact changed the rank as well. From Chaos to Demigod!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was slightly disappointed since he was aiming for God rank, but since the Flying fortress was upgraded as he had originally intended to, he decided to leave it there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what more should I add?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Master? Isn\u2019t your trust in me a little too high\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know precisely what you can and cannot handle so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That makes me even more worried though!]</p><br/><p>The majority of the higher existences belonging to the Destruction Demon Army were those that evolved from monsters, and a lot of the time, their blood and flesh contained extreme poison. Moreover, all of them had unique properties and when mixed with others, the level of poison sometimes evolved to something else.</p><br/><p>Finally, they were the poison from higher existences, and naturally worked against higher existences as well. Among the Destruction Demon Army members, there were many that attacked their enemies with the poison they possessed. Of course, Yu IlHan had the evolved version of Extreme poison resistance, Falling Down, so wasn\u2019t affected by any of them!</p><br/><p>Yes. The second method to upgrade the Flying fortress was poison. There were plenty \\of Destruction Demon Army bodies in his inventory, so he had enough materials as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are too many samples\u2026\u2026 should I try mixing them as I go along?\u201d</p><br/><p>[How are you going to test the toxicity?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied with a smile at Mystic\u2019s very reasonable question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple, I just need to eat it. Falling Down contains Extreme poison resistance, so if I eat poison, I can train Falling Down as well, isn\u2019t it killing two birds with one stone?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Such a perverse plan. Oh, it\u2019s nothing new since it\u2019s master, I guess\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>First he classified them according to the type of poison they had, and squeezed their carcasses dry of blood. Like that, he acquired a total of several millions liters of blood of a few thousand different types. At that point, Yu IlHan believed in his instinct and just randomly started mixing them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is too weak. This too, and this one is too weak as well\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t throw it on the ground! The fortress is dissolving!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is weak too\u2026\u2026 and hm, is this a little stronger?\u201d</p><br/><p>He put aside the mixtures that showed strong capabilities, then mixed them with each other, and with weaker ones as well. It was literally finding the most toxic poison in the infinite possibilities. Yu IlHan\u2019s work flowed on like that.</p><br/><p>What was shocking was that when he got used to mixing the poisons, his hand movements became absurdly fast!</p><br/><p>[You aren\u2019t normal!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m not normal!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t be so proud of it!]</p><br/><p>Three or four poisons appeared and disappeared every second. The weaker poisons were thrown away, the stronger poison was mass produced, and new poison, with the stronger poison as the base, was produced again.</p><br/><p>There wouldn\u2019t be so many poisons being created and destroyed in a single place throughout the entire history of the universe. No, in the first place, there was no precedent of someone killing so many higher existences with poison in their bodies!</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to see what IlHan was up to and\u2026\u2026 why do I see hell in one part of the Flying fortress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera, I get that you want to watch, but right now I\u2019m busy, so go spar with the others or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tens of thousands of jars of different colored poison boiling alongside each other looked frightening, and Liera approaching him could be said to be an act that required a lot of courage. Even she could not approach him past a certain distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, that thing over there that\u2019s twitching by itself\u2026. is poison right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. It\u2019s just that a strand of life is about to be born in the poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that a small issue!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can stop it, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Monsters being born from mana was a common occurrence, and therefore, monsters being born in highly concentrated mana poison was not rare either. Yu IlHan stirred it to mercilessly trample on the sign of life and drank a ladle of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he inhaled it, a spicy smell that was perhaps what a thousand-year-old mature fart would smell like hit his nose and his larynx, and the strong wave of hot poison that came along with it twitched like an eel and messed up his digestive system.</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan opened his mouth as he couldn\u2019t bear it, a thick green burp came out. A thousand years of love may suddenly disappear when one saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiik.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI give it a 10/10 death points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah of cou-.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was replying, a completely unexpected text appeared on his eyes.</p><br/><p>[You have mastered the skill, Cooking. You are proficient in all kinds of cooking containing magic and mana. Water and fire attribute resistance and attack power increase by 30%.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at the ladle on his hand silently before shrugging his shoulders. Although it was quite surprising, this wasn\u2019t the first time something like this happened if he thought about it. In any case, his ability to come up with poisons increased, and his fire attribute and water attribute controls became stronger as well. So it was a good thing!</p><br/><p>Liera sensed the change that occurred to him and asked him in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, I feel like you\u2019ve become stronger just now\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be frustrated if I say it so I\u2019ll keep it a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, not that anyone would eat poison just because the final element in training the Cooking skill was poison!</p><br/><p>He sent Liera off before combining poison again. And after around three days, he acquired three types of poison that he liked, and made about 20 liters each. Although this was extremely little in quantity compared to what he started with, Yu IlHan thought that this was a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like if I get the affinity right, I may just be able to kill 6th class being with this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The corpses of the Destruction Demon Army are so thin\u2026\u2026 even though they didn\u2019t reach the peaks of their worlds just to become some materials for poison!]</p><br/><p>He created and installed additional traps using the poison on the Flying fortress, and applied poison to most of the blades that existed inside the fortress.</p><br/><p>The evilest part about this poison was that it contained slight hints of magic cooking in it. Normally, it would be worse than any extreme poison, but it would transform as soon as Yu IlHan wished for it and would attack the enemy! Not only could this prevent allies from being killed by the poison, it would also become possible to drive back the enemies efficiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove all, I can deceive the enemies, making them think that this is just some run of the mill ,weak poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re the evilest, master!]</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan\u2019s evil plans had just begun. After he created the poison, he used the dried out bodies of the Destruction Demon Army to reinforce the Flying fortress! As a result, the outer wall of the fortress became stronger, all artifacts became sharper, the weapons in the mansion were reinforced, and the number of traps increased as well.</p><br/><p>Even after all that, there was not much difference in the information about the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill no good\u2026\u2026? The Flying fortress is the first one that made me dance so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You want to transcend the God-rank, right, master? It\u2019s impossible so give it up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I should give up if it\u2019s impossible. But I haven\u2019t tried the impossible until now!]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re being too stubborn!]</p><br/><p>If the Destruction Demon Army didn\u2019t work, then he would only use the remains of higher existences from other factions! He upgraded the Flying fortress using angels, fallen angels, and garden gatekeepers. The already absurd power of the Flying fortress continued to increase.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of 5th class magic stones were added, and the holy region was enhanced as well. Right now, there was no meaning in counting the number of artifacts anymore.</p><br/><p>Despite that, the Flying fortress stayed at God rank.</p><br/><p>[I said it\u2019s impossible.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu IlHan accept reality. Wasn\u2019t even the Heaven\u2019s Army unaware that there was something above God rank? It was no wonder since Yu IlHan, the master of blacksmithing and mana crafting, couldn\u2019t do it either after all this time!</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll give up now, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, now I should\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Muttered Yu IlHan with a depressed voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo the impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you going to tell me that you didn\u2019t do the impossible until now, master!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nodded seriously and raised his hand in the air. At that moment, a body that filled one region of the barrier, appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible refers to a situation where I have to invest this guy\u2019s remains.\u201d</p><br/><p>[,,,,,,My god.]</p><br/><p>That was none other than a Chief Gatekeeper of the Garden of Sunset, Kelatuke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

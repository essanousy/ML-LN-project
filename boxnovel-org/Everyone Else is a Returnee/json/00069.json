The number of abilities the Cross Bag had was now becoming quite shocking.</p><br/><p>The moment those options were added to his Cross Bag, Yu IlHan retrieved the spear he threw and the monster skewered onto it. Just seeing it directly was enough to bring it into the Bag so there was nothing easier than this.</p><br/><p>This, helped Yu IlHan to hunt fast without showing his presence. If something came into his Cross Bag, then it was possible to separate it by category so there was no need for him to pull out the throwing spear himself either.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpears are flying out of nowhere. Dodge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, those spears are only aiming at monsters. It\u2019s an ally!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan was throwing his spears in front of their noses, those people could not notice Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>No matter how great Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment was, this was normally impossible.</p><br/><p>Yes, if Yu IlHan still only had his concealment technique, then this would not be possible.</p><br/><p>[Killing 2nd class with concealment in a surprise attack 3,000/3,000]</p><br/><p>[Killing 3rd class with concealment in a surprise attack 300/300]</p><br/><p>[Acquire a high ranked title related to concealment 1/1]</p><br/><p>[2nd class magic stones 1,000/1,000]</p><br/><p>[3rd class magic stones 100/100]</p><br/><p>[All the materials combine into a single record.]</p><br/><p>[Absorbing record. Concealment skill evolves.]</p><br/><p>It was something that the angels, but thanks to the shadow monsters evolving to 3rd class, Yu IlHan succeeded in fulfilling all the criteria to evolve his concealment skill within the dungeon before he cleaned it up.</p><br/><p>He missed the 2nd class magic stones and the 3rd class magic stones that were used as materials, but as he was assured that he would acquire a tremendous efficiency in using the skill if he evolved it early on, Yu IlHan evolved the skill without hesitation.</p><br/><p>[You have earned the skill, Deathgod. Mana required to use concealment decreases, and the effectiveness of the concealment increases by a large amount. Concealment does not wear off if you kill the enemy in a single strike with a surprise attack. Also, killing enemies consecutively for 5 minutes would increase all abilities by 0.1%. Currently, as level 1, the maximum stack is 50%, and it will dissipate if you do not kill any enemies within 5 minutes. Other abilities will be added if the skill level goes up by a certain amount.]</p><br/><p>[Due to the beta option of the artifact, Black Deathgod\u2019s Dragon-annihilating Spiked spear, all abilities of the deathgod skill increases by 30%.]</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the evolved ability was a passive skill. And the point that it did not hinder him in anyway even though he could not use mana, this could be said to be tailor-made for him. It was truly a suitable ability for the evolved concealment ability, while at the same time, it was a skill that affected the battle a lot.</p><br/><p>Just that, there was no meaning to the skill when fighting one strong enemy, and instead, it was suitable when fighting many weak enemies. This was the only lacking point.</p><br/><p>However, on this battlefield, this was very effective.</p><br/><p>\u201cOMG, the throwing spear just went past my head.!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree died at once again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bodies of the monsters skewered by the spear are disappearing! Sh, shit. Just what the hell is happening\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had killed all his enemies with a single strike of his throwing spear, Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment never wore off. Nobody noticed him even when he shot the spear from right in front of them! Yu IlHan found fun in this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is comfortable and nice\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[A horrifying skill had evolved to become a terrifying skill, but seeing you rampage around thanks to that makes me feel quite weird.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Wow, he killed 200 in an instant.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Flying type monsters were already wiped out in this place. The moment Yu IlHan realized that, he changed targets to the monsters on the ground, and in less than 15 minutes, the 2nd class monsters on the ground were all cleanly exterminated as well. The deathgod skill had become level 3.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I should move locations. I want to clean up as much as possible while the moon is up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026I think you\u2019ll instakill them even without the moon.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Confirming that all his throwing spears and the monster bodies were in his Cross bag, Yu Ilhan nodded and left the place to find another area where monsters were rampaging. This place only had 1st class monsters which were weaker than the humans here. Although, both humans and monsters were shivering in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, so scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScarier than monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHic, hiccup.\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kuooooo\u2026\u2026}</p><br/><p>A city legend had come about. (T/N: This would be \u2018toshi densetsu\u2019 in JP)</p><br/><p>Kanagawa prefecture, Tokyo city, Chiba prefecture. These were the battlefield zones between monsters and humans. Of course, It wasn\u2019t like monsters were proliferating throughout all of Tokyo and Chiba, but if the battle went on like this, it wouldn\u2019t take a long time until it did.</p><br/><p>Amongst these areas, the area where the foreign delegate ability users were focused on was naturally Tokyo. No one could say which area was not important but rather than Kanagawa, where it was already in ruins, Tokyo, which still had a lot of intact facilities and dungeons left, had more chances of recovery. Using the same reason, Chiba had a higher priority than Kanagawa.</p><br/><p>Truly cruel, but the people all treated Kanagawa as a thrown chess piece and were focusing to not let the monsters spread out from that area.</p><br/><p>First, they would stop the proliferation, then would exterminate while closing in. Although this was the natural course of action to block the Dungeon Wave, what of Kanagawa? It would naturally reach an irreparable state after being trampled on by monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit. The American and French reinforcements are also concentrated on Tokyo and Chiba?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUs too, there are orders to join the Tokyo defense line. Kanagawa was completely abandoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since everyone on Earth were now ability users, many high level personnel had their hometowns in Kanagawa, and there were even two clans that represented Kanagawa as well. In the first place, considering just the population, Kanagawa didn\u2019t lose out to Tokkyo and Osaka.</p><br/><p>These two clans all burned in ambition to become a global clan when they were founded, but currently, they were put in a position where they had to defend their clans on the line.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they planning to abandon a city whenever something occurs? Fuck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove! Fucking monkeys!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat. Make the guys at the front retreat to the defense line!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Odawara city of Kanagawa prefecture, a battle full of despair was occurring.</p><br/><p>The group of devil monkeys that vexed people by jumping around every single place that looked like it could be used as a hiding place, used the all buildings, whether intact or in ruins, as their fortress and hunted humans that wandered around between them.</p><br/><p>Their levels were between 65 and 80. Currently, no matter how elite an ability user was, it was slightly taxing to fight 1 on 1. As such, casualties were rapidly increasing as well.</p><br/><p>{Kiik!}</p><br/><p>\u201cKwaaak! C, captain!\u201d(T/N: \u201cTaichou!\u201d)</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, Tamura!\u201d (T/N: \u201cKusouuuu!\u201d)</p><br/><p>A colleague that was just grumbling about the situation right now right next to him, flew into the air after he was snatched by the enormous monkeys with huge grip power.</p><br/><p>It would be the end once they were caught! The man called captain tried to grab his colleague\u2019s body but the next moment, a throwing spear that flew out of nowhere broke the devil monkey\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man opened his eyes wide while rescuing his colleague that was falling behind. He had not felt any signs anywhere. However, as soon as the throwing spear and the devil monkey fell down, they disappeared immediately.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 486,989 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 66 Devil Monkey.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it possible that I don\u2019t see anyone close to level 60?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, Yu IlHan muttered with a sigh while passing by the man. In his hand was the atlatl that already had another throwing spear loaded onto it.</p><br/><p>[I should\u2019ve told you that becoming 2nd class was also something permitted to a select few.](Erta)</p><br/><p>[This isn\u2019t something we can do something about. The Akashic Record is strict.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet 100 won that the Akashic Record will appear as the last boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s fortunate that you\u2019ve only bet 100 won. Akashic Record has no physical power.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Even while chatting with the angels, Yu IlHan kept shooting out spears without rest. If he was unlucky, he would only kill one; normally, he would kill two; quite often, he would kill three; if he was lucky, he would kill four at once and they all left the world after being pierced by his spear.</p><br/><p>{Kiiiik!}</p><br/><p>{Kuik, Kiik!}</p><br/><p>The devil monkeys didn\u2019t know who was attacking them, but they knew that they were being attacked. They tried to hide their bodies behind a cover, or tried to dodge with their fast movements, but all were for naught.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 690,983 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned 675,938 experience.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s throwing spear was accurate, fast, and strong. The throwing spears that became stronger by 40% due to the effect of moonlight, killed the devil monkeys even if it had to go through a concrete wall. The walls of the building that made them fearful became meaningless.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt barely got to Lv 75, but just how many of them do I need to kill if I want to level up with that experience? About 3 thousand?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Normally, people level up by killing those 3 thousand. That is also why levelling up is slow too\u2026.. No, the other people wouldn\u2019t receive additional experience due to a title\u2019s effect, so they would kill 4 thousand normally.](Erta)</p><br/><p>3 hours had passed since Yu IlHan had commenced the hunt. He had already cleaned up 5 districts similar in size to Odawara city, but he did not level up even once. Even though he was killing only 2nd class monsters!</p><br/><p>If there was any consolation, then it was that he had earned at least hundred of 2nd class magic stones. Since he had to consume an enormous quantity of them while evolving the concealment skill, he felt good whenever a 2nd class monster\u2019s body entered his Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>And the survivors of Odawara were looking at that absentmindedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fucking monkeys all\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. Am I seeing 1 killed every second? Just what were we doing until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary, it\u2019s scary, but\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Throwing spears kept flying everywhere, but they did not know where they were coming from. However, they were all skewering monsters that threatened humans.</p><br/><p>It was honestly a scary scene, but to the humans that were standing on the ground ravated by the monsters, it also felt quite refreshing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod must have become enraged.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, God must have descended after being enraged by the monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo, Susanoo has descended!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had just thrown a few spears, but he had now become the God of Storms that appeared in Japanese mythology. Of course, his techniques could be considered a storm since it ravaged all the monsters nearby, but honestly, it was an embarrassing title.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, should I fire myself up a little more?\u201d</p><br/><p>[So it seems like you like this title more than LA\u2019s Dark Knight or Sungdaein Bolt.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Bullseye. Although it\u2019s a from a different country, isn\u2019t it still a God? Even a whale would dance when praised. Now, he felt like he could dance a Samba.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who had become slightly delighted, started increasing the rate of throwing his spears. If the people mistook him for Susanoo, then he would live up to their expectations and overwhelm them!</p><br/><p>Until the moon set and the sun rose that day, Yu IlHan cleaned up all the 2nd class monsters, or those close to it, in about 30 districts. To put it in another way, he had conquered half of Kanagawa prefecture by himself.</p><br/><p>A truly amazing achievement. There was no way this had not become an issue.</p><br/><p>The survivors all rejoiced, became shocked, and feared while talking about the incident, and various SNS were already flooded about stories of the Storm God Susanoo that had descended on Japan.</p><br/><p>Absolute power that nobody can notice.</p><br/><p>Although this sounded like nonsense, since it had happened for real right in front of people\u2019s eyes, it couldn\u2019t be refuted. Some said that a real God had descended to a lower real, but the majority thought that this was also a type of monster that would threaten humanity.</p><br/><p>And, those that belonged to neither, for example, people like the master of the Lightning God clan, Kang MiRae, and the strong ability users of the humanity side all thought this.</p><br/><p>That an absurdly strong guy that would threaten their debut stages had appeared!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>My little brother told me that I\u2019m a deathgod/reaper otaku after reading this. Hm\u2026 I also think the same. It became like this after I pondered on what to use for the skill name T^T. The deathgod skill is still level 1, so various characteristics are planned to be added as it grows!</p><br/><p>Since it was the Japanese that was naming him, I naturally had to use someone from Japanese mythology, and I pondered on what to use between Storm God Susanoo, and the War God Takemikazuchi, and in the end, I chose Susanoo.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Is Susanoo really the Storm God and Takemikazuchi the War God? If anyone has better alternatives, I will try to use them (I usually can\u2019t be bothered to change)</p><br/><p>Also, what do people think of the Japanese romaji in T/N? Should I replace the original with the Japanese romaji for single words like Taichou and Kusou? (This would feel quite weird since I would have to translate from Korean to Japanese romaji)</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even now, hundreds of wolves, regardless of their affiliation, died every second. The time it took for hundreds of dead wolves to become thousands, and thousands to become tens of thousands was a matter of moments.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Aaaaaah\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuesad, even Quesad is dead. We cannot kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wolf corpses immediately went into Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory upon death, so all that remained on the white, snowy plains were footprints and traces of blood. Yu IlHan used the snowy plains as the canvas, dragon bone spears as the brush, and blood of the wolves as ink to paint a masterpiece of devastation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh goddammit. The headache\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[You really have an exceptional sense of spatial recognition. I think you\u2019d do well with magic too.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is enough. Gate of B-\u201d1</p><br/><p>[Stop right there!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>As he had begun with killing the low levelled ones, it was a difficult task to find any more 2nd class wolves. As such, he had to change tactics, and what he came up with was to throw more than one spear at those he couldn\u2019t kill with a single strike!</p><br/><p>Doing that, his killing speed decreased but his concealment would not wear off, and since his concealment would not wear off, the skill, Deathgod, was kept active. It was killing two birds with one stone. (P/R: Seems more like two birds with four stones though\u2026)</p><br/><p>Just as Yu IlHan was growing in regards to the application of inventory in actual combat, the 4th class wolves who bore witness to the disaster that rained upon their kin, fell deep into despair and became enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlemir! If you hadn\u2019t killed Ikedka, we could have ripped apart that damned human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are no longer a wolfkin. Even if you kill that human, it does not mean victory for the wolfkin. Also\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Flemir could not find any target to vent his rage so he clenched his teeth while facing against the DD-wolves who were growling at him.</p><br/><p>He had watched as Quesad, the strongest wolfkin in Kiroa, being easily put to death by a human. Despite the fact that it was only possible because his ally, Kiana, had seriously injured it with her life as the tradeoff, Flemir did not believe that he could have killed Quesad even under the same conditions.</p><br/><p>No, he would have become incapacitated with the first kick. Also, the spear strike that preceded Quesad\u2019s final moments\u2026 honestly, he wasn\u2019t even able to see it properly.</p><br/><p>That human, had power at a level unbelievable for a human. It was hard for him to believe that this guy was from the same \u2018human race\u2019 that once lived in Kiroa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dragon\u2019s father\u2026\u2026. He does have the qualifications.\u2019</p><br/><p>Flemir just closed his eyes. He already knew what went wrong for everything to become like this.</p><br/><p>Requesting an alliance with the humans on Earth? Trying to deceive him?</p><br/><p>No. From the moment they tried to use Earth in order to save themselves, this ending was set in stone.</p><br/><p>What could I do? What do I need to do? Is the princess safe? Perhaps the other humans are killing all the black wolves like that human? Will I be able to survive this predicament?</p><br/><p>Countless questions flashed through his head and despair creeped into his heart. Meanwhile, an extremely small noise could be heard right next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKKaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning his head, he witnessed a scene where the neck of one of the surviving DD-wolves being slashed, and its corpse pitifully falling onto the ground. The figure of the human disaster was also there. He couldn\u2019t kill it instantly due to there being no critical hit this time.</p><br/><p>Although, that wolf died immediately after he dealt a few more strikes using his Spear of Untraceable Trajectory!</p><br/><p>[You have earned 820,224,008 experience.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaaaaaah\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, there are only 2 more 4th classes left \u2013 Yu IlHan muttered to himself and retracted his spear when the wolf-man next to Flemir, ran while howling like a madman.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaoooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Noticing its movement, Yu IlHan quickly threw his spear, but as if having predicted it, that guy transformed into wolf form from the humanoid form and the spear missed.</p><br/><p>[So they have methods to turn back into wolves!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be sooo happy to have acquired new knowledge, huh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, Yu IlHan threw his spear again. It did hit its target, but it was nowhere near enough to give a fatal wound, and the wolf did not even think about fighting back and disappeared into the gate with a spear stuck on its ass.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Is that guy really a 4th class?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s also the first time I\u2019ve seen such a shameless 4th class\u2026\u2026.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought about chasing it, but thinking back to what he messaged the Empress before, he shook his head. If she used his giant spears, she would have plenty of chances to kill that wolf. Moreover, since he put a spear on its hind, she wouldn\u2019t miss that either.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was time for mankind to experience and overcome 4th classes. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t protect them forever! Only when humanity suffered as a whole did Yu IlHan\u2019s humanity strengthening project have a meaning!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan killed the wolves that were throwing themselves into the gate and collecting his spears, he talked to Flemir.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you following it? You have a reason to, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though his current multi-tasking had a tremendous impact on his brain, his facial expression was cold and firm any ripples.</p><br/><p>As he had experience reading several books at once in order to read them faster, perhaps that \u2018training\u2019 might have helped him out.</p><br/><p>[Such an idiotic method of training\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t read my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Erta and Yu IlHan\u2019s leisurely banter was about to continue, Flemir opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you knew after all?\u201d</p><br/><p>A word containing a sense of futility without any emotions. Yu IlHan naturally nodded his head. More than a hundred wolves died yet again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I have udon noodles for my brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be. I can just kill them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flicking his hand again, a baptism of dragon bones fell once again. Since the remaining monsters were only the elites , the monsters that were killed due to the vertically falling spears were only around 1/10. In other words, tens out of hundreds died every round.</p><br/><p>\u201cEii!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having calculated the delay of his control and the actual results from his inventory through using remote collection continuously, Yu IlHan now bundled tens of spears in sets of smaller but quicker barrages.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaoooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the monsters that avoided the fist strike could not continuously dodge the shower of spears that were falling on them as if having read their movement trajectories. The 3rd class wolves that finally learned the trick to dodging all fairly met their deaths yet again. Now, there were less than 20 thousand wolves remaining even after counting every single wolf.</p><br/><p>[Aah, that horrifying skill is being developed further.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Regardless of Erta\u2019s despair, Yu IlHan\u2019s spear rain did not end. Monsters continued dying with no end in sight.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment had long since worn off, but the monsters did not even attack him. They could only helplessly fling their bodies towards the gate in order to survive.</p><br/><p>They were all the same regardless of black or red. True unity was achieved. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t care about that though. He only decided to believe in the humans that should be fighting beyond the gate.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a delightful message popped up on his retina.</p><br/><p>[You have become level 140. 2 Strength, 1 Agility, 1 Health, 1 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling his strength, agility, health and magic increasing, Yu IlHan was delighted.</p><br/><p>He really did feel frustrated. He wiped out wolves on the scale of hundreds of thousands that fought with their destiny of their world on the line, but he only leveled up thrice! Of course, unlike Dareu, the majority were weak, and he did that within a single day, but even so!</p><br/><p>However, just as Yu IlHan was about to raise his hand after leaving his joy aside, Flemir prostrated himself on the ground.2</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease forgive us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot let the wolfkin go extinct like this, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too different from the dragons he allied with, and the elves who served him as their emperor? In the first place, these guys had made the humans go extinct of their own will, even though the Destruction Demon Army had been pulling the strings.</p><br/><p>And regardless of where they belonged to, they thought of Earth as their prey. Double the sin. Execution.</p><br/><p>Above all, decisively,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the hell should I believe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a method!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone other than Flemir shouted. Hearing the clear female voice, Yu IlHan tilted his head while turning it, and could see a black-haired woman who stood there.</p><br/><p>Furry black wolf ears could be seen on the head, and despite the leather and metal armor, the glamorous body line couldn\u2019t be hidden. Especially around the chest area which was tightened by the sturdy metal armor and looked stuffy as hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cP, princess!? How!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here myself, Flemir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!\u201d</p><br/><p>From how Flemir, who was horrible at acting, was calling her princess with a panicked expression, it seemed this girlie was indeed the wolfkin princess. From how she said that she came here herself, it seemed also true that she had gone over to Earth, and came back here to Kiroa.</p><br/><p>However\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan had some questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were only wolves on the other side other than Flemir, though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmong the wolfkin, those who have received the baptism of the moon can freely change between their humanoid and wolven forms. I am one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess answered, and Yu IlHan acknowledged his mistake. He was mistaken since only the 4th class ones had humanoid forms, but it seemed it wasn\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that only 4th classes could change to humanoid forms, but the correct answer should be something along the lines of \u2018there is a higher chance of becoming a 4th class after gaining the ability to transform into humanoid form through the baptism of the moon\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, why did you come over knowing that it\u2019s more dangerous here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have predicted one thing after seeing that both wolfkin and those tempted by the Destruction Demon Army, were charging out in fear from the gate from the other side. Moreover, I could be sure after seeing Melod\u2026\u2026.the poor wolf that was tempted by the Destruction Demon Army, coming out of the gate as if trying to run away from something; that you were enraged, and decided to destroy the wolfkin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps due to being royalty, it seemed her head was quite a bit better than Flemir\u2019s. And so, she came back to Kiroa, when she was supposed to be hiding on Earth, since she saw that the wolfkin were about to go extinct, and she had wanted to prevent that.</p><br/><p>For a royalty, she had quite a good sense of responsibility. Although, there were less than a third of the wolfkin left.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are more royalties, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone. I\u2019m the only survivor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his hand. At that moment, Flemir desperately lowered his head while shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let the princess go! I will do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need any of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about all of the wolfkin! Rule over the surviving wolfkin!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the shout was from the princess. Such a kind heart for her people. Yu IlHan laughed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, and I don\u2019t need you guys either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will make you be able to believe us! And there will definitely come a day where you will need our help!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if retorting, Yu IlHan flicked his fingers after hearing the princess\u2019s confident words.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of dragon bone spears rained once again, but this time, only towards the red wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that scene, the princess sighed in relief. However, Yu IlHan flicked his fingers again and asked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? How will you make me believe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The princess answered,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve overheard the elves talking; that you have the skill \u2018Rule\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why are you guys talking about that! \u2013 Yu IlHan swore at the elves, when the princess declared confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you rule over my life using the skill, then all wolfkin will have no choice but to obey you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to her words, Yu IlHan thought.</p><br/><p>Huh? I think I\u2019ve seen this scenario somewhere before.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Aaaand, the meaning of the title is revealed.</p><br/><p>IlHan\u2019s battling methods will change in the future as well since he will make new weapons according to the enemy! Wait, isn\u2019t this the first time he attacked by pouring out spears from his inventory!?</p><br/><p>At this point, some of you may have noticed the bait this author has scattered at the very beginning of the story. Perhaps some of you who may have re-read the whole thing recently have realized. Well, it\u2019s a childish joke though!</p><br/><p>This novel is not an R-18 novel. Just saying this just in case someone will say something in the comments!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>I believe \u2018Cheer pack\u2019 is a company name\u2026 They make \u2018drinking pouches\u2019.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m keeping \u2018wolfkin\u2019 cuz the original word uses the same format as \u2018dragonkin\u2019.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know that \u2018gate of babylon\u2019 meant until people told me in discord\u2026 and I guess\u2026. MC\u2019s cleaning weapon is indeed similar\u2026 but\u2026 He can only attack vertically down, so it technically isn\u2019t the same.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

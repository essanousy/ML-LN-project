If the world was normal, everyone should be sleeping, but to those belonging to Guundia that had to guard against monsters 24/7, this naturally didn\u2019t apply to them.</p><br/><p>There were lights in various parts of the fortress, and the guards could not help but put up their guard against Yu IlHan and the Guardian fortress that appeared out of nowhere due to Yu IlHan cancelling his concealment, even though they knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to win against him.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good atmosphere.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen such a scene in movies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll wipe out all the monsters before coming back, why are they still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Would darling rest easy if some complete stranger suddenly appeared and said they\u2019ll wipe out all the higher existence factions, including the Heaven\u2019s Army, for you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad because you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought they might not even open the gates, but perhaps there was a separate order from Han YeoRang, as he could enter without any resistance. Of course, he could not stop them from whispering about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. He has such beauties by his side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, my.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul blossomed into a smile after hearing the word \u2018beauty\u2019. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t bother reacting to her. In fact, he was worried that Heli\u00e8na may show her power and cause a mess, but it seemed like she planned to hide her vicious and violent magic power.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Major-General, and\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lead by the soldiers, he was taken to where Major-General Yoon and Han YeoRang was. Han YeoRang had an imposing aura about her despite wearing tattered armor, and the dignity of a leader could be seen from her. Even after seeing Kim YeSeul and Heli\u00e8na, she did not back down and greeted Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cColonel Han YeoRang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang\u2019s firm voice sounded very natural to Yu IlHan. Well, in the first place, there was no relationship between the two at all. If any, it was between a weapons trader and customer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that Colonel Han is safe as well. I did erase all the monsters for now\u2026\u2026 but it\u2019s not like the world has stabilized, so I cannot be sure when an uprising may occur again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026That is plenty amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>What expression was Han YeoRang supposed to make when Yu IlHan mentioned massacring all the monsters in the world like pulling out weeds from his backyard? Although she already knew this as she heard from Yoon DaeHan, she once again felt the tremendous gap in worlds that they lived in. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even know what kind of thoughts she had and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I planned to take Colonel Han and all the members of Suppression back to Earth. Right now, the Earth is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I have heard everything. It\u2019s developing at a rapid pace, and may even evolve to a higher world in the near future\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was good that there was no need for additional explanation. Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I feel that Colonel Han is a very important figure in this place. Of course, if you wish for it, I\u2019ll take you back to Earth\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head without hesitation. It was exactly as Yu IlHan foresaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as there are people who believe in me, I cannot run away to Earth alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should not be considered as running away. The environment of Earth is harsher than this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is you, Mr. Yu IlHan. Just with that one fact alone, Earth will be much safer than this world, as well as a more productive place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The exaggerated evaluation made him shiver. However, just then, Han YeoRang dropped a bigger bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u2026 can you not accept us all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan questioned if he heard wrong, but the reply was the same.</p><br/><p>The surviving members in this fort only numbers 30 thousand. Right now, we have it tough just surviving, and even if we do survive and live on\u2026\u2026 we do not have much hope in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not deny that. Fighting against monsters, and preparing for war whenever they could \u2013 that could not be called \u2018life\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut an entire 30 thousand people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will make our settlement by ourselves. There are plenty of land on Earth without an owner right now. I just want to receive your protection, Mr. Yu IlHan. I want to stay where your eyes can reach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t reply and only looked at Yoon DaeHan. However, just as when he thought that he would help him persuade Han YeoRang, Yoon DaeHan instead tried to persuade him</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve decided already. If you permit it, everyone will follow you back to Earth, Mr. Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou simply do not know what a higher world signifies. Didn\u2019t I say that Earth will become a warzone? It will become a battlefield of beings with absurd power that cannot be compared to the monsters in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, we have thought that it is better than drying ourselves out to death in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026How can you possibly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not understand what these people were thinking at all. However, Kim YeSeul had a satisfied smile all this time, and Heli\u00e8na also giggled.</p><br/><p>[It really is interesting. Darling is witnessing why humankind can only bring themselves to destruction. Even though they\u2019re struggling to escape the current status quo, they\u2019re running in a worse direction, thinking that new things will be better!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no different from you Destruction Demon Army guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my, is that really so? The objective of the Destruction Demon Army, is literally destruction, darling. Destruction that swallows everything up, even themselves. That\u2019s why the Destruction Demon Army is not going against their raison d\u2019\u00eatre.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really are screwed up.\u201d</p><br/><p>[However, darling is different from those things.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s seductive smile tried to grab Yu IlHan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>[Darling isn\u2019t planning to let Earth run to meet its maker, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is what I hope to do, but well, yeah. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Right? People are attracted to your power that makes your beliefs into reality. Receiving the servitude of the inferior as the great one, it\u2019s a natural thing.]</p><br/><p>And as such, as long as they believed and followed Yu IlHan, they did not pick the wrong head \u2013 was this what she meant? It was really complicated.</p><br/><p>[Fufufu, how can your pondering face be so cute too\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pushed away Heli\u00e8na\u2019s face that closed in on his without hesitation, but his hand lacked some strength. Heli\u00e8na recognized that and a smile hung on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, then. 30 thousand people. We shall all go to Earth. It\u2019s not that hard anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang\u2019s expression darkened after seeing Heli\u00e8na, who had a might incomparable to hers, acting cute towards Yu IlHan, but as soon as his permission was given, she smiled brightly as if she never had a dark expression and bowed towards him. The her that acted upon emotions did not exist anymore.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan walked up to the walls of the fort with his companions. A slow ringing bell resounded out, alarm magic activated, and the ones that collapsed due to the fatigue of battle all woke up and walked outside. When all members, including the non-combatants, gathered below the wall, Han YeoRang raised her voice and declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now! We! Shall go to Earth! It\u2019s the place I was born on, and it\u2019s the place where a Supreme being rules!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loud cheers filled the place. Supreme being referred to him? Yu IlHan became dejected. However, the reaction of the people was filled with vitality, and he didn\u2019t have any strength to refute that statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go immediately. Everyone gets on board. We shall all go at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis many members\u2026\u2026 all at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>He warped to Earth many times already. No matter how many people he brought, it didn\u2019t use that much mana. Yu IlHan dispelled the barrier on the Guardian fortress, and let every remaining survivor of this world into the fortress. Then, he put the crucial items into his inventory.</p><br/><p>Everyone got on board the fortress. The abandoned fort, the abandoned lands, the abandoned skies. Yu IlHan muttered while looking at Guundia that were devoid of monsters, and will also be devoid of humans very soon</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will happen to such a world?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Well? It will probably stay abandoned forever, no? It\u2019s not like mana has disappeared so monsters will keep appearing, but they will only go through a cycle of appearance, disappearance, and destruction, so there will be no future for this world.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps that has the same meaning of a world where time no longer flows\u2026\u2026. The world where everything has stopped. It\u2019s an unfortunate thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul Muttered, she felt sadness from Heli\u00e8na\u2019s words. However, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s words hadn\u2019t ended yet.</p><br/><p>[But, but you know? If it\u2019s darling, you might be able to change that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Do you want me to come to this world and regularly clean up the monsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No, no, darling. You\u2019re subordinating the mankind of this world under Earth.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026fufu, the rest is a secret. If it\u2019s darling, you\u2019ll find out in no time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na looked at Yu IlHan after speaking. It was a familiar gaze for Yu IlHan. It was very similar to how Liera looked at him normally. He licked his lips as if about to say something, but eventually decided not to.</p><br/><p>He felt like he fell into a swamp the more he faced this woman. She was a being that denied his views and standards of action in a straightforward manner.</p><br/><p>Her very being was against the natural law. Was it because she was from the Destruction Demon Army? Even though he said that there was a need to control and restrain her by her side, perhaps it was his mistake to come with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll depart for Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth, what kind of a world would it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a world ruled by someone with overwhelming might. It will be much harsher than here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026 but a different life will be waiting for us there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Han YeoRang is with us. We have nothing to fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Belief in Han YeoRang, as well as the admiration for the Supreme being \u2013 these two were strongly embedded in the people\u2019s minds. Even while thinking that they were doing everything in vain, Yu IlHan activated the Warp skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they arrived on Earth after leaping over the dimensional wall, the ones onboard the Guardian fortress all burst out in exclamation. Thick foliage everywhere, as well as absurdly high cliffs!</p><br/><p>A tunnel made of seawater that connected the land and the skies. Numerous stone islands inside the tunnel of seawater and bridges of rainbow that connected the islands! It was like the land of paradise!</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo beautiful\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world was created by the ruler?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked towards Yu IlHan in shock. Han YeoRang was no exception. Even though she had become adept at controlling her reactions, she couldn\u2019t help but regain her girly emotions in front of such a spectacle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, Mr. IlHan\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan laughed dryly. He couldn\u2019t say that he was the most shocked out of all of them.</p><br/><p>He had to work on the stabilization of Earth.</p><br/><p>Before Earth completely leapt into becoming a higher world, right now! Immediately!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

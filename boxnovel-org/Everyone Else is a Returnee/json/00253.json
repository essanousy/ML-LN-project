I\u2019m\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m at full power!]</p><br/><p>At the same time she said that, Heli\u00e8na spread out her aura to the surroundings. Everyone in the battlefield who could not completely overcome her aura swayed.</p><br/><p>[Kugh\u2026\u2026Khaaaaaaaaarh!]</p><br/><p>[Kihigh, Heli\u00e8na\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The gigantic armored shark messed up the Army of Brilliant Light against its will despite its enormous power, due to Heli\u00e8na\u2019s pheromones, and Nati\u00e8re was in an identical situation, in the regard that she could not make rational decisions. Controlling the opposite sex, and destroying the reason of the same sex \u2013 the power that still applied even on the same league!</p><br/><p>[But why do you not love me!?]</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t reached 7th class with just 6th class stats for nothing. With regards to mental and psychological magic, she was the strongest!</p><br/><p>Was there a 7th class that could face her head on? Would the Heaven\u2019s Army\u2019s Battalion Commander be able to go against her magic and rip her wings off?</p><br/><p>At least, the Heaven\u2019s Army didn\u2019t think so. Even though Spiera had reported to her higher-ups multiple times despite her chaotic mental state, the Heaven\u2019s Army did not send a Battalion Commander. She also despaired after a few minutes.</p><br/><p>[Yes, for the Heaven\u2019s Army, it\u2019d be better for these guys to exhaust each other out.]</p><br/><p>[That means\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[There is nothing we can do here. It will be for the best if we can retreat like this, but\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The majority of the angels had fallen for Heli\u00e8na\u2019s charm except for herself and a few others, and were fighting each other. Retreat? Was that even possible? As the leader of this small group, she couldn\u2019t flee by herself.</p><br/><p>[Spiera-nim\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Resolve yourselves. The grace that Heaven has given us, it\u2019s time to pay them back by burning our souls, kugh!]</p><br/><p>However, even when she tried to erect her willpower straight, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s magic was trying to pollute her. How unreasonable and violent of an ability was this? She subconsciously clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>[The efforts and power I\u2019ve built up all my life is collapsing thanks to a single Succubus. \u2026.. Kraaaaar!]</p><br/><p>[Nati\u00e8re!]</p><br/><p>[Kugh, this dumb shark is completely doomed!]</p><br/><p>The Heaven\u2019s Army and the Army of Brilliant Light were rapidly losing their battle power, and the Battalion Commanders Kelatuke and Nati\u00e8re were also expending each other\u2019s mana! A single Succubus Queen was toying around with everyone on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>[Here, look at me, LOOK.AT.ME!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re noisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well, other than Yu IlHan\u2019s group that is.</p><br/><p>[How? Am I not lovely? How! Huh? HOW!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re not my type\u2026. Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a laid back reply, he handed his helmet backwards. Liera, who received the helmet, looked at Yu IlHan with worried eyes for a little, but eventually put it on Erta who was having the hardest time among them. And magically, Erta\u2019s shaking stopped right then.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is this helm\u2026\u2026 oh, it\u2019s one of Yu IlHan\u2019s crafts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you accept it with just that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan. Just what are you darling? Just what did you do to become like that?]</p><br/><p>The Succubus Queen didn\u2019t seem to be interested in the scenes of tragedy occurring in the background, that she had caused, and only focused on Yu IlHan. The screams and exclamations of despair were ringing out like a BGM, and she asked Yu IlHan several times.</p><br/><p>[No one, not even our mighty Ruler, was completely free from my charm. However, darling is just a lower existence. Was that helmet a bluff? Is there still a hidden artifact?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Really? There\u2019s really nothing like that?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na glistened her eyes as she approached Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan thought for a moment, but eventually decided that it was better to not kill her now.</p><br/><p>It was just a simple logic of rock-paper-scissors. Yu IlHan had no confidence to kill the other 7th class Battalion Commanders, but Heli\u00e8na could make the two self-destruct. And Heli\u00e8na herself, could not win against him. Then, it would be the wisest to use her to stall her for time and make the battle as advantageous to him as possible.</p><br/><p>The only thing that tugged at his mind in this situation was the Heaven\u2019s Army, and looking at them, they also looked like they would self-destruct any time soon.</p><br/><p>The fact that Spiera was amidst of them made Yu IlHan feel weird\u2026\u2026 but he shook his head. By killing Echjar and saving Spiera, he had done all he could for her and set his heart straight. Since he had decided to depart with the Heaven\u2019s Army completely, he could not do something foolish and end up not being able to protect the others just because of them.</p><br/><p>[Darling, look at me. Don\u2019t look at the others.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na was still stuck to Yu IlHan. However, it wasn\u2019t like the others were free from her. The endless stream of mana that came out of her did not let them go.</p><br/><p>No, in fact, she was even absorbing the mana from the ones charmed by her!</p><br/><p>[Darling, tell me more about yourself. Open your heart a little more.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no intention to join the Destruction Demon Army nor do I have anything to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m only curious. Just what did you experience for your heart to be frozen over\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m open to guesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, Heli\u00e8na also noticed that Yu IlHan was stalling for time. Even that he was trying to weaken the other 7th class Battalion Commanders using her! Despite that, she did not stop using her power. She was set on thinking about how to make Yu IlHan hers.</p><br/><p>[Is it because your heart is full already? Then\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>But at one moment, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s gaze switched from Yu IlHan and looked at Liera, Na YuNa and Erta.</p><br/><p>[Do I just need to clean those girls up first?]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately picked up his spear once he heard that. Hell blossomed on the tip of his spear and spread to his body and Yumir\u2019s back and ruled over a certain region of space. The skill he activated was Falling Down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can only switch my plans too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyak, finally a reaction! Yes, that\u2019s it!]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na did not plan to give up on Yu IlHan at all. The reason she tried threatening his companions was also to create a gap in Yu IlHan\u2019s heart to charm him.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan had no more intentions on having a staring contest with her. The reason he was laid back until now was because Heli\u00e8na\u2019s attention was all focused on him. It was a completely different matter if she switched her attention to his companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss YuNa, please buff me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was waiting for this~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera and Erta, please block this woman\u2019s attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, I\u2019ll move a little faster from now. Synchronizing with dad, you can do it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah!]</p><br/><p>He activated God Force to enhance his body muscles beyond their limits and gripped on the Eight-tailed dragon spear. Despite that, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s expression was still as laid back as ever. Even while knowing that Yu IlHan\u2019s heart was closed shut, she had confidence in her power.</p><br/><p>[I have no intentions on attacking you, darling, but why are you bullying me? You like me better than those things, no?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHah.\u201d</p><br/><p>All men are hers \u2013 this was the fact that she had treated as the unsullied \u2018truth\u2019 for tens of thousands of years. There was no way she could accept that it was broken. This was Heli\u00e8na\u2019s biggest mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo words don\u2019t work on you. No, you didn\u2019t have any intentions to have a conversation with anyone until now. Since activating your power would suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your eyes became scary. Are you really going to pierce me with that spear? Do you want to bind me with these chains?]</p><br/><p>The soulflame chains will not work on this succubus. Her charm was effective even against thought-souls! If he tried to forcibly use them, then the power would backlash at him.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who instinctively realized this, clicked his tongue and put away the soulflame chains, and instead, covered his spear in stronger flames. The translucent flames increased in temperature under the control of Eternal Flame.</p><br/><p>[Really? Are you really going to\u2026\u2026 Kyak!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s spear slicked past Heli\u00e8na. It wasn\u2019t that the charm had disrupted the trajectory, but that at the moment he struck, she condensed her magic power and shot it to deflect the spear\u2019s trajectory. Yu IlHan\u2019s Record skill activated to record Heli\u00e8na\u2019s mana pattern that she just used. He wouldn\u2019t be fooled by the same technique again.</p><br/><p>[You attacked me.]</p><br/><p>Muttered Heli\u00e8na while touching the slight burn that appeared on her shoulder as she couldn\u2019t completely dodge that attack. Rather than the fact that she was injured by a lower existence, she seemed more shocked by the fact that Yu IlHan had attacked her.</p><br/><p>[You really attacked me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, Mir!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it!]</p><br/><p>Now that he didn\u2019t need to stall for time any longer, he could not hang out with her childish acts. Regardless of Heli\u00e8na\u2019s reaction, Yu IlHan poised himself once again, and synced his breath with Yumir and charged once again, to pierce with the Spear of Untraceable Trajectory with his full power.</p><br/><p>[Kyak!]</p><br/><p>[Hick!]</p><br/><p>[Eeeeek! I hate you!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, as he had expected Heli\u00e8na had exceptional talent not only in regards to mental magic, but all kinds of skills that required wielding mana. Seeing her dodge Yu IlHan\u2019s strike that could instantly kill dragons with magic with varying mana patterns and their applications that Yu IlHan had never seen before, he could not help but be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Record, has become level 47.]</p><br/><p>However, that also became a good stimulus for Yu IlHan who had not experienced difficulties for a long time. Facing off the Succubus Queen that lived for tens of thousands of years allowed him to see what he couldn\u2019t before just by swinging his spear, and saw a path that he could not walk on!</p><br/><p>[The skill, Record, has become level 48.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, God Force, has become level 12.]</p><br/><p>[So you really are attacking me straight on. Without any hesitation, with the intent to kill me\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHhp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring her shock and exclamation, he fought her for an unknown amount of time afterwards, and finally, a repeated pattern appeared. Yu IlHan did not miss that opportunity and pierced ten times at once, and those strikes created holes on Heli\u00e8na\u2019s abdomen, shoulders, and thighs.</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Kyahak!]</p><br/><p>Blood scattered in the air. Yu IlHan got hit by the blood in the air on purpose before they were vaporized by the flames in his domain. The moment he absorbed the blood of a living 7th class, the information he had on the Destruction Demon Army and succubi rapidly renewed itself.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Record, has become level 50.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wiped the blood on his face and licked his hand with a smile. Although he was purely being happy with the skill\u2019s growth, he just looked like a madman on the outside. However.</p><br/><p>[Aah.]</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s expression finally changed for the first time.</p><br/><p>[Aaaaah\u2026\u2026! Yes, that was it!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally feel like fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was too late for that now. Yu IlHan had acquired enough records about Heli\u00e8na already. Even though Heli\u00e8na\u2019s magic power suddenly increased by two times, he had the confidence to face her. Since he had inflicted fatal wounds on her as well, what was left was to only pierce her heart by charging forward with Yumir!</p><br/><p>[Yes, I finally get it.]</p><br/><p>However, just as Yu IlHan poised himself to attack for who knows what number of times this is, she suddenly said something completely incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>[So darling is the Fifth.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Wait, let\u2019s talk again after we clean this place up.]</p><br/><p>She, who was focusing on Yu IlHan from the very moment of her appearance until now, suddenly said something nonsensical before turning around. Looking at her defenseless state, Yu IlHan was about to pierce her without any hesitation, but he ended up not doing so by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m completely fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera, who checked up on him, voiced her worry in a trembling voice, but Yu IlHan shook his head completely fine and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not feel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeel what?\u2026\u2026 Oh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That annoying aura disappeared.]</p><br/><p>Yes. From the moment Heli\u00e8na turned her back on them, the power of her charm did not extend towards them anymore. Despite the fact that she was so obsessed with him just before, it was as if she had completely given up on Yu IlHan and his companions.</p><br/><p>The aura that extended towards them were completely retracted back to Heli\u00e8na, and was poured back out towards the three other factions that were in a mess of a fight.</p><br/><p>[Kugh\u2026\u2026Kyahk!]</p><br/><p>[Uhuoooooooooooh! I curse you! I SHALL CURSE YOU!]</p><br/><p>The battlefield was crumbling rapidly. The Heaven\u2019s Army and the Army of Brilliant Light were almost wiped out, while Nati\u00e8re and Kelatuke fought each other to half-death.</p><br/><p>Spiera? She was caught up by the massive battle between the two 7th class beings, and was gravely injured and her consciousness was becoming foggy, and ended up being inflicted by Heli\u00e8na\u2019s charm. All of this was Heli\u00e8na\u2019s doing while she struggled with just one person \u2013 Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt his strength dragin while looking at that. Did the enemies defeated by him until not feel like this? Although he wasn\u2019t infected, looking at the succubus that did what he couldn\u2019t possibly even attempt to, make him feel so insignificant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell? She\u2019s completely toying with all of them\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of the three strongest Battalion Commanders even in the Destruction Demon Army! Do you even know how much I panicked after seeing her so suddenly!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta, who finally regained her calm, complained to Yu IlHan while pinching his cheeks. However, Yu IlHan could not reply to her. He was completely absorbed in the Succubus Queen in front of him right now.</p><br/><p>[Well, it\u2019s time to end this.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na playfully raised one hand in the air and shook it. The mana of charm that became much bigger than before due to her absorption of the mana from everyone here, instantly reversed back into them with the wave of her hand. The next moment,</p><br/><p>[Kahk.]</p><br/><p>[If it\u2019s her wish.]</p><br/><p>[I shall gladly!]</p><br/><p>They started committing suicide.</p><br/><p>(woots~ Yes your Highness \u2013 code geass) \u2013 KKS</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Not all 7th class beings are the same!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Damn, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s f*cking Lelouch\u2026..</p><br/><p>TL: Chamber</p><br/><p>PR: RawRBoosted, Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When it extended its left arm out, a stream of pure energy that froze everything in its path was exuded.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarina!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whem Michael Smithson shouted while redirecting the arm with his shield courageously, Carina Malatesta, who aimed for that moment, cast restraint magic to tie the demon down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHhp!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the ice demon was firmly held in place, Takagaki Asuha suddenly appeared from behind it and tied its neck with her whip. However, that lacked the destructive ability to finish it off!</p><br/><p>\u201cHhaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not enough, kugh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge, Michael!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle with the demon only ended after another 30 minutes of cruel battle. If Na YuNa didn\u2019t bless them once midway, there would\u2019ve been another dangerous moment.</p><br/><p>\u201c*pant* *pant*\u2026\u2026 I guess we just barely won that one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael, good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCarina, you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael Smithson, who had it the hardest since he was in charge of defense, broke off the ice off his shield and panted heavily. Carina Malatesta wiped the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief. Ignoring their flirting (she got used to it by now) Takagaki Asuha checked her level.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s definitely insanely hard\u2026\u2026 I levelled up again. I\u2019m already at level 250!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it still so hard even though we\u2019re levelling up so fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta gave a simple and clear explanation as she prepared to summon the next monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the levels of the summoned monsters increase as you three increase in level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou devil!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA devil? That\u2019s quite nice to hear after having been called an \u2018angel\u2019 to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s refreshing smile was angelic!</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps anyone who get involved with mister unique transforms into terrifying beings\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we might become like that someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta snorted after hearing their words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou three are still far from catching up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s of course\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael Smithson subconsciously nodded his head. Where his gaze headed to. A gigantic dragon and a single human were fighting it out.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll kill youuuuuuuuuuu!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you intend to do that? When will you ever catch me? I think it\u2019ll take a shorter amount of time for me to die of old age and be laid in my grave than being caught by something like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kraaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar louder! You can\u2019t even scare an earthworm with that!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHaaaaaaaaaaaan!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour steps are so weak and wobbly that someone might see and think you\u2019re an infant! Should I sing a lullaby?\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Yu IlHan as he drove the frightening dragon into a corner even while not forgetting to inflict copious amounts of mental damage, they felt like they were worse than ants. And the one that revived that frightening dragon was Yu IlHan himself!</p><br/><p>Carina Malatesta asked with an absurd face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long has it been since Mr. Yu IlHan started fighting that dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. There\u2019s around a month until the end of the duration of the barrier, so I guess they\u2019ve been doing that for an entire year and three months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout sleeping even once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than when bathing in the Cradle of Miracles. He indeed never rested nor slept.\u201d</p><br/><p>Michael Smithson became silent. Right now, Yu IlHan was dashing left and right through the air, clearly still filled with vitality even while swinging his spear. The fear-striking flash that seemed to split the universe itself whenever he swung the spear hitting the dragon made him realize that Yu IlHan was not the slightest bit tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe used the Cradle of Miracles until now too\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut resonance is not something that\u2019s easy. But that shouldn\u2019t be the only thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu IlHan was indeed very exceptional, training for such a long period of time without sleeping wasn\u2019t something that could be easily challenged just because one had the capabilities to. It was only possible because of his strong mental fortitude.</p><br/><p>Although it was frustrating, Michael Smithson admitted that he was inferior to Yu IlHan for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not think he\u2019s in the right in all things but\u2026\u2026 There\u2019s at least one thing to admire about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can also become stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Carina. I do not want to be greedy like that any longer. I\u2019m sick and tired of trying to grab everything and failing to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He heaved a short sigh and raised his shield again. The rugged breath had also calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will become a shield that protects you. I won\u2019t be greedy for everything, and only polish what I can do to the extreme.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you wish\u2026\u2026 my love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Have a happy love life.\u201d</p><br/><p>This couple was so flirtatious alright! Whatever they did eventually reached a pink-colored ending!</p><br/><p>Takagaki Asuha, who had to watch the two flirting for more than the past year, looked away from them and towards Yu IlHan. He was what drove her forward. He was driving a terrifying dragon that she could never even dream of fighting, to a corner! Even though he denied it, he must be the reincarnation of a god! She was happy just watching like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve all recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aah.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she realized, Erta was staring at her lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wish to be of his help, you don\u2019t have time to rest so leisurely, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve levelled up just now, so I\u2019m fine physically. Please summon the next monster. \u2026\u2026 if possible, above that couple\u2019s heads.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the three clan masters. Yumir, Kang MiRae, Na YuNa, Kim YeSeul, Liera, Heli\u00e8na, Kang HaJin and even the Dragon\u2019s Army were doing what they could within the barrier. The year and a half that lasted for not even an instant \u2013 Earth\u2019s battle force was being upgraded at lightspeed.</p><br/><p>Of course, the one with the most growth was of course Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[Krhoaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>Roared Echjar. His body no longer had a heart, nor any spines or ribs \u2013 heck, he was missing flesh and blood as well \u2013 but with Yu IlHan\u2019s divine-tier Blacksmithing and Mana crafting, he could revive it with the power to overwhelm any 6th class beings.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026 what is it that you want!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know already.\u201d</p><br/><p>However even with the overwhelming strength, Echjar could not win against Yu IlHan. Echjar had the advantage when he was first revived, but as Yu IlHan adapted to the Flamesoul dragon body throughout the fight, the situation was eventually reversed.</p><br/><p>[I will never submit to you! It is not my loss even if I lose against you with this inferior body!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? You lost to me the moment you died. This is only the process of snapping your morale.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You defeated me with a cowardly method! Had I retained my original power, I would not lose my life to the likes of you!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou defeated your enemies with curses, and you call me a coward, eh? You are a wimp unsuited to be a dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Krhaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the strongest that wins, it\u2019s the victor that is strong. Didn\u2019t I say so? I\u2019ll free you if you win against me. And you nodded your head at that time. And now that you lose so easily like this, you\u2019re coming up with excuses? Were you really born a dragon?\u201d</p><br/><p>[T, this coward\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Orochi, who had also heard those lines for like the millionth time now, muttered powerlessly.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re so evil. I think my morale is going to be snapped before his\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to trample on him a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan leapt several times in the air as he said that. Wherever he went, his spear drew the air, and the Great Cosmos-severing Spear that followed it once again struck Echjar\u2019s injured body.</p><br/><p>[Krhaaa, it\u2019s painful! It\u2019s PAINFUL!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so pathetic! Why don\u2019t you just commit suicide instead? If you have the pride of a dragon, then why don\u2019t you just do that!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Krhaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>Once, he was called the Dragon of Despair, Echjar. He swung his tail to attack Yu IlHan, but as Yu IlHan had recorded all of its movements in the past, it only looked like he was acting cute. In fact, he even traced the movements of the tail and flew towards where the tail would lose its force, and grabbed the tail when it completely lost its power and twisted it apart.</p><br/><p>[Kugh, Khaaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>At that moment, Echjar cried.</p><br/><p>[I\u2026\u2026 lost.]</p><br/><p>He admitted defeat for the first time. After such a long period of battle, his mentality had finally snapped before his body did.</p><br/><p>[I will acknowledge you as the master of dragons.]</p><br/><p>Unsatisfied with his tone of voice, Yu IlHan twisted a little harder and checked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay that again.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Khhhh! I acknowledge you as the ruler of us dragons!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan let go of the tail and floated upwards. At that moment, new text engraved itself on Yu Ilhan\u2019s retina.</p><br/><p>[Although not complete, you have received the declaration of defeat from the thought-soul of the strongest dragon in existence, the Dragon of Despair. The records you possess as a dragon become enhanced. The power to rule over dragons activates a little more.]</p><br/><p>There was no way the high and mighty 7th class dragon would admit defeat just because Yu IlHan beat him up a little. It was all possible because he had acquired the qualifications as the ruler of dragons by completing his armor.</p><br/><p>In any case, Yu IlHan had achieved what he had set out to do. Now, Echjar was his.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then you\u2019re on my side as well from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You finally did it, you malicious master.]</p><br/><p>The Rule skill at the level of mastery covered Echjar\u2019s entire body. With both his body and mind tattered, Echjar threw away the pride it had piled up over countless years and agreed to become Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinate.</p><br/><p>\u201cEchjar, let\u2019s get along well from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I acknowledge you as my master\u2026\u2026 so you must become the strongest.]</p><br/><p>[\u2018Echjar\u2019 has become your subordinate.]</p><br/><p>He finally succeeded in all of his objectives that he aimed to fulfill within the barrier. Yu IlHan\u2019s lips curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then let\u2019s switch your places now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That body of the terrifying dragon is uncomfortable in itself but\u2026\u2026 I guess I can\u2019t help it.]</p><br/><p>[Fuu\u2026\u2026 for me, this is more comfortable.]</p><br/><p>There was no need to hesitate anymore. Yu IlHan immediately activated \u2018Creation\u2019 to switch Orochi and Echjar.</p><br/><p>Echjar would be able to adapt better to the Body of the Human Dragon that contained his very own essence, and Orochi would also find the simpleton 7th class dragon\u2019s body a better fit than a God-ranked artifact.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi, what should we do? Leave the body as it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It is insanely uncomfortable. Make it a humanoid form instead, master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, leave that to me. I\u2019ll compress the power without losing any of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yu IlHan was about to commence his last piece of work in the barrier, Mystic, who stayed obedient until now, raised her voice in complaint.</p><br/><p>[Master, me too! I also want a body!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 can just wait a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re too much! You idiotic master! I also want a body like Orochi! A cute and little girl!]</p><br/><p>[Haha, brat. Go break dance or something with that gigantic body of yours.]</p><br/><p>[Orochi you idioooooooooot!]</p><br/><p>Mystic\u2019s young-sounding voice filled the barrier. Yu IlHan laughed and picked up his hammer.</p><br/><p>There was still a month left until the barrier was dispelled, plenty of time to create another masterpiece.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

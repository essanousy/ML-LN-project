So cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s new weapon shocked not only the golem, but the others as well. He actually used the bone ammo as a screw? And equipped an \u2018electronic\u2019 driver?</p><br/><p>Above all, he was grinding that giant golem real-time!</p><br/><p>[Kuwaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUoooooh!\u201d</p><br/><p>[So fast! He\u2019s already dug 5 meters already!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Frustrating\u2026\u2026 so frustrating!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yu IlHan had ended up learning a new skill. He had entered a realm he hadn\u2019t in his one thousand years of solitude.</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the skill, Excavation. All abilities related to excavation rises as the skill level rises, and the quality of the items excavated becomes higher as well.]</p><br/><p>Never did he imagine there would come a day he\u2019d learn such a skill!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really is no end to the path of labour.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m actually starting to be scared now that he may try to master all possible paths of manual labour\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera retorted to Yu IlHan\u2019s honest remark. Yu IlHan wanted to retort to her about what she saw him as, but he wasn\u2019t one to talk, since he was literally grinding a golem, so he held back.</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 2.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 3.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[The skill\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The more he dug into the golem\u2019s body, and the more the drill spun and scattered the metal fragments around as the Excavation skill level rose. No matter how skilled Yu IlHan was in labour, it was abnormal for a skill to rise so rapidly from level 1.</p><br/><p>However, the \u2018target\u2019 of excavation right now, in terms of the excavation realm, could be considered to be the final boss, a golem made of archaic alloy metal! It was no wonder the proficiency increase was incomparable to swinging pickaxes to dig iron ore!</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 15.]</p><br/><p>Originally, the skill had to rise even faster, but since the scattered fragments that comprised the golem\u2019s body was still controlled by the golem, Yu IlHan\u2019s excavation was in fact, actually not successful at all.</p><br/><p>Meaning, Yu IlHan was actually piling skill proficiency while trying and failing! It could be seen how amazing and horrifying of an opponent this golem was.</p><br/><p>[Guwooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was enjoying a two-birds-with-one-stone time of training skills and training skills, the golem felt a sense of crisis from its body being ground apart. Even when it tried to regenerate its body by picking the fragments back up, the puny humans beneath its feet was desperately preventing that, so it couldn\u2019t do so!</p><br/><p>So, it ended up choosing the extreme choice. The enormous amount of records and mana it had piled up over a long period of time on this stone mountain! \u2013 utilizing all of that, it had implemented a trump card attack that should have been impossible for it normally!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Yu IlHan was focusing on drilling through the golem\u2019s body, the first one to notice the change was Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ruins is emitting some strange light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would the ruins glow\u2026.. everyone back off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MIRae shouted after her. After that, the entrance exploded with a \u2018boom!\u2019 and the white metals composing the corridor inside all shot up into the air! Na YuNa shouted with shiny eyes as soon as she saw that!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fusion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Stop that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted Kang MIrae while shooting a spear of lightning. a strong lightning, that was way above just 3rd class magic, struck on a portion of the white lumps of metal, but the mysterious metal didn\u2019t seem to be damaged at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next batter was Yumir. As he had seen Kang MiRae\u2019s failure just now, he tried to blow them far away instead of destroying them, but the metal actually completely devoured the windstorm he had made. This was dragon\u2019s magic, albeit 3rd class, we\u2019re talking about!</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cries*, dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he failed, he looked for his dad! Fortunately, at that time, Yu IlHan had also sensed the change in the stone mountain. Right now, only the metals making up the ruins were reacting, but in Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes, this golem\u2019s deeds wouldn\u2019t stop there.</p><br/><p>From the minute vibrations on the ground, or the suspicious movement of mana, he was quite sure. In the worst case scenario, the entire stone mountain may as well disintegrate and fuse into the golem\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I can\u2019t help it\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while grumbling that he was about to be robbed of everything when he had just come here to learn magic engineering, he took out the next set of cards he had.</p><br/><p>While he himself was still holding onto the Death Driver, he called out something using the remote collection function of his inventory, onto the top of the golem\u2019s shoulders, which was\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Ballista Quartet!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The names are quite generic.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[But do you really have to shout like that every time you take something out?] 1</p><br/><p>[Do you not know, Erta, it\u2019s where his dreams lie in.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Surrounding the massive hole Yu IlHan had made while digging, four huge ballistas appeared in the east, west, south, and north directions. They were loaded with cartridges containing a maximum of 50 loadable sharp blades.</p><br/><p>Actually, from its appearance alone, it didn\u2019t look that much different to the installation-type ballista he had made before. 2, but he refused comparisons with those as this \u2018did not need human hands to operate\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHup! Eat some bone spears you alien monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan let go of the drill for a moment, and took out 4 3rd class magic stones from his inventory and threw them fast. When the four magic stones emitted bright light in the air, the ballistas, now supplied with mana for activation, all started firing.</p><br/><p>They first stuck themselves on the ground and adjusted their trajectory with squeaking sounds, before aiming at the metal fragments that tried to fuse to the golem body.</p><br/><p>The magic gunpowder and the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band he had made a lot of, was used in those ballistas, so they had incomparable destructive power from before, and they were starting to smash into pieces, the white metals that tried to regenerate the golem!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat looks painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yu IlHan. Did you really not learn any magic engineering\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any time to speak! Your Highness, the entire stone mountain is trembling!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuguguoooooooouuuuuuuh!]</p><br/><p>The golem also noticed what was happening on its shoulders. The metals it called out to recover its body was exploding and raining down!</p><br/><p>However, just that alone wasn\u2019t enough to extinguish its will. The mana in this area was already resonating with it. Accepting the will to become stronger and sturdier in order to defeat the invaders, the mana was giving the land for it to use.</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooh!]</p><br/><p>If it was impossible top-down, then it will just start from the bottom! The lands that the people were setting foot on, arose as if it had a will of its own, and fused into the golem\u2019s body. Naturally, earthquakes occurred, and holes appeared everywhere, and the people on the ground had to focus on saving themselves first rather than battle.</p><br/><p>At this moment, this golem was the ruler of the area!</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re going to die trying to learn magic engineering!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Ah, we\u2019re doomed. The ruins completely collapsed.!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. it will be fine if we do something about the golem!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Splendid, Yu IlHan. That\u2019s the spirit!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[In my eyes, he just seems hopelessly optimistic, though!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gritted his teeth, and put more strength into gripping the Death Driver. In any case, Yu IlHan was digging deeper into its body. If he drilled all the way to the bottom, then no matter how it tried to reinforce itself, it would fail to move!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ruins completely collapsed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe collapsed ruins is all fusing with the golem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the grounds were collapsing, or the fact that the body of the golem was getting larger as time passed, Yu IlHan only focused on drilling through the golem. He poured as much mana he as he had, and focused on the drill and on himself.</p><br/><p>Labour was something that would rapidly increase in efficiency the moment the body and soul looked towards one direction! Like how Yu IlHan became one with the spear once before, and one with the sword, he became one with the drill and kept digging through the golem!</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 30. Efficiency related to all excavation increases, and you\u2019re now able to excavate magic metals that cannot be excavated by normal means.]</p><br/><p>That was the moment of miracle.</p><br/><p>[Guhuk, Guwoooooaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>The white metal fragments, that still moved after being drilled by Yu IlHan, under the golem\u2019s control, all stopped moving!</p><br/><p>Yes. Becoming able to excavate magic metals, meant that the magic metals excavated by Yu IlHan were no longer under the golem\u2019s control. Of course, he had to spend a certain amount of mana in order to possess the magic metal, but right now, that was hardly a burden!</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 31.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation, has become level 32.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Excavation,\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[The skill\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>When the possession of the magic metals he couldn\u2019t acquire until now, all came over to Yu IlHan, the Excavation skill started rising rapidly again.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan ignored all the levelup notices on his retina, and did what he had to do now \u2013 which was, putting all the stationary magic metals into his inventory. Before the golem started doing anything else with it!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomehow it feels like the golem\u2019s pressure is being reduced\u2026.. is it just me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nope.</p><br/><p>Well, the golem\u2019s body was increasing faster than Yu IlHan could dig, but that was all just boulders making up the stone mountain. The core power behind the golem, the magic metal, was entering Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory real-time!</p><br/><p>[Guwoh, Guwoooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>The golem roared as if to say that it was unacceptable to be excavated by a human while alive. At that moment, sharp spikes protrude out from the wall of the hole that Yu IlHan had dug through with the Death Driver and the bone screw!</p><br/><p>\u201cKergh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[It can change the form inside its body as well!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Shouted Erta and Liera in shock. Yu IlHan avoided injury as he had called out Aegis as soon as he sensed a change in mana, but the golem focused on shape shifting its insides, and pulled out tens, hundreds, thousands of spikes!</p><br/><p>Not only that, slowly, very slowly, but surely, the hole Yu IlHan had dug was shrinking as well. Since Yu IlHan had put all the pieces of metal making up the body into his inventory, this wasn\u2019t regeneration. It was just compressing the body like mad while making up the outer parts with just boulders!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did not let go of the Death Driver even after confirming that the hole was shrinking, but he couldn\u2019t help but sweat cold sweat as hundreds of metal spikes hit Aegis.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I saw a similar scene in Saw\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaak! Don\u2019t mention such a scary movie!] (Liera)3</p><br/><p>No matter how good the defense was on Aegis, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the could hold out forever. Yu IlHan checked while blocking the spikes that appeared from below him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much further do I need to dig until I reach the ground?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are almost all the way through the magic metal parts. No matter how it tries to form its body using boulders from the mountain, in the end, the reason it can move its body was because it is made of magic metals, so if you can sever that, you can kill it. The problem is that\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Is that we\u2019ll get swallowed up before that happens. Yu IlHan, we need to escape this place first.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan interjected Spiera.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no solution if we attack from the outside. We need to finish it from the inside. So\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s use the final card.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sighed a little. Had he mastered excavation, he wouldn\u2019t have needed to undertake such risks!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan boldly put away the Death Driver into his inventory. The golem roared in victory after noticing that the drill had stopped, but Yu IlHan hadn\u2019t died yet!</p><br/><p>He covered his entire body with Aegis, and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to use this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuuh, that sounds very suspicious.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, no matter how high your fire attribute resistance is, that\u2019s just\u2026.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s alright. Probably.\u201d</p><br/><p>The most important thing started now. While the bone screw was still holding out inside the golem! Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes glistened mysteriously.</p><br/><p>Even now, the inside of the golem\u2019s body was shrinking little by little. If the bone screw was ejected, then it would immediately try to fill the gap.Yu IlHan planned to plant a bomb before that gap was filled \u2013 using the swap technique he had practiced so much. Collecting and releasing at the same time!</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t do it precisely, then Yu IlHan\u2019s life would be in danger as well. Although he had fire attribute resistance, he had no explosion resistance. So he had to prevent himself from being hit by the explosion no matter what.</p><br/><p>He stared at the bone screw, and at one moment, he blinked. Immediately after that, the bone screw disappeared, and the golem shrunk that part and filled the gap. It really was a blink of an eye \u2013 a moment that seemed like no one could do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Even as the hole was shrinking towards him, Yu IlHan was smiling.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Spiera understands what dreams are.</p><br/><p>What does Yu IlHan\u2019s smile mean!? (T/N: Ain\u2019t that obvious)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Try replacing \u2018digger\u2019 with \u2018monarch\u2019 and see what you get (chapter title)</p><br/><p>Special thanks to Daniel P!</p><br/><p>1.

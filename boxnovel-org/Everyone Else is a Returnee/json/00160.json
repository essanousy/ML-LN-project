That\u2019s 8 levels worth of stats. It\u2019s the same as your level being increased by 8 for 30 minutes. Don\u2019t even get me started on how absurd such a thing is.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>In fact, for Yu IlHan, the effect was increased to 75 magic for one hour, due to the increase of his Cooking skill to level 90, and the effects of the cookie increased accordingly, but he decided not to say it. Instead, he kept on baking cookies.</p><br/><p>[Shouldn\u2019t you look into how such a magic reaction happened first?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you appeal to me like that, I won\u2019t give you any more. The birth of the Giant Bucket is a result of coincidence in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The only hypothesis is that Breath, made of dragon blood, must have resonated again using the cookie dough as the media, with the Giant Bucket. As you know, dragons are a race of mystery.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Despite having told off Yu IlHan, Erta had made the exact same remark. When Yu IlHan stared at her, she pretended to not know anything and turned her head away, but her cheeks were still red.</p><br/><p>[Dragons\u2026\u2026 So I need to go kill dragons\u2026..?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s Mir here so don\u2019t even joke about that!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Spiera, who unexpectedly had a high propensity for good food, seemed to be completely smitten by the cookie, and watched as Yu IlHan kept on making more. Yu IlHan quickly packaged them and stored it in his inventory, to protect the cookies from her demonic hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call this \u2018magic stuffed cookies\u2019.\u201d 1</p><br/><p>[Simple is the best!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s a good name. You wouldn\u2019t be able to say it cuz it\u2019s embarrassing, even if there\u2019s an occasion where we have to say it!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Like that, the magic stuffed cookies that received positive feedback from everyone. About 50,000 more pieces were produced, using 100 liters of Breath, and they all went into Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory. This would make the already strong Yu IlHan even stronger.</p><br/><p>Training in the Great cosmos-severing spear, creating products, baking cookies, and producing Breath \u2013 Yu IlHan\u2019s schedule was still jam-packed. If possible, he wanted to finish the two months like that\u2026\u2026 but the end had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, we have no more monsters to dismantle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve procured enough products and inventory for Angel Tear as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>[IlHan, let\u2019s dismantle the Perverted Vibration Demon now!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cUergh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan vomited blood and twisted his body. However, the cruel angel did not forgive him.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m so excited about what he\u2019ll make.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Well, it really was a special type of monster.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t want to see it again. It keeps reminding me of that manga.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cManga?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mirey took the bait! At this rate, his emperor-in-name status would go down the drain!</p><br/><p>With a vicious expression, Yu IlHan turned to the three angels and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Cookies.]</p><br/><p>[Cookies.]</p><br/><p>[Kis\u2026\u2026Cookies!]</p><br/><p>He opened a pack of magic stuffed cookies and put one into each angels\u2019 mouth. He received the \u2018more\u2019 gaze, but since they may threaten him even more, he planned to give them out in timed intervals.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out the Perverted Vibration Demon\u2019s corpse from his inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoa, what the heck is this disgusting piece of\u2026 thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s dead, the skin is vibrating\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShush, you guys go do some free sparring or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out a dismantling knife, and fell into deep thought before he went to work \u2013 how should he dismantle this\u2026 thing that was still vibrating with a buzz. No matter how he was a dismantling master, he couldn\u2019t know that immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it vibrating due to the innate properties of the skin? No, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s like that. The tissues are connected. To the heart\u2026.. yes, I knew it. There\u2019s a separate magic organ.\u2019</p><br/><p>After coming to that judgement, Yu IlHan finally started wielding the knife. Although the vibration was less than when it was alive, he had to spend an enormous amount of strength and magic power in order to cut through its skin, and he ended up having to throw a few magic stuffed cookies into his mouth and raise the output of Blaze in order to cut.</p><br/><p>The head which he had pierced entirely \u2013 starting from there, he cut the body in exactly two halves, and flayed its skin.</p><br/><p>In that process, he had to carefully take out the strands of magic power that stuck to the skin, in which he had to cut through the flesh and slice the bones in order to pull out the entire strand of magic string.</p><br/><p>Finally, he scooped out the heart, and took out the unpleasantly vibrating sphere, that was colored in greyish white. This was the core magic organ that made the skin vibrate.</p><br/><p>[That feels unpleasant.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re quite brave to be handling it with bare hands. I feel a horrible curse from it.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my higher curse resistance proficiency is rising by the minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic organ contained an absurd amount of mana, making him wonder if it was actually the magic stone, but unlike magic stones which the user could freely control, this thing was changing the properties of mana in a single direction at the same time of producing mana = vibration power.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I can only use it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why do you sound so weak? That\u2019s unexpected.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>All of the materials Yu IlHan had handled until now, were those that did their purposes by itself. There were some that mutually benefited other materials, but this was the first time it was physically connected like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the skin has countless small magic organs, and not to mention the magic strands, the core is the same. If I had to describe this, this is a completed artifact in and of itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s difficult for you to do any additional processes on it, correct?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodded Yu IlHan with a bitter smile. Of course, he could make something out of it by bringing out the structure of this, if he tried, but that would amount to nothing more than an inferior copy of the perverted vibration demon. He needed to look into this material.</p><br/><p>He thought about how to use this disgusting, but exceptional material for a while, and murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic engineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, perhaps it would be possible with magic engineering. He felt like the living blessing of the god of smithing was saying that. So, he first decided to keep it in his inventory.</p><br/><p>[Is the rest just garbage?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe flesh and the bones are quite peculiar too. They have the ability to amplify and emit energy while retaining the properties of the energy received.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s like\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, resonance. Although the resonance ability lacks much more in the viewpoint that it has to be in contact of the energy, like the Thunderhammer, but the amplification ability itself is actually quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also why its ability had almost no time delay. Not to mention the skin, even the bones and the flesh had magic organs. This was proof that this monster was quite different to the ones he had confronted until now.</p><br/><p>However, if there was a disadvantage, it was that it would amplify even outside sources of energy that had invaded the body. The vibration from its magic organ, and the vibration from Yu IlHan\u2019s attack had overlapped to tilt the balance, and claimed its life.</p><br/><p>Meaning, this was a double-edged sword, but of course, it would become an exceptional weapon if Yu IlHan processed it in a suitable way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would have been better if there were one or two more.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I was wondering why you didn\u2019t say it\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan first tested if he could process the bones using Eternal Flame, but the result was a miserable defeat. There was a considerable ratio of monsters which their bones had metallic properties, but this monster wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it would just burn once in contact with a flame, and would vibrate and cause a mess once he tried to cut it, so it was a material that almost annoyed him to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re giving up?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, the word \u2018retreat\u2019 doesn\u2019t exist in my dictionary. There\u2019s only left and right turns!\u201d</p><br/><p>By \u2018right turn\u2019, he meant that he would just break the flesh and bones into fine pieces, and drain the moisture, to make a powder out of it.</p><br/><p>The options on the Mixed bone full plate armor came to light in this process. Using the ability which allowed him to create ice by using water and mana, he gathered the moisture in the bones and the flesh, to create ice outside, resulting in instant drying!</p><br/><p>[That skill sounds like an OP skill in battle.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if there are any opponents that stay still while I drain the moisture out of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan kindly answered Liera, and poured all the powder into the Giant Bucket. This was because the properties were too weak right now, to be used in anything.</p><br/><p>The innate properties of the powder was very strong, and the dragon mana composing the Giant Bucket also couldn\u2019t invade easily, but as there was nothing the Giant Bucket couldn\u2019t conquer until now, he decided to leave it like that.</p><br/><p>If it went as Yu IlHan had predicted, then the weapons he would produce would change the weapons industry once again!</p><br/><p>[Then what are you going to do while that matures? Are you going to spar like them?] (Lieara)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, although it\u2019s quite sorry to say this, they\u2019re too weak to be of any help in my training\u2026\u2026. and, yeah, I should train in the Great cosmos-severing spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hm, Good.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ended up picking up his spear as he couldn\u2019t endure Spiera\u2019s sparkly eyes that looked straight into his. He resolved to learn it quickly to get rid of Spiera\u2019s nagging!</p><br/><p>3 days passed since then.</p><br/><p>Now, there wasn\u2019t much time until the barrier was dispelled. Yu IlHan finally judged that the powder had finished maturing.</p><br/><p>[They all turned red?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[What in the world are you planning to do with this powder?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[On the outside, it even looks like crystal powder. Since I know it was originally bones and flesh, it disgusts me even more.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you see its abilities, you would probably retract that statement.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the 3 days of processing inside the Giant Bucket, the dragon mana had compressed the powder particles and made them smaller and harder, even enhancing the properties, and now, they had a property that would explode with frightening power even when Yu IlHan just heated them up with Blaze.</p><br/><p>He tested it, and he judged that a palmful of that powder would probably disintegrate a 3rd class monster at level 120.</p><br/><p>[Huh?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[This is\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, gunpowder.\u201d</p><br/><p>And a gunpowder that was different from the original ones, in the sense that it would contain bigger explosive power the more energy was imbued into it, whether it was fire, or lightning!</p><br/><p>This was a revolution that would overcome the absolute flaw of mankind firepower against monsters.</p><br/><p>[So that\u2019s it. You could do that with it.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I couldn\u2019t even imagine. I thought it was a relatively inferior version of resonance, but never did I believe that it would be amplified by the Giant Bucket.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>The entire volume had shrunk while he extracted moisture, and the particles were even more compressed inside the Giant Bucket, so the final amount of powder Yu IlHan had acquired was only about 300 kilograms. However, if he tried igniting all of this at once with Blaze, an entire country would be blown to smithereens.</p><br/><p>[This is a top-tier danger material. Perhaps it\u2019s the most dangerous material on Earth right now.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Are you planning to sell these too!?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this will only be used for the equipment that I\u2019ll make for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan already had the motor engine known as the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band. The pile bunker was also something that used the elasticity of the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band.</p><br/><p>But what if he added a gunpowder that would generate even more forces by borrowing fire from Blaze? Wouldn\u2019t there be an unimaginable result from the two motor engines working in concert? Things that should have been impossible until now, would become possible.</p><br/><p>Especially, in regards to the trial he had to undertake recently.</p><br/><p>[Are you preparing it just in case you need to go inside that world?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Ah, so that\u2019s it. So your aim is to\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan acknowledged without hesitation. Although it was incredibly unpleasant to say it with his mouth, he couldn\u2019t help it right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need a weapon with enough firepower to penetrate the skin of the perverted vibration demon, even when I\u2019m not in concealment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after that, the barrier made by the Hourglass of Eternity, dispelled and Yu IlHan\u2019s group came outside.</p><br/><p>Not to mention the renewed multiversal brand, Vanguard, he had created years worth of stock for the high-class dessert brand Angel Tear, and he had even made new gear to obliterate the Perverted Demon Beast, that had easily deflected Yu IlHan\u2019s long-range remote-collection spear rain technique.</p><br/><p>The curtain to the Earth-Trade era had risen.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a secret to what he made. Sorry? It\u2019s obvious? Urgh, I knew this would happen</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Man, you guys are on a role today! Is this my birthday? this is already the 5th sponsored chapter within one week! I only have like 5 stockpiles now. Looks like I should actually translate stuff now\u2026</p><br/><p>This is a sponsored chapter!</p><br/><p>And\u2026 yeah. It looks like he doesn\u2019t need to worry about equipment inventory for Vanguard now\u2026 He\u2019s made \u2018years worth\u2019 of them\u2026</p><br/><p>Enjoy!</p><br/><p>P.S Those with Ad Problems, it looks like disabling javascript works well.

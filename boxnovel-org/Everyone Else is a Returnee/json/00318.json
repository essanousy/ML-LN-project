After Yu IlHan cleaned up last time, the situation of the people there had become slightly better, and were still resisting against violent hordes of monsters. And the most surprising thing was that\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026This world might come under me at any moment. How did it come to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I have heard that you have shown miracles in this world. The entire world of Heishia now worships you as a God. It might trigger the phenomenon if you show yourself now.]</p><br/><p>Even though he hadn\u2019t shown himself at all during the cleanup!? Just as he thought that, he also realized that such a thing did not matter.</p><br/><p>Once he showed himself and show a similar kind of miracle to the people here, the people will follow him. The faith spread around the mankind in this world will instantly change to deep-rooted belief and Heishia will come under his rule. It will probably be immediately fused to Dareu as well.</p><br/><p>To think such a thing had happened when he was just ensuring the safety of his father, Yu IlHan felt quite astonished due to the flow of \u2018worship\u2019 that was transmitted to him from this world, and Uriel spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>[The Fifth and the Brightest shining star, was it? That is definitely true. No other transcender could fuse lower worlds with higher ones. What do you think? Do you still think that you are an egoistic person? Even though your light actions brought salvation to many?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019s fine as long as I and the ones around me are safe. I couldn\u2019t care less about anyone else. Even if there are many people who I have saved until now, it is because I\u2019d feel awkward if they died in front of me. I\u2019m no hero. I\u2019m sick of that kind of role play.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu. You should have acquired the qualifications of a transcender precisely because you can say that. It really is like a certain person I once knew.]</p><br/><p>Uriel smiled. Was it his mistake? Uriel\u2019s figure was definitely friendly towards him now, unlike her attitude in the previous world.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan judged that it was because this world no longer contained any traces of Heaven\u2019s Army. In other words, she had become more honest than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heaven\u2019s Army has abandoned this world. No, they missed it? \u2026\u2026Or was it purposeful?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Heaven\u2019s Army is in management of countless worlds. A simple trick from one of the Four Great Archangels is enough to make a blank chit.]</p><br/><p>She just basically admitted that she was the one who did it. Isn\u2019t that a perfect crime! This is why authority shouldn\u2019t be given to those in power! \u2013 Yu IlHan muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did God believe in such beings and share his power?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It is not that we were bestowed with parts of his power. It was expropriation. In that process, Luciel became Satan while God went missing, and the Four Great Archangels reigned supreme in Heaven.]</p><br/><p>His random grumble resulted in an unimaginable answer and so Yu IlHan momentarily doubted his words. However, when he thought about what the self-proclaimed God said to Kang MiRae, he could somehow naturally accept that as a fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not like what you said was completely stupid and unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>[At that time we were all of one mind. But what could have happened? The same mind we shared fragmented into pieces. Michael wished to maintain God\u2019s rule of the past while Raphael wanted Michael to replace God\u2026\u2026 I could not watch as they walked down that path even though they knew it was wrong\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Gabriel couldn\u2019t accept that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel\u2019s mouth curved into a faint smile at Yu IlHan\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>[You are smart as expected.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to hear the next part from Gabriel himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his hand.</p><br/><p>As a supreme being that exposed all falsehood and concealment, he swung his hands lightly when someone who hid behind the sky showed himself.</p><br/><p>He was someone who Yu IlHan knew very well, as well as a person that he had never met before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u2026 you\u2019ll tell me about it right, dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Four Great Archangels that was hiding himself, Gabriel, simultaneously, the leader of the Garden of Sunset, at the same time, a father of one certain loner.</p><br/><p>Yu YongHan was there.</p><br/><p>[I will, my son. I\u2019ll have to tell you everything now.]</p><br/><p>[You have worked hard, Gabriel.]</p><br/><p>[The work that was done by my son. \u2026\u2026Sorry for worrying you all this time.]</p><br/><p>Even while feeling something welling up inside him, he suppressed it and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was nothing. You had such a faint presence that I forgot about you more often than not.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about the matters that you had to take care of because of this unworthy father.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too\u2026\u2026 should have suffered a fair bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a lot of insults piled up that he wanted to say when he met his father again. However, somehow, meeting his father and seeing him in such a tattered state made Ilhan forget about all that.</p><br/><p>In fact, he kinda knew that this would be the case. He doubted from the moment that he simply became an insane concealment master from birth; from how the angels supported him at the right time; was assured when he couldn\u2019t find any traces of his father from Heishia; realized something new when he met his mother in the world under the Garden of Sunset, where time and space were halted; and realized the identity of his father as he went against the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to believe it. He wished his father was ordinary. He wanted his father to be unaware of the tremendous pressure on his shoulders that even made his legs numb thanks to becoming the pillar of support that so many beings relied on. He wanted his father to live an ordinary, happy life.</p><br/><p>It was just that. He was only turning his eyes away from reality and was complaining.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of foreknowledge is only possessed by you across all worlds, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is correct. This is something I was born with when I was a lower existence. I almost burst out laughing when Michael asked me if I can surpass the leader of the Garden of Sunset.]</p><br/><p>When his father laughed, Yu IlHan giggled as well. Orochi and Mystic stood back quietly, and Uriel was smiling while watching the reunion of the father and son.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you make the Garden of Sunset?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It is when I realized that Michael had changed. Satan created the Army of Brilliant Light to go against him, but father felt that it wasn\u2019t enough. But you know? Running two jobs was a lot harder than expected. There was nothing that went as I wished to.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you even had a hard time raising a family.\u201d</p><br/><p>His dad was triggered and retorted.</p><br/><p>[But I still fulfilled my objective.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was your objective?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Confronter of God, the brightest shining star, that is you, as well as the elimination of as many variables as possible. And finally\u2026\u2026 the protection of my family.]</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the confronter or start of whatever, the reason he created the Garden of Sunset was to protect his family? And one that will be made far in the future? Wasn\u2019t that too much of a lie even if he had the foreknowledge ability? Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s me or mom, we remember a lot of times when we received damage from the Garden of Sunset and you want me to believe that? Moreover, variables? The Garden of Sunset was the biggest variable that no one could account for, duh!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Foreknowledge is in no way omnipotent, and I can only believe that the results of the foreknowledge are true and move accordingly. That is why\u2026\u2026 I made you and your mother suffer. There were a lot of things that didn\u2019t go as I intended.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was flabbergasted after listening to his father\u2019s confession. However, thinking back, the Garden of Sunset was related to almost all the incidents that got him caught up until now, in one way or the other.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t Dareu, that was the biggest source of power for him, affected by them as well? Even his precious son Yumir was a child he received from Lecidna, a follower of the Garden of Sunset. His mother too acquired a large power in that halted word, albeit spending a frightening amount of time there.</p><br/><p>Yes. Just looking at the results, that was the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t forgive you either way. You\u2019re guilty. I grit my teeth every time I think about how I was left out on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I will gladly receive any kind of punishment. I\u2019m sorry, son.]</p><br/><p>It frustrated him even more since he didn\u2019t make any excuses. If it wasn\u2019t his father and was anyone else instead, he\u2019d have beat him half to death and beat him up the remaining half after that, but he couldn\u2019t really do that now could he?</p><br/><p>That was because Yu IlHan himself knew how fathers thought of their son. His father had acted in consideration of Yu IlHan and Kim YeSeul. That was why it was more frustrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour methods are insanely wrong! We\u2019re not superman!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought it was better than death. \u2026\u2026And I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be put through so many serious situations. I\u2019m really sorry.]</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Better than death \u2013 the words that he couldn\u2019t deny since he had watched the deaths of many. Yu IlHan thought about where he had to hit his dad to inflict the most pain but eventually loosened his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back on topic.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Did you accept it with just that?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptance, but delaying the inevitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Got it.]</p><br/><p>Fearing that he may end up making his son commit a grave sin (at the expense of his own life), Yu YongHan immediately shut his mouth. Yu IlHan sighed once more and took out a Trap of Restoration and showed it to him</p><br/><p>[Oooh, this is that\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour son\u2019s capability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although no one could analyze the already installed Traps of Restoration, it was possible to see through its functions if someone saw it in its inactivated state. And as he had expected, Yu YongHan exclaimed after seeing that.</p><br/><p>[A really amazing artifact right there. It\u2019s an artifact that fully counters the Legnae. Moreover it has an ability that I cannot completely see through.]</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what happened to God to become like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the important question. He would find out why Yu YongHan had to act as the leader of the Garden of Sunset at the same time as being Gabriel, as well as the reason why he himself had to give up living as a loner all his life and become the leader of Dragon\u2019s Nest.</p><br/><p>[Yes, I still hadn\u2019t told you that yet.]</p><br/><p>Gabriel, Yu YongHan, seemed to hesitate for a moment, before blinking his eyes deeply once and started talking.</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s see\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s it. I need to reaffirm this fact before I start. And that is that the God of Heaven\u2019s Army is not the creator. \u2018God\u2019 in the truest sense, does not exist.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan remembered, during the time of the god of love\u2019s message. The message definitely stated that God did not exist. So that meant that God, really, did not exist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean to say that no one knows who the Creator is, or actually, whether he or she exists or not at all, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. And the God of Heaven\u2019s Army wants to become that Creator.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked while thinking about Legna, as well as the God that came into contact with Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he made mana, is that a lie as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a lie. Well, he did definitely reach close to the realm of creation, but he did not. All of that is false. What he can make is at best those Legna golems. In one sense, he\u2019s even inferior to you, son. Just like this Trap of Restoration, there are numerous things he cannot create.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s inferior to me when I only trained for one millennium? That\u2019s one sloppy guy\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YongHan burst in to laughter after he heard Yu IlHan\u2019s words. His son had reached a realm that no one had reached ever since the dawn of creation, and he didn\u2019t seem to know how amazing the realm he reached actually was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he trying to erase mana?\u201d</p><br/><p>[He can only erase mana since he\u2019s trying to erase all existence. However, son, as you saw, the God of Heaven\u2019s \u2018creation\u2019 is not true creation. He just burns countless souls as fuel to do something similiar to it. Like that, everything will eventually reach destruction\u2026\u2026. You know that this is wrong, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>In one meaning, that meant the death of worlds. Greed\u2019s words, of course probably unintentional, had seen through the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I have many many other questions to ask, but I\u2019ll ask just one more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed while he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it have to be now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That is\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Yu YongHan, Gabriel, closed his eyes after hearing his question.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know exactly what his son had been through to reach this position. He only predicted that his son will become the brightest shining transcender, and that he will become the confronter of God.</p><br/><p>However, his son had experienced many more things than he had thought, and had grown a lot more. He was no longer being swayed by the worlds and was leading the situation. The vague foreknowledge had finally become clear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Earth shall become larger than Heaven. The Fifth and the brightest shining star that rules Earth, shall appear. Born from an angel, raised as a human, reborn into a dragon\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feeling a conflict of disappointment and satisfaction at his son\u2019s growth, Yu YongHan told his son the truth.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s because you have appeared, son. With your appearance, all other factions have shrunk back, and the moment that God had waited for has arrived.]</p><br/><p>\u2018And in the end, he will become the sole God.\u2019</p><br/><p>He spoke the line that Yu IlHan had already predicted.</p><br/><p>[Harmageddon, is coming.]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

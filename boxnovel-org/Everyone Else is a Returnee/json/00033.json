It\u2019s a masterpiece whether in regards to defensive power, appearance and attack aids.]</p><br/><p>This was the moment when Yu IlHan made the first legend rank item using his blacksmithing skills. This was a rank higher than unique!</p><br/><p>Although the 3 options were shocking, the contents of those options were a bigger shock. Forget the higher defensive power compared to the leather armor he was wearing, there was even a surprise attack increase option!</p><br/><p>As a Blurred Lancer, Yu IlHan already had the ability of his attack power increasing by 10% when in concealment. Attacking when concealed was obviously a surprise attack, so when he attacks in surprise, that meant a 40% increase in attack. If he used a spear? It nicely becomes a 50%.</p><br/><p>[In my opinion.]</p><br/><p>With the fullplate armor which had an absurd ability, in front of her, Erta opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>[The \u2018shiveringly\u2019 alpha option must be increasing the effect of the other two options.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s an option that increases other options\u2019 effectiveness. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s possible for 3 options to get attached.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who knows? In fact, I also don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen anything with 3 options in my lifetime. Moreover, this armor had no mana crafting done to it!]</p><br/><p>That was true. No matter how easy for items made with Metal Hearts\u2019 hearts to get an option, it seemed that the fact that there were three options attached to an item which didn\u2019t even have any mana crafting done to it, was quite a shock to Erta.</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it that your title \u2018Creator of Myths\u2019 might have made the impossible surpass its limits to become possible? However, even though I\u2019m saying this, I\u2019m not quite sure of it myself. The future history will be made by you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell. That sounds so scary. I want to live a long, thin life.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Just who is saying that\u2026\u2026 Rather than that, Yu IlHan, do you have any thoughts in selling the equipments you made to other peoople?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, a little bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just that that only applied to when his customer could notice him.</p><br/><p>[Never, ever, sell an item with 3 options to others. Exposing your ability anywhere is too dangerous. Okay?]</p><br/><p>Then what if I get 4 options? \u2013 Yu IlHan wanted to lightly joke like that, but since Erta\u2019s expression was very serious, he wordlessly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was touched that Erta had opened her heart to her to the point that she would seriously advise him.</p><br/><p>[Three options\u2026 Uuu, to think there will be a day I will make a new word.]</p><br/><p>\u201cA new word?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I declare that the third option will be called the gamma option!]</p><br/><p>He looked forward to it a little, but it was a name without any surprises whatsoever. He tried his best to not tackle Erta\u2019s words by opening the door to his workshop.</p><br/><p>When he did, as he had expected, he saw that the scene inside his workshop had completely changed.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026You don\u2019t seem to be that suprised?]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m weak in pretending to be surprised. Should I do so now?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fuck off!]</p><br/><p>Of course, the originally lent items such as the hammer, anvil and such metalworking tools have long since gone. However, as if to replace it, tools made from a black metal which he didn\u2019t recognize were inside his workshop, not the ones he himself had prepared.</p><br/><p>Even the fireplace where the Eternal Flame was burning was changed to a bigger and more complex one.</p><br/><p>[Heaven marvelled at your exceptional ability and the results. Heaven has decided to reward you with what you, who has achieved par to, no, surpassing all expectations, with what you deserve. The tools in this workshop right now are made from metals which only appear when Earth evolves two levels more. Although it can\u2019t compare to the tools lent from heaven, even if you acquire harkanium, you would be able to process it with these tools.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was satisfied with the feeling he felt when stroking the new hammer and the anvil. No matter how hard he tried, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make these kind of materpieces with the Metal Hearts he had. It was due to the limitations in material.</p><br/><p>Seeing him like it, Erta also smiled and spoke.</p><br/><p>[I thank you for your work from the bottom of my heart. Yu IlHan, the quest was completed sucessfully.]</p><br/><p>[Quest from Heaven 002. Creating Traps of Destruction, mission complete!]</p><br/><p>[All statuses increase by 5.]</p><br/><p>[Since you have completed the quest surpassing all limits, additional rewards are rewarded.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, a more delightful news could be heard.</p><br/><p>[The rewards aren\u2019t over yet.]</p><br/><p>4 levels\u2019 worth of status, refurbishment of his workshop, information of the Metal Heart Dungeon, Cross Bag that acts as inventory. Even though he might be treated like a thief, Yu IlHan was also feeling insufficient with just these.</p><br/><p>When he looked at Erta with shiny eyes, she, with a serious face, took out an item from her inventory.</p><br/><p>[Record of Extreme Poison Resistance Skill.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He predicted that it would be a skill the moment he saw that the item was shaped like a book. Even in games, skills acquired from external sources usually looked like books.</p><br/><p>Yes, he wasn\u2019t suprised because the reward was a skill. It was because the content of the skill was very shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this very hard to learn!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was expecting poison resistance to a certain extent, but this was extreme poison resistance!</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan exclaimed in shock, Erta laughed with a \u2018fufu\u2019 and spoke.</p><br/><p>[So you do realize how much it\u2019s worth. Not only is it hard to learn weak poison resistance, it\u2019s extremely difficult to evolve it to extreme poison resistance. The difficulty rank of acquiring weak poison resistance is A rank; its training difficulty is about S rank.]</p><br/><p>[At first, we were planning to give you weak poison resistance. However, as your abilities surpassed what we thought, it was increased to weak poison resistance, and as you succeeded in reducing the amount of harkanium needed, it had become extreme poison resistance.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you have extreme poison resistance, you will be able to ignore 4th class monster\u2019s poison. Please notice its value.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I can chew troll meat without worries!\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Yeah, well, that isn\u2019t wrong.]</p><br/><p>Erta looked like she was a bit fed up, but Yu IlHan had no interest in that. He grabbed the book and closed his eyes in excitement, and his predictions weren\u2019t wrong and the words [Will you absorb the essence of the record?] appeared on his retina.</p><br/><p>When he expressed affirmation without hesitation, the book soon emitted light and gradually lost its weight.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>[You have learned Extreme Poison Resistance Skill.]</p><br/><p>Opening his eyes, there was nothing in his hand. Replacing that, a clear change occurred to his body. Now he had the confidence that he would be fine with the poison from monsters\u2019 body. Now he didn\u2019t have to be teased with [If you have resistance!] anymore!</p><br/><p>Although the one to do that was Erta, now that he acquired Extreme Poison Resistance like this, he did feel that those were trivial.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yeah, whatever. I knew you\u2019d say that.]</p><br/><p>Erta nonchalantly passed his confession like nothing, and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>[Then, then, I will give you the last reward.]</p><br/><p>In fact, it didn\u2019t seem like she was entirely effected. Of course, Yu IlHan was already possessed when he heard that there were some rewards left and didn\u2019t realize that Erta had bit her tongue.</p><br/><p>[The last reward is also another piece of information.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s go straight away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gladly nodded his head the moment she said that. Erta was confused since she hadn\u2019t mentioned a single word about the dungeon when Yu IlHan guessed correctly like it was nothing while he was checking the contents of the Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s info about the troll dungeon anyway, right? So, where is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I really hate you\u2026]</p><br/><p>Erta grit her teeth while looking at Yu IlHan who had godly wits in reading the situation due to reading books for several hundread years. However, as he was correct, she couldn\u2019t retort.</p><br/><p>Now that it came to this, she just decided to obediently tell him the location. It was because this was the best comeback.</p><br/><p>[Troll dungeon is in America.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAmerica!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dungeon location info attack was very effective!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s vision became black.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange, I opened my eyes, but I\u2019m not in the P*k*m*n center\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The place you\u2019re going to is not the P*k*m*n center but America!]</p><br/><p>Erta grabbed Yu IlHan\u2019s escapist mentality. Yu IlHan looked at Erta with the gaze \u2018do I really have to go to America?\u2019 but she just mercifully(?) smiled and nodded. He hated such smiles.</p><br/><p>[We have to go to Arizona in America. Well, then. Let\u2019s hurry up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, Erta.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What is it?]</p><br/><p>To Erta, who really did seem confused, Yu IlHan replied with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a passport.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan travelled all the world in several hundred years, and he had even visited Arizona before but he had no passport. Although it was more correct to say that he didn\u2019t need one, even Erta\u2019s two eyes blinked a few times at the unexpected situation.</p><br/><p>[Making a passport and going to America will require at least 5 days. Oh my god, what are you going to do if the troll dungeon is cleared in that period? You\u2019d have no choice but to wait for another troll dungeon to appear or for trolls to reproduce in there.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, for some reason, Yu IlHan was very confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I have officially neven passed through the gate, if it\u2019s now, I\u2019m full of baseless confidence that I can pass through the gate without other people knowing!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Bullshit baseless! That\u2019s called illegal trespassing!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cleanly ignored Erta\u2019s words. Sometimes, there comes a time where humans have to sacrifice small things, for example, their conscience or their morals, for something bigger.</p><br/><p>This was Yu IlHan\u2019s such moment!</p><br/><p>[No matter how cool you wrap it with words, it\u2019s still a crime!]</p><br/><p>This was the moment when Yu IlHan\u2019s stowaway plan had begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be out for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he couldn\u2019t honestly say that he would stowaway to America, Yu IlHan just said that. Although his mother was a bit suprised, she didn\u2019t stop him.</p><br/><p>It was because from the time he had declared that he would quit university, or perhaps even before that, she was vaguely aware that he was doing something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, be careful on your trip. Don\u2019t forget your meals too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say \u2018I have extreme poison resistance so I won\u2019t die even if I pick something up on the street and eat it\u2019. He even more couldn\u2019t say that he was looking forward to which part of the troll meat tasted the best!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t do something like wearing his armor on the street. He just wore the same metallic innerwear that he had given to his parents, then hid it suitably with a leather jacket and black jeans. Finally, he perfectly his his identity with the direwolf skull mask.</p><br/><p>[Even if you don\u2019t do that, they don\u2019t even recognize your concealment, just wear your armor.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I fell.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the outfit that felt like a boy in puberty might wear, Yu IlHan left his house and headed to the airport.</p><br/><p>Although airways were open after the world had stabilized, not only there were very few flights, the price was also astronomical. That was because a few fighter jets would accompany a flight due to the danger of aerial monsters. They were ability users belonging to each government!</p><br/><p>While reading a few articles on the internet related to that, Yu IlHan muttered foolishly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what bait did the government give them for them to go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, please remember that what you may consider worthless may be very valuble to others. You will get hurt if you keep judging with your own standarsd.]</p><br/><p>\u201cErta said something correct, wow\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>To go to Arizona, one had to exchange flights mid way. The quickest flight stopped in Los Angeles, so Yu IlHan also decided to take that flight.</p><br/><p>He succeeded in getting on board without problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, modern inspection system can\u2019t even recognize my concealment skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even modern magic would probably not notice it\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>His stowaway looked very smooth. In fact, it was very smooth.</p><br/><p>Yes, until he arrived in Los Angeles.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a monster army, a monster army is destroying the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he arrived at the airport, he heard something very bad. People were running around everywere, and the flights which were scheduled to fly were changing to delayed.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan quietly spoke after he looked at the people who ran around like the zombie apocalypse had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, your next line is \u2018I think there was a mistake\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think there was a mist\u2026\u2026 Whoa!?]</p><br/><p>Although he said that, Yu IlHan had no plans in blaming Erta. When everything happened as he had calculated, humanity would have never suffered in any way.</p><br/><p>As God wasn\u2019t omnipotent nor omniscient, there was no way that the angels under God\u2019s command would be omnipotent or omniscient either. They did their best for humanity, so only humanity could bear the accidents that happen despite everything.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wore his armor and held his spear.</p><br/><p>Now was the time to overcome the first \u2018Overflow\u2019 on Earth.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>MC reads the plot\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Pokemon series of the nintendo game, when you lose in battle, your vision becomes black and you get moved to the front of the pokemon center.</p><br/><p>What should I hide, I like the main character of Jojo\u2019s bizzare adventures 2nd season, Joseph Joestar the best!</p><br/><p>Item\u2019s ranks are normal -&gt; rare -&gt; unique -&gt; legend -&gt; epic -&gt; chaos, in that order (T/N: I think I saw \u2018God\u2019 somewhere though\u2026)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>\u2026.Kill me.

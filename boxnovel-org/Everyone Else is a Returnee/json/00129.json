The city under the blue sky was bustling with people, and he could hear noisy chattering as well as people bargaining at shops.</p><br/><p>He had come here in his dropout period, but ironically, it was even more strange now that he could feel life here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my god. That fruit vendor, the housewife that\u2019s purchasing goods from him, and even the vendor across the street \u2026\u2026 They\u2019re almost all 2nd classes.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Did they carry out an investigation before invading? It\u2019s as if they\u2019re performing a country-wide play.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>There were definitely people that did not disguise themselves using human skins in Venezuela. They were probably the usual tourists. However, they were joyfully buying apples from a 2nd class fruit vendor without the slightest bit of suspicion. Meaning that they did not notice anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt frightened while looking at that scene. His imagination had turned into half-reality. They were trying to assimilate into Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>[How about language? What are they doing about language?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Artifacts, it\u2019s artifacts. How could this be\u2026\u2026 They didn\u2019t plan this out for just one or two days\u2026\u2026!] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>So such a thing was about to happen to China as well\u2026 If he couldn\u2019t prevent that, then what would have happened\u2026 He felt a frightening shiver all over his body.</p><br/><p>The problem was that Venezuela was now in their hands. He couldn\u2019t even fathom how much their plans had progressed.</p><br/><p>If there was one good thing, it was that they invaded an archipelago in the Atlantic. If they had devoured the entire South American continent, there wouldn\u2019t be a need to invade those small islands.</p><br/><p>Yu ilHan thought about what he had to do in order to stop this invasion. Just how could he kill these people who devoured an entire country\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026when he realized one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I can differentiate them?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not because their average level is higher than the tourists?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not for such a simple reason. There are many high leveled tourists as well. I can somehow do it\u2026\u2026 aha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was conversing with Liera, he succeeded in finding the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve acquired their records through killing thousands of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was like that when killing dragonkin and dragons as well. Since he had killed so many of them, at some point, he knew what kind of dragon used what kind of power or what kind of weaknesses they had.</p><br/><p>It was the same right now. Since he had killed so many of a specific world\u2019s residents continuously, he became to understand their characteristics and now could differentiate them; as if determining a type of a monster, or determining prey.</p><br/><p>Even if they were using a special disguise that did not use magic, they could not deceive the Akashic Record.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, its like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled. Now that things became like this, all the moments of hesitation were meaningless. He was the one who was going to wipe them out anyway, so it would be enough for only he himself to be able to differentiate them!</p><br/><p>To think wiping out the invaders in the archipelago would bring such results\u2026 He thought about this from the past, but he always seemed to have quite the luck at appropriate moments.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they asked for this as well. From now, they\u2019ll compensate for their arrogance in deceiving the people of Earth.</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t realize that it was possible to differentiate them with the Akashic Record.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Well, we did think that they were all the same humans. And there\u2019s not much opportunity to kill thousands of humans at once\u2026\u2026 Oh! I don\u2019t mean you\u2019re bad, IlHan!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan decided to not be ruled by the extremely ambiguous concept of good and evil. He just resolved to protect himself, to be true to his heart, and resolutely trudge on the path he had set his sights on. That was also the reason he could endure a millennium of solitude.</p><br/><p>As such, even if what he was about to do now may look very evil, Yu IlHan wouldn\u2019t mind it so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun\u2026.. Kahk!\u201d</p><br/><p>When people started dying, the market naturally fell into chaos. Everyone moved around in panic to protect themselves, and the panic of the tourists were even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh, what the hell is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember this. Susanoo also used something like\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, the people are all dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people escaped the place, but no one on Earth was faster than Yu IlHan. Moving around busily, he bestowed death upon all the other-worlders within his range.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>When nothing else worked, they tried to mix in with the tourist group, but it was all useless. Yu IlHan\u2019s spears killed them in pinpoint.</p><br/><p>It took less than 0.1 seconds from the time a dragon bone spear appeared in the air to the time it killed the enemy. If they weren\u2019t at least mid-level 3rd class, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to react properly. 1</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, they realized that something was wrong. Since they were found out before they proceeded onto the next stage, disguising themselves was now meaningless.</p><br/><p>\u201cClean these up first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReport to the higher-ups!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if this was all promised beforehand, they took out weapons they hid in one part of their bodies and tried to kill the tourists.</p><br/><p>They were quite vicious, as they were trying to erase any evidence even when they were under attack. Perhaps, they hid themselves exactly in order to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Yu IlHan had predicted that already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKhaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKahk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was difficult for him to read all movements of all people in this wide area, most of it was resolved when he threw spears to whoever he saw.</p><br/><p>Moreover, at this point, some of the tourists started noticing some things, so they tried to not move towards the residents.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, just how can this be\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind the enemy! If rumors spread before we finish working, then it will be the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the survivors moved around busily. Some to find the enemy, some to report above, and some to escape this sudden calamity.</p><br/><p>And one, to kill all these fuckers.</p><br/><p>[Over a thousand died within 1 minute.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[It seems it isn\u2019t a single country that is involved in this. Unless they are a great empire that has power over an entire world, this is impossible.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start moving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It took two hours for Yu IlHan to clean up the capital. As he had moved while decimating the other worlders in one spot, they couldn\u2019t even communicate with others, and were doing their duties in their own place. For Yu IlHan, this was very thankful.</p><br/><p>He poured spears, killed the people, and collected them inside his inventory before moving. As if hammering away to make equipment, he repeated those movements.</p><br/><p>That figure was akin to a machine rather than a human. This kind of unaesthetic and inhumane massacre was very bone-chilling.</p><br/><p>Even Spiera, who did not care about what Yu IlHan was thinking, and only cared about Yu IlHan\u2019s ability, became slightly uncomfortable. However, Yu IlHan did not show any change in expression and repeated his actions.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the surviving people, of Earth, were trying to upload things to their SNS while escaping the tragedy caused by Yu IlHan, but unfortunately, internet was down over all of Venezuela. There was no way the SNS was working.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working dammit! It\u2019s an important news about Susanoo massacring the people of Venezuela!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, I need to tell this to the people of Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Really, they should just escape underground in the time they have time to do that, but these people really were hopeless. Looking at them, Spiera nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>[I knew SNS was a waste of life.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Hah! Good for them.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, something collectively happened to you angels right? I won\u2019t laugh so please say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The angels shut their mouths. Yu IlHan also gave up and continued \u2018cleaning\u2019.</p><br/><p>[Kuaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>[You! Earthling! It was you!]</p><br/><p>Whether it was monsters or humans, \u2018thoughts\u2019 weren\u2019t left behind that often, but as Yu IlHan had killed so many, he acquired quite a lot of \u2018thoughts\u2019.</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan was planning to kill all the other worlders that came to Earth, he didn\u2019t mind them that much, but after not being able to find their roots even though he had wiped out many cities of Venezuela, he stopped for a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should interrogate some people first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place Yu IlHan was in currently, was the largest state of Venezuela, Bol\u00edvar. He had killed almost all the other-worlders in cities he passed by until now.</p><br/><p>If he could not find any path connecting to another world in Venezuela, he had to go over to Guyana, Brazil, or Columbia, but really, he didn\u2019t want to imagine such a situation.</p><br/><p>Not only would it mean that damage had spread that far, the possibility of them surviving would become higher as well.</p><br/><p>As such, now he needed to go to a specific place.</p><br/><p>[Interrogate? How are you going to interrogate?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Is it the power of a deathgod? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a deathgod that rules and controls souls, though?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Oh, so there were such deathgods as well, huh. Well, it should rather be said that a violent deathgod that burns lifeforce to make a flame was rare. Although he did learn Soul enchant from Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s mutated soul, but it was just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do not know yet. Skills are only the crystallization of human abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course we know that. Even though I look like this I lived several times lo\u2026\u2026 [email\u00a0protected]#$%] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera covered her own mouth after blabbering on as if natural. However, just as Yu IlHan was about to pretend that nothing had happened, Spiera said a rather cruel line.</p><br/><p>[Several times? Don\u2019t you mean, tens of times?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not, IT\u2019S NOT! It really isn\u2019t!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Not minding about the super-mini war between angels, Yu IlHan did his own stuff.</p><br/><p>[We have nothing to tell you!]</p><br/><p>[We are just a portion. The great plan is already proceeding so someone like you will not be able to stop it!]</p><br/><p>He did not mind about whatever the thoughts said. Yu IlHan alone wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to them anyway. As such, he took out Eight-tailed dragon spear from his inventory and ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meal time. First, let\u2019s eat them all and leave 20 behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Krrrrrrrrraaaaar!]</p><br/><p>Such was the beginning of soul interrogation.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you think you should call that \u2018preying\u2019?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[So thoughts have their own world. That\u2019s deep\u2026\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Some of the thoughts that came with the lifeforce had some tenacity. They, were all eaten by Orochi, and seeing that, the remainder \u2018shook\u2019 in \u2018fear\u2019 of a second death even though they were just fragments of souls, and spat out information.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, with his experience of gathering important information from numerous text, picked out all related information and completed a small fragment of truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the world you came from is Ferata.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ttttttttthat is so!]</p><br/><p>With those words, Yu IlHan glanced at Liera and Spiera. The two nodded. They must be thinking about the angels working in Ferata. Of course, as they were not in contact with any angel on Earth right now, punishments would come later.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the time the people of Earth went over to Ferata, this was planned by the great empire Ferata Ma Kadra, and became possible after the Army of Brilliant Light contacted them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y, yeees!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were careful since you could open only one gate, and focused on Venezuela and its nearby islands first since you had to take root before the people focused on Abandoned Worlds were freed.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Th, that is so! It has only been 3 days since the plan began operations on Earth. We have not secured any further territories than Venezuela\u2026\u2026.! If the 2nd class knights successfully place themselves, then the 1st class soldiers would come over and will take the skins of the countries beyond Venezuela. That was the plan!]</p><br/><p>As if asking Siri, answer was immediate. Yu IlHan laughed with a \u2018fuu\u2019 and confirmed with them for one last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, where is the dungeon located?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The location that will not be found out by anyone, at the same time being placed in a convenient place to acquire Venezuela and its nearby islands\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s an underground dungeon located in the deep Atlantic.]</p><br/><p>Looking at Spiera, Yu IlHan smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee my future prediction?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.This human is starting to get annoying\u2026\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan invested two more hours to decimate all hidden Ferateans hiding in Venezuela and looked through all the small countries nearby, but he really couldn\u2019t find any more of them.</p><br/><p>Although he moved as fast as possible, Venezuela was doomed with the exception of extremely small places. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t save them. As such, he had to prevent the worse-case scenario.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know what kind of communication methods they used to the HQ, since hours had passed since their massacre, HQ would probably send reinforcements or do something of that sort.</p><br/><p>Nothing good would come out of them knowing that Yu IlHan had massacred them all. He had to move right now.</p><br/><p>Well, then. This was the start.</p><br/><p>Now was the time to wipe out their base.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The power of the Akashic Record!</p><br/><p>Angels are afraid of the SNS</p><br/><p>Orochi got some screentime today.</p><br/><p>Siri is the personal secretary program developed by Apple. I also have it on my IPad, but I never used it before\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Mass spear throws using remote collection is mostly used when cleaning out minor mobs. Although he can use it when facing higher levelled enemies, but that\u2019s just for support.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Sorry to all readers that reside in Venezuela\u2026.</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

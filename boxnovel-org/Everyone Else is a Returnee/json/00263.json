Yu IlHan, we want you to protect Miss Kang MiRae during the process.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds very suspicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Any more than this is too dangerous to talk about within a lower word.]</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even expect the angel to be truthful with everything. She probably means that they won\u2019t be able to escape once they heard the story. This basically meant that they had to follow whatever the Heaven\u2019s Army requested them to do if they wanted the two God-ranked artifacts\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan pondered for a little but eventually nodded his head. Kang MiRae said she\u2019d do it, so there was no reason for him to refuse either.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s go get the prepayment.\u201d</p><br/><p>[B, before that. I\u2019ll go report to the higher-ups.]</p><br/><p>Titaera stood up powerlessly like a middle schooler that failed in buying a game that was just released, even though he had lined up from dawn for it.</p><br/><p>Keduta was about to support her but was given a glare and shrunk back. It was definitely a gaze that contained \u2018if you had just moved a little faster and procured Kang MiRae!\u2019 or something along those lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease select ones that fit us. One will be used by Miss MIRae so one related to magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I understand.]</p><br/><p>Titaera left like that. After sending her off, Yu IlHan sighed and loosened his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has become a pain. I thought we wouldn\u2019t have to fight for quite a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you could have just rejected their request. The one they wanted was me in the first place too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t trust them anymore. I can\u2019t send you, alone Miss MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Yu IlHan had said that out of pure worry, it was an arrow to Kang MiRae\u2019s pink-colored heart. However, Yu IlHan ignored the fact that Kang MIRae was blushing and fidgeting, and stretched his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much time left, so I should make a trump card just in case. If I could only use the Hourglass of Eternity again, then I could have surpassed the limit of the Flying fortress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA trump card?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera tilted her head. Yu IlHan lightly nodded and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might need Pat\u00e9\u2019s power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPat\u00e9\u2019s\u2026\u2026? Don\u2019t tell me you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s eyes trembled. What she thought of was the intact bodies of higher existences inside Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to try entering the field of necromancy? It would be hard if you don\u2019t get used to the class like Pat\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, rather than undead, it should be classified as a living doll\u2026\u2026 I want to do something about those annoying thought-souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>[What do you mean annoying?]</p><br/><p>There was a fresh and lively voice that replied to Yu IlHan\u2019s words. It was none other than the thought-soul of the Succubus Queen Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>[I only want to tell my darling of my endlessly straight and pure love.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNot all \u2018straight\u2019 and \u2018pure\u2019 things are good; you know? Look at me. I was a \u2018straight\u2019 and \u2018pure\u2019 loner, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied to Heli\u00e8na\u2019s thought-soul in a cold voice. Liera asked him with worried eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, is it fine to believe her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I did not accept her for one is because I couldn\u2019t trust her, but it was also because I could not accept her very existence. However, both of them have completely been solved right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liera tilted her head in confusion, Yu IlHan continued explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth Heli\u00e8na\u2019s thought-soul, and her body, are, in the end, the \u2018previous\u2019 Heli\u00e8na. They\u2019re not the same being. And if it\u2019s a thought-soul, I can trust it however much I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I did say this before, but you could have trusted me while I was not a thought-soul too! Darling really likes to be reassured. What should I do? I love that part of you as well. Darling, can you feel my love?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan only replied with a snort at the thought-soul Heli\u00e8na\u2019s proactive approach and looked around at his other companions before clapping his hands to gather attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon\u2019s Army, and the ones that still haven\u2019t acquired their 4th class will be left on Earth for this battle. This is too difficult for anyone under the 4th class. The rest of you, please prepare for battle in your respective positions. Oh, Erta, you help me out with Pat\u00e9.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, I shall get Pat\u00e9 here then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul noticed that her son was about to do something amazing and her eyes shined. Wasn\u2019t this the perfect moment to witness one of the countless abilities that her son had?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds very interesting. I want to watch too. Is it something secretive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s fine if you watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan allowed her to watch with a light heart. Like that, Yu IlHan, Yumir, Kang MiRae, Na YuNa, Kim YeSeul, Pat\u00e9, Jirl, Mirey, Ericia, Liera and Erta \u2013 a total of eleven \u2013 gathered in Yu IlHan\u2019s workshop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy!? I said go prepare!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we are curious\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera blurred the end of her lines. In fact, her true intention was to watch over Yu IlHan to see if he did something bad, but there was no way she could say that. Yu IlHan\u2019s gaze turned to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparation for battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to watch, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, this shouldn\u2019t be possible, but Miss YuNa. Can you cast anti-charm barrier onto the group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Lady Leytna. Pleaseeeee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after checking that everyone was cast with the barrier did Yu IlHan start the work. What he first took out was the Cradle of Miracles. Inside, he poured Echjar\u2019s blood, and took out Heli\u00e8na\u2019s body from his inventory and let it float on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could His Majesty stab such a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Goddammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her skin had turned pale, she was completely intact, except for her heart that Yu IlHan stabbed, and the skin. Nobody would be surprised even if she suddenly woke up and walked around. Seeing that, Pat\u00e9 made an expression of absolute despair and told Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, it is impossible with my current power to make such a powerful undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. You just need to lead my imagination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s work was usually done through three processes.</p><br/><p>First was the item crafting \u2013 blacksmith. This was the one Yu IlHan had the most confidence in, and was also the foundation of the creation of countless artifacts.</p><br/><p>The second was of course, mana crafting. Yu IlHan also had talent for this field as well, and after absorbing the essence of magic engineering and handling all sorts of items, at the current point in time, he could do it just as well as blacksmithing.</p><br/><p>The third was soul enchant, the power of the deathgod he had acquired from Reta Kar\u2019iha. In this field, he was confident as well like the previous two, as he had grown as a Deathgod until now.</p><br/><p>And this time, there was no need for the first process.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a completed product in itself. It\u2019s not something I can touch.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my\u2026\u2026 you do have eyes for girls, darling.]</p><br/><p>He ignored the thought-soul\u2019s voice and put his hand on Heli\u00e8na\u2019s chest. It was the part where his spear had pierced.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe materials for mana crafting is already within the remains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA 7th class magic stone. That\u2019s an amazing material.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd to add\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cut open his palm and drew out blood. The moment Yu IlHan\u2019s blood fell upon the punctured heart, the Cradle of Miracles reacted with a \u2018voon\u2019 sound. Echjar\u2019s blood that filled the cradle, started resonating violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cPat\u00e9, grab my hand. And draw out your aura to the fullest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pat\u00e9, who was more beautiful than most female elves (but was strictly male), grabbed Yu IlHan\u2019s hand while blushing. He had to bring out all his power as an Archer of Destiny and transfer it to Yu IlHan!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan calmly accepted Pat\u00e9\u2019s power, recorded it and analyzed it. Mana crafting had commenced from this moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pat\u00e9\u2019s power that allows him to go against the laws and make the dead arise again and move them around to his wishes \u2013 what I need is only a portion of that. I only have to bring the back the body alive again. I\u2019m not making an undead. I\u2019m making hardware.\u2019</p><br/><p>The 7th class magic stone inside Heli\u00e8na\u2019s body came into contact with Yu IlHan\u2019s blood. With blinding light, an enormous amount of mana burst out like water from a broken dam, but Erta and Kim YeSeul who were prepared for this used their magic to return it to the body. Kang MiRae also helped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is an amazing power\u2026\u2026! Son, did you really fight against this individual!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t exactly call that a \u2018fight\u2019\u2026\u2026 but yeah, you can take it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grasping a single strand of mana and making it circulate inside Heli\u00e8na\u2019s body \u2013 once the flow of mana was controlled, regenerating wounds was a simple matter. What was important was to make the regenerated heart beat again. He had to erase any remaining will inside the body and make the body just a empty shell of a biological structure!</p><br/><p>[Darling\u2026\u2026 amazing, you know me better than I do\u2026\u2026? I\u2019m so happy!]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s thought-soul exclaimed. Immediately after that, the mana that was exploding outwards went back inside as if time was being reversed. The pale skin of the body seemed to glow for a little, before color returned to her skin!</p><br/><p>\u201cAah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVitality is coming back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Echjar\u2019s blood, that supported the floating body, rippled, the ripple was very periodic \u2013 it was according to Heli\u00e8na\u2019s heartbeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rather, now that the mana was all concentrated, this was the more important of a moment. Any mistake would make the mana go berserk and make the body explode along with the entire Flying fortress! Yu IlHan controlled the flow of mana while bringing out the concentration he used to pick lots for cleaning back in his middle school days.</p><br/><p>And an unknown amount of time had passed since he had started. A single line of text appeared on Yu IlHan\u2019s retina, quietly.</p><br/><p>[You have mastered Mana crafting. You possess the talent to bestow mana to recreate an item that no one can catch up to. Perhaps the end of that ability may be related to creation. The future path must be created by you.]</p><br/><p>Echjar\u2019s blood that resonated with the heartbeat slowly started being absorbed by her body. Vitality came back to her skin as time passed, and after some time, it even started breathing mana. Perhaps some onlookers may think that she was really sleeping. Kim YeSeul and the others could only be left dumbstruck by the miracle.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera wasn\u2019t too late in catching Yu IlHan from collapsing after all the work had been done.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, there\u2019s still one process left. If we don\u2019t do it immediately, there will be a variable. A new consciousness may arise in a body without prior consciousness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s for a little, I can slow down the time that the body feels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>He never knew his mom would be so heartening! With the support from his mother, he regained a little time to breath, and immediately went on to the next process.</p><br/><p>It was none other than the soul enchant process, as well as the one that had to precede it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to accept you as my subordinate now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So you\u2019re finally accepting my heart!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I wanted to do that, I wouldn\u2019t have gone through such a troublesome process. You should know what I\u2019m thinking. You are already someone completely different from \u2018Heli\u00e8na\u2019, and I\u2019m only using a loyal thought-soul and the remains of Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this was also the reason why Yu IlHan did not need to hesitate to work on this. However, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s thought-soul rejected him outright.</p><br/><p>[However, darling should already know. Darling\u2019s power had broken through the limits a long time ago, and as a result, I, who is now in your consciousness, have a very clear self-consciousness. I do not think that I\u2019m completely intact, but I do think that it\u2019s at least more than 60%. So, darling has just split the soul in half by killing Heli\u00e8na. Aah, I only pity the other half of my soul that had disappeared for eternity.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Why are you telling me all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, Heli\u00e8na spoke words that even made Yu IlHan very dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>[Because you might be disappointed after you learn of it later. I do not want to get hated by you, darling\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As you know already, I cannot hide a single thing from you right now. Do you get that you\u2019ve made a mistake?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan went silent; it was a very difficult thing to receive such direct intentions from the thought-soul.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He bit his lips and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cProve it to me that I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My beloved, I was waiting for you to say that line.]</p><br/><p>A thick tie that could not be severed by anything, was connected. Yu IlHan\u2019s Rule skill activated.</p><br/><p>[You have mastered the skill, Rule. You may evolve the skill once you fulfill the necessary requirements.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m Heli\u00e8na, darling. Like I always was, and like I always will be.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You have accepted \u2018Heli\u00e8na\u2019 as your subordinate.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan decided to acknowledge the current her. Then he enchanted her to what was originally her body.</p><br/><p>It was a very quiet process, and there was no exaggerating the violence of mana like mana crafting.</p><br/><p>However, this was no different from the start of a huge incident that may shake the future of all factions.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na was planned to die and experience recreation from the very beginning!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Anybody think of \u2018Kimi no na wa\u2019 when IlHan said \u201cYour name\u2026\u2026\u201d?</p><br/><p>kek</p><br/><p>PR (chamber nim is such a weeb!) says me\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

These people did not like the fact that they would have to put their lives on the line to return Earth to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this way of living is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>This\u2026\u2026 clan from the Front Line Alliance which he did not know the name of, but the master of this clan shrugged his shoulders as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to risk my life. Oh, I\u2019m not treating you like a fool, nor do I think that this is hopeless. However\u2026\u2026 a lot of things have already changed. Returning everything back to how it once was sounds, well, inefficient to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEfficiency, you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t everyone doing well in other worlds? But from your words, Earth will become more dangerous than these other worlds, no? If so, staying here will be the happier and safer alternative. Isn\u2019t it natural that we would think like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. He did expect someone to mention that, but\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked the guy in an emotionless voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think they\u2019re all doing well? And that I need to leave them alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s question, he was silent for a little, before turning his head away from him and replying to him in a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not as strong as you\u2026\u2026 so I can\u2019t even imagine resisting against the angels. If I had absolute power like you, I would have been able to act just and cool like you. But I\u2019m not, am I? Insult me however you wish\u2026\u2026 but the vast majority of humans, including me, have something called limits in their courage and talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan decided to give up on persuading him. Perhaps they were similar to their clan leader, or perhaps they wanted to stay by his side, the clan members wished to remain in that world as well, so he had to leave without any gains.</p><br/><p>His companions only chatted while looking at the scenery from the Guardian fortress since he didn\u2019t put any of his emotions on the surface, but Orochi, who could share his complex feelings to a little extent, spoke to Yu IlHan, which was very unlike him.</p><br/><p>[You haven\u2019t forgotten that you are a very special case, right? His reactions could be said to be reasonable. In fact, those that follow you without any hesitation are the strange ones.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m also aware that I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t want to consider his millennium alone on Earth as luck, he could not deny the fact that he reached his current level of ability through a very special process. Perhaps that was precisely why something nagged his mind.</p><br/><p>However, Orochi didn\u2019t seem to like his reply and heaved a sigh.</p><br/><p>[I will not say anything if you want to say that is luck, but you have no confidence in your own ability. I think that you can have more assurance in yourself.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re trying to say. \u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t know there would come a day I would say these words to you, but thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Everyone keeps changing for as long as they are alive. Although I cannot say that I am \u2018alive\u2019 right now\u2026\u2026 I also feel the slightest bit of thanks when I feel my transformed self.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really have to say \u2018the slightest bit\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you know that I\u2019m not in a position to be completely thankful to you, you should be aware that my expression of appreciation is a miracle in and of itself? Haha.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan subconsciously laughed while conversing with Orochi. Once, he had fought against him with his life on the line, but it was funny that they were having a heartfelt conversation right now.</p><br/><p>Everyone changes, whether slowly or rapidly, through encounters with other beings, and Yu IlHan was no exception. He was simply unable to feel it when he was a loner.</p><br/><p>If he han known this before, then perhaps he would have treated his thousand years he spent on Earth with Liera a little differently \u2013 that was the only disappointing fact.</p><br/><p>Putting that aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi, don\u2019t you need a body?\u201d</p><br/><p>[For now, I feel the most joy rampaging around as your weapon on the battlefield, so I do not see the need just yet. Hm, I see. I shall request it at a later date.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, okay. I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that he would get an interesting result if he used Echjar\u2019s body, but to do that, he had to raise Orochi\u2019s league a little. As Orochi grew as Yu IlHan did, it seemed like there was indeed a method to do that, it was impossible for now. Possessing a 4th class dragon right now didn\u2019t mean anything after all.</p><br/><p>[So it wasn\u2019t kindness towards me but your desire to make something strange again.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take it as killing two birds with one stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, the Warp skill activated and transported the companions to Earth again. Immediately, the magic formation started pressuring Yu IlHan and his companions. If he brought someone else back, he would have to slow the speed of the Guardian fortress to protect them, but unfortunately, he had none.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we go to the next world right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, don\u2019t you need to open that barrier soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan checked the state of the Hourglass. As he had been to several worlds that were not Earth, the cool-down time of the Hourglass of Eternity was decreasing without being affected much by Earth, and from the looks of it, another four days were required for him to re-use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I think I can go to around 30 more worlds in that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Whew, darling likes to work so much. Don\u2019t you want to enjoy a date with me once in a while?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even dream of it. Yu IlHan can even endure Liera\u2019s seduction.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But I\u2019m not that scatterbrain ex-angel. Darling, play with me, please?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pushed away Heli\u00e8na\u2019s face after she lightly ignored Erta\u2019s remarks and tried to hit on him. Then, he checked whether the Will of the Guardian was still in place, as well as the millions of artifacts scattered over Earth, before activating Warp to his next destination.</p><br/><p>That world had met its doom.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this looks worse than Guundia.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling, the people of Earth\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYu IlHan landed on one of the civilizations that had burnt to the ground and activated the Record skill. After reading through the records slowly, he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is not a single person belonging to Earth in this world anymore. And they were quite a strong clan too\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBelonging to Earth? You mean that there were\u2026\u2026 other people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan acknowledged Kim YeSeul\u2019s sharp remarks and activated the Warp skill once again. He couldn\u2019t help it since he didn\u2019t know, but it wasn\u2019t like he could just ignore the surviving people suffering due to monsters, so he planned to do everything he could do for them.</p><br/><p>When he moved with Warp, there was a war between a patch of humans and a field of monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cArggggggh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun\u2026\u2026 everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuoaaaaaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>[Disgusting humans, bad tasting and weak things.]</p><br/><p>[End them all! End them all!]</p><br/><p>The majority of the humans could not understand monsters\u2019 speech, but Yu IlHan felt disgusted whenever he heard monsters speaking. They were the same wherever he went!</p><br/><p>Perhaps there was no development from them because they had no creativity \u2013 thought Yu IlHan as he shot out all the artifacts. The group of artifacts that swept the monsters looked akin to an army of Valkyries on orders of a god.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hide anything here. Wipe them all out!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Darling, want some help?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll appreciate it if you do. Let\u2019s finish this quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yu IlHan gave the permission, Heli\u00e8na unfurled her wings and flew upwards. Erta and Kim YeSeul also used their abilities to wipe out the monsters in the surroundings. The ones that were fighting against the monsters in the battlefield were shocked after they saw them</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monsters\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre disappearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>[Cri\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, aaaah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026God.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monsters in the vicinity were massacred, and Yu IlHan didn\u2019t stop there and made the Guardian fortress wipe out the monsters in other regions as well. Seeing that, someone whispered lightly in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that must be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod himself has come to a world that the angels abandoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even know that the people were treating him as a God, and focused on killing the monsters. He had no plans on wiping all the monsters in this world, but he at least planned to dispose of monsters that were near to human settlements.</p><br/><p>Like that, around 3 hours passed when the cleaning was almost finished. Yu IlHan ignored the people who were absent-mindedly staring at the fortress and was about to Warp away. However, Heli\u00e8na grabbed his hand lightly at that moment.</p><br/><p>[Darling, it seems like they have something to say.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan looked down, he did definitely hear the people shouting something. He really wished to ignore them but\u2026\u2026 he shrugged his shoulders and lowered the Guardian fortress. The closer he became, the clearer he could hear them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease stay by our side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Lord God, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>God? Him? Yu IlHan became absent-minded for a moment since he could not understand when Heli\u00e8na finally burst out laughing. He stared at Heli\u00e8na and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a human though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do not mind how you think you are. To us, you are God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease save us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh God, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were complete thieves alright. Of course, he knew their urgency, and their hopes to grab onto a piece of straw if necessary, but Yu IlHan wasn\u2019t in the leisure to play Sim City in another world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you need to protect this world on your own. I came here looking for something else but it was no longer here, I\u2019m planning to leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please take us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a world that\u2019s incomparably harsher than this place. Even if you follow me, what awaits you is even harsher suffering so endure in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t God in that place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease save us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people eventually got on their knees and put their heads on the ground, which made Yu IlHan dumbfounded. He somehow felt like he felt something similar not too long ago\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s going well, isn\u2019t it, darling?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na only smiled suspiciously. Yu IlHan was agonized for a moment, but he couldn\u2019t find a way to stop the people who were courting death so he could only reply like this.</p><br/><p>After that, Yu IlHan had travelled many other worlds as well, but a portion of them had already met its doom, or were heading towards one. The majority of the survivors wished to go under Yu IlHan, and he brought them back to Earth, even while not understanding why.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae and company experienced the same thing, and the ones that were brought to Earth by them bowed their heads towards Yu IlHan and the others even while moving slowly due to the effects of the magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeeeeeeeeeee shhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllll llllllllllllooooooooooooooooyaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllll-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders while looking at the people who acted like clowns.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their lives. I guess it\u2019s up to them to decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four days later, Yu IlHan finally became able to reactivate the Hourglass of Eternity. The number of worlds he had been to in the meantime was 42, four of which had met its doom.</p><br/><p>At this point, the number of people from other worlds numbered over one hundred thousand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

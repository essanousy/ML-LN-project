Because I\u2019m pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>A little after he chased them, he could hear the two chatting. The woman\u2019s high and mighty pride, the man\u2019s uninterested replies. The conversation made Yu IlHan confused since he thought they were a couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s hard just with the two of uuuus. Wouldn\u2019t he have helped us if we told them we\u2019ll give everything to him other than the poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if he says he wants that poison? Or if he asks us where we would use it? Moreover, the fact that we know of information about dungeons may sound unfair to others just by itself. We should always be careful with out mouths.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Kang HaJin\u2019s sharp counterarguments, Yu IlHan almost burst out in laughter. It was quite impressive that despite saying that he should be careful of what he was saying, he was saying stuff quite carelessly.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan continued following them. He could see Na YuNa grumbling while putting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can just say that it\u2019s the reward from Heaven\u2019s quest. Moreover, no matter how I see it, he\u2019s a good guuuuuy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really wonder how you grew up to that age that purely even with your appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because oppa and Mirae protected me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed they had their own circumstances. Moreover, poison? Were they here for the scorpions and not the trolls in the first place? Yu IlHan looked towards Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you honestly say what really happened, I will forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t know. I really didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t I already say that I thought this was a dungeon where only trolls lived!? So please stop looking at me as if looking down. It\u2019s making me frustrated.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting more suspicious. I even think there maybe another foreshadow to make me suffer, even though I\u2019m moving while predicting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Please stop. I think the word foreshadow might bring out a Gestalt collapse.]</p><br/><p>Even while conversing with Erta, Yu IlHan kept thinking.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s poison, he got one after killing the giant sand scorpion. Didn\u2019t they want that? A poison of a different type? Or a stronger type? Although it wasn\u2019t a problem if they wanted another type, if they wanted a stronger one\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, that\u2019s definitely a 3rd class one.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I knew you would say that.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became excited. It really was a great choice to follow them! Although it was a little sneaky!</p><br/><p>[I think a scorpion is about to ambush them.]</p><br/><p>\u201cScorpions are mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying a line like a cheetah looking for a floured cookie, Yu IlHan took out a weapon. The thing which was embedded between the gaps of the gauntlet were the Metal Heart skewers.</p><br/><p>[Can I get angry now?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only an experiment to confirm the strength and practicality of an item made with Metal Hearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Not an experiment to research how you can pose yourself in a cool position with metal skewers?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know me too well\u2026\u2026 Lita took several tens of years before she saw through me.\u201d</p><br/><p>(T/N: Do remember that for the first few decades, Lita didn\u2019t stay with</p><br/><p>him 24/7)</p><br/><p>However, even though he was found out, he had no plans in stopping it! If it was such a weak resolve, he wouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.</p><br/><p>With a useless resolution, Yu IlHan threw the four Metal Heart skewers in his gauntlet.</p><br/><p>The power of max level shooting added with the surprise attack option attached on his armor, 4 Metal Heart skewers pierced through the air with unbelievable strength for being simple skewers, before embedding themselves on the sneakily moving scorpion\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 697,290 experience.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I need a specific value, but it was an instakill.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t comment on that.]</p><br/><p>As it was still a distance away from Na YuNa and company, the two didn\u2019t notice the sand scorpion. Of course, they also didn\u2019t know that Yu IlHan had recovered the Metal Heart skewers, and put the scorpion\u2019s body into the Cross Bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why does the angel on them not notice us? Moreover, they even got ambushed last time, why did she leave that alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Angels cannot bring out their full power on earth. Moreover, didn\u2019t I tell you last time? That there are not many things a guardian angel can do. Interfering the lives of humans too much goes against the rules of Heaven, so even if we know of an ambush, we cannot prevent it happening. Although, notifying isn\u2019t a problem.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, in other words, you are useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kuhk.]</p><br/><p>They kept following Na YuNa\u2019s back. While keeping a vague distance, and hunting the scorpions following them.</p><br/><p>[You have earned 653,755 experience.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, they don\u2019t notice me well if I attack fast with a long ranged attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you shoot machine guns in the same position, they would notice you. Skewer attacks are unexpected effective.]</p><br/><p>Erta didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that, but a concealed attack while in concealment sometimes maintained the concealment.</p><br/><p>More specifically, there was a high chance of concealment being maintained if the enemy doesn\u2019t now what it was attacked by until the moment they were attacked. Of course, it was a probability problem, so he couldn\u2019t believe in it fully.</p><br/><p>[I will get angry if you start throwing skewers at 3rd class monsters.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I really won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>And some time passed before the man and the woman noticed that something strange was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did the scorpions\u2019 ambush decrease?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe the terrain changed? We still see trolls sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be bad if even the massive scorpion disappears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a massive scorpion, but the Giant Death Stalker.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s expectations surged when he heard the frightening name, which sounded like it was definitely a 3rd class monster. However, the following conversation shattered his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we kill it by ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a 2nd class monster in the end. Moreover, if we can\u2019t do it, then we will just retreat. You have the scroll right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better for you to have it, oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to get caught by another scorpion-like last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should have been the prelude to the meeting with the Dark Knight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Giant Death Stalker was a 2nd class monster? Even though it has such a cool and long name, it\u2019s a mere 2nd class!?</p><br/><p>He felt like grabbing Kang HaJin and shouting at him to confirm if it really was a 2nd class monster, but he barely held it in. They had no sin, only, Yu IlHan had misunderstood all by himself.</p><br/><p>Dejected, Yu IlHan muttered with a tired voice. His gaze was heading over the horizon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave them that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s? Oh, it appeared, eh?]</p><br/><p>It was definite that the thing called Giant Death Stalker had a skill related to concealment. It was clear just with the fact that Yu IlHan had noticed it first, and Erta, a step late.</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t you become the God of Concealment later?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you make me into one, I\u2019ll make you exclusive to me and make you suffer all your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I, if you can do it, then why don\u2019t you try\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s cheeks reddened. Since she was resenting herself for thinking that maybe not so bad, she had missed the spectacle of the Giant Death Stalker charging through the highlands with a high speed. Around that time, Kang HaJin and Na YuNa also noticed its presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuhk, the reason trivial mobs didn\u2019t appear is because there was a boss nearby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to exclaim. Buff! Quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Make oppa stronger, yaaaapp!\u201d</p><br/><p>The incantation was as out of place as always! However, the effect of the chant was definite. The man holding a shield with an incomparable might from before was going towards the Giant DeathStalker!</p><br/><p>\u201cIyaaaaaaaaap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin, charging towards the scorpion with a buff, was a grand spectacle, like Don Quixote to a windmill, and a warrior to a dragon.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was a feeble priestess behind him with both of her hand put together, believing in the man! Here was the main character of a fantasy.</p><br/><p>Seeing up to that point, Yu IlHan became petty and turned his head away.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I don\u2019t even want to share anything with them if I lose to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[We should. Listening to them, they seemed to have the means to escape even if they encounter danger. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose to them or not.]</p><br/><p>It was the moment Yu IlHan turned his gaze away from the fight between the scorpion and the warrior-priestess duo.</p><br/><p>He suddenly saw a truly huge shadow casting over them.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that troll is also a 2nd class?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do you want my answer?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled while looking at the troll with a massive body enough to squish Na YuNa, Kang HaJin, and the Giant Death Stalker included at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill it so you don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><br/><p>And without a shred of hesitation, he took out the pile bunker from his Cross Bag,</p><br/><p>[Mad Heaven\u2019s deathblow pile bunker]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Unique]</p><br/><p>[Attack power \u2013</p><br/><p>5th stage : 6,200]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 50% increase in attack, 100% increase in penetrability, destroyed after use]</p><br/><p>[Durability 1/1]</p><br/><p>[A destructive weapon with all its might focused into a single attack. It has an unstable structure which would break down after one shot, but the attack of the self-destructing weapon will destroy its target as well.]</p><br/><p>The mana crafting that he did was simple. He ignored the durability of the pile bunker and made it able to endure a 5th stage loading until a single shot was shot out. It was a truly daring action if he thought about the magic stones and the ingredients used in this weapon, but Yu IlHan didn\u2019t want to meet the worst results just because he saved up on some materials.</p><br/><p>As even the ammo went through an enhancement with the use of a 2nd class magic stone, this pile bunker was no different from the most expensive consumer item on Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, my hands tremble just holding it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Who told you to do such idiotic modifications?]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think I can kill that troll without this much. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m so frustrated. It\u2019s as if the things you created have all been created after you read the future coming at you!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan only laughed at Erta\u2019s not grumble like grumble.</p><br/><p>However, the situation wasn\u2019t that leisurely. Kang HaJin was already confronting the Giant Death Stalker, and the clumsy Na YuNa didn\u2019t even notice that a giant troll was approaching them. In contrast, the giant troll had already swung up the metal club to smash them.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, I wish you success.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of this, there was a final sauce that he had saved up until now. It was none other than the superhuman strength skill! Yu IlHan activated the skill right away. Without the use of mana, all the muscles in his body squirmed before starting to emit heat.</p><br/><p>The meat that Yu IlHan had eaten to the point of being overboard, became the power source for the muscles and burned. Although there was not a lot of change on the surface, he knew. This skill was a jackpot!</p><br/><p>[Superhuman Strength skill is activated. For 3 minutes, physical abilities increase by 30%, but after the duration, your muscular strength would decrease by 50% for 10 minutes.]</p><br/><p>He lightly kicked off the ground. He was already used to testing his jumping ability.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who jumped with all his might, shot up courageously, like a space shuttle full of humanity\u2019s will. In his two hands was the pile bunker, loaded to the 5th stage.</p><br/><p>{Troll, hunts.}</p><br/><p>Speaking something unbefitting of its size, the troll smashed down with the club,</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Ah, troll! Oppa, back! Come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean back! Whoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kuhiuaaaaaaak!}</p><br/><p>While Na YuNa, Kang HaJin, and the Giant Death Stalker were screaming after they grasped the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a 100% success rate ambush!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who jumped all the way to the top of the troll\u2019s head, daringly smashed the pile bunker onto its head!</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Gestalt Collapse : Mumble \u2018Snow white\u2019 100 times.

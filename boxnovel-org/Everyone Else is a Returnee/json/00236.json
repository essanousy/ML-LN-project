Although Erta did glare at Liera as if she would kill her, when Liera hid behind Yu IlHan\u2019s back, she could only give up. Liera also did not provoke Erta more than needed. It was as if Liera was being considerate for Erta \u2013 this made Yu IlHan\u2019s curiosity rise even more, but the girls did not solve his question.</p><br/><p>[Liera, did you completely abandon Heaven?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>The once-an-angel and still-an-angel looked at each other. Emotions were being exchanged between the two of them through their gazes.</p><br/><p>Liera who decided to go back to being a lower existence to stay with Yu IlHan, and Erta, who had to leave Yu IlHan for a few years in pursuit of a new realm. The two at that time each did what they thought was for the best, but the results were drastically different.</p><br/><p>[Are you not planning to go back? Heaven will gladly receive you again.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can live for several hundred years more even like this. And also\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera hugged Yu IlHan\u2019s arm and made a warm smile. Yu IlHan had still not realized what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to bet on IlHan\u2019s possibilities. If it\u2019s him, he\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.I really want to kill you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak, protect me, IlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ugh\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s chances of winning was pretty slim in the first place. In the first place, the one who widened the gap was herself, so no good would come out of any resentment. But even if she did admit her loss, she wouldn\u2019t feel better about it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Erta was a higher existence. As it was not easy to move her heart in the first place, once he did, it was also near impossible to turn it back.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who hadn\u2019t the slightest clue of how Erta was feeling right now, just concluded that he wouldn\u2019t have to point his spear against her, and breathed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s good that Erta is not an enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh yeah, you. You really did try to go against me without the slightest hesitation, didn\u2019t you!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you said you were going to kill Liera, so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eeeeeeek.]</p><br/><p>Erta stared daggers at both Yu IlHan and Liera alternately while her hands were trembling, but eventually, she loosened her arms with a sigh.</p><br/><p>At the same time she put up a barrier that covered herself, Yu IlHan Liera and a few others. As Dareu had entered into the realm of higher worlds, Erta was also not limited to use her abilities to use mana.</p><br/><p>\u201cWao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was very shocked at her proficiency, speed, and above all, the endurance of the barrier. He newly realized that Erta was a higher existence after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a soundproof barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only that. Isn\u2019t this interfering with the Akashic Record? I think anything that happens in here won\u2019t even be recorded\u2026\u2026. Erta, you\u2019ve made progress, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan and Liera who were surprised at the unintended elements, Erta once again made a low sigh before speaking.</p><br/><p>[Please remember, Yu IlHan. That I will never go against you even if Heaven collapses.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yeah. We were still bound by a partnership contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even without that! No, wait, your faith in me is that little?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan once again checked that anything that happened within this barrier will not be transmitted to Heaven\u2019s Army and replied to Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I do believe you. But you\u2019re in a position where you can only obey if Heaven orders you to do something, are you not?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uuu, it is definitely like that now, yes\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Erta once again realized that Yu IlHan\u2019s heart left the Heaven\u2019s Army completely. Perhaps he noticed the negotiation between the Heaven\u2019s Army, the Destruction Demon Army and the Army of Brilliant Light. She couldn\u2019t even make up any excuses.</p><br/><p>Heaven\u2019s Army priced Yu IlHan\u2019s value as too low. He was not a talent that they should overlook for one or two higher worlds. If they somehow made him an angel, then Heaven\u2019s Army would have leaped in power instantly!</p><br/><p>However, right now, nothing good would come out of Yu IlHan becoming more distant from Heaven\u2019s Army. Even to Yu IlHan himself. Erta started to explain the reason why she had come to look for Yu IlHan so quickly.</p><br/><p>[Heaven\u2019s Army will also enter Dareu soon. Although the Destruction Demon Army and the Garden of Sunset Light had the advantage until now, a certain rising star from somewhere had destroyed that balance and thanks to that, there was a gap for the Heaven\u2019s Army and the Army of Brilliant Light to appear.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do something so big?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course it\u2019s a big thing.]</p><br/><p>The fact that Yu IlHan had killed tens of higher existences belonging to the Destruction Demon Army and the Garden of Sunset may actually be quite small in comparison to the entire war.</p><br/><p>However, they were only in the initial stages of the war for Dareu right now. While both sides were scouting each other out, he just wiped them all out, so as a result, Yu IlHan called for nervousness from both sides and made their scope of action smaller.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve volunteered myself in the Heaven\u2019s Army\u2019s scouts for Dareu. Of course, the main camp isn\u2019t here yet\u2026\u2026 but I realized that you were about to use the Hourglass of Eternity and immediately contacted you first. And I also did expect this to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how the hell did you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ve used a pseudo-barrier that applied the flow of time only in the barrier put up by the Hourglass of Eternity, on me as well. Of course, as you know, I couldn\u2019t maintain it for long\u2026\u2026 Moreover, it did use up quite a lot of my mana and magic stones, but thanks to that, I could find you faster than anyone else.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand a single thing.</p><br/><p>However, he did understand that Erta\u2019s magic potential was exceptional to the point of being able to interfere with a god-ranked artifact. Liera said one before, but Erta did seem to be quite a talent even in the Heaven\u2019s Army.</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan, who completely accepted this situation, Erta continued to speak.</p><br/><p>[The Heaven\u2019s Army will request an alliance from you. And Yu IlHan, the alliance at this point in time, regardless of their views and objectives, will be of help even to you. No matter how prepared you are, going against four higher existence factions is worse than allying with one of them, even for your allies as well.]</p><br/><p>Erta was speaking with the consideration of the alliance breaking up later. She understood Yu IlHan\u2019s vantages roughly. Perhaps the reason she put up the barrier was also because of this.</p><br/><p>However, despite that, Yu IlHan had a hard time believing her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there really be no problem even if the alliance breaks mid way? There\u2019s no way their work is so sloppy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan. It was you that said that we\u2019re still bound by a partnership contract. To them, you are being recognized as an ally even without having to request them for alliance.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAha!\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood immediately. However, wasn\u2019t that a bigger problem? As long as Yu IlHan had the Angel\u2019s partner subclass, he could not betray the Heaven\u2019s\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan.]</p><br/><p>At that time, Erta slightly closed her left eye and opened it again.</p><br/><p>Yes, she winked.</p><br/><p>[I have a way. I\u2019ve prepared for this until now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOk\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who never imagined that the cold her would do something so cute, blinked his eyes several times in confusion, but he roughly understood why she did that. Although he didn\u2019t know what she prepared, from her enormous confidence, it would be fine to believe in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, your eyes are pretty. so what?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Y, you\u2019ve advanced a lot, flattering women in such a natural fashion.]</p><br/><p>Even though her words sounded pouty, Erta\u2019s face was colored in red. Although unintentional, her disappointment about Yu IlHan seemed to have been washed away a little with this flattery. Liera laughed at her with a small voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Liera\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk more detail. What exactly are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>[For that, I\u2019d have to explain a little more about myself, but\u2026\u2026 fine. I\u2019ll reveal everything.]</p><br/><p>Erta made a slightly boastful expression. Her calm green eyes contained some playful light.</p><br/><p>[In the past, I was a talent that all of the higher existence factions wanted.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>[However, that\u2019s the truth; unlike Liera, who was number one on the list for Destruction Demon Army thanks to her violent and barbaric tendencies.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan subdued Liera with both his arms since she was taking out her spear to attack Erta, and urged her on.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Amongst them, the Garden of Sunset still wants me. Like how you\u2019re screwing up the war on your own right now, it is very possible for one exceptional person to decide the outcome of the war\u2026\u2026. and not too long ago, I\u2019ve accepted their proposal.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019ll betray the Heaven\u2019s Army and join the Garden of Sunset!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera, who was struggling within Yu IlHan\u2019s arms abruptly widened her eyes. Erta\u2019s expression while replying was also quite strange.</p><br/><p>[Do you really not want me that much? I\u2019m only using them to return to being a lower existence safely.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thing is possible?]</p><br/><p>[The magic I\u2019ve prepared until now is precisely for that purpose.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at Liera to see if he was the only one that didn\u2019t understand but Liera\u2019s expression was also in confusion. He was relieved.</p><br/><p>[No, it\u2019s not that difficult. Yu IlHan, I\u2019ll use the simple terms you like so much. First, think up of the process of a magical girl transformation.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, they activate the magic while clothed, and the moment the clothes are stripped, an annoying light appears to conceal the naked body, and some ribbon-y stuff comes out and equips the girl with the magical girl outfit.\u201d</p><br/><p>That light. That resentful light that turns that beautiful scene into a thing for 7 year olds! (T/N: xD) Just as Yu IlHan was burning in rage, Erta asked.</p><br/><p>[And if a bad guy attacks mid way through the transformation?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey would be kicked off naked. That\u2019s one kind bad guy right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The magic I\u2019ve prepared is precisely that bad guy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you an exhibitionist?\u201d</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s no way that\u2019s true!]</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s no way that Yu IlHan didn\u2019t understand after all that. The explanation was definitely simple. Right now, she was saying that she would activate a magic to return to being a lower existence, in the process of transforming from an angel to a member of the Garden of Sunset.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 will you be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t. That\u2019s why I need you to help me. To be exact, I need you to protect me from the assault from both Heaven\u2019s Army and the Garden of Sunset.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I was planning to make them enemies in the first place, so, yeah. Leave that to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that this was about turning two higher existence factions into enemies, Yu IlHan\u2019s answer had no hesitation. Erta slightly fell for his reassuring reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>On one side, Yu IlHan realized one thing mid way.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. If you return to a lower existence, the partnership between you and me will naturally crumble. And like that, you\u2019ll dissolve the alliance between the Heaven\u2019s Army and me. You\u2019re saying that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Correct.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s so, there\u2019s another obstacle in our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the story reached here, Liera could also realize as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan is still bound to another angel through a contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. That is why, there\u2019s one more thing you need to do before you cancel your alliance with the Heaven\u2019s Army. Something that you need to resolve in a place like this barrier, where no contract will affect you.]</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s eyes glistened. Her eyes contained a hint of hesitation, resolve and decisiveness.</p><br/><p>[You need to\u2026\u2026 settle it with Spiera.]</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Erta really is an exceptional angel! Though, she didn\u2019t have the chance to show herself off until now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It seemed like this team was not aware of what had happened to Earth yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you ask Miss MiRae to create a gate so you can come back to Earth first?\u201d</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s urgent. I understand.]</p><br/><p>Erta had countless good points about her, but her best points were that she was wise and was quick to start working. Yu IlHan cut off the communication there, and looked around the world before putting mana into a clap to gather everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you see, the mankind of this world, Earth, were scattered across various other worlds. We don\u2019t know when they will be able to come back, but I can\u2019t let you live in their original habitats. However, there are plenty of locations where the population was wiped out due to dungeons or large-scale monster attacks, so I\u2019m planning to choose one of those places for all of you to live in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to work on fixing Earth immediately due to an unforeseen error. So, in the meantime, I hope that the members of Suppression will be able to help Miss Han YeoRang\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Major-General Yoon DaeHan nodded with a bright smile as soon as he heard that. It seemed that he thought that Yu IlHan was being considerate of them. Well, let him misunderstand alright. Yu IlHan immediately moved the fortress to the place he had thought of, which was none other than Venezuela.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only place where I was shamed, I was unable to help them in time \u2026\u2026 one of the things I still have regrets on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yu IlHan\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>All 30 thousand got off there. The citizens of Venezuela in the past numbered 30 million, but all of them had died. It would be more than enough for 30 thousand people to live in. Even considering the time needed for them to continue with their unique culture and prosper, this kind of environment would be enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting the monsters will be a little tough, but the current Suppression should be able to handle it. Oh.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan brought the unique-ranked artifacts piled up in Vanguard warehouse and distributed them to the members of Suppression. The equipment they were using right now were good items, but they were all mass-production models he had made when he had inferior abilities to now. Just by switching equipment, their fighting power would increase by 3 times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad about using it. I\u2019ll clean up the vicinity first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan gave Han YeoRang and Yoon DaeHan a communication device each.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a call whenever you\u2019re in danger. I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy but\u2026\u2026 do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be fine as long as you\u2019re here, Mr. Yu IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u2026 *sigh*.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan only sighed at Han YeoRang\u2019s firm attitude.</p><br/><p>They still didn\u2019t seem to be aware what a higher world signified. He still had lingering thoughts that he should have just left them in Guundia.</p><br/><p>But what was he to do now? They were the ones who followed him as they couldn\u2019t endure the situation Guundia anymore. Perhaps Heli\u00e8na was right. Humanity was just struggling to escape their status quo, heading to their destruction.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2026Though, I won\u2019t let them.\u2019</p><br/><p>On his way back from Venezuela, Yu IlHan set up the minimum amount of safety devices. He first wiped out the monsters, and installed various traps and automatic weapons made from the materials gathered from those monsters.</p><br/><p>If above \u2018ordinary\u2019 monsters, for example, the perverted demons, appeared, they\u2019ll activate automatically and even signal Yu IlHan. Before Earth leaped into a higher world, this much preparation should be enough to protect them.</p><br/><p>[How kind.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was really kind, I wouldn\u2019t have brought them to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted at Heli\u00e8na\u2019s remark, and moved to the Korea, the clearing where the gate to Kiroa had once been. Of course, that gate had disappeared, but this area was Yu IlHan\u2019s land before. And he had scooped it out to make the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>[My\u2026\u2026 how beautiful.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is spectacular.\u201d</p><br/><p>A lake had formed in the place where it was once like a crater due to a large mass of land being scooped out. Moreover, the surface of the water was glowing faintly, and from time to time, sprouts of water shot upwards to create special shapes \u2013 all this implied that the lake was formed from the influence of magic power.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu IlHan, I\u2019ve arrived. \u2026\u2026 oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta had also arrived at this time through the gate, and also saw the scene. Not only that, the only conclusion she could come to after seeing the current state of Earth, where the lands, skies, and sea were all being twisted apart.</p><br/><p>The transformation of Earth into a higher world was in progress. And this was happening very, very rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it would take a few years at least?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I hoped so anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no way a human like you can accurately predict the transformation period. But it\u2019s good that we found out before it was too late. And so? You\u2019ve prepared something right? The reason you called me should also be related to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought back to the time when he borrowed Pat\u00e9\u2019s power to bring Heli\u00e8na\u2019s body back to life, and explained his plans. The magic he was planning to cast on Earth was fundamentally not that different.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to slow the time and space applied on Earth by borrowing mom\u2019s magic. The mana needed will be supplied by the mana being generated from the Earth itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was like always, this was one of the most absurd declarations by Yu IlHan. Erta couldn\u2019t retort and only turned her head around to Kim YeSeul.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust from words, it sounds absolutely impossible\u2026\u2026 so how is it, Kim YeSeul? Does it seem possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t my son be able to do it? I believe in my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>[This will be interesting. I want to hear the specifics, darling.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll explain it to you in steps.\u201d</p><br/><p>If possible, he wanted to get Kang MiRae\u2019s help as well, but he could only do with these members as she had other important things to do. Yu IlHan first put a boat on the lake and rowed to the center with the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a magic formation here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn this lake? Would that suffice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m going to use the artifact I created to draw a magic formation over the entire Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My, making a magic formation on Earth with an artifact?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entire Earth!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta remembered something after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancient elven magic formation in Dareu. My god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is the enhanced version. So\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to make what Miss Han YeoRang said, not that far off from the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was the only one that could take responsibility for Earth, all he needed to was to conquer it. Yu IlHan was planning to become the ruler of Earth. No one permitted him to, but he didn\u2019t plan on getting their permission either.</p><br/><p>Noticing what he was thinking, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s face blossomed into a smile.</p><br/><p>[Fufu, you\u2019re doing well even without me telling you anything, darling. Perhaps our hearts are already synchronized? How joyful.]</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite the unpleasant woman, I must say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, but this is no time to be quarreling. Focus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was not proficient in magic that manipulated space and time. So, he would require Kim YeSeul\u2019s help even in the process of making the magic formation.</p><br/><p>By creating an artifact that could realize all of her powers, he would etch the magic formation over the Earth and activate it. Finally, he had to finish it off by adding a feature that could maintain the effects of the formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe environment is not that bad. There is a lot of mana in the lake too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[My.]</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan shook his hand, the surface of the lake shot up according to his lead, and froze in the form of a delicate statue.</p><br/><p>A beautiful angel with two pairs of wings extended. It was none other than the figure of Liera when she was a 6th class high angel. Kim YeSeul was curious what kind of magic tricks he used when she saw him and realized that her son had become slightly different.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy, when did your armor change, son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlizzard Tyrant\u2019s Mixed bone fullplate armor. It\u2019s an artifact that allows me to wield water and make it into ice. I\u2019m going to create the artifact by extracting the feature of this armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s neat, darling. Can\u2019t you make a statue of me too?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I feel like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he swung his hand again, the statue changed into water again and fell back into the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I need the help of the people here. Is it possible to transform mom\u2019s ability into the form of a magic formation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be difficult for me alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll try, darling. That seems interesting.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall also help. Fortunately, magic formations are my area of specialty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll leave that to the three of you. As for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took off his armor. Then, he took out a 5th class magic stone and extracted all the features relating to water manipulation from the mixed bone fullplate armor. The fullplate armor immediately became dust and scattered with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make this lake into an artifact.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You destroyed a legend-ranked artifact so easily\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I need is the ability to manipulate water, not the armor.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Yu IlHan did something unbelievable. He just dropped the higher existence\u2019s magic stone with the power of water into the lake without any hesitation. Even Heli\u00e8na couldn\u2019t help but tilt her head at that scene.</p><br/><p>[Darling\u2026\u2026 are you alright?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to concentrate. Don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan slowly closed his eyes and put his hand on the surface of the water. What he was trying to do right now was extremely simple. Using the magic stone that would control the entire lake as the foundation, he would tie all the water in the lake into a single mass and enchant a thought-soul into it!</p><br/><p>To put it easily, he was making a water golem. Of course, this would be impossible without the magic engineering, mana crafting ability, and soul-enchant that had respectively reached the peak of their fields.</p><br/><p>\u2018Activate mana crafting and soul enchant at the same time. And a suitable thought-soul would be\u2026\u2026 yes, you\u2019re the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Are you, serious\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>The voice that replied to him was extremely low, and was filled with curses. However, to Yu IlHan, who had experienced countless fights even after fighting it, this much was cute.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes I am serious. If it\u2019s about protecting the Earth, you should be the strongest.\u2019</p><br/><p>[What I want more is to rip you apart to shreds.]</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re mistaken if you think I\u2019ll back down to such a meagre threat. You should have watched from inside me didn\u2019t you? Do I have to put it in easy words for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted towards the thought-soul that could do nothing to disturb his mind no matter how much it shouted, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as I don\u2019t permit it, you cannot do anything. If you do not accept, I\u2019ll only look for another one, and if the protective power over Earth becomes weaker as a result, you can only writhe in despair and curse me as you always did. No, in fact, I can just feed you to another thought-soul.\u2019</p><br/><p>[You aren\u2019t particularly skilled in threatening, or perhaps, you really don\u2019t care if I comply or not.]</p><br/><p>\u2018You get it. So, what are you going to do?\u2019</p><br/><p>[I\u2026\u2026 want freedom.]</p><br/><p>\u2018You are already dead. You are already no longer you, and whatever you thought when you were alive no longer relates to the current you.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Despite that I\u2026\u2026 want freedom.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Then very well. Negotiation is over.\u2019</p><br/><p>[However.]</p><br/><p>The thought-soul held Yu IlHan back.</p><br/><p>[If I could live on in a different form, if I could escape my current state\u2026\u2026 I shall follow your words for a short while.]</p><br/><p>\u2018You really aren\u2019t good at negotiating either.\u2019</p><br/><p>[I was always watching you. If I am not skilled in negotiation, then it is your fault.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Hah, who are you blaming? Very well, then. Let us begin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan activated the Rule skill that had reached its peak and made a smirk. He voiced out its name, the \u2018concept\u2019 that was embedded in the Akashic Record.</p><br/><p>\u201cChaos Will, become my subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I accept.]</p><br/><p>The worst loner and the most brutal being joined hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

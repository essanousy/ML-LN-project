(Kang HaJin\u2019s job))</p><br/><p>The location was, of course, the 14th floor of Vanguard. Unlike the 13th floor, only those with Yu IlHan\u2019s permission could enter, and this place didn\u2019t have any displays with showcased equipment, looking more like an office.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan would be in charge of trading the higher ranked equipment anyway, and his Cross Bag could hold as many equipments as he wanted, so there was no need for a showcase.</p><br/><p>Now, Yu IlHan did not wear a mask. Vanguard was his company, and he also thought that there was no need to hide his face when he was showing himself as the owner of Vanguard.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had taken it off, but.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the man and woman sitting on the sofa he had prepared on the 14th floor, opposite to him, Yu IlHan tilted his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly sir Yoon DaeHan needed to come though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, shouldn\u2019t I at least be together with one subordinate to show myself off a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yoon DaeHan nonchalantly laughed, but seeing the national representative \u2018beauty\u2019 first lieutenant Han YeoRang, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Mr. Yu IlHan. Although, I only got to know of your name now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>First lieutenant Han YeoRang spoke in a slightly stiff tone, but as expected of one that was aiming for quick marriage and end of military service, she had some pretty makeup. Wishing for her to meet someone good quickly, Yu IlHan asked Yoon DaeHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you my conditions so you should have a grasp on it, right? How much are they willing to pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s at the level of those sold on the 13th floor, and the supply is high, then they have intentions on buying at the market price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe market price is over 5 billion though. It\u2019s not the market price, but the Vanguard standard price. The government also has their own predictions on why Vanguard was opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I also think it\u2019s a good business. Cutting it short, it\u2019s not that much different from taking them for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a limit to selling the items of Vanguard. 2 per person. In the first place. it wasn\u2019t a brand with a lot of stocks, so for arming Suppression, the army would profit even if they were supplied with Yu IlHan\u2019s items at market price.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan called out a longsword out of nowhere. In truth, he had taken it out from the Cross Bag hung in one corner of the office, but the strong friends seeing that could only see it as magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the average equipment of those supplied to Suppression. Take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, they are inferior to the ones sold in Vanguard downstairs \u2013 muttered Yoon DaeHan in his heart and received the sword. Han YeoRang also seemed curious and extended her hand to touch it.</p><br/><p>[Pressure Tiger Bone Bastard]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Rare]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 2,650]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013 40% increase in attack when facing monsters below user\u2019s level]</p><br/><p>[Durability \u2013 2,100/2,100]</p><br/><p>[Mass produced weapons made by surpassing the limits of the material]</p><br/><p>Yoon DaeHan wordlessly smiled. However, Han YeoRang didn\u2019t have that much experience and shouted in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack power 2,650? Moreover, I\u2019ve never seen options like this! Just who is the smith?</p><br/><p>\u201cIndustrial secret, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan placed his index finger on his lips and smiled. Han YeoRang blushed in embarrassment, but Yu IlHan firmly ignored that and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there will be variables in the attack power and the options according to the form of the weapon, but you can think that this is the average. It\u2019s around the middle of standard weapons and higher ranked weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, the price is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to the government. However, I\u2019d prefer additional services over money. There are a lot of benefits that one wants when conducting business, and I also wish to block some annoying interferences in the future as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a splendid business man who blatantly requested bribery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot of money, and can earn as much as I want if i will it. I also don\u2019t think that the currencies used until now will have much value in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ignored Han YeoRang again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I should get this straight. I don\u2019t want the government to profit from the weapons I sell. I want the weapons to be solely distributed to Suppression. As such, I want a list of members of Suppression, and the equipments they needed to be equipped with. A weapon and an armor each. Simple, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019ve prepared them. You also don\u2019t have to worry about the problems you have spoken of. The higher ups in the Korean military aren\u2019t only composed of thoughtless idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite fortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even while Yu IlHan and Yoon DaeHan were speaking business, Han YeoRang\u2019s eyes were fixed on Yu IlHan. Was her eyes twisted? Or are her preferences very extreme? Neither.</p><br/><p>It was simply that Yu IlHan\u2019s level was nearing 80, and his very league was heightening by the day, which resulted in his body figure and face nearing a more perfect form without him realizing it.</p><br/><p>Honestly, his starting point wasn\u2019t so good, but even so, Yu IlHan was currently at the top of humanity. At least, he was way higher than his own self-evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u2018A good-looking guy full of ability, perfect. He\u2019s the perfect husband-material.\u2019</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang decided to seduce Yu IlHan. Although, she did get ditched once in the past, she was only happy that they made connections like this.</p><br/><p>However, just as plans were being built in her mind, Yu IlHan lightly clapped and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop it here. The items will be prepared in 3 days, so let\u2019s settle it with the contract then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. I thank you from the bottom of my heart again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only pitied you since you were being pushed around everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words filled with honesty made Yoon DaeHan\u2019s heart ache. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t bad for Suppression to earn Yu IlHan\u2019s pity right now.</p><br/><p>Yoon DaeBang clicked his tongue after looking at Han YeoRang staring at Yu IlHan, before he suggested to Yu IlHan, thinking that he should help her out a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like to eat lunch together with us? I know of a good place nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really tempting, but I have other activities in my schedule.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang\u2019s eyes flashed. Thinking that this idiot should fight monsters all her life, Yoon DaeHan smacked her on the head when Yu IlHan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should already be aware that Vanguard and the Lightning God Clan has some connections. I have planned to meet the clan master of the Lightning God Clan, miss Kang MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han YeoRang\u2019s face became one of dejection. She knew her own level well. If compared, they had as much difference as a excalibur and a wooden training sword.</p><br/><p>[How cruel.]</p><br/><p>\u2018Women are annoying.\u2019</p><br/><p>And honestly, she didn\u2019t even enter her eyes. Repeating what was said before, Yu IlHan\u2019s standard of beauty had become absurdly high after spending time with Lita for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>Wishing that the despairing Han YeoRang would meet a good man in the future, again, Yu IlHan saw the two of them out. Not even 20 minutes after that, 3 people of both sexes arrived on the 14th floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod dammit. They\u2019re no different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, IlHan! You look so handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI appreciate your praise but please use polite speech.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting there since he could not turn his customers away, Yu IlHan brewed some coffee for them since he had no secretary or the sort. Of course, since his cooking level was growing by the day due to consuming extreme poison, a simple coffee turned out to be extremely delicious as well.</p><br/><p>While the others were rejoicing at the effects of their magic and battle skills, Yu IlHan was relaxing himself with his cooking skill!</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae took a sip and was shocked at the unexpected goodwill and blinked her eyes several times, before finding calm and asking him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the higher ranked equipment will be sold starting next week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. On a fair subscription basis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replying, Yu IlHan thought for a little before continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not planning to sell a tier of weapon outside of your level, since people will go above themselves and try to do the impossible if they acquire artifacts above their ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, that. MiRae is really doing the impossible nowadays, you\u2026 Ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving aside Na YuNa, who was achieving the record of 1 hit per 3 minutes, Kang HaJin opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the crafter you\u2019re in contract with has the ability to pull out artifacts of MiRae\u2019s staff\u2019s level like nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he has the time and material, yes. Although he can\u2019t do it everyday, he probably does more than you, Mr. Kang HaJin, can think of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan continued with the words \u2018as such\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo give me that holy power material or whatever you call it right now. Miss Na YuNa and Mr Kang HaJin should have an artifact of your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your eyes, do I have the capability to wield legend ranked artifacts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, but you do seem to need one in order to follow those two monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s words were too honest. It was to the point that Kang HaJin received a lot of damage, despite having resolved to throw away his inferiority.</p><br/><p>But even so, should he be thankful since he was honest\u2026?</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin felt weird. It was probably because he had seen the battle in Japan.</p><br/><p>To retort, the difference in their levels were too plainly seen. Yu IlHan was more like a teacher who taught him from above him, rather than a competitor.</p><br/><p>Now, he didn\u2019t even feel that dejected anymore. Through an unrealistic experience, he had come to accept reality. Although, his sister didn\u2019t seem so yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we got theeeem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa pulled out 3 small stones from her pocket.</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan tried to receive them, Na YuNa extend her fingers to play a prank, but having read her moves, Yu IlHan turned his hand in the air to receive just the stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Holy Stone of the Goddess of Beauty, Leytna]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Legend]</p><br/><p>[A special kind of stone that was kept in the temple of the Goddess of Beauty, Leytna, to harbor holy power. It is used in making artifacts specialized for priests/priestesses and paladins, and is one of the best.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan looked at Na YuNa and asked where she had retrieved such a precious item with his eyes, and Na YuNa, who realized his intention, said proudly while puffing out her large chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cFufu, I\u2019m kinda being treated as the holy maiden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I use this? Does it just need to be embedded on the weapon or the robe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the crafter know it well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much relation to temples.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s words slightly felt like a loaded question, but since he had expected these kind of questions from the start, Yu IlHan smoothly replied. Na YuNa\u2019s eyes flashed in interest, and Yu IlHan blinked nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin spoke instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can grind it and apply it. It\u2019s a finishing agent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it only through that method? During blacksmithing? Or during mana crafting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to imbue the power within the holy stone into the equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan acknowledged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll request right away. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank you with just those words alone. I think we\u2019re about to get busy soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang HaJin stood up with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae also stood up. She had a frightening expression on as if she was hit by someone, and only expressed her inner intentions when they were about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the Tokyo Orochi fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned a lot. I think it will take a little time before I ask you for partnership. However, I won\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought that she really had a lot of conviction. He himself had no intentions on getting involved with Kang MiRae more than necessary, but if her growth sped up thanks to him, that was a matter worth rejoicing about so Yu IlHan nodded in a delightful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. We\u2019ll take our leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Give me my worth of it, since I attacked with my magic \u2013 or so he thought she would say, but Kang MiRae did not ask for anything.</p><br/><p>Was she thinking that she still had debt for the artifact trading? He really thought that she had a uselessly high pride and laughed.</p><br/><p>However, even though Kang MiRae and Kang HaJin stood up, Na YuNa was still sitting there. Kang MiRae\u2019s eyes twitched as she try to drag her away, but Na YuNa endured till the end and stayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNooo, I want to talk a little more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disturb him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really have an important matter to say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Na YuNa had no intentions of letting go of the sofa, Kang MiRae created some lightning on her palms. If this building wasn\u2019t Yu IlHan\u2019s possession, she would have shot already. Despite that, Na YuNa didn\u2019t stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNooo, I have something to say with Mr. IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, make this idiot faint.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hear her out first and chase her out later so you two can leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot disturb you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m gonna throw out the entire sofa along with her from the roof after listening to her so just prepare to receive her at the bottom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan already knew a certain extent, what Na YuNa wanted to say. With Yu IlHan\u2019s permission, Kang HaJin, worriedly, and Kang MiRae, annoyedly, bid farewell.</p><br/><p>When they left completely, Na YuNa stood up abruptly and shouted while pointing at Yu Ilhan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis and that are all made by you, right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan acknowledged immediately. Na YuNa opened and closed her mouth a few times. It seemed like she didn\u2019t think that he would acknowledge it so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAraaa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t receive any damage even if I say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArara.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa tilted her head and sat back down while pouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, I wanted to make it more advantageous for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were you even trying to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDropping the polite speech to each other.\u201d (T/N: Not so obvious in English, but yes. MC speak to her in polite speech while she doesn\u2019t)</p><br/><p>An unimaginable trade condition. While Yu IlHan was laughing, Na YuNa only smacked on the innocent sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you hide it then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s probably the same reason as why miss Na YuNa is hiding her true self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmm. Is that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa muttered in acknowledgement and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a waste to give you to MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have no intentions in giving myself to miss Kang MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa nodded in satisfaction and brushed her clothes. Since the negotiation was broken before it had even started, it was now time to run away.</p><br/><p>However, she seemed disappointed to run away with nothing, and extend her hand abruptly towards Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to be friends? Oh, ones that can develop into something else later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied with a smile. The hesitation-less sharp answer made even the Na YuNa sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have ED?\u201d (Editor: A certain dysfunction)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr you like men?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really need to spell it out for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan walked towards the elevator and pressed the button. The elevator that connected the first and 14th floor came up very quickly.</p><br/><p>The doors opened, and Na YuNa went in with a disbelieving face. Only at that time did Yu IlHan speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like miss Na YuNa so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s honest expression, and not one that was an act to receive her attention, made her touched. She was even a little happy. (T/N: I swear, she\u2019s an M)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s really be friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t only like your appearance; I hate your personality even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaoooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the social butterfly queen could not win against the loner-ness of the loner king, Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Such was the first complete defeat of Na YuNa\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Iron walled king, Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>A Korean of conviction, Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>This arc is also finishing, eh.

(5)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it was different!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shouted, enraged at the unfair reality. However, Erta also shouted with a justified face.</p><br/><p>[It is different! Why don\u2019t you take a look at the skill evolution condition for spearmanship!]</p><br/><p>He did as she said.</p><br/><p>[Instakill a 3rd class monster with a piercing strike 0/500]</p><br/><p>[Instakill a 3rd class monster with a slashing strike 0/500]</p><br/><p>[Magic stones of 3rd class monsters 0/200]</p><br/><p>[Magic stone of 4th class monster 0/1]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my Xel\u2019naga.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Erta said, it was definitely different. And it was the difference between Mount Baekdu and Mount Everest! (T/N: Mount Baekdu is about 2.2km high)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easy to climb mount Baekdu!\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought it will be easy for you.]</p><br/><p>Erta had evaluated him correctly, but perhaps due to his force he emited when he was making the Traps of Destruction was too big, she was now inclining towards overevaluating him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how high my status is and how high my martial art levels are, in the end, I\u2019m just level 28, and I can\u2019t use mana.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh yeah, you were like that, weren\u2019t you. 3rd class might be a little difficult for you.]</p><br/><p>The wall of mana was absolute. According to whether one could use mana or not, the power one could produce differed like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>The reason how Yu IlHan can produce an attack power that can overwhelm other people is due to the peak level martial art that was trained to the peak and went over the piled up status on his body. If he was lacking in any of the two, he would have been overtaken by another person.</p><br/><p>In reverse, if Yu IlHan acquired the ability to use mana in this situation, then the definition of \u2018levels\u2019 and \u2018classes\u2019 that the Akashic Records, which ruled the worlds, may be shaken by him, much less the life forms.</p><br/><p>That day will arrive soon. It must arrive.</p><br/><p>Erta realized that she was inwardly looking forward to that moment and she stopped thinking. Even during that, Yu IlHan was tidying up his bed, washing his face, and changing his clothes while complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where do you want me to go kill trolls? Do they even appear on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Monsters don\u2019t only refer to the existences evolved from the original animals on Earth. If mana activates, the monsters that didn\u2019t exist on Earth will start apearing. It\u2019s the same as ores that weren\u2019t on Earth appearing. Like a lobster cannot live on other environments than 1st class waters, there are many life-forms which cannot live unless the concentration of mana reaches a certain point, in this universe.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you major in the faculty of explanation or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan cleared things up while complaining at Erta\u2019s perfect explanation. Even if he goes out in pajamas, no one would realize him due to the passive concealment, but he didn\u2019t want to admit that as he even put on the Direwolf Skull Mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason he turned on the TV just before he went out was because of the thought that the TV may broadcast him the results of the Trap of Destruction that should have activated yesterday. Erta told him to not mind about it, but how ocould he? A master had to take responsibility for the item he makes.</p><br/><p>However, on TV, a scene out of his expectations was being broadcasted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that the scene where I fought two days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mean the square you left the Giant Leopard\u2019s corpse.]</p><br/><p>The view of the video was shaking as it was taken from a helicopter, but the scene the camera was showing was without a doubt, the place a lot of people, including Yu IlHan had fought the gigantic leopard.</p><br/><p>Some high-rise buildings had collapsed miserably, and in some places, even the rubble matched so this wasn\u2019t a recording.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think they divided that up in such a short period of time. That\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t find any traces of the huge leopard\u2019s body, even after he rubbed his eyes. the mountains of leopard meat that Yu IlHan had left on the scene was also gone. With only traces of the battle, the corpse, and the large number of humans had cleanly disappeared.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026It may be a bit different to what you\u2019re thinking.]</p><br/><p>At that moment, Erta spoke with a slightly stiff voice. When Yu IlHan was about to ask back while tilting his head, he could hear a voice from the screen.</p><br/><p>[The place which had the 2nd class monster\u2019s corpse, is, as you see, clean. It had disappeared along with the people who were fighting over the spoils of war after the battle.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Yu IlHan to realize that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>[Some are saying that a dungeon had opened and swallowed them. The authorities are mentioning the possibility that a dungeon\u2019s entrance may have opened in the middle of the city, and are cautioning not to approach this area and\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The broadcaster\u2019s words continued, but Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t focus on that. His eyes trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s a dungeon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So you know well.]</p><br/><p>Erta nodded her head. Her expression was frozen codly like an ice field.</p><br/><p>[The dungeons in Korea have already gone through their 1st activation. If new monsters appear due to the activation of mana, then there maybe a possibility of new dungeons appearing at that time, but it definitely isn\u2019t now.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after Yu IlHan muttered. The camera screen which was showing the ruined city, instantly colored black with a loud crash sound. Immediately after that, the screen changed to the news desk and showed the dumbfounded news caster.</p><br/><p>The news caster tried to hide the ripples, and said \u2018It seems there is an accident at the scene\u2019 and was proceeding to cover it up, but Yu IlHan had already seen through the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was another monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026So you saw it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I did. Its strategy seems familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had acquired almost all martial arts and methods to move his body in 1000 years. However, this was limited to human techniques, there was no way he would be able to realize the technique that monsters used.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan had seen through it. What did this mean? The answer was already there.</p><br/><p>Concealment, it was a master of concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was definitely a leopard. And it was a pitch black one too. \u2026\u2026Erta, you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t know either. The giant leopard was definitely dead, and you even procured its magic stone. 99.99% of monster hunting end at that point.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the 0.01%?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If it was pregnant with a child.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan facepalmed. He felt like he would collapse just from that so he had to endure while clenching his teeth.</p><br/><p>The black-furred leopard that appeared for an instant on the screen, was the child of the Giant Leopard that died 2 days ago.</p><br/><p>[If you dismantled it properly, then this wouldn\u2019t have happened. In the end, this is a disaster that was called forth by human greed.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI had to take a step back at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although it\u2019s true that the black leopard was born as a result of you not dismantling it, but that doesn\u2019t make you responsible for that disaster.]</p><br/><p>To Yu IlHan, who was muttering bitterly, Erta retorted with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t make a mistake about that. Please look back at the reason why you had no choice but to leave that corpse there.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no regrets about my actions then. However, I can\u2019t take the deaths of countless people lightly. Among them, there were some who I rescued, and some who showed me good will, and some who intended to take it fairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s despair was bigger than she thought. Erta still hadn\u2019t understood him fully. Erta despaired for a bit when she realized that obvious fact just now.</p><br/><p>She thought that she wanted to console Yu IlHan. After that, she thought about why this situation occurred. Just why did a higher existence such as her couldn\u2019t see through the existence of that monster.</p><br/><p>[If you want to talk about mistakes, then it\u2019s with me. I should have thought more deeply about the reason why the Giant Leopard had gone in a frenzy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was to hide its offspring?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s definitely to hide its child in its womb that it had gone in a frenzy when it was near death. Originally, it might have fooled humans, but it shouldn\u2019t have fooled me but\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought up of the black leopard\u2019s figure which appeared on the TV screen a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cConcealment. This is the reason why you couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes. It\u2019s an amazing condition. Even I don\u2019t act while thinking that a frenzied monster had a child and that child\u2019s special ability is concealment.]</p><br/><p>Moreover, Yu IlHan, who had max level dismantling and could dismantle even a huge animal\u2019s body in a short time, didn\u2019t completely dismantle it.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the humans\u2019 skirmish, the dismantling of the huge monster was postponed, and as a result, the black leopard was born safely and had\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking like that, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the birth of the black leopard was a miracle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish that it wasn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked while looking at the panicked and sweaty expression of the news caster inside the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a 3rd class?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Considering it\u2019s abnormal concealment ability, it probably is.]</p><br/><p>At Erta\u2019s report, Yu IlHan heaved a sigh and turned the TV off. It was just a moment ago when he concluded that he couldn\u2019t win against a 3rd class monster, and now\u2026 he felt frustrated.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t leave it like that as if he did, there was no knowing how many accidents it would cause. Moreover, although he might be taken over by the people who were doing quests in other worlds, Yu IlHan was still the strongest on Earth. If he pulled out saying he couldn\u2019t kill it, then just who would be able to confront it?</p><br/><p>Finally, although there was no one looking for him to be responsible for this, Yu IlHan himself couldn\u2019t stay still as he felt disturbed. To Yu IlHan, who always thought that he should clean up what he\u2019s done, that leopard was a mess that he had to clean up with his own hands.</p><br/><p>He thought up of the figures of the soldiers who were looking at him with admiration, and the figures of the people who cheered after they survived the ordeal.</p><br/><p>He subconsciouly clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you confident?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt maybe a bit difficult to deal with it alone, but if I make the necessary preparations, it isn\u2019t an opponent I should fear so much, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the Yu IlHan, who always thought up his path of survival first, he looked very spirited. Erta slightly wondered at that fact, but the reason for Yu IlHan\u2019s confidence was extremely simple.</p><br/><p>It was because the ability of the leopard, which is expected to be 3rd class, was concealment.</p><br/><p>If it was a case where its stats were all put into strength or defense, then he wouldn\u2019t know, but if its special ability was concealment, then there was no reason to fear! Since Yu Ilhan, who had mastered concealment without even training for it!</p><br/><p>Immediately after Yu IlHan showed his confidence, he asked Erta with a careful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s not awesomely strong in strength and defense even after all that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your predictions are correct to a point so don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s impossible for an existence to show exceptional ability in all areas. That\u2019s especially the case with monsters. In that leopard\u2019s case, to gain its high concealment ability, its other stats would have decreased.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that, eh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought and left the house. Just by his feelings, he wanted to kill it after levelling up massive amounts, but he couldn\u2019t let it free in the middle of the city. if it was a dungeon instead, then he might have left it alone, but as it was a living, and a 3rd class monster specialising in concealment at that, he couldn\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>Kill that monster after making equipments optimized for killing it in as little time as possible and kill it. This was the best method. If that didn\u2019t work, then he would just run.</p><br/><p>Also, there was another method to decrease casualties while killing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man shouldn\u2019t speak two things with his mouth though\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But there was no helping it. There were a lot of things in this world more important than a man\u2019s pride.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan licked his lips even while unhesitatingly heading towards a public phone booth he had marked beforehand. Then he checked the ID card that he received two days ago, and entered the Empress\u2019, Kang Mirae\u2019s, phone number, clumsily with his fingers.</p><br/><p>This was the beginning of the strategy to save the front line with the dropout and the Empress.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Oh my Xel\u2019naga : In the starcraft world, protosses treat their creators, Xel\u2019naga, as their God. and this line became famous from that. Oh my God! \u2013 it\u2019s the same nunace as that. Of course, Yu IlHan isn\u2019t a protoss!</p><br/><p>The most awkward thing in the scenario progress is the fact that Erta didn\u2019t notice the existence of the black leopard. A mere 3rd class had deceived a higher existence with concealment!? I will be thankful if you just think that it\u2019s a result from the mother leopard\u2019s frenzy. You should know from the flow of my story, but in this story, human effort or parental love can easily surpass the limits</p><br/><p>There were many readers who predicted that the child of the leopard would appear. However, it\u2019s not a pet! It clearly knows the enemy of its mother! (T/N: Don\u2019t blame my translation for those who thought it was a zombie)</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t mean that he will get in to a permanent party just because of the shared plan with the Empress. Whether you want a party with her, or not, please watch!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>People are taking a liking to Erta now, eh? Me too. I\u2019m just like you. Rita ftw, Erta ftw, Empress go away. Will there be new girls? Should I spoil?</p><br/><p>Also, it seems like when MC dismantled \u2018half\u2019 of the giant leopard for the empress, it seemed like he had cut the \u2018front\u2019 half, and not the \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 half.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

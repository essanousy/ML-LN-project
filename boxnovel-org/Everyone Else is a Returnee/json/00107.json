It looked as if the dragon meat that couldn\u2019t be eaten raw, was being assimilated into the mana circulation system through the medium of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the inedible monster meat might become edible if I do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are you trying to open a restaurant or something?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t mother like it if I open one after I chase one of the shops out? I can supply all the materials. Oh, the place of origin is quite a big problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>It will be over the moment he wrote \u2018Dareu\u2019.</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t do that!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, don\u2019t get so angry. But it won\u2019t be so bad eating dragon meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s full of mana too. It might even replace potions\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Cooking skill was an area that Yu IlHan did not improve on during the frozen millennium.</p><br/><p>Although it did grow rapidly due to Yu IlHan becoming able to consume monster meat and blood after acquiring extreme poison resistance, and the fact that monster cooking gave a lot of proficiency experience, he thought that he would never be able to master the cooking skill.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t seem like that now. If he started cooking and eating dragon meat and blood, his cooking skill may increase to new heights. It was funny, but it was very possible that Yu IlHan would become a master of cooking through cooking unconventional monsters.</p><br/><p>[That sounds horrible.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Good cooks are always good. That dragon meat looks nice.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera was drooling about dragon meat even though Yumir was in her arms. What an irony! Erta resolved that she would never show dragon meat to Yumir.</p><br/><p>While she was secretly resolving to herself, Yu IlHan left the maturing dragon meat and started another task with an air of liveliness. Which was, of course, dismantling.</p><br/><p>Now, he was very used to dragon dismantling, as he completely and perfectly separated an entire dragon corpse within just 2 minutes, and even stored the blood.</p><br/><p>Liera clapped while watching since it was as if he was using clone techniques, but Erta, who escaped her pondering asked Yu IlHan with a tone lined in fear.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, Lecidna\u2019s body is among them right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is. She was a golden bird when she died, but she turned back into a dragon when I checked.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the same with Karrows, who assumed elven form, and the immature dragons that still hadn\u2019t assumed their dragon forms yet. Whether newborn or adult, they returned to their original forms after they died.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll say this just in case, but.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cremate her. When Mir grows up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Yu IlHan firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you take me to be? I just declared that I will acknowledge Mir as my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta finally realized. Yu IlHan\u2019s declaration wasn\u2019t just at a level where he just accepted the phenomenon, but that he would really accept Yumir as his real family.</p><br/><p>These two may sound the same, but in Yu IlHan\u2019s mind, they would be very different.</p><br/><p>[Since you sometimes do abnormal things like nothing\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta vaguely ended her line. She tried to understand Yu IlHan\u2019s unpredictable action a little more, but she realized that she was still far away from it, and felt tragic. She felt even more tragic seeing Liera laughing on her side.</p><br/><p>[You knew that already, didn\u2019t you!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Complained Erta through the angel\u2019s ring in order to not let Yu IlHan hear it. Then, Liera answered in a whisper with a flawless mile.</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s why I said I\u2019ll become the stepmother.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Surstr\u00f6mming was still surstr\u00f6mming even after rotting, and it seemed that Liera didn\u2019t spend a millennium with him for nothing after all. Yes, she was indeed suitable to be blessed by the god of love. Or so Erta acknowledged.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t even know what was happening between the angels and continued dismantling. Since he had a little less than 300 dragon corpses, he would finish them by today, but the problem was the 3rd class dragonkin.</p><br/><p>Even though he had dismantled and used a considerable number of dragonkin corpses in order to arm the elves of the fallen elven empire, he still had 30 thousand left! 30K!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I dismantle one every 20 seconds, that\u2019s 3 every minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think it looks plenty impossible with just that.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes 180 per hour, 4,320 per day. Which makes 43,200 in ten days. In other words, 12 days if I take my time\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[So you aren\u2019t planning to sleep for even one second, are you?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Even while dismantling the dragons without rest, Yu IlHan was conflicted. Honestly, he was surprised at the fact that nothing much had happened on Earth, but would it be so in the future as well?</p><br/><p>Well, of course, if it was, then Yu IlHan could also focus on what he wants. However, wasn\u2019t he too lucky to acquire so many dragon corpses, and even survive after meeting a higher existence? Wasn\u2019t it time for something very annoying and tiring to happen?</p><br/><p>[This guy has such a hard life.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cShaddap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finished conflicting. Then he first finished dismantling the dragon he was doing now. The angels would watch the dragon dismantling show that was presented to them along with the beautiful sword dance any time.</p><br/><p>It was 11 am Korean time when Yu IlHan arrived at his apartment in Gangnam with the elves. When he finished dismantling and classifying the parts of all 4th class dragons, it became 6 in the evening.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Mir still sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yup, he\u2019s sleeping well.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who had considered the nagging and crying of children along with changing diapers the moment he was \u2018given\u2019 the dragon egg, renewed his opinion for the better at Yumir who only had the good points of children.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan packed away the dismantling tools and took out a small amount of dragon bones and skin. The sturdy and sharp ribs and skull of Karrows that protected its vital parts, and the most sturdy parts of the skin.</p><br/><p>[Are you going to make new equipment?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the elves. I can\u2019t arm all 1,527 of them with dragon gear so I made do with dragonkin then, but I can\u2019t do that with the ones I brought here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would feel really bad if they died because he gave them inferior gear after they followed him all the way here. Yu IlHan convinced himself like that, but Erta didn\u2019t seem to accept that.</p><br/><p>[They are still in their level 80s!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI also used Orochi gear in my level 80s.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are different!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>He knew very well that Erta was worried. If one used too good gear compared to one\u2019s ability, then that person would rely on the power of the gear and it would become difficult for that person to raise his/her own capability.</p><br/><p>Well, of course, since Yu IlHan had max level of most things technically so she wouldn\u2019t be so worried, but the highest level of martial arts that the elves had was 72. This was also a miracle that happened to a long-living elf, but in Erta\u2019s eyes, it would be insufficient.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can raise their lacking abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu IlHan was proficient with all weapons, he could declare so, and Erta could only grumble to herself.</p><br/><p>Liera was in watching mode from the beginning without the slightest intention of interfering. For some reason, Erta was losing to her today all the time. Erta quenced her burning passion for a comeback and decided to silently watch Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan first made sturdy armor for the greatsword warrior Mirey and the shield warrior Jirl.</p><br/><p>He first made a simple leather armor to be worn on the inside, before making a fullplate armor with dragon bones and processed with dragon scales on top of that. All of that turned out to be a strong armor that would test the endurance of the one that\u2019s trying to pierce the armor instead.</p><br/><p>After that, he invested a few 3rd class magic stones to mana craft, and they both became legend ranked.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Isn\u2019t it about time for an epic-rank to pop out?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Even legend rank is welcomed by the angels in front lines\u2026\u2026!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Of course, even within the same legend rank, there would be very big differences according to the level of the materials and the results of the mana crafting, but at the very least, the legend ranked armor that Yu IlHan created would definitely be ranked amongst the top.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s finish it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like that, he finished making leather clothing for the archer Pat\u00e9, and the thief Phiria. He designed the joints for agile and delicate movements, and made it to stick close to the skin, but he also made it so that the vital body parts are protected well by investing dragon scales.</p><br/><p>As their ranks ended in unique since there was not much stitching done to it, but that was Yu IlHan\u2019s best so he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollowing that, a greatsword, two daggers, a shield and\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>A bow. He was confident in that one. Since he got more proficient while making ballistas, and because the Giant\u2019s Rubber Band that was created from Karrows\u2019 tendons turned out to be even better than the ones made from Orochi\u2019s tendons.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also wondered why that was the case, and he realized that it was because the Eternal Flame had evolved once again after eating the dragon egg shells that Yumir was born from. Perhaps due to that, all products made from dragon parts became better.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy in secret\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the Eternal Flame only licked its lips in na\u00efvety as if asking what it had done wrong. He would only get himself tired even if he got angry at an item that couldn\u2019t talk, so Yu IlHan could only continue working and think that it was a good thing.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was worth it for the Eternal Flame to eat the egg shells, as for the greatsword, the daggers, and even the shield turned out to be legend ranked.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who organized those items, which made him feel happy just by looking at it, Yu IlHan began crafting the bow from the lightweight and elastic black scales and the Giant\u2019s Rubber band from Karrows.</p><br/><p>[Wow, such a beautiful bow.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan. You aren\u2019t doing your best because Pat\u00e9 said he liked you, right?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>But what could he do? They were his subordinates that followed him all the way here. Yu IlHan focused his all while creating the bow for Pat\u00e9. He would be too embarrassed to give him a unique ranked bow when the armor was already a unique ranked one.</p><br/><p>Just using the scales of the Cursed Dragon, and its tendons, the bow was completed within two hours. The bow and bowstring that gave off a feeling like they would disappear when thrown into the darkness, was astoundingly beautiful, to the point that even Yu IlHan, the creator himself, exclaimed in awe when seeing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I do too well? It\u2019s a legend rank even though I didn\u2019t mana craft it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then just give it to him like this.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the moment when his desire as a crafter burned up. The desire that he maybe able to create an artifact at the epic stage with Yu IlHan\u2019s power alone.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was best to proceed when hesitating. Yu IlHan took out the 4th class magic stone that Karrows had left behind.</p><br/><p>Befitting of a magic stone belonging to a Cursed Dragon, the magic stone emitted an aura of vicious curse, which would have made it impossible for Yu IlHan to grab it if he didn\u2019t have the Higher curse resistance skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cI gave out a legend rank weapon for a sum of money. If I can\u2019t invest this much for my subordinates, that won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan grabbed on the magic stone. On his other hand, he grabbed the bow and closed his eyes. Then he thought.</p><br/><p>What was important for a bow?</p><br/><p>The elasticity of the bowstring and the flexibility of the shaft? If it became any stiffer, Yu IlHan might be able to pull it, but Pat\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t even be able to pull it properly with both arms.</p><br/><p>Then sturdiness? It would take a dragon one hour to break this thing. The function as a weapon was already perfect. Then what? What more would make it perfect?</p><br/><p>No. Not that. All of them were wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The enlightenment came from a completely unexpected point.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s thinking until now was wrong. Mana crafting must not be a process of fulfilling a lacking part of an item! How could he think that as a crafter?</p><br/><p>Blacksmithing and mana crafting was the same, but at the same time, different. He had to focus on making an unprecedented item through the fusion of two already perfect processes.</p><br/><p>The bow was already perfect. He created this item using the best materials he had as a blacksmith.</p><br/><p>Now, he just had to make a perfect artifact using the power of the magic stone to the extreme, not as a blacksmith, but a mana crafter!</p><br/><p>As such.</p><br/><p>Run wild like you want.</p><br/><p>Light appeared. A \u2018black light\u2019 that appeared out of unknown origin enveloped the bow, the magic stone, Yu IlHan and the entire workshop. The light was overwhelming to the point that it may have covered the entire world momentarily.</p><br/><p>[Deathgod\u2019s Trajectory, was completed.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Mana crafting, has become level 50. You can bring out the abilities of the material used in mana crafting more easily.]</p><br/><p>Done \u2013 muttered Yu IlHan thoughtlessly. Opening his eyes, he could see that the black bow had left his embrace and was floating in the air. The magic power dwelling within it formed a perfect balance and surpassed matter by half just by existing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made a bitter smile with that masterpiece for generations to come, in front of him. While looking back to the equipments he had made until now, and especially while he thought of the most recent artifact he had made.</p><br/><p>\u201cAegis may have become like this if it took one step more, but I couldn\u2019t find the right feeling then.\u201d</p><br/><p>[However, it still has room for development. Aegis will become like that soon.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Truly beautiful. It\u2019s excruciating that this will be given to a mere elf\u2026\u2026.!]</p><br/><p>Both human and angels would be certain without even the need to check the details on this item. This artifact was the best among the ones that Yu IlHan had created until now, and is likely to remain as such for the foreseeable future.</p><br/><p>That was because they knew very well that it wasn\u2019t something that could be made every day just with the materials, the magic stone and the ability of the smith. All other conditions including inspiration and the condition of the body had to be perfect for there to be a possibility of such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cKarrows\u2019 thoughts on top of that would be truly perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ve just learnt Soul enchant, and above all, that elf won\u2019t be able to endure the dragon\u2019s thought.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the problem isn\u2019t that. It\u2019s that Orochi ate up Karrows\u2019 thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026..]</p><br/><p>Thinking back, he hadn\u2019t moved Orochi\u2019s thought on to the Black bone giant spear yet. Yu IlHan added another schedule in his heart and lightly grabbed his masterpiece.</p><br/><p>[Deathgod\u2019s Trajectory]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 Epic]</p><br/><p>[Attack Power \u2013 7,400]</p><br/><p>[Durabilit \u2013 12,500/12,500]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 3rd class with archer-class main class.

No, calling it a \u2018clearing\u2019 was an understatement. It was overwhelmingly large, to the point where building a park or two was feasible.</p><br/><p>Although this place was once reserved for the rich in Gangnam, with several apartment building complexes, it had received substantial damage, firstly with the generation of the dungeon gate, and secondly due to the connection with Kiroa. What had cost more than its weight in gold became worthless, and it all came into Yu IlHan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>[So you\u2019re going to build your house here\u2026] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your time to look over these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan unfurled tens of bundled up blueprints, including the cross-section and the floor plans of what could only be described as a truly enormous mansion. The intricate designs and attention to detail gave off the impression that a renowned architect had crafted it.</p><br/><p>Cold beads of sweat formed on Ericia\u2019s forehead as she glanced through the blueprints.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, these were all made by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I studied it a little when I had time before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan proceeded to take out an enormous whiteboard and stuck all the papers on it. Following which he distributed the materials along with specific details and descriptions about the parts they had to handle in building.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves and Ericia had dumbfounded looks on their faces, while Yumir was hyped up for no reason. Yu IlHan confirmed with the three angels sitting on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do we have until the 2nd Great Cataclysm, again?\u201d</p><br/><p>[By Earth standards, around one month. That\u2019s almost one year since the first.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[So it\u2019s been a year already. Although, it\u2019s actually much longer than that since we used the Hourglass of Eternity.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan even activated the Hourglass of Eternity while making the building materials for his house. He was drowned in the thought of building his fortress of a house before the 2nd Great Cataclysm, no matter the cost!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have one month. If you master the manuals I gave you, then there will be no problems. We only need to \u2013 solidify the foundations, construct the parts on top of it, and mana craft it!\u201d</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re planning to make the entire mansion into a single artifact!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>1,800 3rd class magic stones, 1 4th class magic stone to serve as the core. He had prepared everything long ago.</p><br/><p>That mansion was no different from the crystallization of Yu IlHan\u2019s countless experiences from making equipments, learning magic language with his Language skill, and handling various materials that he plundered from monsters!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t build it right in front of the gate. First, we\u2019ll build a large fence with the gate as the center, and make a training ground to gather the forces of Kiroa just in case we need it. And I\u2019m going to build the house around here, and make a wall that covers much more than that like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s mansion building lecture continued on for 20 minutes. His subordinates had a hard time keeping up in order to save that information in their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The most loyal and wisest elf, thief Phiria, asked in a careful tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if something goes wrong in the middle of building? Like doing things in wrong order, or getting the position wrong\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix minor mistakes with mana crafting so it\u2019s alright. You only need to work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way out! They could only accept their fate (as slaves)!</p><br/><p>He designed the mansion rather humbly with 500 pyong (1600m^2) for each floor for a total of 3 floors. Of course, it was a little lonely to build just the main building, so he also planned to build a smaller multi-purpose shed on the side, and a dormitory for the wolfkin when they came out.</p><br/><p>[\u2018Humble\u2019, yeah right!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to mind much about the rear garden since the wolfkin would trample on it whenever they come, but instead, I\u2019m going to build a magnificent swimming pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Swimming pools are good!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Cheered Liera. She was already simulating on what swimwear to put on in order to seduce Yu IlHan. Meanwhile, Spiera spoke with a slightly bitter face.</p><br/><p>[I thought you didn\u2019t like petty decorative aesthetics\u2026 what you did in that precious time was some child\u2019s play like this\u2026\u2026] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Humans have dreams. Although we forget from time to time, Yu IlHan is still a lower existence. In fact, it\u2019s not so bad to have a side like this. A little bit is alright\u2026] (Erta)</p><br/><p>However, what Yu IlHan was doing now couldn\u2019t be called \u2018a little\u2019 no matter who looked at it!</p><br/><p>[I get that you want to build a sturdy and cool house. But this is still a little too much!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was still in the state of being hyped up, ignored her and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finished the structure of the mansion, so I\u2019ll go on to the next stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still something left!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bravest, but at the same time, most ignorant of the elves, warrior Mirey, shouted in shock. Her brain had already reached the limit!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there\u2019s the most important thing left.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan mercilessly nodded as he spoke. However, what he spoke next was in a slightly different direction to what Mirey was imagining.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve discussed up till now is the facade of the mansion that can be seen from the outside, and from now, I\u2019m going to talk about the detailed options after the fortress ification.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.fortress?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, fortress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes shined.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mansion shall become the strongest fortress on Earth. Although it\u2019s still impossible right now. I\u2019m ultimately aiming for it to fly and hunt monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>[So your dream was not a lowly mansion but a mobile fortress!?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the swimming pool on the front garden was a facility that reflected his plan to use as a weapon by using the functions on his armor. How frightening!</p><br/><p>[This is not architecture\u2026..] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera, who finally realized the truth, muttered in a dark voice while Yu IlHan was explaining the various weapons and traps here and there in the mansion, all while humming.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s just an enormous-sized blacksmithing!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[At the same time, it\u2019s also mana crafting.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>After all people here were enlightened on Yu IlHan\u2019s true intentions, Yu IlHan solidified the foundations on where the mansion would go, after piling up the enormous amount of materials.</p><br/><p>Normally, this was a huge-scale construction work that was simply out of the question for the realm of a private construction. But with IlHan\u2019s inhuman strength and the inventory\u2019s remote collection function, there was nothing impossible in this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we lay out the floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The construction work that looked like it would take several months at least, progressed according to Yu IlHan\u2019s finger movements, akin to a conductor partaking in an orchestral concert.</p><br/><p>The subordinates realized that there was no way out of this construction for them. Now, they could only hop onto this big wave that Yu IlHan had made!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Like that Yu IlHan and co started the absurd construction of the fortress. This was about constructing a fortress with blacksmithing and mana-crafting as the foundation, One that couldn\u2019t be seen even in worlds that had went through the 3rd Great Cataclysm!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After various clans, conglomerates and even countries perished after offending Yu IlHan, the rage of the people cooled off a little and the situation calmed down as well.</p><br/><p>Although some fanatics were claiming that they should destroy the existing countries and build new ones, now that the 2nd Great Cataclysm was imminent, there was no time to make new countries and solidify their foundations.</p><br/><p>The various governments who witnessed firsthand the consequences of slandering Susanoo, were worried for their respective futures, shifting away from conventional politics and pouring all their resources into preparing for the 2nd Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>Many shelters were constructed with whatever little new materials they had, while clans and the military took care of security around the densely populated areas, and they were told of the various locations where dungeons would emerge in the future and they relocated the various populated districts.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Vanguard lowered the prices of standard-tier equipments and allowed many to arm themselves. It even started selling self-defense artifacts that could be used by people with no power, propelling its already high status to another level altogether.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe president of Vanguard was that famous Deathgod, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Susanoo really was Korean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis real name was revealed. He\u2019s called Yu IlHan apparently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The governments of many countries wished to meet Yu IlHan. The Kang family wanted to prevent all of their attempts beforehand, but it was now beyond what they could handle. Above all, the Battle of Competition that allowed him to bring back a large number of advanced Traps of Destruction, was the largest factor.</p><br/><p>Starting with Japan, the second most delusional character after Kang Chan, believed that Yu IlHan was their own, America, China, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Canada\u2026\u2026 numerous countries sent love-calls to him. For some of the countries that lost most of their power after the Great Cataclysm, the leaders even came to Korea themselves!</p><br/><p>However, all of them failed to achieve their purpose; Yu IlHan had surrounded his land with enormous walls (feat. Dragon bones) prior to the construction. Phones off were the basics.</p><br/><p>As such, the people set Yu IlHan\u2019s family as their next target, but this was also impossible. Yu IlHan\u2019s father, Yu YongHan, was working at Vanguard, and his mother Kim YeSeul, did not let anyone into the house other than Yu YongHan!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that none of them tried \u2018slightly\u2019 forceful methods, but all of these people ran away after experiencing \u2018slightly\u2019 near-death experiences. The people finally found out that Yu IlHan\u2019s mother was a person of tremendous ability as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what does this family do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I knew he wasn\u2019t of ordinary birth, but even so\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan already gave the solution to humanity, known as Vanguard. He had nothing else to give out to the ones who weren\u2019t satisfied and wanted more. As such, he did not reply at all.</p><br/><p>With the challengers all gone, Kang Chan became more delusional again, and the mysticism of the Deathgod Yu IlHan rose by the day.</p><br/><p>[See, he isn\u2019t a human.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s an angel that\u2019s acting as a hero?]</p><br/><p>[The moment the great changes arrives on Earth, the hero that protected humanity since the ancient times, opens his eyes again\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>At this rate, urban legends about him would be made. This meant that humanity relied on him and had their hopes in him that much. If Yu IlHan didn\u2019t restrain his actions, then this wouldn\u2019t have ended there. Perhaps the religion \u2018Uniquism\u2019 may have been created. 1</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Things are like this outside\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae finished explaining and looked at the scenery with the almost finished mansion in the backdrop, when her eyes colored in inexplicable emotions.</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s figure, holding up a heavy piece of ceiling while flapping the two pairs of wings in the middle of the construction site, was particularly impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan, you were creating a mansion here\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s tilting! \u2026\u2026 Sorry? What did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who was both the director-on-site and the number one construction worker, asked after turning his head to Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHaaan, marry me! I also want to live here Kuhk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was \u2018nothing\u2019 by Kang MiRae standards, to Na YuNa, who was being sleeper-choked by her, it was a very big matter.</p><br/><p>However, as he believed in the friendship between Kang MiRae and Na YuNa, he didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he continuted to shout towards the working subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little more! We need to finish it before the 2nd Great Cataclysm arrives!\u201d</p><br/><p>The subordinates shouted back with vitality, and just when Yu IlHan was about to go back to work. Green text continuously popped up on his retina, even though he didn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>[Subordinate, Kiera Monkey, absorbs a portion of the records of the world \u2018Niurad\u2019.]</p><br/><p>[Record of Worlds 100/100]</p><br/><p>[You have acquired the title \u2018The frog that leaped out of the well\u2019. You are able to return to your birth world no matter which world you are in. By consuming mana, you are able to bring others as well, there is a cooldown time of one week after using it.]</p><br/><p>[IlHan, what is it\u2026..?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Oh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>While confirming the new and amazing title info, he thought about what absurd situations he would be forced into in the near future now that he acquired such a revolutionary power. He let out a deep sigh.</p><br/><p>2 weeks after that, the 2nd Great Cataclysm arrived on Earth.</p><br/><p>However, the problem was that something else that never happened in other worlds, was beginning to unravel on Earth.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Sleeper choke is a really dangerous technique. Kind readers shouldn\u2019t try it!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not the evolution of the Language skill, but the title. Evolution is still far away</p><br/><p>Like IlHan, Earth is all \u2018my way\u2019 too. They really do get along together well, living 1000 years together!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

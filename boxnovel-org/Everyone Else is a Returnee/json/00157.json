Having endured 2 years and 9 months in the Abandoned World influenced them in a way, to sleep as much as possible whenever they could in preparation for when they had to expend energy.</p><br/><p>Although there were signs and traces of thousands of monsters having tried to break into the mansion, the automatic interception system seemed to have cleaned them up.</p><br/><p>Because it was an automatic interceptor, Yu IlHan\u2019s experience didn\u2019t rise, but the growth of the Bittersweet Persona would be accelerated. He was satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, great. I\u2019ll wash up quickly and sleep. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ran checks on the mansion\u2019s perfect security system and entered while humming. Unlike apartments in Gangnam, he could always sleep at ease here.</p><br/><p>Until now, it had been impossible to be completely at rest because he did not let his guard down even in his sleep, but within the mansion, he could soundly sleep with the power of a Resting skill master.</p><br/><p>[That wasn\u2019t your full power? You foolish!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t take him seriously every time, Liera] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Listening to the angels\u2019 usual banter, he entered the mansion when he felt an aura from the study. Why did anyone enter when nothing in the study would work without Yu IlHan?</p><br/><p>[Welcome, Yu IlHan.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>When he entered his study in a state of confusion, there was Yumir, sleeping on the black leather chair that Yu IlHan used while he defended the mansion for two weeks, and Erta, who greeted Yu IlHan and co after noticing them.</p><br/><p>[Why are you so late? Were there really 4th classes in a place out of everyone\u2019s reach?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Hearing Erta\u2019s reasonable question, Yu IlHan\u2019s head started aching again and he vaguely nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was one fourth class. That was something really shocking, but Liera will explain the details. Rather than that, why is Mir sleeping here? \u201d</p><br/><p>[He woke up as he was hungry then cleared out an entire fridge of dragon meat, before looking around the mansion for traces of you, until he arrived in the study and started sleeping on the chair.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan lifted Mir up, he instinctually attached himself to Ilhan. Originally, he wanted to wake him up, but forgot about it after seeing Mir sleeping so soundly. Rather, Yu IlHan\u2019s eyelids became heavier instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some sleep before I work too.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You have stayed up for 20 days without proper sleep. I would have knocked you out if you tried to do something again in that state.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[Let me sleep with you!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You come here!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan temporarily handed Yumir over to the angels, took a shower and then took the child back before diving onto the bed. As a master of the Resting skill, he fell asleep in one second. The angels now had to do some piled up work.</p><br/><p>[Earthly matters will get even more complicated \u2026\u2026.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Are there any gates on Earth that remain connected to other worlds? If there is such a gate, have at least one angel watching over it.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[No, leaving it to an angel is too na\u00efve. We couldn\u2019t completely clean up the traitors last time. We need to ask for help from the people of Earth. We should give out Heaven\u2019s Quests.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Looks like the power of the Heaven\u2019s Army is going to be lowered even more. We\u2019re already on a tight budget thanks to IlHan.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[We have to undertake this risk. Earth has long past the point of being treated like a lower world.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Yes, we\u2019ll have to take a firm stance. Looks like I have to propose for a Reserve Territory for Earth.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[We need to go that far?] (Erta)</p><br/><p>As two 6th class angels somehow ended up on Yu IlHan\u2019s side, the discussion between the three of them influenced a lot of the matters on Earth</p><br/><p>[Bye.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I will finish it soon.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>After the three reached a consensus, Spiera headed to Heaven as their representative. If it was her, she could negotiate for the best the Heaven\u2019s Army could do; both Liera and Erta sent her off without any complaints.</p><br/><p>[She\u2019s gone.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[She did.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>After sending her off, Liera and Erta looked at each other for opportunity, but they soon came to a silent agreement and extended one of their hands in a flash.</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s was fist, and Erta\u2019s was paper.</p><br/><p>[Fuu\u2026\u2026.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>When Erta kissed her fingers in satisfaction, Liera shouted while gritting her teeth.</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s go with three rounds!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Victory is always decided with one round.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta\u2019s will was like a steel wall. As Liera laid next to Yumir after crawling onto Yu IlHan\u2019s bed with a crying face, Erta cautiously leaned on IlHan\u2019s side and held onto his sleeve.</p><br/><p>[I think I can sleep comfortably for the first time in a long while.] (Erta)</p><br/><p>[Hmph, I\u2019ll spare you for today.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Liera looked at Erta, who looked like she was satisfied with just holding his sleeve, with complicated, subtle eyes, but soon fell asleep. It looked like Erta didn\u2019t say that for nothing, as she also fell asleep quite soon.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s subordinates also slept well without waking up. Although all the monsters in the vicinity gathered towards the mansion, they were cleaned up by the automatic interception system without harming a single thing on the mansion</p><br/><p>Like that, all the inhabitants in the mansion fell into a quiet sleep.</p><br/><p>Even at this point in time, the whole world was struggling due to the residue of the weeks of battle, as well as the gates that were still there, but only this mansion was separated from such chaos.</p><br/><p>A few hours after that.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m back. Why is the mansion so quiet?\u2026\u2026 Oh.] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>Spiera, who came back from Heaven after the meeting to decide new rules that would be applied from that moment onwards, found it absurd that even Liera and Erta were asleep, but left them alone after thinking that they had suffered quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Because, things would get even messier from now onwards</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at that time, the master of the Lightning God Clan, Kang MiRae was troubled. It was because she had received a request from a high-ranking person who even she could not ignore, from the other world Lanpas.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrade, you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the resources of Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Imperial Princess of the Great Empire of Palladia, Irma An Ill\u2019ta, replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there pathways to countless other worlds? MiRae, as you probably know already, all worlds seem to have similar resources, but have slightly different ones.. Of course, monsters are different as well. In the process of studying them, we would be able to get a variety of unimaginable, high-quality records\u2026 and it will be a great opportunity to develop the magic of our world that has stagnated. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous. We do not know when the vortex would be generated, and even if I make a gate to this place and the people of the empire can temporarily come over, if the gate somehow closes due to a mistake\u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s MiRae. What should I worry about? Someday you\u2019ll make another gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Irma An Ill\u2019ta was burning with her desire for progress. Kang MiRae, who had a deep relationship with her, knew very well that she would no longer listen to anyone at this point</p><br/><p>\u201cI can assure you. People in other worlds are definitely thinking like me. I am talking about magic, but some may want items, others want monsters and some, human resources. Sooner or later, there will be a market for trading on the earth. \u201d</p><br/><p>She giggled. It was pleasure for her to think that things that have never been imagined so far will happen in reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth would have to prepare well. If you cannot control it, it will be very difficult. The management of the Gates, the management of the people who passed through those Gates, as well as the management of the transaction \u2026 MiRae, I\u2019ll advise you as a friend. Before someone else does it, Make a place that everyone would need. That way, you would be able to get a lot of things on your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the sighing Kang MiRae in front of her, Irma Anilta, laughed and added with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps Earth is one of the types of worlds that will someday emerge in the many worlds. Think positively. You can act as a trade center for many worlds. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish that there will not be a big mess. Currently, Earth is not in a situation where we can afford to think about other things. But precisely because of that \u2026 it would be best for me to step up in order to decrease the potential mess as much as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s expression stiffened. Of course, the ability users with enough power to open gates to other worlds were limited, but even if that was the case it was unknown when an unexpected situation would occur.</p><br/><p>The reason the people of other worlds did not harm the people of Earth was because of the contract with the Heaven\u2019s Army, and once they came over to Earth, that contract would lose effect.</p><br/><p>Even the Imperial Princess in front of her might cause a stir once she goes over to Earth. Meticulous management was mandatory!</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae recalled to the matters about Ferata. While she was fighting in an Abandoned World with others without knowing anything, Yu IlHan was fighting alone against an entire world in order to stop them. Thinking about that, a fire rose in her heart.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t rest the Earth on Yu IlHan\u2019s shoulders alone. Now it was time for someone to take away some of the burden on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae wanted to become that person. She was excusing herself that such actions befitted a partner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely make it happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you think of it that way\u2026 You really will suffer miserably. If anyone sees you, they might think that you\u2019re the one protecting all the people of Earth, \u201d</p><br/><p>The Imperial Princess was prepared to have a fight of words when she said that, but Kang MiRae only smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>The Imperial Princess pouted when she saw that Kang MiRae didn\u2019t talk deeply about herself, but she also knew of her personality well. Without stepping any further, she retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, do your best. Everyone would want to become the main character of Earth. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say as an outsider\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae sighed while imagining the people of Earth participating in this incident.</p><br/><p>Human greed would not disappear until everyone fell into destruction at the same time. If it was possible for anyone to make the vortex a gateway to another world, then the Earth would have been in a really big mess since a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Even at this moment, the leaders of the countries would be racking their brains to think of countermeasures, but even they would also be thinking about how to use this opportunity for their country. This was a natural thing</p><br/><p>\u201cThe easiest way is to create Earth\u2019s local specialty. If everyone wants a piece of it, then the trading area would be focused there, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying, it isn\u2019t that easy to pick out items that are special to Earth\u2026. oh wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae was retorting when she exclaimed. It was instead the Imperial Princess that was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, there really is one? No matter how great Earth is, it had just undergone the 2nd Great Cataclysm, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is, well\u2026\u2026 a \u2018specialty\u2019 that anyone and everyone would be greedy about\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae responded with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Why was she sighing when she was saying that there were special products? The Imperial Princess was curious, but that was natural, since the \u2018special products\u2019 she thought up of referred to the brand Vanguard, whoever was supplied the goods was practically in charge of defending Earth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is that person so good at everything!\u2019</p><br/><p>It was just a while ago that she wanted to relieve the burden on his shoulder, but she immediately thought of a method that would be reliant on him. She wanted to dig a hole and crawl into it right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are those special products? You can let me know, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult. But before that, I have a request. \u2026 It is also a request that your Highness must accept in order to obtain the Earth\u2019s specialties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s \u2018request\u2019 sounded very sinister. That was because the last time such a thing came out of her mouth, a large portion of the mana potions belonging to the empire all went to her!</p><br/><p>However, Kang MiRae had practically became the mascot of the Empire. She couldn\u2019t forgo her request lightly. The Imperial Princess opened her mouth after resolving herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, ask me anything. What do you want from me? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaterials related to magic engineering. Anything that exists in the Empire. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>An attack from an unexpected direction. However, she soon nodded her head because it was much easier than she thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll look into it. If it\u2019s the fundamentals, I have some right now in my room\u2026\u2026 But the existence of craftsmanship is indispensable for the magic engineering, so in fact, in this era, research on that side isn\u2019t advancing a lot. If you\u2019re the one planning to learn it, then be prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it is not for me to learn \u2026 Actually it is also related to the specialties that your Highness is also wondering about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Question marks were rising on the Imperial Princess\u2019s face. Kang MiRae thought that it was about time to reply to her question, and extended her bracelet towards her with a quiet smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever give this to you even if my head falls off. Just check the information.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Imperial Princess put her hands on the bracelet even while pouting. At that moment, a series of green text appeared on her retina and\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cTh, this, this this this this craftsman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Imperial Princess stood up from her place and shouted without being able to hide her excitement.</p><br/><p>In response to the expected reaction, Kang MiRae smiled while putting her bracelet back on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the value of the special product high enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Erta is quite shy</p><br/><p>A feeling of a new quest (2)</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Tried editing from google translated version. Tell me your thoughts. The translation speed\u2026 well\u2026 isn\u2019t that much different.</p><br/><p>Chamber posting, thanks for reading and I\u2019m always open to sponsors! (Fundraising for my new laptop\u2026 the Asus UX501 failed to be fixed\u2026And my new aim is to go higher! (Aero 14 from Gigabyte. Man, that looks sexy))</p><br/><p>Also, no chapters after this was edited from google translate. It just isn\u2019t worth it. If I had good mouse control (which I don\u2019t) it might have been, editing from google translate requires a lot of clicking\u2026. and I\u2019d rather translate from scratch if it doesn\u2019t give me any time improvements.</p><br/><p>And it was also funny how \u2018Yu IlHan\u2019 was translated to \u2018the only one\u2019, \u2018the unique\u2019, \u2018the unique one\u2019. I\u2019m like \u2013 \u201cLol, google translate must have chuunibyou\u201d</p><br/><p>Also, I\u2019m planning to take the next university term/semester off. Because 1. I can\u2019t keep up with school content (they\u2019re way beyond my comprehension). and 2. My dad will probably quit working(as in retirement), so his company won\u2019t pay my tuition anymore. I\u2019ll probably finish my degree (since I\u2019m currently on the 5th semester/term out of 8)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

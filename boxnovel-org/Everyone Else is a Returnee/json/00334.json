For around 3 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s meaningless though!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is meaningful. That\u2019s enough time to destroy all the other transcenders from other factions.\u201d</p><br/><p>3 hours is enough? Kang HaJin looked at Na YuNa in plea to stop that madman, but Na YuNa replied to not interfere with someone else\u2019s marriage business. In the end, Erta was the one to nitpick with him. Heli\u00e8na was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to connect with Earth right now? Really, really really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep to the prophecy darling. You said you hate prophecies but are you really going to act in accordance to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the prophecy is correct. Not because dad prophesized it as such. The current Dragon\u2019s Nest is still incomplete. Our main world needs to be Earth. That\u2019s because the world I was born and raised in is Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026 still incomplete?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s will was firm. Everyone already realized that Yu IlHan was looking at a completely different realm from what they were experiencing by themselves.</p><br/><p>They could no longer go against him. He was the leader of the faction and the supreme being, so they had no choice but to comply.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s say that we make Earth our main world. Then can\u2019t you just summon Earth and fuse it like you did with other worlds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that happens, Earth will be permanently subordinated to Dareu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can\u2019t you just go over to Earth and fuse Dareu with Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that happens, Earth will be crumpled to bits without any traces left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke Yu IlHan seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice but to open a gate and fuse it directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, Mr. IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae found her calm first.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it. I\u2019ll help to the best of my ability. I just need to make a really, really large gate right? I just need to make it so that Earth and Dareu are facing each other, right? Everything else will be handled by you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are always quick to understand, Miss MiRae. As expected of a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is in the field of instinct. I still half-doubt that it would work.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, to not believe him, the things he had achieved now were all completely insane as well. They were already riding on the back of a tiger. It was too late to turn back, and had to accompany him wherever he went. Kang MiRae utilized the Crown of Wisdom and raised her staff, while Yu IlHan agitated his mana with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss YuNa, please take care of the holy region. This time, you have to strengthen me on top of Miss MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that~. Fine, fine. Holy region goofers should do their job. I really hate this side-character treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut no one other than you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I just complained because I want you to care about me more!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, she was shameless to the point that she was rather adorable! Yu IlHan patted her hair as she wished and turned around to Mystic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic will support me. Don\u2019t forget that this is a parallel connection between Earth and Dareu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about the fact that Earth is relatively too low in league, master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pour Dareu\u2019s power into Earth to balance it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd! That\u2019s absolutely impo\u2026.ssible\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic became speechless midway her sentence. Although she thought that was impossible, she also felt like Yu IlHan could do it. In the end, she also closed her mouth and pushed her straw hat onto her head, covering her eyes and breaking her line of sight with Yu Ilhan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You were the one who said support. Whatever happens is not my responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. And\u2026\u2026 mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul never knew she would be called out and widened her eyes. Yu IlHan smiled and nodded his head. Instead of a concrete explanation, he added another sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need help from Erta and Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? The only thing I\u2019m better at than the others is magic formations\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErta and Heli\u00e8na\u2019s help? Oh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three women had the same expressions. They finally realized what Yu ilHan was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, son. You\u2019re always dreaming of absurd things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have gone with a different method if it was me alone. So mom, I know how to ask help from others now. I\u2019m different from the me of before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he uttered all the dark history he had, it seemed that nagged on his mind. Kim YeSeul found her son so cute when he hurriedly added since he thought that the thing from last time may bother her, and ended up giggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, my son. You make me proud. You\u2019ve grown up well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, is this really a perfect plan? No matter how I think about it, this is too unstable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the rest of it is guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, we\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled at Heli\u00e8na and breathed deeply. When he gave a glance to Na YuNa, she bit her lips and extended her two arms. A thick pink aura rose from her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Leyt\u2026\u2026 no.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head mid-chant and stopped. Was she about to play around at such an important time? \u2013 everyone thought that as they looked at her, but Na YuNa\u2019s eyes were more serious than ever. Then why?</p><br/><p>The next moment, a new chant was uttered from her mouth.</p><br/><p>[All mana shall obey \u2018me\u2019, the one that raises the beauty of all matter.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan abruptly raised his head. It seemed that she had also discovered the loss of the recorded gods! The ones that received the blessing from other gods will probably realize in the future as well. However, it was very like her to realize that first.</p><br/><p>[Envelop all that I love, bless, and strengthen them.]</p><br/><p>[To the one that is qualified to monopolize my beauty, with all my love, I shall execute my miracles in god\u2019s name \u2013 Everything shall become as you will it to be.]</p><br/><p>The holy region enveloped the entire city. The two focal points of the aura were none other than Kang MiRae and Yu IlHan! Yu IlHan had a lot of things he wanted to complain about Na YuNa\u2019s chant, but for now, he had to do what he had to do.</p><br/><p>He opened his mouth, and Declared while gathering the mana of Dareu that had a higher mana density than any other world after the 9th Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>[Thou shalt be the master of the miracles, and execute my power on my permission.]</p><br/><p>[Thou art the master of magic, and shall stand as the connector of dimensions.]</p><br/><p>Two strands of Declaration raged violently after it became mana. Kang MiRae abruptly opened her eyes in the midst of the turmoil. The Crown of Wisdom flickered wildly while releasing light of varying intensities and accelerated her thought process.</p><br/><p>Eventually, when all her magic power was focused into one point, Kang MiRae\u2019s mouth opened. Surprisingly, the structure of her magic power was similar to Yu IlHan\u2019s when he used Declaration.</p><br/><p>[Connect.]</p><br/><p>Mana was concentrated before it sublimed. Three beings that surpassed the records combined their powers to create a miracle.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere opened in Dareu. The skies of Earth could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was really connected\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two dimensions had only become connected. True fusion had yet to begin. Kang MiRae maintained the gate with all her power, and Yu IlHan started his next process. A message appeared on his retina.</p><br/><p>[Earth had been waiting for the moment to be subordinated by you from a long time ago.]</p><br/><p>[You are prepared. Will you declare Earth has a territory of Dragon\u2019s Nest?]</p><br/><p>[From this moment onwards\u2026..]</p><br/><p>He could feel all the mana that filled his body, the resonance with Dareu, and the strand of connection he had with Earth. Yu IlHan spat out a deep breath and uttered the fateful line.</p><br/><p>[Earth is the main world of Dragon\u2019s Nest.]</p><br/><p>[Earth is leaping to a higher world. All restrictions on Earth are lifted.]</p><br/><p>[The higher world, Earth, is fusing to D\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>The message that was appearing on his retina disappeared with an almost inaudible noise, and a new message appeared.</p><br/><p>[The two higher worlds, Earth, and Dareu, are fusing.]</p><br/><p>The skies of Earth and Dareu burned as they faced each other. The mana and matter that comprised Dareu, were rising into the air like mad. The only thing that remained intact was Yu IlHan and the city they were in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, is this really possible\u2026\u2026!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mystic, who never talked about what was possible or impossible when fusing seven thousand worlds at once, now screamed. However, Yu IlHan called for Kim YeSeul instead of replying to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ll connect you with that thing. Please take care of the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are making me work hard. Okay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan Declared with a smile.</p><br/><p>[My subordinate who has the same objective as me, shall have the same thoughts as mine.]</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan\u2019s declaration was fulfilled, a deep voice of a man\u2019s rang in Kim YeSeul\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>[Just what is this? Why is the concept of Earth being shaken?]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim YeSeul smiled and called Erta and Heli\u00e8na to her side. They had to make a masterpiece of mana and magic formation crafts in the fastest time possible. A magic formation of space-time that contained all of their essence!</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you will have to change your corporeal form according to what we say. Let\u2019s see. Can I call you Will of the Guardian?\u201d</p><br/><p>[My god, that world is\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>The Will of the Guardian that finally recognized Dareu screamed without being able to hold back. It also realized what was happening right now.</p><br/><p>[Fuck! You insane madman!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry! I don\u2019t think failure is allowed after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan hadn\u2019t even begun properly yet.</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae\u2019s role was more important than Yu IlHan\u2019s in fusing Earth and Dareu through a gate. Synchronizing the records of Dareu with Earth\u2019s could be done by Mystic alone. Predicting the world after the fusion of Dareu and Earth was the job for Kim YeSeul, Erta, and Heli\u00e8na.</p><br/><p>There was only one thing Yu IlHan needed to do. To fuse Dareu and Earth together to create a perfect world. Yu IlHan knew very well what kind of abilities he needed to utilize in order to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlacksmithing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026IlHan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera, who could only cheer from the sidelines, was shocked after hearing Yu IlHan mutter. At that point, she thought \u2018no way\u2019, but couldn\u2019t stay like that after hearing his next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMana crafting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, is that perhaps\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul enchant.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had plenty of materials.</p><br/><p>The crafter was here.</p><br/><p>There was more than enough mana.</p><br/><p>The lifeforce also existed as well.</p><br/><p>[In this time and place, Dragon\u2019s Nest.]</p><br/><p>The power of \u2018miracles\u2019 that Na YuNa made was finally consumed this moment. Yu IlHan brought out all the power he could bring out. The Cradle of Miracles that was scattered in the atmosphere of Dareu had decreased into the size of a bean and appeared on Yu IlHan\u2019s palm, before disappearing without a trace.</p><br/><p>[Shall be created.]</p><br/><p>An unrecorded record. A technique that was already completed the moment it was made. A miracle that was allowed only to Yu IlHan. An incubator that incubated possibilities into reality.</p><br/><p>The Cradle of Miracles appeared once again. This time, it enveloped both Dareu and Earth and formed a humongous egg that could not be fully observed with the eyes.</p><br/><p>The prophecy was finally fulfilled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At that moment, a grand explosion occurred!</p><br/><p>[Kuwaaaaaaaaah!]</p><br/><p>\u201cUaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The golem roared, but the one who actually wanted to scream was Yu IlHan. The effect of the explosion was so large that, Yu IlHan\u2019s body sprung upwards due to the impact! He only endured while putting his faith into Aegis and his armor. Also\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this thing still isn\u2019t dead! Then\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[You really are going to do that? Do you have to do it?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took out his Eight-tailed dragon spear, and activated purple flames, enhanced it with the Eternal Flame, and activated the Dragonic blood-enhanced Blaze.</p><br/><p>[Are you really going to do it?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll really die!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I die\u2026\u2026. please blast my the (D:) drive on my laptop to smithereens without asking!\u201d</p><br/><p>An absurdly high temperature heat appeared on the spear, and Yu IlHan struck beneath his foot with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUooooh!\u201d (This is MC)</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOM! An explosion incomparable to the one just now, occurred! The once-exploded magic gunpowder on various parts of its body (scattered due to the first explosion) was affected by Blaze and caused a secondary explosion!</p><br/><p>[Kuooooooh!]</p><br/><p>The true might of the bomb only started now. The magic gunpowder scattered deep inside its body, amplified the already volatile energy of Blaze to the extreme, and instantly melted its body into a pool of magma. That which melted the golem\u2019s body, also tried to melt Yu IlHan as well.</p><br/><p>No matter how high Yu IlHan\u2019s fire attribute resistance was, it was impossible to endure without a single scratch amidst all that. In the pain that made him feel like his guts were melting, he glugged on Breath like mad and endured. He actually found it quite endurable after a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s actually pretty warm once you get used to it\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even a higher existence like me is feeling hot! What was that!?] (Spiera)</p><br/><p>[IlHan, come to yourself! You must not sleep!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[I can understand your worry for him, but that\u2019s a death flag for the snowy mountains!] (Erta)</p><br/><p>How long had he endured in that state? The moment Yu IlHan decided to take out a new cheer pack, the surroundings turned silent as if everything was a lie. Until just now, his ears were almost numb from the golem\u2019s roars, the churning of the insides, and the trembling from everywhere, but now they had all disappeared.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, the text that signified his victory, etched onto his retina.</p><br/><p>[You have earned, 488,910,776,003 experience.]</p><br/><p>[You have become level 162. 2 Strength, 2 Agility, 2 Health, 2 Magic increases.]</p><br/><p>[You have earned the record of Lv 270 Keshna Golem.]</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at that moment, an enormous quantity of information flowed into Yu IlHan\u2019s head. To exaggerate a little, it was similar to the time he received the blessing from the god of smithing.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t imagine that such a thing would happen, but the golem named \u2018Keshna Golem\u2019 had absorbed the records of the ruins in the process of fusing everything into its body, and with Yu IlHan defeating the Keshna Golem, all the records had flowed into Yu IlHan\u2019s brain now!</p><br/><p>No\u2026.. well, to be exact, this was precisely what those ancestors intended!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fucker! This is no trap, but something that would activate either way!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Sheesh, there really are some lunatics out there. Do you think humanity dies out in places because of psychos like this one\u2026..?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t like the magic engineering researchers had intentions to destroy the empire with a golem levelling 270. The problem was the golem they had created!</p><br/><p>Keshna. This magic metal possessed incredible mana absorbability, tensile strength and was counted as one of the highest-tier metals, but other than that, if it was processed through a special means, it becomes possible for it to absorb the records from another object and preserve it in its entirety.</p><br/><p>That was why, the ancestors created a golem from it, intending for it to absorb the records, and enable the successors to defeat it and absorb all of those records!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.. That, was, the original intention, but the record absorbability of the Keshna Golem was beyond their imaginations. It would have been good if it just ended with absorbing the magic engineering-related records, but while it was waiting in darkness, it had rapidly grown stronger by absorbing all sorts of other records!</p><br/><p>Contrary to the ancestors\u2019 intentions for a successor to find the place soon, it was left alone for countless years, and the golem which became stronger through absorbing records alone for a long period of time, had actually broke through to the 4th class, and reached level 270!</p><br/><p>And, as intended, it lifted its body in order to defeat the invaders. Result being the scene that had just taken place.</p><br/><p>In other words, the ancestral researchers wanted make a \u2018golem that can act as a device to transfer all of the records in its entirety\u2019, but ended up creating a \u2018golem that infinitely becomes stronger\u2019. This was a result more absurd than inventing post-its while trying to develop adhesives!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this must be their karma.\u201d</p><br/><p>The angels who heard Yu IlHan\u2019s short explanation could only smile bitterly. They, decided to stop at the conclusion that mana crafters, whether new or old, were all psychos.</p><br/><p>[So, how are you going to get out, IlHan?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is all mine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Yu IlHan while avoiding the still uncooled magma. He swung his Eight-tailed dragon spear to procure a place to stand, and without much difficulty, he put away the golem, to be exact, the parts that were only composed of the magic metal.</p><br/><p>One moment, and the space was empty. Yu IlHan, took out spears from his inventory and destroyed his way out.</p><br/><p>Beyond the traces of the stone mountain, which looked like a disaster had struck, his group was waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo cool\u2026\u2026 It will be perfect is there was the white letters \u2018END\u2019 at the bottom left of the background~!\u201d</p><br/><p>First, I\u2019ll smack Na YuNa on the forehead \u2013 he decided, as he walked towards them.</p><br/><p>Well, there was something else he had decided on.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t even look in the direction of Lanpas from today onwards!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry! I was planning to repay you for the necklace, but to think I\u2019d ended up causing an inconvenience\u2026..!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve got the experience and the magic metal as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess couldn\u2019t lift her head in front of him. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t bother mentioning the fact that the golem would have activated either way. The opponent was being humble, so he didn\u2019t find a need to relieve her burden at all.</p><br/><p>Well, he did express his thanks saying that he had acquired plenty of materials related to magic engineering.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and I won\u2019t be going to that banquet either. I want to go back quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve suffered so much. Why don\u2019t you rest for a day here-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really want, then please give me the food that will appear in the banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Yu IlHan while taking out a L*ck&amp;L*ck box.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate people, not the food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut it\u2026\u2026 here? The food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can, pack an assortment into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess couldn\u2019t possibly say no, and accepted the box with a strange expression. Then, she looked towards Kang MiRae for help. Kang MiRae noticed that, and said as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you to come back, so please be on your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial princess walked on the hallway while stomping on the ground. Yu IlHan smile at that and asked Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll borrow the bath though. My body\u2019s a mess right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanna bathe with daddy too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen me too, with Mr. IlHan~\u2026\u2026 ouchouchouchouchouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa\u2019s attempt to go with them was for naught. Thanks to Kang MiRae\u2019s consideration, Yu IlHan and Yumir could enjoy a luxurious and leisurely bath.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had also set up a luxurious bath in the Bittersweet Persona, but it did lose out when compared to the one in the imperial castle. Yu IlHan entered the bath with Yumir and stretched his body, while trying to find any points to learn from the bath facilities of the imperial castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, wasn\u2019t it scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>These were Yumir\u2019s words while he scraped Yu IlHan\u2019s back with a soft towel. Yu IlHan thought about what he was referring to, and realized that it was the battle a while ago.</p><br/><p>Scary, huh. It looks like Yumir had felt a sense of fear facing the overwhelming size of the golem. Well, it was no wonder, since the golem did indeed have an overwhelming size, and an overwhelming strength to go with it.</p><br/><p>If he did not have the magic gunpowder or the Death Driver, Yu IlHan would have had to put much more effort into defeating it. Although, he didn\u2019t think he would lose.</p><br/><p>So, it was natural for Yumir, who was both young and still weak, to get scared. Perhaps Yu IlHan was a bad parent for forgetting that he was only three years old now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the big-sized guys. Dad won easily, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir\u2019s voice turned serious, so Yu IlHan pondered seriously as well. Of course, the conclusion was the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, it was easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had already prepared a lot to fight against large enemies, and had coincidentally met one that just fit that criteria. Naturally, there was no other outcome than victory, and so, he won.</p><br/><p>Well, yes, he did panic when the enemy used an attack he didn\u2019t predict, but in any case, they were all attacked that he had put up countermeasures against. It wouldn\u2019t have been so easy if his Excavation skill didn\u2019t rise at the decisive moment, but in any case, it was quite an easy battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is hard to you, dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigher existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the others, I feel like I can face them with my techniques artifacts or wits, but I still can\u2019t find a solution against higher existences. I feel like I can do it once I am 4th class, but for now, it\u2019s still impossible. No matter how stealthily I move, it will be meaningless if I cannot penetrate their skins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. Dad is strong after all. Your standards are completely different from others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir nodded, but his voice was trembling as if slightly frustrated. Yu IlHan could feel more pressure on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to help dad, but I was sad because I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou helped out plenty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><br/><p>His abilities rose just by fighting together, and he also inflicted a fatal strike with Dragonic blood, so he couldn\u2019t say that Yumir wasn\u2019t of help. However, Yumir didn\u2019t seem to be satisfied with just that. As expected of a dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to become stronger. I want to fight a lot, and eat a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll become a dragon that suits you, dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you will be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Yumir was plenty strong right now, but Yu IlHan thought that it was not a bad thing to give a positive stimulus to the child. And also\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I got my hands on magic engineering knowledge, I\u2019ll make a present for you Mir. However, I\u2019ll only give it to you once I see that you\u2019re growing fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A suitable reward would help his desire! Yu IlHan could feel that the mana in Yumir\u2019s body was thumping, in a positive way. Yu IlHan felt better since he thought that he took a step forwards as a father.</p><br/><p>[I wanna bathe too! With Mir~~~!] (Na YuNa)</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026come, here, and, sit, down.] (Kang MiRae)</p><br/><p>[Hiik!] (Na YuNa)</p><br/><p>At that moment, faint voices could be heard. It looks like the people out there didn\u2019t think that it would be audible inside the bath, but Yu IlHan\u2019s senses were already beyond that of a 3rd class. Mir was the same. The father and son looked at each other and laughed.</p><br/><p>When the father and son exited the bath, the imperial princess was waiting outside. Her expression of achievement was quite impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ve put in every single one of them! By me! For Mr. Yu IlHan only!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took back the L*ck&amp;L*ck box from her. However, the imperial princess also handed him a jewel that was emitting violet light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an item that was found when we first went to the magic engineering ruins. Mana can be felt from it, but we can\u2019t do anything about it, so I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan accepted the jewel. He also checked its information, but for now, he had the same conclusion as the imperial princess. This was an item that was already processed once, and its uses were incomprehensible right now. Perhaps he would understand after he made all the magic engineering knowledge his.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur empire wants to be on friendly terms with you in the future. I implore you to please remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did expect this, but it looks like she still had a sense of guilt.</p><br/><p>Well, it was no wonder, since, although such things were everyday life for Yu IlHan, for her, it was a disaster that would only have a chance of happening once every few hundred years. It was natural that she thought that Yu IlHan had a bad first impression of the empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is alright. If anything, I profited since I levelled up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it this way. This jewel is my compensation. Oh, and when you enter a newly found ruin, please be careful. It looks like the magic kingdom had quite a lot of psychopaths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As if he\u2019s not a psychopath\u2026..]</p><br/><p>[Shh.]</p><br/><p>Although they had to do something completely different from what he had expected here, Yu IlHan, Yumir, Na YuNa, and Kang MiRae could safely return to Earth. They had harvested more than they had expected too!</p><br/><p>And the next day, he set off for Breya after repairing his equipment.</p><br/><p>Time to acquire a new source of metal and holy stones.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>What 2nd Great Cataclysm is to the people of Earth : Struggle for survival</p><br/><p>What 2nd Great Cataclysm is to the people of other worlds : Opportunity.</p><br/><p>What 2nd Great Cataclysm is to Yu IlHan : Labour</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Special thanks to Daniel P!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yu IlHan asked him some questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Smithson, what is your current race?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue dragon\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Mrs. Smithson?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue dragon\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then your daughter will definitely be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA dragon\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no problems at all. They accepted it all naturally! Only the princess in Carina Malatesta, no, Carina Smithson\u2019s arms had a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe probably understands what we\u2019re talking about right now. You need to be careful with her education.\u201d</p><br/><p>A child that understood speech immediately after birth! Considering how her foundation was extremely high since she was born as the daughter of two true dragons, her growth wouldn\u2019t be ordinary either. Carina Smithson thought that she chose a good godfather and asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather, please take care of this child. You will accept her into Dragon\u2019s Nest, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, as long as she fulfills the qualifications. So? What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuni Smithson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026And if it was a boy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNick Smithson.\u201d 1</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan became speechless. Yuni, in her mother\u2019s arms, probably did not know how her name came about nor would she want to\u2026 probably.</p><br/><p>Please let her grow up without knowing the origins of her name \u2013 Yu IlHan prayed to the non-existent gods while patting her forehead. The child smiled even brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s really pretty~. She must take after her mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Hahaha, she looks completely like her mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was the birth of new life, almost everyone other than Yu IlHan were already gathered at that place. Na YuNa, who still didn\u2019t like Michael Smithson that much, indirectly dealt damage while stroking Yuni, but Michael had become really toned down after he became a father and just laughed about it.</p><br/><p>He completely changed as a person!</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Yuni struggling in Carina Smithson\u2019s arms, Liera\u2019s eyes glistened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us make a baby too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wondered why you weren\u2019t saying that earlier. No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy! I want to have a baby! I want to have a babyyyyyy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera clung to Yu IlHan, but he firmly refused. And the reason went like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate it because it feels like the epilogue is coming soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to retort, but couldn\u2019t find a way to do so and became silent. Yu IlHan tapped her shoulders and received Yuni from Carina Smithson. Since he became her godfather, he had to at least do his job properly.</p><br/><p>[Yuni, you shall become beautiful and happy. You shall become someone who can share joy and bear the burdens of sadness with others. You shall have a warm heart as strong as your sturdy claws, and as much emotions as your clever smarts. You shall become one that\u2019s loved and one that shall love.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s Declaration became a heartfelt wish that enveloped Yuni. It was a wish that would grant upon her a bright potential, though not absolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, look at all that mana. Amazing\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful. Only he can wield mana so beautifully like that, can\u2019t he\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Would Yuni know how much of a blessing Yu IlHan\u2019s Declaration was? Yu IlHan grabbed Yuni\u2019s finger before giving her back to her parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations. I was so absorbed in work that I didn\u2019t even know you two got married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will do the marriage ceremony later. So that is\u2026\u2026 after everything is over, once Earth is back in orbit, with both of our parents. Please visit us at that time with everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI pray for their survival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled, saying that he really wished it was so.</p><br/><p>It would be a lie if he said that the figure of his father didn\u2019t flash past his head. No matter how strong he became, it would all be meaningless if Gabriel had met with grave misfortune.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2026\u2026He should be fine.\u2019</p><br/><p>He convinced himself that his father was alright. Nothing would change just by worrying. As he always did, he only had to do what he could do right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the Smithson pair should busy themselves with raising their child\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we create our own child, ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we shall train.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smacking Liera\u2019s head, Yu IlHan retorted in a serious tone. It became like this after he realized that there was 9 years left after making artifacts for an entire year! Liera asked with a crying face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are we filming the epilogue, hey?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will blow the whistle when it comes down to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very suspicious foreshadow! Are you going to question the origins of my birth at this point!?\u201d2</p><br/><p>Time flowed very quickly after that. While Yu IlHan was absorbed in training along with the other main battle members, while the other, more ordinary people actually lived a very joyful life, much more so than he had thought possible.</p><br/><p>There was no threat from monsters, and they were living in a world where civilization and nature were mixed into one, so in fact, it could be said that they were living their most peaceful life since before the Great Cataclysm.</p><br/><p>Of course, regardless of what they were up to, Yu IlHan did his own thing like a loner. Although he took the first step as the Creator, he still had long ways to go. And he until reached the end of that path, his steps would not halt.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Originally, Yu IlHan was very skilled in not noticing the flow of time, but since there was someone who showed clear changes among the ones he was constantly in close proximity with, he couldn\u2019t stay unaware of it now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>A pretty little girl with brilliant golden hair tied into a ponytail shouted while the end of her hair fanned out like a sunflower, as she zoomed past him in the training zone within the Flying fortress. Yu IlHan waved his hand with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s you, Yuni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYay! I can go in, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s goddaughter Yuni grew rapidly as expected of the daughter of two true dragons. Since there were masters of all fields around her, she had plenty of opportunities to learn techniques, and she, like a dragon, had very-difficult-to-satisfy thirst for knowledge, and tried to learn as many things as possible in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>This was top-tier talent in Yu IlHan\u2019s view! Dragons are really the best!</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather, please spar with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><br/><p>And the one that Yuni admired the most, like all other dragons and dragonkin on Earth, was Yu IlHan, the manager of Earth. Well, his strength was the highest too anyway.</p><br/><p>From the first instance that she was able to hold a weapon in her two hands, she has picked up the spear like it was the most natural thing to do, and now that she possessed an outer appearance of a fifteen-year-old girl, she had developed a pretty high level of technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I might be able to grow if I go against you just once more. Please? Pleaaaaase?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay, come then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYess! Iyaaaaaaaaah! Ergh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t even last 3 seconds against Yu IlHan. Yu IlHan was a man who was merciless to anyone regardless of ages or genders, after all. The reason she could even last 3 seconds in the first place was because he went easy on her! Yuni, collapsed on the floor like a dead frog, grumbled while rubbing her nose that became red.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I thought I would be able to last longer since I got to the 4th class now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, she is actually 4th class already! Yu IlHan asked her in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuni, how old are you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? It will be my ninth birthday the day after tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>That means that the barrier will disappear soon! Yu IlHan was shocked, and he despaired.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t mastered Transcendent Trajectory yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat level is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c99\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that he should punish Na YuNa for spreading unpleasant habits around, Yu IlHan retrieved the spear that was floating in the air.</p><br/><p>When he looked at the sky, the projection of the Hourglass of Eternity indeed revealed to him that there wasn\u2019t much time left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ll be busy for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s no place for you in it, Yuni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to help you though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about it again after you become a higher existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The world would be a beautiful place if everyone was like her \u2013 sighing, Yu IlHan patted Yuni\u2019s head. Yuni shriveled saying it was ticklish and made an innocent laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then shall I go out. We need to be back safely for your birthday party Yuni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a cool line!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I had that line at the ready ever since you were born.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied in cool words and exited the training zone while retrieving his spear.</p><br/><p>As though having read his mind, his companions were already waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be soon, IlHan. There isn\u2019t even one hour left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, will it really be over in 3 hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might take a little longer than that. If there\u2019s no hidden last boss, then 5 minutes, if there is, then 20 minutes, and if there\u2019s another one after that one is defeated then one hour, and an extra 30 minutes for each one that appears after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>His trump cards were uncountable! Yu IlHan left them speechless and exited the Flying fortress.</p><br/><p>Perhaps everyone knew, but the non-battle members had already gone down to Earth and the others were already on the aerial city.</p><br/><p>[I greet the Lord.]</p><br/><p>Uriel, with four pairs of dragon wings, greeted him. She was the only 8th class other than Mystic, and had the most amount of mana among his subordinates. She was one of the two \u2018people\u2019 that were most motivated for the matter that was about to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know. You want to go save dad, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Th, that is true, but not only that, that uh\u2026\u2026 Ga, Gabriel is.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me so it\u2019s fine. You settle things with mom on your end. What\u2019s important is the mindset to clear up the important things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sometimes, people make the impossible possible. Though, what laid in front of Yu IlHan were all possible things!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan consoled Uriel who still had a worried expression in worry of Gabriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much. Everything will go as I planned it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The Lord\u2019s amazing point is that you can make me accept with your speech alone but\u2026\u2026 understood. I believe in the Lord. Let\u2019s go save Gabriel. Let\u2019s go stop God. Let\u2019s bring an end to our bad karma with the Destruction Demon Army. Let\u2019s interrogate Satan on what he is doing. \u2026\u2026Let\u2019s bring peace back.]</p><br/><p>Uriel raised her head after saying that. Behind her were all the official members of Dragon\u2019s Nest lined up. They were already armed with the gear that Yu IlHan had handed out, and were ready to fight against any and all enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone should know this already, but.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke Yu IlHan in a voice that was neither loud nor small. At this point, he could make his voice be heard by everyone without having to use the Declaration skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much of the enemy forces left. While they were foolishly whittling away at each other, we created Earth, and they widened the gap all by themselves when they would have lost even if they came at me head on. So, our victory is pretty much set in stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take care of the leaders, so I will ask you to take care of the remaining ones. Honestly, if you get so much as a scratch on your skin while fighting with the equipment I gave you, you probably don\u2019t have the qualifications to be a higher existence. I will immediately strip your qualifications if that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he make others so unmotivated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Disregarding what everyone was saying, Yu IlHan finished his speech off quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will invade the enemy main world immediately. As soon as the barrier is dispelled\u2026\u2026 Oh, and before that, someone send Yuni back to Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Yuni, this girl, how dare you sneakily come here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe, Me too! I want to fight! Godfatherrrrrrrrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Yuni was chased to the ground by the others, Yu IlHan really confirmed that everyone here were members meant for, and ready for battle before speaking once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready, then I shall immediately warp after the barrier dispels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, darling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get that we\u2019re invading enemy main worlds\u2026\u2026 but which one are we going to first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we need to rob the emptiest house first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan winked and spoke to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Netherworld.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/><p>1. Yuni+Nick = Yunick = \u201cUnique\u201d. Remember how Michael Smithson calls him \u201cMister Unique\u201d? </p><br/><p>2.

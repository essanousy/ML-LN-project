The ability user platoons managed by the countries also started taking shape, and the clans, which operated like companies, also solidified their place in the changing society.</p><br/><p>The value of strong ability users increased more and more, and many industries and technology lost their meaning, and even more new industries started rising.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was all an achievement made under the blood and sweat of many.</p><br/><p>The mana concentrated in Japan spread around the world along with Orochi\u2019s death, and the concentration of mana on Earth rose as a whole, which made the frequency of monster occurrences and dungeon occurrences much much higher. Anyone with power had to fight in order to protect their homes.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the 26 clans who succeeded in getting higher standard weapons from Vanguard, shined brighter than any others.</p><br/><p>The gear Yu IlHan sold were usable even after one became a 3rd class, and they just had to hunt the monsters while being careful not to damage it.</p><br/><p>Their reputation rose by the day in their countries, and in the world, and in truth, their levels were rising incomparably faster than other clans to the point that the other clans couldn\u2019t do anything to them even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>Then, what was left was desperateness.</p><br/><p>They wished that Vanguard would sell them higher weapons, or even, just standard weapons on a large scale, before the gap became bigger.</p><br/><p>It was funny, but the gear shop that Yu IlHan had set up since he did not want to suffer alone, had become the number one wish for everyone in the world. In a mere 4 months.</p><br/><p>There were two others who received attention that was not inferior to Vanguard, which was the Lightning God Clan of Korea, and Suppression, who was the only organization under a country\u2019s government, and was supplied gear by Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[The Lightning God Clan of Korea conquers difficult dungeons one after the other!]</p><br/><p>[Overwhelming growth of small scale clans. Everyone predicts the alliance of Vanguard.]</p><br/><p>[The small tiger of Korea, Suppression, becomes an army admired by all.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It seems your gear were pretty good.]</p><br/><p>It seemed that the reputation of the Lightning God Clan, and Suppression was really high as he could read news about them despite still being in America.</p><br/><p>They were mostly news about how the Lightning God Clan saved a clan who were isolated inside a dungeon, or about Suppression, who safely exterminated monsters in a danger zone in another country.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, the taegeukgi (Korean flag) is flapping everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Your share should be high too. Why don\u2019t you ask them to deduct your taxes every time a taegukgi flaps?]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a genius?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Vanguard should have influenced it since it opened in Gangnam of Seoul. The opinion that the Lightning God Clan had a deeper relationship with Vanguard than the other clans were floating around the net.</p><br/><p>The Lightning God Clan neither acknowledged nor rejected that statement, but the people were sure about it</p><br/><p>[Who is the owner of Vanguard, Yu IlHan?]</p><br/><p>[Vanguard supplies weapons that could not be seen in any other world. The president, Yu IlHan, is believed to have a unique ability that can buff productive abilities\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The people were at the point where they wrote novels about Vanguard, Lightning God, and Suppression, and making secondary versions of it. It was so serious that Yu IlHan read books about the life of ten different \u2018Yu IlHan\u2019s while heading to the airport with concealment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world feels really stuffy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mana concentration is too low.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaaa, Fuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four elves that stuck to Yu IlHan in fear of concealment wearing off, were having a hard time due to the difference in concentration of mana between Dareu and Earth. Their long ears flapping were a proof of that.</p><br/><p>They must feel like their power was draining. Yu IlHan was also feeling something similar in real time, so he knew very well. He spoke to them with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably won\u2019t be able to bring your full powers out here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were prepared, but the pain is unimaginably more painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can a hero like Your Majesty come out in a world that has only gone through the 1st Great Cataclysm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t call me Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m very sorry, Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silently deciding that he should educate them properly when they go back, Yu IlHan lead them to the airport. Then, he ignored numerous people and stowed away. The elves just followed Yu IlHan onto the aeroplane without knowing anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really are interesting things, to think that such a lump of metal flies in the air.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were some human countries that made things like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, they fell shortly after the 2nd Great Cataclysm though.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nonchalant talk of the elves made Yu IlHan shiver. It was as if they were foretelling that human civilization would fall.</p><br/><p>[Earth may be different. All worlds have their own ways of living.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good if it\u2019s so.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few hours, they arrived at Korea. A lot had changed in the three months in Korea as well, especially the cities that developed much faster than the non-cities.</p><br/><p>The already high population density increased, and a portion of the monster danger zones were completely isolated. He felt as if looking at a completely different country.</p><br/><p>What was more important than anything was that talks about Vanguard, Lightning God, and Suppression were talked at least 10 times as frequently here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is His Majesty\u2019s homeland!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is messy and noisy. Especially the buildings look quite strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan finally realized that the elves did not know Korean, not to mention English. While Yu IlHan felt depressed thinking about whether he had to first teach them Korean, Erta spoke like it was nothing much.</p><br/><p>[They just need an artifact each.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Heaven\u2019s Army has tons of artifacts with translation magic cast on it. Although it isn\u2019t like it can translate monster speak or dragon tongue, but it should be possible to translate between elven language of Dareu and a language spoken on Earth.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan widened his mouth in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, there\u2019s no way you guys are so capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Then forget it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry. Please give them to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Heheh, then I\u2019ll hand over some of them. Since your achievements were so big this time, 4 translation artifacts shouldn\u2019t be so difficult.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan also laughed when he saw that Erta enjoyed the sense of superiority she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. However, that was for just a moment. Since the word \u2018Haeven\u2019s Army\u2019 came out, he thought of someone and his face paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Lita be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be sure of anything, but Yu IlHan was sure that the Destruction Demon Army was aiming for him in order to target Lita. Whether it was because Lita was strong and was a threat to them, or whether she had another value for them.</p><br/><p>Since Yu IlHan had killed them all in reverse, not to mention getting caught, it was alright, but what if Lita was fooled by them? Even if she didn\u2019t, what if she was defeated by them?</p><br/><p>He sealed such thoughts in Dareu as he couldn\u2019t relax his tension all the time, but now that he did think about her, he couldn\u2019t calm down.</p><br/><p>Erta spoke in a bitter smile after realizing what he wa thinking.</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re so worried, should I go up and check?]</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll check then.]</p><br/><p>She headed to Heaven without saying much. Yu IlHan spoke to the elves who were blinking their eyes without knowing what happened since they weren\u2019t able to see angels.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s first go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo, to Your Majesty\u2019s mansion? You can just give us a small room in a small annex.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no such thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The strongest of the four elves, the beauty greatsword warrior Mirey, tilted her head before shouting \u2018aha!\u2019 with a bulb above her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, a separate palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanna get beaten up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll follow Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Violent Majesty is cool too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up you idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elves shut their mouths and followed Yu IlHan. Thinking that it was really fortunate that he had bought out an entire floor of an apartment building, Yu IlHan led them to the apartment in Gangnam.</p><br/><p>On the way, they also passed by the building owned by Yu IlHan, and where Vanguard is,</p><br/><p>He checked whether the building was still intact, or whether the angel\u2019s protective magic was still there, and he contacted his parents when he almost arrived at the apartment.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, his mother received his call.</p><br/><p>[Son! You\u2019ve been to another world? You sure took your time.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, mom. Father\u2019s still well, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly wrong. Although it was an Abandoned World, wasn\u2019t it still another world?</p><br/><p>Now Yu IlHan was also a returnee! Although he did feel tragic thinking that whether it was worth it to become a returnee in this way!</p><br/><p>However, just as Yu IlHan was immersed in his tragedy, his mother calmly spoke some words that would make Yu IlHan faint if he heard it in his highschool days.</p><br/><p>[Your father quit work.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s good. But why?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The company went bankrupt. Well, all companies in this field went bankrupt. I think it will take some time until he can find new work.]</p><br/><p>A simple and cool reason. Yu IlHan thought about sending money home, and thought that his father would never accept it even if he died, so he spoke to his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf father still wants to work, how about working at Vanguard, mom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, his parents knew that he was the president of Vanguard. At first, the two of them thought that their son made some good ties in another world, setting up a gear shop, but watching Vanguard becoming the center of the world, they realized that the thin protective armor that Yu IlHan gave them before was the foreshadow for everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cRather than specialized work, it\u2019s more like managing the store, receiving calls\u2026\u2026. and some bothersome work, since it\u2019s the center of attention and all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s good. This man should earn some money from his son to realize that his days are long gone.]</p><br/><p>His mother took the bait. Even while sweating cold sweat at his mother\u2019s direct words, Yu IlHan ended up scattering salt on the wound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026\u2026 about just moving over to Gangnam?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Puh.]</p><br/><p>His mother burst out laughing. Then, she scolded him.</p><br/><p>[You didn\u2019t contact us for three months, but it seems that you are worried about us, eh. It\u2019s alright. Mother has some ability, and as for your father\u2026\u2026. it will be fine if he stays next to your mother.]</p><br/><p>All mothers were really quick witted. With a bitter smile, Yu IlHan gave up on moving his parents to Gangnam. Instead, he told them that he would go look for them in a few days, before going to the top floor of the apartment building with the four elves.</p><br/><p>Although it was smaller than they expected, they exclaimed at the quite a big apartment building while asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis giant building is owned by Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the top floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink of it as the providence of the universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, what\u2019s that on the wall, a button?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the magic tool that calls for an extremely small scale war once ditching after pressing, the bell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan dragged the four elves who looked like RPG noobs trying to double click everything they could see and opened the door to his house at the top floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, don\u2019t do anything and listen to me. I\u2019ll explain you the lifestyle of Earth from alpha to omega.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty is our alpha and omega!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up and listen to\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to explain to the four fanatics, he tilted his head. He could feel a presence in his bedroom.</p><br/><p>He would think \u2018that can happen\u2019 if it was the intrusion of someone with malice towards himself, but this presence was one that he was really used to.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta?\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she come back first after getting news of Lita? That was possible \u2013 Yu IlHan opened the door to the bedroom while thinking that.</p><br/><p>On the king sized bed prepared by Yu IlHan, without holding back any money, as he thought that sleep was the most valuable thing on Earth, a beauty with \u2018two pairs\u2019 of wings, was sleeping on the bed while snoring.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan unintentionally raised the reputation of his country.</p><br/><p>Erta regained her face as a higher existence for the first time in a while.</p><br/><p>Thank you for loving Everyone Else is a Returnee until now. From next chapter, Act 2, \u2018I\u2019m Also a Returnee\u2019 will\u2026\u2026 (This is also a lie)</p><br/><p>Sorry? You expected IlHan to go to the Wall of Chaos in order to save Liera?

Make it longer again! Longer! You were so sexy just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being sexy so I\u2019ll keep it short.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooo! Idiot! Idiot~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan realized that his hair now had the properties of fire. Well, fire was immaterial and could be manipulated to alter its size at will, so it wouldn\u2019t be strange even if his hair had such properties. In other words, a part of Yu IlHan\u2019s body had transcended the realm of matter.</p><br/><p>He had reached the midpoint between lower existences and higher existences. He instinctively realized that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it seems like I can aim for higher existences in this field.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratz on getting many ways to become a higher existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026 hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fire and dragon, rather than pursuing just one of them, it would be better in the long term to fuse the two together to pave his way to the realm of higher existences.</p><br/><p>Although he was surprised at the unexpected gain, he quickly reorganized his thoughts in his heads and returned his hair as the same as before. Now, it was the time to make the other armor part \u2013 the outer armor \u2013 that contained the power of dragons.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan took off all the clothes he was wearing and put the Soul of Fire on his body. It was custom made for him and had the pure properties of fire so even when he wore it, it gave him a comfortable sensation as if he wasn\u2019t wearing anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the outer armor is a problem with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m happy!]</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame repeated the same words like a child that just started to learn a language. Yu IlHan laughed and lightly tapped on the armor before picking up his hammer again. A flame blossomed on the tip of it very naturally. Yu IlHan and the Eternal Flame has already deeply synchronized, and it was a foolish thing to attempt to differentiate between the two anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi, it\u2019s your turn now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought I was being melted along with the spear last time\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to melt the spear as well. It\u2019s time to throw away the name of Eight-tailed dragon spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Is that for real?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see what Eternal Flame was capable of just now? You just need to do that yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought you\u2019d use Echjar.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to switch you with him once I become able to control him at will. You just need to take care of it until then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan still didn\u2019t have the power to manipulate the violent 7th class dragon to his will. Orochi made a bitter laugh when he heard Yu IlHan\u2019s honest words.</p><br/><p>[Then I can only do my best. Although, I\u2019m fine with that and will not complain.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we start?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Understood.]</p><br/><p>Eight-tailed dragon spear, half of the Infernal dragon body that became an armory to numerous weapons, Chaos Will\u2019s gauntlet, Echjar\u2019s bones, and his DRAGON HEART as well \u2013 treasures that would shock worlds just by themselves gathered in one spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan slowly closed his eyes and simultaneously activated Mana crafting, Soul enchant, and Blacksmithing to enter the realm of creation. Since he had already done it once, he was more proficient with it now.</p><br/><p>[Kraaaaaah! You dare to do that to my body, and my heart!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just shut up, Echjar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was impossible to control him, shutting him up was no problem. Yu IlHan utilized all his powers as a Deathgod to bury Echjar deep inside his consciousness and continued working.</p><br/><p>Echjar\u2019s ginormous bones glowed in red and started decreasing in size. Orochi\u2019s thought-soul left the Eight-tailed dragon spear and moved to the remaining half of Infernal dragon body, while Yu IlHan melted all the other materials with fire while simultaneously activating Dragonic blood.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to forge a body that can bring out the power of dragons to the best. It\u2019s an easy thing, and it should be one.\u2019</p><br/><p>[Master, focus!]</p><br/><p>Everything melted down, and Echjar\u2019s DRAGON HEART reacted. The mana crafting process commenced successfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I shall try.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his hammer before striking down. The outer appearance of the armor appeared for a brief moment before being buried into chaos again. However, Yu IlHan did not get disappointed. This meant that Chaos Will\u2019s gauntlet had efficiently been melted in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not plan to entrap or suppress the power of dragons. Transform and roar as you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s what I wished for.]</p><br/><p>Orochi and Yu IlHan\u2019s senses melted and mixed into one. Although he was one with the Soul of Fire right now, his training in manipulating thought-souls were not for nothing and he could adapt to it without much problems. The soul enchanting process was smooth as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u2026 Very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was resonance. The power of dragons that always reacted when Yu IlHan entered the Cradle of Miracles had awakened again from the stimulation of the materials here. A violent wave rippled through Yu IlHan\u2019s body. If he couldn\u2019t endure even this, he may as well give up the dream of becoming a higher existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start working then!\u201d</p><br/><p>He struck down with the hammer. The Eight-tailed dragon spear snapped perfectly, before being melted by translucent flames and being absorbed by the remaining half of Infernal dragon body. Now, it was time to utilize the power of Blacksmithing to cast it into a shape.</p><br/><p>[Fuu\u2026\u2026. Haaah.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026. Haaah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan and Orochi\u2019s breathing synchronized. The more he hammered on, the louder Echjar\u2019s bones screamed in pain before being compressed. The size of DRAGON HEART also decreased in size as time went on and enhanced the materials with its magic power.</p><br/><p>With such complex processes happening simultaneously, even Erta and Heli\u00e8na who were very well versed in magic could only watch the breathtaking scene without being able to comprehend much.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give up. I can\u2019t understand a thing\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Watch even if you cannot comprehend anything, lady. The figure of darling stepping onto a new realm, the records that are not recorded.]</p><br/><p>The only non-draconic material here, Chaos Will, was the last one to cry out within it. That had to be used in enhancing the characteristics of dragons, and in unchaining the restrictions in strength. Yu IlHan transformed that power and lead it. He used the mana from DRAGON HEART to form the power into that of a dragon\u2019s to make it one with the armor.</p><br/><p>[It is starting, master.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. \u2026\u2026It\u2019s starting.\u201d</p><br/><p>He struck down with the hammer.</p><br/><p>He struck down with the hammer.</p><br/><p>He struck down with the hammer.</p><br/><p>The DRAGON HEART completely melted down. The momentary surge of horrifying concentration of mana was all focused on Yu IlHan, and he synchronized with that mana using the power of Dragonic blood and poured it into his hammer.</p><br/><p>Despite the mana of dragons that rippled so hard enough to put his heart in pain, his movements did not change at all. The armor tried to take form but then dissipated again, tried to agglomerate before dispersing again. Echjar\u2019s bones completely enveloped the armor and was melted together with the rest of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I saw that before. It looks like ink being diffused in water~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><br/><p>He struck down with the hammer. Just once, a sonorous sound of hitting metal could be heard. The dispersing energy and mana that seemed like it would fill the entire barrier was instantly compressed and formed itself into an item in the shape of an armor.</p><br/><p>An armor that embodied the reddish-black, sturdy scales of a dragon. It was an armor that looked like a sized up version of Infernal dragon body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan heaved a short sigh and dropped his hammer. Even though the hammer was made from top-grade materials, it could not endure two consecutive process of creation and ended up as a half molten mess. He was only glad that it held out until the end of the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It is indeed.]</p><br/><p>Green text appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>[Body of the Human Dragon was complete.]</p><br/><p>[Body of the Human Dragon]</p><br/><p>[Rank \u2013 God]</p><br/><p>[Defense \u2013 25,500]</p><br/><p>[Durabiltiy \u2013 50,000,000/50,000,000 (regenerates as long there is a single fragment left.)]</p><br/><p>[User restrictions \u2013 Yu IlHan]</p><br/><p>[Options \u2013</p><br/><p>1. Amplifies the power of dragons and increases recovery rate by 300%.</p><br/><p>2. Raises the league of all skills related to dragons.</p><br/><p>3. Freely transforms the figure of the user by consuming mana, and may transcend the realm of matter.</p><br/><p>4. Can freely summon all weapons etched onto the records of the user. Half of the defense is added to the weapon\u2019s attack power.]</p><br/><p>[An armor that allows for the coexistence of one\u2019s human and dragon nature, created by a human that had a deep understanding of dragons.]</p><br/><p>[I can finally understand what Mystic meant.]</p><br/><p>Orochi, trapped in the Body of the Human Dragon, complained.</p><br/><p>[I feel very stifled, master. Please do something about it.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Uhihi! Good for you! You ignored me and now you are in the same situation since you were so arrogant!]</p><br/><p>[It frustrates me so much that I\u2019m in the same state as that woman\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>A dual core only had meaning when they worked together. The Heart of Fire that is controlled by Eternal Flame, and the DRAGON HEART operated by Orochi had to gather around the hardware known as Yu IlHan to be truly considered complete.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi, you know what to do, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ugh, I do.]</p><br/><p>When Yu IlHan flicked his finger, the Body of the Human Dragon floating in the air transformed itself into a black fog. Chaos Will\u2019s properties had been implemented on a new level after borrowing the powers of dragons!</p><br/><p>The fog swirled across the air and enveloped Yu IlHan that was wearing the Soul of Fire. It materialized again and naturally settled on top of the Soul of Fire, when Orochi, Eternal Flame, and Yu IlHan became one.</p><br/><p>As if having waited for that moment, a few lines of text quietly appeared on Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>[The Eternal-ranked artifact, Flamesoul Dragon body, was complete.]</p><br/><p>[There are artifacts that are perfect by themselves, but may transcend perfection by merging with other items. \u2018Soul of Fire\u2019 and \u2018Body of the Human Dragon\u2019 belong to such a case. Artifacts that cannot be complete with the two artifacts and the user had formed a perfect harmony to be reborn into an Eternal-ranked artifact.]</p><br/><p>[An additional effect is added to the Flamesoul Dragon body.]</p><br/><p>[The equipper of the armor become the master of all flames and dragons. It can amplify the power of fire and dragons, bestow power, and may take away the power as well. However, the league of the user is still low and thus, the ability cannot be activated to its full extent.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuuuuu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who had gone through a simple awakening process through the imperfect fusion with the artifact, heaved a deep breath. Inside it was all the power of fire and dragons. Some call it \u2018Breath\u2019.</p><br/><p>There was someone who was looking at him with a dumbfounded gaze, and it was none other than Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad ended up becoming a dragon!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when are you becoming one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, amazing! Dad is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan softly embraced Yumir as he rejoiced with glittering eyes, before he shook his hands at the others that had their gazes fixed on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Show\u2019s over. Go do your things now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I look at how you work; I feel so useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die uselessly later then please continue doing those useless things.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was still a lot of time until the barrier was dispelled. He had the urge to just dive inside the Cradle of Miracles and never come out again, but he couldn\u2019t do that since he wasn\u2019t the only one that needed it right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are also other things that I need to do before I leap into the realm of higher existences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan called out his spear and poised himself. He summoned a reddish-black spear made from the energy of fire and dragons. It was made with the Eight-tailed dragon spear as the base, but was also the strongest and sharpest spear he could remember and make, and as such, was a completely different spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone wants to spar with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone will get instantly crushed if they fight IlHan right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I need to train in the Great Cosmos-severing Spear\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiiiik.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone shrunk back in fear when they heard the words \u2018Great Cosmos-severing Spear\u2019. Wasn\u2019t that the skill that raised his martial might to a whole new level? Only Heli\u00e8na reacted, but unfortunately, she was a magic combatant and was not proficient in close combat, and therefore, was unsuited to be a sparring partner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan nonchalantly muttered and let go of the spear before taking out the remaining body of Echjar. Although the fundamental parts were all robbed off, the grandeur of the remains was still very great.</p><br/><p>He uttered amazing nonsense in front of the remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only revive Echjar and fight him.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You dare when you made me into this!]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the league would be significantly lower, the abilities of the physical body won\u2019t be that different so rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>[YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll free you if you win against me. So just listen to me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[T, this rude and poor lower existence dared to look down upon this Echjarrrrrrrrrrrr!]</p><br/><p>Echjar who was provoked to no end by Yu IlHan let out a roar. Yu IlHan nodded in satisfaction after feeling that.</p><br/><p>Now that his equipment was complete, there was no way he could lose against that simpleton Echjar. Moreover, he could also snap his morale by physically winning against him and put him under his rule, so what was two birds with one stone if this wasn\u2019t! The reason Orochi had to go inside the Body of the Human Dragon was all to fight Echjar and bring him to his knees!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. I\u2019ll revive you into a cute lil\u2019 thing, so wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>[C, cute!? L, \u2018lil\u2019!? YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan picked up some random dragon bones to make a new hammer and approached Echjar\u2019s body. The training session that only Yu IlHan took joy in, had begun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, I do know that someone had given me the record. It was an enormous portion of power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know who that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No. However, I do know that \u2018he\u2019 resents you a lot. That is probably also why he interfered with my birth and gave me the power.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m the proof. Now that I\u2019ve escaped my body, I do not resent you any more.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes me tearfully happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Would \u2018mountains over mountains\u2019 fit any better for this situation? He thought that he had finally defeated a higher existence, but it turned out she was just someone else\u2019s underling. This was a cliche plot that even novels didn\u2019t use nowadays.</p><br/><p>But if there was something that was positive, it was that now the situation was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably the dungeon\u2019s master, with the way he hates me, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>An overwhelming pool of mana hat could make such a wide dungeon, his concealing ability that allowed him to hide from even Yu IlHan, who was as good in finding others as he was in concealing himself, and most of all, the voice that told him to never return the moment he left the dungeon all pointed towards this \u2018strong being\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he came out of the dungeon too\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>[A dungeon\u2019s lord does not need to protect the dungeon forever, so it\u2019s not improbable. In an case, it is fortunate that we left without confronting him before. If Mystic, born from his record, is already this strong, he must be a stronger existence. Perhaps, he\u2019s\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.No, it\u2019s nothing.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did not dig any further. He could predict what she was about to say, and reality wouldn\u2019t change even if she said it or not.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to become stronger, faster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan Muttered to himself and gripped his fists. The enemy was much stronger than he had thought, and was much more proactive in confronting him. He couldn\u2019t rest content just because he defeated Mystic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic, don\u2019t you know anything else about Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>[None. What I know is that there is a super strong being in this world, and that that being is disgusted with you.]</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, you aren\u2019t helpful at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I answered so give me a body already!]</p><br/><p>Mystic urged Yu IlHan. She didn\u2019t seem to realize how big of a problem she had just given to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>However, right now, that was better. Nothing would get better if they stayed dejected. Yu IlHan sighed and replied to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body is already complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Where!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke Yu IlHan while pointing down and the ground he was stepping on. For a moment, she went silent because of his firm tone, which then she shouted as if about to cry.</p><br/><p>[You want me to get buried, right? Like my dead body! In . The. Ground!]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if I wanted to do that, I wouldn\u2019t have made you submit under my rule. What I pointed at was not the ground, but this flying fortress.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Flying fortress\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this giant castle that crushed your body into paste.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice regained vitality from sometime onwards. No matter how strong the enemy in front of him was, it was also a clear fact that he was advancing step by step at every moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you manage this flying fortress inside it. You definitely won\u2019t feel bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wha\u2026..t!?]</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to persuade her to have this \u2018body\u2019 that was billions of light years away from what she had expected, but Mystic, in the end, accepted that she was going to be enchanted into the flying fortress.</p><br/><p>It was a giant building, far from being capable of \u2018free movement\u2019, moreover, although it was a separate being, her original body was literally crushed by this \u2018new body\u2019 of hers, and if she said she didn\u2019t feel bad, it would be a lie, but the overwhelming energy and mobility of the fortress did have a certain charm to it.</p><br/><p>[Hmph, I guess it\u2019s better than being stuck inside a weapon.] (Mystic)</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re funny for a newbie thought-soul. I\u2019m much more free than the likes of you.] (Orochi)</p><br/><p>[What good is being free? You\u2019re weak.] (Mystic)</p><br/><p>[Eek, eeeeeek!] (Orochi)</p><br/><p>Despite acquiring different bodies to each other, the two thought-souls continued to fight. Of course, the were both under Yu IlHan\u2019s Rule, so nothing much would happen even if they fought.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan wanted the two of them to be close if possible, but as of right now, when Orochi was weaker than Mystic, he thought that that maybe impossible.</p><br/><p>[Ooooh, so this castle is an artifact! There are a lot of things I can do!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll scold you if you suddenly lower the altitude or accelerate.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hmmmmmm, so the beams from these mirrors pierced my body after all. Oh, ooooooh? How do I stop this!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I should have waited for a much calmer thought-soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way Mystic would have easily adapted to the controls of the flying fortress when she was unable to take a single step forward when she was born.</p><br/><p>She had to go through numerous days of trial and error in order to get used to the management of the flying fortress, and Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t rest even for a little as one moment of carelessness would make the fortress suddenly descend and crash, or the destruction mirrors would spontaneously activate.</p><br/><p>[Amazing, it\u2019s as if those the monsters on the ground are trash!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Wow, I can shoot a hundred beams at once!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said that too. And hey, if you don\u2019t change directions, you\u2019re gonna crash.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the fruits of the suffering was very satisfying. With a new manager of the fortress, when before, Yu IlHan had to split his consciousness to control it and as such, impede his ability to fight, now, Yu IlHan could fight to his best capabilities on his own and also order Mystic to control the fortress.</p><br/><p>One problem was that not enough monsters were generated for them to try cooperating.</p><br/><p>Even before Mystic had appeared, the appearance of monsters on Earth had deceased, which made him think that Earth was perhaps in a recovery period since it had used up a lot of mana in giving birth to a 5th class.</p><br/><p>[Perhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s making another 5th class.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m only thankful. I was thinking that I was short on resources in any case.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Resources\u2026\u2026? IlHan, wait!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan vaguely replied to Liera\u2019s sharp words. However, Liera had spent ten centuries with him, so she could understand his words without misunderstanding\u2026 much. Yu IlHan didn\u2019t give her any time to retort and took out the \u2018resources\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll now make the strongest equipment in this world with this!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Wh, what are you taking out? Just bury it already!]</p><br/><p>It was none other than Mystic\u2019s remains. Moreover, the place he was going to work at was inside his workshop inside the flying fortress. Really, he had no consideration for others at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already irreversibly damaged anyway. You just get used to your current body. I\u2019ll cleanly erase all traces of your past.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Great excuse, huh!] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[*Sob sob*, now that brute is insulting the dead as well\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>While the flying fortress and the angel was shocked, Yu IlHan boldly continued to work. In any case, no part of the remains was usable other than the bones which had metallic properties, as they were too soft to use. What he did was to throw the remainder of the corpse to the furnace where Eternal Flame was burning to incinerate it to nothing.</p><br/><p>Disposing aesthetically unpleasant stuff, and letting Eternal Flame absorb a body belonging to a very high level being to make it evolve again. Everything was perfect!</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re inhuman!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The biggest characteristic that Mystic\u2019s bones had was its hardness, unharmed even after the maximum output of the destruction mirrors, or the smashing of the flying fortress.</p><br/><p>Of course, the relatively weak muscles and flesh had turned to paste so the remains would remind other people of horror movies, but Yu IlHan thought that it was finally time to make a new equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could hold out with these armors until now, but now, I don\u2019t think they are enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ah, so you\u2019re making armor.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>At first, he thought about making a weapon if he acquired the body of a higher existence. However, after hearing that Mystic was just a being born with the help of the hell dungeon\u2019s master, he felt a sense of crisis.</p><br/><p>Until now, he was confident in both his concealment abilities as well as his defense, but in the future, it won\u2019t necessarily be like that.</p><br/><p>His abilities had developed to support all of his attacks, while his defense wasn\u2019t quite enough. In the worst case scenario, he had to make an armor that could hold out for at least one strike regardless of who it was that attacked him.</p><br/><p>[I was worried that you were going to make something like a drill again.] (Liera)</p><br/><p>[Drill? What\u2019s that, that sounds cool!]</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I did want to make a drill, but the situation is too urgent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan melted down almost all the rare metals he had acquired until now, along with some dragon bones, and alloyed it with Mystic\u2019s bones.</p><br/><p>Crafting a perfect metal without allowing the slightest mistake. Never was he so thankful that he had the blessing of the god of smithing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe metal itself is perfect after all\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[What are you saying when it hasn\u2019t even solidified yet?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, I won\u2019t be able to shape it at all if it solidifies.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You can\u2019t do anything with the Eternal Flame either!?] (Liera)</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame flickered as if to deny that, but no matter how amazing it was, there was a limit. No, if Eternal Flame could melt it, he couldn\u2019t say that it could block any attack at least once.</p><br/><p>[Then just how do you make it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took off the armor he was wearing, and filled it with a special mould, comprised of perverted demon\u2019s flesh and magic stone powder as well as some others. Ignoring Liera that looked like she was about to vomit at any second, he scattered 4th class magic stone powder on top of the armor, and poured the molten metal on top of it.</p><br/><p>[What are you doing!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a cast out of my armor. The demon flesh inside will hold out long enough for the metal to solidify.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think that\u2019s already beyond the realm of metalworking\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it cannot be worked on with a normal method. If anyone calls this metalworking, you need to kick that guy\u2019s ass. And so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised his hand. In his hand was a magic stone emitting brilliant violet light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is not metalworking.\u201d</p><br/><p>[IlHan, you!?]</p><br/><p>[Hiiiiik, what the hell is that! The quantity of mana is absurd!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only wish that 5th class beings would appear a lot on Earth in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic stone he was holding emitted brilliant light and melted. At the same time, the molten metal on the armor also emitted light.</p><br/><p>Metal that comprised a higher existence, and a magic stone that was the core of another \u2013 the two met in front of the blacksmith with the best ability across all worlds, and brought each other to a higher realms.</p><br/><p>This was a secret technique only allowed to the smiths that have received the blessing of the god of smithing, as well as being extremely proficient in mana crafting due to absorbing the essential knowledge of magic engineering \u2013 blacksmithing through mana crafting \u2013 was being carried out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This time, everyone apart from the 1st Battalion Commander participated.</p><br/><p>[Now, even Heli\u00e8na went and died right after Echjar got done in. Look at the state the Destruction Demon Army is in.]</p><br/><p>[Heli\u00e8na, that fool. She was always pursuing something else. The Fifth\u2026 was it? Does that even make sense? No wonder she died.]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t care about a lizard, but Heli\u00e8na\u2019s death means an unfortunate loss of a woman. I never tasted that woman until the very end.]</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t joke with me, Belkatoo. When she was alive, you couldn\u2019t even look her in the eye due to the fear of being controlled.]</p><br/><p>[Do you have to express your desires every time you meet!]</p><br/><p>The 8th Battalion Commander Zenusva sighed while shaking its bird head. Then, he lightly breathed out fire to get their attention.</p><br/><p>[He is dangerous, whether we bring him to us or kill him, if we lose any more of our forces, the very foundation of our faction may be shaken. I\u2019ve gathered you here today in order to tell you that.]</p><br/><p>[Nati\u00e8re and Kelatuke died as well, right?]</p><br/><p>[Heli\u00e8na was the one who killed them.]</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t care who killed them, what\u2019s important is that they died.]</p><br/><p>The eyes of the 4th Battalion Commander Telzaider glistened.</p><br/><p>[Everyone knows that the guys in the Garden of Sunset are skillful at deceit, but they do not have a lot of 7th class beings. It\u2019s good news that one of them died. \u2026\u2026Although the loss of Heli\u00e8na is unfortunate, we didn\u2019t really lose that much more in comparison.]</p><br/><p>[Looks like the guys at the Army of Brilliant Light must also be grinding their teeth right now. Nati\u00e8re, that bitch was pretty too.]</p><br/><p>[Belkatoo, shut up.]</p><br/><p>[Everyone stop.]</p><br/><p>The mouth of the 2nd Battalion Commander, Hillutonne, opened. He was one of the commanders that didn\u2019t participate in the first meeting, but came to the second after being notified of Heli\u00e8na\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>[So you mean you will not take revenge for Heli\u00e8na?]</p><br/><p>[Do not. This is my order as the one presiding over this meeting. Any unnecessary action with regards to this matter will be dangerous.]</p><br/><p>[Zenusva, you are\u2026\u2026 Yes, you would not know. However, I cannot stay still.]</p><br/><p>The firebird Zenusva was strictly classified as gender neutral. However, the \u2018males\u2019 of the Destruction Demon Army all had feelings of some sort or another towards Heli\u00e8na, whether big or small. They could only feel angry after being notified of her death. And Zenusva also understood them.</p><br/><p>However, right now, he had to persuade them.</p><br/><p>[Save it for later, Hillutonne. You need to direct your anger somewhere else right now.]</p><br/><p>[Somewhere else\u2026\u2026? Oh.]</p><br/><p>While replying Hillutonne arrived at the answer himself. The Wall of Chaos that blocked Elo Katra from Heaven\u2019s Army main headquarters \u2013 he could feel the gap in the wall opening again.</p><br/><p>[The Heaven\u2019s Army\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>[Yes. Only they did not lose a 7th class being in this war. Is that not unfair?]</p><br/><p>Zenusva emitted fire from all over its body to emphasize its speech.</p><br/><p>[They also need to pay a reasonable price. The Army of Brilliant Light, as well as the Garden of Sunset will also be thinking about that.]</p><br/><p>[You mean to drag them into the War of the Wall of Chaos?]</p><br/><p>[We\u2019ve made losses in other places, so we need to gain profits here. I\u2019ve already acquired a positive answer from them.]</p><br/><p>[Zenusva, very daring\u2026\u2026. But I like it.]</p><br/><p>[I too, am looking forward to this battle now.]</p><br/><p>Although there were slight worries, most of the Battalion Commanders took a liking to how Zenusva thought. Going beyond the Wall of Chaos was the final objective of the Destruction Demon Army, as well as the very reason for its existence.</p><br/><p>[I can consider this as having reached a concensus?]</p><br/><p>[Of course I agree. You did good this time, Zenusva.]</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t help it\u2026\u2026 If it\u2019s for that reason, very well. I will endure it for now.]</p><br/><p>[Good, I shall report to \u2018him\u2019 and immediately go into preparation.]</p><br/><p>The last obstacle that blocks the Destruction Demon Army from eating away even the Heaven\u2019s Army, the Wall of Chaos. The moment that collapses, all balance across the multiverses would be twisted and broken. They finished the conference while looking forward to the day their wishes were granted.</p><br/><p>Like that, Yu IlHan had escaped the attention of higher existence factions for the moment. The Heaven\u2019s Army had attracted a lot of aggro because they didn\u2019t send a 7th class being, and as such, they would act as a buffer for him.</p><br/><p>Of course, not that they would have been able to do much to Yu IlHan even if they tried.</p><br/><p>After coming back to Earth, the group rested in order to shake off the piled up fatigue. They did absolutely nothing and spent about 4 days in peace and tranquility.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan and Liera did not come outside their room at all, and made people wonder if they were piling up more fatigue instead, but they exited their room in exactly 4 days as if to drown all of their worries and resentments. Na YuNa spoke to Liera while sticking close to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnni, can I stab you just once~? Just once with a hard, sharp bamboo spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead. But instead, I\u2019ll stab you once too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan called for the others that had rested in their own ways. Although the glares directed at Liera did weigh on his mind, he decided not to mind about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone should have gotten their rest, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master. I am only worried for master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had plenty of rest, Your Majesty! I am also worried for Your Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ericia and Mirey\u2019s answer had minute amounts of complaints in them. Looking at Liera pressuring them with scary eyes, it looked like the power of the god of love had activated again. Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this before, but I\u2019m going to look for my father and mother now. If they\u2019re doing well where they are, I do not need to bring them here\u2026\u2026 anyway this is my personal matter, so I don\u2019t need to take you if-\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to go as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yu IlHan\u2019s words finished, the eyes of the others all started glistening. Although he did expect something like this to happen\u2026\u2026 Yu IlHan sighed once and looked at the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cErta, you still aren\u2019t used to your new body, right? Please focus on stabilizing and adapting to your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even so\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because the world I\u2019m going to is a dangerous place, but because I\u2019m worried that something like what happened in Dareu will happen once again. We\u2019ve met after all this time, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, your way with words has increased as well\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Erta gave up first. Then, the ones weaker than her naturally looked away. Yu IlHan naturally didn\u2019t let them go either.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss YuNa. You still haven\u2019t gotten your 4th class yet, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThaaaat\u2019s, uh, some absurd quest appeared because the records I\u2019ve acquired with you until now was so great\u2026\u2026. I did the 5th class hunt bit, but the 4th class bit is still a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you achieve 4th class before I come back, I\u2019ll make you a pretty earring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYES! Oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa was lured by the present and shouted \u2018yes\u2019 immediately, and immediately realized her mistake and shut her own mouth, but the bus had already departed. She shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust make it a ring! A pretty ring!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll make you a ring. Well, then, the rest of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest noticed their fates and despaired.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will train on Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will also\u2026\u2026 become a little stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh, to think I cannot serve His Majesty\u2026\u2026 I will also research into the undead minions.\u201d</p><br/><p>He patted the heads of each of his subordinates. He let out a small laugh after seeing that they shook off their disappointment with that, and then proceeded to look at Liera and Yumir. He didn\u2019t really need to leave these two behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera said she\u2019ll come, and Mir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir seemed to hesitate a lot, but eventually shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to see grandma and grandpa, but\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll focus on getting stronger for now. I\u2019m still not level 299 yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I understand. I\u2019ll leave the Cradle of Miracles behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Cradle of Miracles reacted most sensitively to Yu IlHan and Yumir. Unlike Yu IlHan, who was only a Dragon Rider, a natural-born dragon like Yumir would be able to receive the maximum effects of the Cradle of Miracles.</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan, who are we going to find first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, he\u2019s much weaker than mother. I\u2019ve also rummaged through father\u2019s belongings and acquired enough records of the world he has been to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, he was calm thinking he should be doing well, but after experiencing what happened in Breya and Dareu, he was feeling hurried for some reason.</p><br/><p>Of course, from Yu YongHan\u2019s words, Heishia, the world he had been to, was quite a peaceful world, but Yu IlHan knew better than anyone how rapidly a developing world could change.</p><br/><p>No, he should probably be fine. He must be. \u2013 muttered Yu IlHan to himself as if to calm himself down and ordered Mystic.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of the Flying fortress. Don\u2019t forget to clean up the monsters on Earth regularly.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t worry about it and leave it to me.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I\u2019ll be off then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately activated Warp. The range of the skill was himself and Liera, just two. Since the records about the destination was quite clear as well, it activated safely not so much after, and the two could arrive in Heishia in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cL\u00fcna\u00eb was horribly beaten by the orc army, weren\u2019t they? The next is probably us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t the imperial knight order still here? Let\u2019s not give up hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first words he heard as soon as he came here were such strength-draining words. Yu IlHan turned his head around, and realized that they were standing on a pathway made of stones. The voice could be heard from a fruit vendor on the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnights? I don\u2019t believe in them. They appear in front of those that pay their taxes in full, but they always disappear when monsters appear around these parts. I wonder if they even have any 3rd class among their ranks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Heisha come to an end like this\u2026\u2026? Damn, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that place were two middle-aged men. There were other vendors on the street, and a lot of other people, but the majority were speaking words laden with despair like those two men. The street had anything but liveliness and vitality.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with the atmosphere here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could it be? This place is also at the brink of destruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps Liera had never been to this place before, and when he translated to Liera who had question marks over her face, she blinked her two eyes and grabbed Yu IlHan\u2019s arms quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means your father is in a dangerous situation too! Let\u2019s get him quickly and go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThats why I\u2019m tracking the records of my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you act quick, as always.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera doubted her ears for a moment after hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s natural reply.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard that right. I can\u2019t find the records of my father at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Even with the Record skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with the Record skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as Yu YongHan existed in this world, there was no way he would not be able to find a trace with the Record skill, but he currently was unable to. The Record skill that had helped tremendously since its appearance had annoyed Yu IlHan for the first time.</p><br/><p>Liera tilted her head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your father also in possession of a tremendous concealment ability? If that\u2019s the case, I can understand that you can\u2019t find any records of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, I thought that father did not have concealment, but perhaps I really didn\u2019t notice him because he is a concealment master. Dammit, I did feel that father\u2019s presence was very faint, but to think that I can\u2019t even find the records!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t he be safe if he\u2019s a concealment master\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018what if\u2019. Moreover, I never saw my dad wielding mana. It\u2019s not like there are two \u2018Pancosmic Loner\u2019 titles\u2026\u2026 and so.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liera thought something foolish like \u201cblood can\u2019t be deceived after all\u201d, Yu IlHan suddenly extended Ruin Calling and flew upwards. She followed him in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you going to do? You can\u2019t even find the records of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t find father, then there\u2019s only one method I can take.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if Yu YongHan had died or not, but if he was alive, there was one method he could use to make sure that he was absolutely safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just need to kill all the monsters in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera wondered about what kind of retort she should make, but then thought that this much was indeed not much of a problem for Yu IlHan, and became silent.</p><br/><p>And during the next 17 hours, Yu IlHan killed every single monster in the world of Heishia.</p><br/><p>\u201cH, how can this be! The orc colony was wiped out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe yeti colony in the northern mountain range was also wiped out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god. Just who caused such a miracle?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pseudo-apocalyptic disaster that loomed on Heishia had disappeared just like that. However, Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment did not wear off even once against the monsters, so the identity of the hero that saved the world would remain a secret for all of eternity.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>N/A</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Translator: Chamber</p><br/><p>Proofreader: Koukouseidesu</p><br/>\n</div>"}

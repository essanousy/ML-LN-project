I didn\u2019t know about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel exclaimed in a panic. Her eyes were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow? Wasn\u2019t it because we were lacking in strength? Wasn\u2019t it because God slipped away nimbly? Isn\u2019t it because your final attack missed him that he was able to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Michael\u2019s ability was not perfect. He could not steal God\u2019s power completely from him and ended up leaving a slight trace. He ended up foolishly giving a part of his own power to God, and we, having received a portion of God\u2019s power, became unable to kill God. That included Michael as well.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel was flabbergasted. They failed for such a stupid reason? They finally came back to this point after countless sacrifices, but what was this? They were toyed with like clowns! They did all that in vain! Yu IlHan asked in her stead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael doesn\u2019t know about that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If he did, he wouldn\u2019t have foolishly charged towards God. I\u2019m the only one who realized this until now.]</p><br/><p>Uriel shouted with an expression as if she would vomit blood at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have said something to us! You should have explained it properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Haha, no way. Will you obediently give up your life if I said that you needed to die in order for God to die?]</p><br/><p>Uriel became speechless. She couldn\u2019t do that. She couldn\u2019t give up. She couldn\u2019t give up on herself, or Gabriel\u2026\u2026. Satan nodded as if he knew it all along and continued speaking.</p><br/><p>[That is why I needed to prepare a more perfect stage. I had to aim for an opportunity to kill God as well as everyone who possesses God\u2019s power. I thought such an opportunity will never come, but Gabriel\u2019s son, that is, you, Yu IlHan, came and the opportunity arrived. I was sure that you will accomplish our goals for us.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you tried to kill my father because you knew I wouldn\u2019t kill him myself. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026So you even know that I failed to kill him.]</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Color came back to Uriel\u2019s face after hearing that Gabriel was alive. Kim YeSeul was relatively calm looking though. As though she was sure that he had been in no real danger from the beginning.</p><br/><p>[Yes, he ran. That is also why I blocked your path. He\u2019s not a man who would hide when his own son is in danger.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were going to kill Uriel, and kill my dad as well using me as the bait and be insta-killed by me in a fit of rage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even third-rate movies don\u2019t have that kind of generic plot nowadays. When Yu IlHan mocked him, Satan started becoming enraged. Yu IlHan\u2019s ability to tick others off was top-notch as well!</p><br/><p>[Although the scenario didn\u2019t go as I had anticipated, since you know everything, can\u2019t we do this smoothly? It\u2019s a good news that you erased God\u2019s final objective cleanly, but that guy just became stronger after eating Michael over there \u2026\u2026You seem to believe in yourself very much, but God isn\u2019t such an easy target to deal with.]</p><br/><p>\u201c8 things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan suddenly uttered. When Satan asked back \u201cWhat?\u201d Yu IlHan explained nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have 8 different methods to kill God for sure even if he is stronger in physical terms than I am. You seem to take me lightly, but unlike you, I can easily kill someone even if that guy has God\u2019s power, or a predator\u2019s power or even if they are a monster that manipulates the Akashic Record. So shut up and listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWao\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa exclaimed. Such charisma. There was no way she wouldn\u2019t fall for that. Seeing Yu IlHan uttering words with even more arrogance than Satan himself, he was stunned for a moment when Yu IlHan pushed one hand in front of him.</p><br/><p>Space distorted and Gabriel popped out. Satan shouted with his eyes open wide.</p><br/><p>[You were hiding in Heaven!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cSheesh, I can\u2019t even hide properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he lost the fight with Satan and ran away, he would have been found out if he maintained the world of the Garden of Sunset.</p><br/><p>So, Gabriel had currently let go of his power as an Archangel and the power he possessed as the leader of the Garden of Sunset, and was currently an ordinary human. Of course, with a portion of God\u2019s power, his might wasn\u2019t anything to scoff at.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan glared at his father and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou heard that, dad? It seems like you need to die in order to kill God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, I guess I can\u2019t help it. Do I need to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can foresee everything and still didn\u2019t see that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I could read the future and know everything, I would have beaten God\u2019s ass long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>The father and son were just having a casual banter as if nothing serious was happening. That was what was more shocking. In order to kill God, Gabriel had to die, so why was the person in question making such a peaceful smile, and why was Yu IlHan, the one who had to watch his father die, still making such a calm expression?</p><br/><p>Of course, Gabriel\u2019s smile was fundamentally different from Yu IlHan\u2019s. Gabriel\u2019s smile was one from someone who had resigned himself to fate and gave up thinking about everything, while Yu IlHan\u2019s smile was that of desire that only those who did not let go of anything could have.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, you want to live, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, who would want to die? At least the only one I know is Lucifer right there. But wouldn\u2019t I need to die in order for you to kill God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll give you 70 points. That\u2019s a B grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, you\u2019re so harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan groaned and estimated the distance between God and them. It seems like he still needed a little time to fully absorb Michael\u2019s power, but he sooner or later he would come. So, in fact, there wasn\u2019t much time left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs Satan said, we\u2019re in quite a hurry so let\u2019s get this over with quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan pushed Uriel who was in his arms, forward. Satan and Gabriel instinctively looked towards her. Yu IlHan spoke to Uriel.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you still have God\u2019s power in you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uriel felt strange, but still obediently extended her hand and used her power that was stolen from God. Beautiful red mana flowed out and burned up as flames.</p><br/><p>[What!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, now that I think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Satan and Gabriel became pale after looking at that. Uriel also soon realized why they were making such an odd expression.</p><br/><p>It was partially God\u2019s power, yet it was something fundamentally different.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen carefully you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they were busying themselves by being shocked about the scene in front of them, that hadn\u2019t been possible when they stole God\u2019s power in the past, Yu IlHan spoke as if to boast.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Lord of Dragon\u2019s Nest. I\u2019m the closest person to the Akashic Record as of now, and a person capable of changing whatever comes at me as I wish. What I mean is that, everything that enters my hands will all-\u201d</p><br/><p>When he put his hand towards the flames that Uriel had made, the flames divided into countless little butterflies of fire and scattered.</p><br/><p>The power that was Uriel\u2019s but not under Uriel\u2019s control, easily obeyed Yu IlHan and flew around in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201c-become mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding quietened down. Everyone knew what he was talking about and the implications of such words.</p><br/><p>Gabriel had to admit that his prophecy was wrong, and Satan had to admit that he had misjudged Yu IlHan to a great extent.</p><br/><p>He had long since surpassed both Gabriel and Satan. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t be able to surpass Michael. Unlike Michael who had to leave God\u2019s power alone as it is, Yu IlHan made God\u2019s power his own and even evolved it to a higher level.</p><br/><p>Would he fear God? Would he really be unable to kill God?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou surpassed my prophecy.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You are beyond what I could have possibly imagined.]</p><br/><p>The two that harbored a similar train of thoughts ever since their rebellion against God had failed; the two who made the Garden of Sunset and the Army of Brilliant Light in an attempt to stab at God\u2019s heart once again, uttered similar words and looked at each other before laughing.</p><br/><p>Just like the flow of a river, new water would constantly replace the old. The two painfully realized and admitted that it was their mistake to think that everything would go their way simply because they wished as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, let\u2019s do it your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, do as you wish.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI was waiting for those words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan raised one hand and shook it. It didn\u2019t matter whether if it was in heaven or Elo Katra. Right now, they were within a portion of Yu IlHan\u2019s domain of Earth, the aerial city that resonated with the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress. Without any delay, the Declaration skill activated his abilities as a leader of a faction.</p><br/><p>Of course, there would be no need to say what that was for.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At that time, God, who had regained most of his powers thanks to devouring Michael, laughed out in a joyous mood. Now, there was no need to be bound to anything anymore. There was no need to skimp and save on strength anymore. There was no need to hide himself, or hesitate.</p><br/><p>[Fuu\u2026\u2026Kuhahahahaha! I can finally move freely! It is now the time of judgement! I shall destroy everything and create them anew!]</p><br/><p>However, there was still one more thing he had to do before that. The man who possessed the key to opening the new world, Yu IlHan. That damned son of Gabriel that grew up too rapidly!</p><br/><p>[He is here. Satan too, and\u2026\u2026 Gabriel? That bastard still hasn\u2019t died yet?]</p><br/><p>No, this was for the better. Gabriel\u2019s soul would become a great material for Legna! In order to punish them all at once, God moved forward and called out his loyal subo\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Called out his loyal subor\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Subordinates?\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026?]</p><br/><p>God stopped in place. He tilted his head and tried once again, realized that something was wrong, and the next moment, he thought that there was a need to check up on it himself.</p><br/><p>Then, he realized.</p><br/><p>[Wait\u2026\u2026 how?]</p><br/><p>Gone. He couldn\u2019t feel it. How did he not know until now? Well, he thought that there was no way it could disappear so he never noticed it until now. Yes. There\u2019s no way it could have disappeared. No one could possibly have entered his stomach.</p><br/><p>But why? And how?</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>A message that he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time filled his vision. However, he didn\u2019t remember attacking anyone, so this message meant that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Greed. Oh, should I call you loser? Anyhow, hi! Isn\u2019t it such a good day with wonderful weather to die for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026it was him who got hit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

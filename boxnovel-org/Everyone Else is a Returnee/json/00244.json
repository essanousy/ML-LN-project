The Dragon of Despair!]</p><br/><p>[How can that being already be here? The Destruction Demon Army was annihilated!? Whatever happened that caused it to be able to come here? Just who, and how?]</p><br/><p>[Kugh\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Spiera momentarily tried to look at the Flying fortress where Yu IlHan and his army was residing in, but endured from doing so with her superhuman will. Yu IlHan also noticed what she was doing. At least, he could realize that she had done that for him.</p><br/><p>That was why, he was more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Humans really are unpredictable. They aren\u2019t just evil, nor just insane, nor just single-minded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiera is not a human but an angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I still can\u2019t understand her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiera won\u2019t fall for IlHan, right\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had no confidence that his concealment would work against a 7th class being, but looking at things now, it seemed that his enemy did not see him. His gaze was fixed on Spiera.</p><br/><p>[Only you here are capable of making this scene. Yes, how was it to behead a dragon?]</p><br/><p>[Very satisfying. I think beheading you will be even more sensational.]</p><br/><p>Spiera raised her spear. The 7th class dragon Echjar burst out in laughter at Spiera\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>[Interesting, very interesting! It was worth it for me to come here!]</p><br/><p>[It is only now that you\u2019re at your leisure. Do you not see the dragon blood flowing on this spear?]</p><br/><p>Spiera was provoking an enemy on a higher league than hers without fear. The angels were shocked at her attitude, while contacting Heaven or casting defense magic on her. Of course, the enemy seemed to have confidence as he slowly walked out the gap in the skies.</p><br/><p>[I wanted to leave at least one\u2026\u2026 No, now that this world became a higher world, if I acquire this world, dragons will naturally keep appearing in the future.]</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll acquire this world?]</p><br/><p>[I alone am enough to fight you bitches, but\u2026\u2026. The Army of Brilliant Light will also come here soon. We decided to hand them a treasure of the Destruction Demon Army. Well, if you\u2019re frustrated, why don\u2019t you ally with the Garden of Sunset?]</p><br/><p>Even while knowing that the alliance will not happen, the dragon provoked the angels. An overwhelming mass of mana that covered its enormous body, enough to eclipse the size of all dragons Yu IlHan had hunted now put together, each materialized into large and sharp weapons.</p><br/><p>[Were you so proud to kill a dragon? Well then, how about you show your skills to me as well.]</p><br/><p>[You oversized lizard. I\u2019m joyful that I can break a corner of the Destruction Demon Army today.]</p><br/><p>The materialized mana charged towards Spiera and the nearby angels. The angels all cast defensive magic, but the weapons penetrated it easily, and as their movements were read already, they instantly pierced through the angels and their defenses.</p><br/><p>[Khhak!]</p><br/><p>[My LORD!]</p><br/><p>\u201cE, eeeek.\u201d</p><br/><p>Over ten angels died on the spot. Liera\u2019s hand grabbing Yu IlHan\u2019s shoulder tensed. Although she had left the Heaven\u2019s Army, she could not leave behind her feelings towards the individuals as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that the angels are moving slowly. That guy\u2019s mana is hindering the angels\u2019 movements\u2026\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also analyzing it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s voice that replied to Liera\u2019s words that she said while clenching her teeth, was also full of nervousness. Currently, he was focusing his all on recording everything within his range of senses with the Record skill, but as the enemy was of 7th class, he was feeling a pressure. Falling Down would probably not work either.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. The enemy\u2019s reserve of mana was way too large. An overwhelming amount of mana that Yu IlHan could not bear was hindering him from recognizing, recording, and restricting the enemy! And this was relatively fast as well since he had concealed himself.</p><br/><p>[Haaaaaaap!]</p><br/><p>While all other angels had given up on resistance, only Spiera shouted and swung her spear towards him \u2013 with the Great Cosmos-severing Spear that killed the 6th class Teraka instantly, despite being helped by concealment!</p><br/><p>[Fuu.]</p><br/><p>However, the shield that the enemy made in less than an instant with just a snort simply blocked that strike. Spiera\u2019s full out attack continued for several more times, but the shield blocked everything.</p><br/><p>[Hm.]</p><br/><p>Muttered he in exclamation.</p><br/><p>[You are especially strong for a 6th class. However, that\u2019s it. You cannot reach me. No, oh, is that it? Was this to buy time for your allies to retreat?]</p><br/><p>The moment the dragon\u2019s wings unfolded widely, the moment flames filled the air! \u2013 the wings of the angels that tried to flee while leaving Spiera, could not endure and melted like the wings of Icarus. And then a large-scale ice magic came afterwards! Spiera desperately swung her spear to cut apart his mana, but just the traces of the magic was enough to freeze a part of an angel.</p><br/><p>[Oh, Lord God.]</p><br/><p>[Please give us salvation. If you cannot save me, please bestow salvation upon my colleagues\u2026..!]</p><br/><p>[That damned God, that disgusting God! Call him out here, I SAID CALL HIM OUT!]</p><br/><p>The more the dragon\u2019s wings flapped, the more it snorted, the more angels groaned in pain. Only the sole 6th class, Spiera, was holding out relatively well.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was worried that Erta might be within their ranks, but fortunately, she could not be seen among them. It seemed that she had fled early on.</p><br/><p>Mystic was retreating from the moment the dragon appeared, but judged that that was not enough and reported to Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[Master, I think we\u2019ll be affected soon. I can nullify it, but the concealment would probably wear off in the process.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, flee. We need to flee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Yu IlHan\u2019s reckless attitude, he could not enforce it on the army he had, there were still loads of 3rd class beings here, there\u2019s no way he could let them go against a 7th class!</p><br/><p>Even Yumir, a 4th class, and of the same kin, had a nosebleed while standing on the outer wall of the Flying fortress. Although he seemed to have been inspired a lot from the extreme limits that his race could reach, any more than this would be dangerous even for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMystic, I will now send the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress to a safe region\u2026\u2026 the concealment would wear off immediately, but there should be no problems in defending yourself on the spot, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Concealment will wear off\u2026\u2026? Master, you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2026\u2026. of course, gotta kill that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the ever-confident Yu IlHan could not keep his confidence in this situation. He felt his own voice trembling and let out a laughter. However, he did not plan to retreat here.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as the battle is within this continent, no one will catch me, so I have the confidence to survive. Moreover.\u201d</p><br/><p>I said this last time, but a person\u2019s heart is mysterious indeed.</p><br/><p>He muttered that inside his heart and looked at Spiera who was facing off against a 7th class dragon. Although he never changed his mind to screw her up, and was also building his plans towards that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t send her off so easily like this. If I did that, I\u2019ll die due to the tugging on my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are an idiot. Though, that side about you is cool as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera did not stop him. Instead, she stood by his side quietly. This was her expression of never leaving his side even if she had to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat magic formation can cover for the two of us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan accepted her with a bitter smile. Yumir, Na YuNa, and Yu IlHan\u2019s other subordinates that saw the two wished to go with them, but he firmly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are too lacking. Moreover, I\u2019m going to come back alive so don\u2019t look at me as if I\u2019m going to die there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Your majesty, we met after such a long time\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The most worried was Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan. Let\u2019s just all escape to Earth, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss YuNa, if we don\u2019t proceed, what remains is only regress. Fleeing will become a habit. We\u2019ll have to face that guy anyway once the Earth becomes a higher world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yu IlHan didn\u2019t know this, his words were similar to what Teraka said. And Teraka, had met a vain death after saying those words.</p><br/><p>Of course, Teraka and Yu IlHan had differences, but whether that will work against a 7th class being, he did not know. Looking at the rampaging dragon, he thought that he had acquired enough records, but even the most amazing of records would lose meaning without the ability to realize the potential.</p><br/><p>Despite that, Yu IlHan\u2019s voice was full of confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo first. I\u2019ll finish it off real quick and come back.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuu, that\u2019s really dangerous though. Mr. IlHan, you idiot, iiiiidiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having felt that she could not stop him, Na YuNa muttered in dejection and hopped towards him. Even Liera, who would have normally blocked her, let her be for now, and Na YuNa could be embraced by Yu IlHan. She dug her face into his chest and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to curse you if you die. I\u2019m going to reveal the contents of the \u201cNew Folder\u201d on your pc or the entire D drive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with everything else, but please delete the \u2018English lectures\u2019 folder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIiiiiidiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kahak.]</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was persuading his subordinates, the battlefield was progressing rapidly as well. Over half of the angels that came to Dareu had died, and half of that number safely escaped the battlefield, and Spiera, who was swinging her spear without holding back in order to buy time for the others to flee, was already half-dying.</p><br/><p>[Hmm, you\u2019re not enough.]</p><br/><p>However, at this point, Echjar felt a sense of awkwardness.</p><br/><p>[You should not have been able to kill Teraka so easily with that much power.]</p><br/><p>[Why don\u2019t you test me. You have not brought out my all!]</p><br/><p>[Hah.]</p><br/><p>At the same time the dragon swung with his wings, the wind that generated assaulted Spiera. She severed the attack with several attacks of the Great Cosmos-severing Spear, but the aura that she could not cut apart inflicted a light wound on her body. Right now, even that light wound was very serious for her.</p><br/><p>[Your attack power is strong indeed, but something is definitely lacking. Just what could it be. So that\u2019s it. You lack speed and concealment.]</p><br/><p>Echjar reached the conclusion quickly.</p><br/><p>[There is someone else. There is someone else that I don\u2019t know about, in this place!]</p><br/><p>At the same time he shouted that, a violent surge of mana exploded outwards with him as the center! Yu IlHan immediately activated the magic formation to send everyone other than himself and Liera, but he coulndn\u2019t safely bypass the shock of the mana explosion even with five Aegis shields stacked together.</p><br/><p>\u201cKugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shock that even Infernal dragon body could not absolve inflicted shock on Yu IlHan. However, it was fortunate that Liera wasn\u2019t seriously injured as he had embraced her.</p><br/><p>[I definitely felt something. But I still cannot know where that is.]</p><br/><p>[Dragon, did you get Alzheimer\u2019s after living so long? I said there was no such thing.]</p><br/><p>Spiera laughed at him and took up her spear. Although her blood-covered arms were trembling minutely, the aura at her spear tip was still as bright as ever.</p><br/><p>[You must not be thinking that only the Destruction Demon Army possess 7th class beings. You were too reckless. You\u2019ve blown this war very far out of proportion.]</p><br/><p>[Do you think I fear anyone? I am the King of Dragons. The 13th Battalion Commander of the Destruction Demon Army, Echjar!]</p><br/><p>Echjar\u2019s attention that was headed to a certain someone hiding within the area fixed on Spiera yet again. Liera thought that this was the perfect time to do a surprise attack, but Yu IlHan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat he showed from the beginning until now is all a feint. From the moment he appeared, he knew of my existence, and he has not let go of his wariness towards me. You remember how the 5th class giant was prepared against my surprise attack right? This guy definitely has something as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the option on Yu IlHan\u2019s gauntlet \u2013 calling out a shadow to distract the others \u2013 was not ready to reuse yet. He wondered if it would work even if he could use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u2026 then what are you going to do? We can only run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not quite like that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan watched as Spiera attacked with all her power, and as the dragon only snorted and prepared a large scale magic, while he prepared his own skill as well.</p><br/><p>What would be consumed as 1,300 4th class magic stones and 15 5th class magic stones. This was a tremendous requirement to prepare for a single skill, but he could only use them all as the \u2018target of accompaniment\u2019 of the skill was quite a high tiered being after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is found out that I used this method, I wouldn\u2019t be able to use it again, and though I thought about using this against Spiera, though this is a method I did not plan to use without Erta\u2019s help\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIlHan\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, against an opponent that\u2019s firing large scale magics like nothing, it should be possible. It\u2019s probably trying to discover where I am, but\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That would instead be his downfall. Yu IlHan noticed that the skill was ready and waited for the right timing nervously.</p><br/><p>[Die, beast!]</p><br/><p>[Kroaaaaaaaaar!]</p><br/><p>Not yet, Spiera had just commenced attack on him.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019ll do what with this puny attack? It\u2019s so funny that I don\u2019t know what to do, you angel!]</p><br/><p>His mana puffed up. The mana forms a meticulous structure and into magic.</p><br/><p>The magic activates. The shiveringly cold icy aura that spread from him instantly spread towards the surroundings and put not only Spiera into his attack range, but Yu IlHan and Liera as well\u2026\u2026 and at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan activated the skill.</p><br/><p>The name of the skill was Warp, and the destination was none other than Earth.</p><br/><p>The rarest of skills, Warp, that allowed him to leap worlds with others if he consumed additional magic stones. The \u2018target that the user wants to\u2019 on the skill explanation, did not necessarily mean allies, and it could be anyone that he wanted to accompany him.</p><br/><p>In other words, if he wished to, and had enough magic stones to consume, even Echjar could be drawn into the Warp skill, and that meant\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cKuuuuuugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.What?]</p><br/><p>The four beings that were safely warped to Earth, voiced out with different expressions. Yu IlHan and Liera in pain, Spiera in confusion and panic, and.</p><br/><p>[Kkuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahk!]</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that he attacked a \u2018lower existence\u2019 \u2018first\u2019 in a \u2018lower world\u2019, Echjar screamed as the pain of his qualifications of a higher existence being stripped from him began.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Like what he said, the \u2018warp attack\u2019 was a method that Yu IlHan was going to use on Spiera. Some of you may have realized from the previous chapter!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Note: Do NOT ask ME for answers. I don\u2019t know how that works, I\u2019m the translator not the author. I thought he told the kids \u2018don\u2019t resist\u2019 when he took them to Breya. I have a lot of doubts as well. Just don\u2019t think about the theory. Just sit back and enjoy the read, and marvel at Yu IlHan\u2019s smarts.</p><br/><p>If you ask me why there were only two chapters for the past few days, it\u2019s because I\u2019m having a neural meltdown from the translation and heat. (I also set up a new PC \u2013 a cheap one \u2013 and I\u2019m not used to the keyboard yet, and that took time to set up as well.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

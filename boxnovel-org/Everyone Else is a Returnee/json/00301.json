The majority of the fallen angels had died instantly thanks to the two WMD-level fortresses, and after a few exchanges, he was the only left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean guts. If we really had the guts, we wouldn\u2019t be acting like this. We\u2019re only taking the initiative because I fear for the lives of my beloved, I am afraid that my precious friends will die, and finally because I\u2019m shy and weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Replied Liera. The strongest in the group was naturally Heli\u00e8na, but she lacked physical might so after Liera separated from Yu IlHan, she was acting as the squadron leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found that we weren\u2019t in a position to be picky. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the right. Just\u2026\u2026 think of it as a war. Like how we have always lived until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The high angel who had lost her wings, Liera\u2026\u2026 do you feel good being a human\u2019s dog!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDogs are more apt for describing guys like you\u2026\u2026 and could you please call me his fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera shrugged her shoulders and raised her spear. The deeper the depths of her love reached, the stronger the spear became, and now its attack power had passed 16,000. The fact that her lover had become the ruler of all metal should have also influenced her spear as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me. I\u2019ll finish you in a 1 on 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>[How foolish of you to try fighting me when I retain all my powers as a 6th class while you have fallen.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether I\u2019m foolish or not will be decided after we exchange a few blows, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>[You dare\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Of course, even Liera wouldn\u2019t just charge in recklessly. She brought up her own magic power and strength using the battle dress, the Feather of Temptation, which Yu IlHan had painstakingly made for her as well as her various accessories. Only after she was blessed by Na YuNa and had the confidence to overwhelm the enemy did she charge forward. It might have been different if she was alone, but she had a lot of people to protect and a lot of expectations to meet.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, that\u2019s done and over with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Minutes after the start of the battle, Liera killed Ze\u00e0r and skillfully calmed down the magic power that made the spear vibrate. She collected his corpse as well. Heli\u00e8na, who was watching from the back, exclaimed.</p><br/><p>[My, your fighting figure looks similar to darling\u2019s.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was me who taught him the spear so that\u2019s quite obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But how do you feel to be left behind by darling in an instant? Hm? How is it?]</p><br/><p>\u201cI love it. I feel proud and satisfied to think that I played a pivotal role that made IlHan the him now. I feel like I\u2019m with a part of him even when we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Tch.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na tried to make something to tease Liera but clicked her tongue after seeing Liera with a very happy smile.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have the blessing of the god of love for nothing. Although Heli\u00e8na felt true love towards Yu IlHan, she was a mere child in front of Liera who had raised her love meter over hundreds of years!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is done. Then shall we go to the next world? It\u2019s the Army of Brilliant Light again\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Satan really does act?\u201d</p><br/><p>[If Satan moves, then the leaders of other factions will also move, so that will be the time when all factions will go to war just in order to catch us. And that is precisely what darling is aiming for too.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we all die at that time~!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouted Na YuNa in shock, but Heli\u00e8na shrugged her shoulders.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m saying that even at this rate, everything will be finished on Earth. And that is why darling\u2019s plan of weakening these leaders as much as possible is the correct choice. And you didn\u2019t forget about it right?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s eyes glistened mysteriously.</p><br/><p>[The reason he is making us gather so many records, and the reason he is throwing himself into the most dangerous places is all for his awakening \u2013 darling, as a complete, perfect, higher existence, as a leader of a faction\u2026\u2026 At that time, we do not need to fear the leaders of other factions any longer.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWould everything really change at that time~?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. \u2026\u2026 No, perhaps darling may stand at the highest and most glorious place of all.]</p><br/><p>Considering the God that the Heaven\u2019s Army is in servitude to, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s words were very rude, but not to mention the others, even Liera and Erta who still had slight beliefs in God\u2019s power did not retort to her. In fact, even these two wanted it to be like that.</p><br/><p>[And so, lady. When are you going to make the gate?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na blushed, feeling embarrassed after saying all those lines that praised Yu IlHan and turned her head towards Kang MiRae. However Kang MiRae\u2019s expression was quite, no, very dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, but the gate isn\u2019t opening.\u201d</p><br/><p>[But lady, your ability is to make a gate leading to other worlds.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s inteference by an external element. I can\u2019t even send a message to Mr. IlHan. How, I thought that this ability will not be hindered by anyone recorded on the Akashic Record\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026What?]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na asked back.</p><br/><p>[Even the artifact darling gave us doesn\u2019t work?]</p><br/><p>Not only did Kang MiRae\u2019s ability get hindered, something was interfering Yu IlHan\u2019s artifact when he was the one who reached the highest realm of crafting after the Creator? Heli\u00e8na checked her artifact, and it was indeed, real.</p><br/><p>Liera realized that any communication with Yu IlHan was disconnected and asked Heli\u00e8na in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Did Satan appear or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Even Satan cannot block darling\u2019s artifact. This is an\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>[Unexpected situation.]</p><br/><p>Before Heli\u00e8na could come to a conclusion, a voice that belonged to neither any in the group, nor any other being in the word Fi\u00e8ta, covered the world. It was a voice that was neither high nor low, emotionless, and an even genderless, dry voice.</p><br/><p>[The Fifth faction, Irregulars of the Akashic Record.]</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice appeared in thin air. It was an unpleasant-looking creature with a humanoid, but streamlined body, that emitted a foggy light towards all sides.</p><br/><p>[Eliminate before they acquire the power to go against Heaven.]</p><br/><p>It was just that they had a different characteristic to any other race they knew \u2013 three pairs of wings that looked like curtains swaying in the wind, as well as a twisted ring of light that sparked above their heads.</p><br/><p>[No way\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na shivered slightly after looking at that. Erta and Liera as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that, an angel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for it to be an angel\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019 raised its part that resembled a human arm and aimed at the Flying fortress. Everyone felt a great sense of crisis, and Mystic shouted.</p><br/><p>[Everyone inside the fortress!]</p><br/><p>As soon as the others complied with her instructions, a barrier completely covered the Flying fortress in an instant, and at the same time, Kelatuke\u2019s metallic armor was spread above it! Just as the metallic armor completely covered the fortress and started rotating, \u2018it\u2019 shot out a ray of light. The ray of light clashed against the metallic armor and caused a massive boom.</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaaaaak, he\u2019s damn strong! Insanely strong! What the heck is this, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mana!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you! Lady Letyna, we need every bit of your strength, even from when you were drinking your mother\u2019s milk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow the heck does a goddess remember her baby days!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa agitated the holy region and supported Mystic. The power of the goddess was that of recovery and protection! The holy power that filled the entire holy region was absorbed by the barrier to fill the gaps and enhance the quality. Even after all that, it wasn\u2019t easy to block that ray of light.</p><br/><p>This was the strongest being that they had ever met. What was even more annoying was that they didn\u2019t even know the identity of this thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what the heck is that monster. If IlHan was here, he would have instantly recognized what that thing is with his Record skill\u2026\u2026 Eek.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, Liera realized that she once again relied on Yu IlHan and slapped her lips. Even though IlHan was indeed very great, but she, who was once a peak of one world, was looking for help like a weakling! She bit her lips and raised her spear again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If we don\u2019t know, then we\u2019ll only find out, and then defeat\u2026\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s do this together, ex-angel. I wouldn\u2019t dare let you get killed because darling will hate me so much afterwards.]</p><br/><p>[Looks like I should help as well.]</p><br/><p>Liera, Heli\u00e8na, and Orochi stepped through the barrier. Even against a monster that shot out rays of light that was equal to Yu IlHan\u2019s barrier, their eyes were full of will to battle. Mystic immediately poured out numerous mirrors and protected them.</p><br/><p>[Although it should be mana, it feels slightly different so be careful! I will try to analyze and reflect it\u2026\u2026 but don\u2019t trust in the Destruction Mirrors so much!]</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The positions were perfect. Behind them were Kim YeSeul, Kang MiRae and Erta preparing magic. Their objective was to discover its weaknesses and restrain its actions rather than dealing damage. The angel-like being with a twisted halo and wings also seemed to notice the aura they gave off.</p><br/><p>[Raising the expected capabilities of the irregulars. Loading additional records from the Record.]</p><br/><p>It was still blabbing on some nonsense. However, this was for sure. Those thugs that appeared out of nowhere, blabbing on about irregulars or what not in novels or movies were highly likely to be the mastermind that was scheming everything!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means that we\u2019re nearing the last boss! Moreover, it is very likely that they are not related to the four Higher existence factions or are related to the foreshadows they gave off all this time, and belong to a completely different organization or individual!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiera-unni is like Mr. IlHan now~!\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026 Raising the danger level of the enemy.]</p><br/><p>Even the enemy was shocked at Liera\u2019s deduction! However, the situation didn\u2019t look that bright either. It was still attacking the Flying fortress even while aiming for Heli\u00e8na, Liera, and Orochi perfectly.</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>A ray of light shot out. But thanks to the fact that it said it will attack like a robot from a movie from the 90s, the group could react quite quickly.</p><br/><p>[Eliminate.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, that\u2019s the second one!\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s really annoying!]</p><br/><p>If their reflexes weren\u2019t on par with that of a higher existence\u2019s they would have instantly died without getting a chance to dodge. After settling on a target, it didn\u2019t seem to be satisfied with just one attack and started to attack continuously. It was as if they were facing against Thousand Eyes. The couldn\u2019t find a chance to retaliate.</p><br/><p>[I\u2019ll make a path.]</p><br/><p>Mystic couldn\u2019t endure it and sent out the majority of the mirrors at once to attack even more fiercely, but it was prepared for that as well. The halo increased slightly and instantly created a circle around 3 meters in diameter, before rotating around it rapidly to create a shield to block. It was as if it imitated the metallic armor barrier of the Flying fortress!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s movement is as if\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Liera could tell that to the others.</p><br/><p>[Destroy.]</p><br/><p>[Kyaaaaaaaak!]</p><br/><p>Something finally happened. The curtain wings all expanded outwards at once to shoot out rays of light to instantly destroy a few of the Destruction mirrors! The number of the destroyed mirrors was exactly 4. Mystic shouted in a sobbing voice.</p><br/><p>[Noo, Thousand Eyes really became Thousand(1,000) Eyes!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not the time for jokes! I think he\u2019s learning what skills to use off our attack patterns! Even his actions are like the last boss\u2019s underling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heli\u00e8na\u2019s eyes shined after hearing Liera\u2019s words. She also didn\u2019t have much physical might so she was busy dodging all those beams, but if it became more advantageous for the enemy as time passed, then they couldn\u2019t keep this up forever.</p><br/><p>[Oh my, save up your techniques for now. It looks like this is my turn. Liera, can you make way? Let\u2019s get this over with.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmph, fine. Follow me, Heli\u00e8na.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ex-high angel and ex-Battalion Commander formed a tag team. After Heli\u00e8na reached Liera through the many rays of light, Liera raised her spear before taking a deep breath and charged at once.</p><br/><p>[Priority target of elimination.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSays who! The one to be eliminated will be you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[A little closer\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s it!]</p><br/><p>The spear that vibrated in Liera\u2019s hand thanks to her magic power, twisted the ray of light! The shockwaves she used had refracted the light! And Heli\u00e8na instantly approached it!</p><br/><p>[Darling pleaded me you know\u2026\u2026. And I\u2019m someone who can\u2019t refuse his request.]</p><br/><p>This was the moment she concentrated the hardest even since she was reborn under Yu IlHan\u2019s hands. Heli\u00e8na focused all of charm at her fingertips and touched the enemy as it was slightly defenseless after attacking Liera once. The infallible charm against any man, woman or life form, started flowing into him.</p><br/><p>[So can you obediently die?]</p><br/><p>[Changing priority target.]</p><br/><p>However, the reply was very emotionless.</p><br/><p>[Eliminating target with the most hindrance to movement.]</p><br/><p>[Kyaak!?]</p><br/><p>The beam that it shot out pierced through Heli\u00e8na\u2019s abdomen before Liera could do anything.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>A new enemy appeared! \u2026\u2026 But since Liera explained everything, there\u2019s no need for me to explain right!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yu IlHan asked Erta with worried eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay? \u2026\u2026I can cook if it\u2019s porridge, shall I?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m extremely normal! On heaven\u2019s orders! I\u2019m giving you! A quest to help with the creation of dungeons!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sofly sighed. Then he asked while sharply raising his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis quest, it\u2019s not for me but for you guys, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026I, it\u2019s for Earth too, so it\u2019s for you as well?]</p><br/><p>\u201cActing cute now won\u2019t deceive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he hear the full story from her yesterday already? That the traps, in other words, dungeons, that God scattered before was unsuccessful in luring monsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I do what even God can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re thinking that the reason why the dungeons aren\u2019t successfully functional is because the majority of the monsters were swept by God\u2019s power when Lord God stopped the time on Earth. So, the monsters, which have gained immunity to God\u2019s power, won\u2019t approach the dungeons where God\u2019s power is dwelling strongly.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are keep going to saying that it\u2019s because the time stopped, aren\u2019t you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes!]</p><br/><p>She was so shameless that he was about to fall for her!</p><br/><p>[In contrast, you have polished all sorts of techniques in the 1000 years of stopped time despite being an Earthling. In conclusion, your blacksmithing skills have reached a level of marvel that even us, as higher existences, have a hard time believing. Your only fault is that you cannot use mana, but the mana crafting skill will solve that. \u2026\u2026The only existence on Earth who can create dungeons in our place is you.]</p><br/><p>At the praise baptism that poured all over him to the point that he became itchy, Yu IlHan narrowed his eyes more. His instincts as a loner which reacted extremely sensitively to intentions that were trying to use him, was warning him.</p><br/><p>That this woman will dump him with a huge piece of work!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just directly dumping me work, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests. We do our mission, and you receive a quest befitting of your ability and even earn a suitable reward!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can talk well. Even though you\u2019re a scammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, did the fact that Yu IlHan wanted to do it because of all that make Yu IlHan a pervert?</p><br/><p>Was it a perverted mind which can be coated with the words \u2018challenging mind\u2019, and \u2018confidence\u2019?</p><br/><p>Wait, doesn\u2019t this make him a pervert anyway?</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan asked her lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if I don\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Heaven will create another set of dungeons. Of course, as God\u2019s power will dwell in it, it has a higher chance of failing, and as a result, humanity will have to survive in a slightly more wild evironment.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I make it, will the monsters really fall for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>[At least, with a much higher chance than the one made by heaven, yes. They will.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026This is the most important question, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at his body, which didn\u2019t look anything special, and the workshop, which only had basic equipment.</p><br/><p>And turned back to see the angel who was unprecedentedly glowing her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can make dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course. If you have the blueprint and the necessary materials. And those, we have.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s begin right away.]</p><br/><p>Erta poured out huge piles of metal from nowhere inside the workshop.</p><br/><p>She took out chunks of refined metal, \u2018Harkanium\u2019, which emitted a wondrous black light; chunks of another metal, \u2018Fecinom\u2019, from which one could feel a red and rough energy; following that, a bottle containing the liquid, \u2018El Hazra\u2019, which emitted faint blue light; and finally, equipments such as a hammer, chisel, anvil and the like, which looked plain but not unpleasant.</p><br/><p>[These three metals are materials in higher system worlds. If the current Earth levels up 2 more times, then these will also appear on Earth in extremely small amounts.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this liquid is metal as well? Then I can just think that it\u2019s similar to mercury, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026.It seems you didn\u2019t listen to me at all.]</p><br/><p>Continuing on, she poured out countless numbers of magic stones that would become the ingredients for mana crafting, but they were incomparably bigger and emitted incomparably more brilliant light than the Direwolf\u2019s one.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t these perhaps the magic stones from the \u2018higher existences\u2019 that Erta likes so much? Yu IlHan asked with a careful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe will of the craftsman is important though in mana crafting, is it not? I don\u2019t have any experience in making dungeons, and I don\u2019t even know how to make them. Are you fine with me handling all these precious-looking magic stones?\u201d</p><br/><p>[In the applying process, angels will help you. Did you perhaps think that you will do everything from start to finish?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Loners always worked alone from start to finish as they hated communicating with other people and hated working together! Yu IlHan was also planning to do everything alone so he was a little bit surprised when Erta implied working together.</p><br/><p>[Other than the used materials, they are all for rent, so you have to give them back. For the reward, we will prepare something else.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the reward, can\u2019t you give me that 4 dimensional pocket you were using?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Inventory is magic.]</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the moment he was the most frustrated after the time he heard that beds were science. (T/N: ACE, a company that makes beds, said that beds weren\u2019t furniture but science in their commercial, and this saying became famous in Korea.)</p><br/><p>However, his switch flipped automatically while he was clearing away the existing anvil (it was extremely light) and fixed the anvil that Erta brought (It was extremely heavy). A master may not dwell on his tools, but Yu IlHan did.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the hammer, or the anvil, and even the tongs, were all in a different dimension to the one he had used until now. He resolved that he would definitely procure tools that wouldn\u2019t lose out to these in the future.</p><br/><p>[The basic processing is already done, so what we\u2019re asking of you should be the form creation and the inlaying. We\u2019re not thoughtless to the point that we\u2019ll make you make a dungeon from start to finish.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the materials here, just how can I make a dungeon in this workshop? You\u2019re not telling me to make pottery but a dungeon, right??\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan spat out the question he had the moment he saw the materials. This was reasonable, as inlaying meant etching the surface and filling it with another material.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, as an intricate and beautiful technique which ran at the peak of metalworking, metal inlaying was just basically a very very difficult and annoying work.</p><br/><p>Creating a dungeon with a technique that\u2019s used in accessories \u2013 just how? Did they make some magic which can make goblins pop out if he drew a goblin with inlaying?</p><br/><p>[A dungeon is a huge space. There\u2019s no way that we\u2019ll directly make them, is there? Specifically, the thing you have to make is a magic tool that would attract the monsters and change the surrounding environment to make a dungeon. This is called the Trap of Destruction.]</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me that from the beginning! Then is that inlaying perhaps\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[It can be called a type of a magic array.]</p><br/><p>Erta held out a paper which was made from unordinary materials. After he had a look at it, he paled in fright. After he heard that it was a magic array, he thought that the form creation wouldn\u2019t be very difficult, but that was his misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>With one cube at the center, countless metal rings were enwrapping it, and not only on the cube itself, there were indecipherable letters everywhere on each and every one of those rings.</p><br/><p>If someone saw the finished magic tool created according to this blueprint, then that person would shout \u2018This artifact looks like it may appear on the last volume of a fantasy novel!\u2019.</p><br/><p>This was definitely an object with a higher difficulty in creation than any of the things he had created before. Rather than blacksmithing, it seemed like his worksmanship would play a bigger role too\u2026\u2026 He sighed before he even started.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan clenched his teeth and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe quest reward\u2026\u2026It should be good, right\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I promise. I will prepare something that you will be surprised about. According to the level of achievement in the quest, you will be given the most suitable reward.]</p><br/><p>Erta, who knew the difficulty of this work, confirmed with her most serious voice.</p><br/><p>Then it was okay. Didn\u2019t he know that the reward of this quest from heaven was unordinary just by looking at the Eternal Flame? In this way, they were trustable.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan recognized that the work he thought to be difficult surpassed his imagination in a direction that he didn\u2019t think about, and accepted it.</p><br/><p>He wore a cloth that could absorb sweat well on his forehead, and he picked up the metal tong which looked plain but its hardness could be well-felt from it. Then, he picked up a chunk of the black colored metal, Harkanium, and pushed it inside the fireplace and muttered as if he resolved himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first joint work of the Eternal Flame and Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>Erta had alook at the steel spear that Yu Ilhan made before so she knew how amazing his techniques were. However, she had never seen him working on the metallurgy process directly with her own eyes.</p><br/><p>However, his figure, focusing on the flame and the metal after his switch was completely flipped, made her a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026The flame is still a bit weak. Does it get stronger if you feed it magic stones?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yes.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026\u2026Good. this is sufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>He should have only worked with the ores that existed on Earth before the Great Cataclysm. Also, even materials like titanium were difficult to be worked on inside a small work shop, so there should have been a clear limit to the number of ores he had actually worked on. As proof, his master piece, the steel spear, was in the end, just \u2018steel\u2019.</p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>However, just how was he showing movements like a master smith who had handled harkanium for about 100 years?</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu\u2026\u2026Hap!\u201d</p><br/><p>When harkanium was sufficiently heated up by the Eternal Flame, whose temperature increased exponentially after absorbing a magic stone, he started welding with a serious face.</p><br/><p>He knew of the metal\u2019s hardness at the melting point, so he hammered down with all his strength from the beginning. The moment the hammer and the harkanium produced a violent clash, he felt it.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can probably do this.\u2019</p><br/><p>His original strength would have been insufficient, but it seemed like this hammer had the ability to increase its user\u2019s strength temporarily. Yu IlHan, who got used to the feeling after striking a few more times, hammered the harkanium with sufficient strength.</p><br/><p>Clang, clang, clang, claaaang.</p><br/><p>Harkanium tried its best to resist the change, but in this small workshop, there was everything prepared to handle that. The flame of eternity, anvil, hammer, and lastly, an exceptinal smith.</p><br/><p>In the end, it slowly, but surely collapsed.</p><br/><p>The metal was changing. Yu IlHan, who perfectly memorized the blueprint after seeing it once, changed the position of the tong, as he heated the metal and struck with the hammer continuously.</p><br/><p>A contradicting movement \u2013 intricate but strong, unrestrained but controlled \u2013 that was impossible for a even for a machine. From some time, harkanium was being played around as Yu IlHan willed.</p><br/><p>Just who would believe when told that this was harkanium? Did the Eternal Flame make this? The hammer?, The anvil?</p><br/><p>No, tools cannot make miracles. It was the human. That human was calling for a miracle that did not happen in the past, and wouldn\u2019t happen again in the future, right now.</p><br/><p>Erta looked at that scene breathlessly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I perhaps make a mistake? Shouldn\u2019t this human have become a blacksmith instead of a lancer? Then\u2026 he might have made something that could challenge against God\u2026 Yes, something that can challenge God.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just why do all the angels become blasphemous after coming into contact with Yu IlHan. Right now, Erta acknowledged that Yu IlHan had the potential to suprass God. And in technique and not fighting power.</p><br/><p>The form creation was finished after not a long period of time. After having finished shaping the the central cube, and the countless metal rings connected with a thin metallic line, Yu IlHan picked up the small chisel, also prepared by Erta. Now it was time to do the inlaying.</p><br/><p>Despite thinking that he was sufficiently resolved, when he was about to go into the process, he sighed subconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck. I don\u2019t know if I fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If you fail, then you can just melt it down and make it again from scratch. Of course, it will take an extremely long period of time.]</p><br/><p>While completely ignoring Erta\u2019s words, he put the knife against the \u2018Trap of Destruction\u2019 which now had its form.</p><br/><p>This was the moment where an overwhelming \u2018record\u2019 which could not be expressed in experience, was engraved in the world.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The tanning, the processing of the leather and bones, processing the metals, metallurgy, and the like is from the author\u2019s research. There may be unavoidable flaws or errors. I will fix what I can, but please overlook some of those that I may not be able to fix.</p><br/><p>Dungeon management won\u2019t happen whether it\u2019s soon or later! No, I clearly told you that I won\u2019t do it righ!? This novel is about Yu IlHan, who became OP in various fields, adapt to the changed world! It\u2019s not dungeon management!</p><br/><p>Erta pulls the date where Yu IlHan can use mana, just by existing! And her quest is a win-win! It definitely helps Yu IlHan!!

Ruby was muttering about how he may have received a mental attack, but since both Yu IlHan and Heli\u00e8na heard her, it was quite meaningless.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an ally, so there\u2019s no need for you to worry. Rather than that, why are you back already?\u201d</p><br/><p>[As many dragons have been born, there were just as many dragon-slaying monsters that were born. I thought Father should know about this soon\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was perhaps natural. Well, right now, Yu IlHan was strongly attributed towards dragons, but before, he had gathered numerous records as a dragon killer. He could still vividly remember killing the one thousand dragons when he first came to Dareu.</p><br/><p>Dareu had evolved using all of his records as the basis, so of course, there would naturally be dragon-slaying monsters born here. If it was to the point that even the dragons felt a sense of crisis, this meant that there were high levelled ones as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you should be able to grow even more if you overcome them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Father, what do we do?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are afraid of them? \u2026\u2026 Well, I guess I can\u2019t help it since you were just born.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan requested Yumir who was waiting obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, look after your weaker siblings. You just need to let them survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, dad. I\u2019ll make everyone stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Said Mir with a smile as he flew into the air. Amidst the gaze of Ruby and the other dragons he exposed his 6th class body filled with grandeur!</p><br/><p>[Kuoooooooooh!]</p><br/><p>With scales that shone like a golden flame, Yumir roared and all the dragons present froze in place. Ruby\u2019s eyes especially, burned with desire.</p><br/><p>[Amazing, brother!]</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother\u2026\u2026?\u201d 1</p><br/><p>Ilhan finally realized that Ruby\u2019s voice was closer to a female\u2019s than a male\u2019s. So she was a girl! It was good that he gave her a girly name!</p><br/><p>[Everyone follow me! There will be many occasions in life where you\u2019d meet beings that slays dragon like it\u2019s nothing so you can\u2019t be freaking out so early on!]</p><br/><p>[So heartening!]</p><br/><p>[Always something new!]</p><br/><p>[Exciting!]</p><br/><p>\u201cMir is sure different since he\u2019s raised some children already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this was nothing new to talk about, Yumir was an amazing child. Taking the loner characteristic away from Yu IlHan and inserting the traits of a leader would obviously make him flawless! He was the type that would never ever become the protagonist if this were a novel.</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was inwardly relieved, Yumir lead everyone and flew directly towards where the enemies were. After the dragons left following Yumir\u2019s lead, Heli\u00e8na\u2019s gaze towards Yu IlHan became slightly profound. It was a gaze that contained a slight trace of anger.</p><br/><p>[Darling\u2026\u2026 who is it again?]</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving aside whether you have the qualifications to ask that question or not, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking. It is only that the large number of dragons that were born while Dareu underwent the 6th Great Cataclysm are treating me like their parent because of my power that rules all dragons.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Phew, it\u2019s good that there are no more competitors.]</p><br/><p>Of course, there would be no way Yumir would lose against any normal beings, but the weaker 4th class dragons may get injured, so Yu IlHan applied slight restrictions to all monsters with dragon-slaying powers. Call this a cheat, but he just wanted to preserve his forces.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I did this much, so even if they die, they won\u2019t be able to complain\u2026\u2026 then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Construction was almost done as well; as well as the valleys, nests, and caves that the millions of dragons will reside on; the cities, forests, farms and riverlands that the elves and wolfkin would live on; and finally the grand castle where Yu IlHan and his friends would reside. Of course, he didn\u2019t forget to prepare them adequately so that they could be used in battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cInterlocking the cores of the Flying fortress and the Guardian fortress and the ancient elven magic formation to make the entire world into one giant fortress\u2026\u2026 hm, the bases are laid out, so I only have to wait for the formation formula to be completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Yup, I like darling because of your love to make large scale things\u2026. so you\u2019re making the entire world into something like the Flying fortress?]</p><br/><p>In fact, this was a little too grand for her to understand fully! At this point, Yu IlHan\u2019s enemies were pitiful, but Heli\u00e8na didn\u2019t bother saying that. Instead she asked.</p><br/><p>[When are you going to start, darling? If it\u2019s alright\u2026\u2026 Can I be the first?]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, but the first will be LIera.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Tch, considerate of your first wife as ever. Do you like that woman so much? No, it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll be hurt so don\u2019t answer it.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan stroked Heli\u00e8na\u2019s hair while she felt slightly disappointed. She seemed surprised at first, but started blushing soon after.</p><br/><p>[You really did change. Although darling was kind even before\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re being considerate of me now. Aren\u2019t you?]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I am aware that I am me, but oddly, I\u2019m slightly changing even as I\u2019m conscious about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, during his lower existence days, existed as an independent identity, but right now, he was the leader of Dargon\u2019s Nest, a group he had to house in his bosom.</p><br/><p>His sights widened, and his standards became higher as well. His feelings towards other individuals decreased slightly, but he could now think more about those that came into his sight. Perhaps this was influenced from the subclass leader he had acquired prior to becoming a higher existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is slightly disturbing. This is a change that I can\u2019t block even with Unshakable Heart. Is this really a natural occurrence? Is this truly what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>[But didn\u2019t darling change like that until now? Piling up records after records, and building yourself anew amidst the influx of records. It\u2019s just a repetition of that process. If you want to deny that, wouldn\u2019t you have to deny yourself the moment after you were born?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan closed his mouth. Although he did forget this from time to time, Heli\u00e8na was a being who had lived for tens of thousands of years. Like now, she sometimes surprised Yu IlHan with her words. He obediently nodded his head in admittance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are right. If I don\u2019t accept my current self, then I would not have the qualifications to go forward either.\u201d</p><br/><p>[And I like the darling that is kind to me more.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Eiii.\u201d</p><br/><p>His feelings towards her ended up increasing due to the sudden attack. Was the Succubus Queen\u2019s assaults still active after all? He couldn\u2019t let his guard down. Yu IlHan smacked Heli\u00e8na on the forehead and turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cGather everyone after they\u2019ve had plenty of rest. I will have a look around the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Fufu, I got it , darling.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan flew into the air. As he was deeply connected with the Flamesoul Dragon Body, flames, and dragons, it was a natural thing for him to fly without the implementation of mana. Though, it was possible to accelerate further by calling out Ruin Calling contained inside the Body of the Human Dragon.</p><br/><p>He extended his mana into his surroundings to record everything at the same time as calling out Ruin Calling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoh.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Flamesoul Dragon body had gone beyond just being an artifact and had unified with his physical body, the weapons inside also naturally transformed. Ruin Calling, which was formed with countless type of metal and the very essence of magic, had become a pair of flaming red bat-like wings. Anyone would see this and call them dragon wings.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t like its hardness and ability had disappeared somewhere. In fact, it had increased in performance by at least twice as if it was an artifact that was strengthened inside the domain of Falling Down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Higher existences are sure interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I express my exclamation towards the Lord\u2019s thought process that treats the realm of higher existences as mere research field.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re becoming like Orochi huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kugh!?]</p><br/><p>Shushing Echjar, Yu IlHan increased his flight speed for real this time and took a look around his surroundings. The mana he wielded was resonating with the world and the ancient elven magic formation, so taking in all the details even while travelling around at that speed wasn\u2019t anything hard.</p><br/><p>Really, after the 6th Great Cataclysm, it felt as if Dareu had materialized Yu IlHan himself into a world. Yu IlHan felt both shock and exclamation at this fact.</p><br/><p>This was perhaps why the other factions couldn\u2019t treat Heaven\u2019s Army lightly even though they didn\u2019t look like much! Perhaps this was why everyone was so hesitant to invade the main worlds of other factions!</p><br/><p>[The aura of fire fills the world. But it\u2019s forming a balance with water. This world is beautiful!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for thinking like that, Eternal Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eternal Flame absorbed or supplemented the flames existing in this world by sending copies of herself into her surroundings, as well as absorbing and emitting mana to play around. In the process of Yu IlHan being reborn into the leader of the Dragon\u2019s Nest, she had also broke through, so her power was now incomparably become higher than before. Even without Yu IlHan lifting a finger, Eternal Flame could block any higher existence alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon-slaying, dragon-slaying\u2026\u2026. Ah, found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could feel traces of a harsh battle between dragons and other monsters from far away. Of course, as Yumir was the one leading them, there weren\u2019t a lot of deaths, but as Yumir was not battling directly and was focusing on supplementing the battle of other dragons, the battle didn\u2019t end so quickly.</p><br/><p>[Everyone get yourself together! You can\u2019t even cook rice with that kind of fire! Do not forget the pride of dragons!]</p><br/><p>[Understood, brother(hyung-nim)!]</p><br/><p>[Bring out the boiling mana under your throat! Feel your heartbeat and emit the whispers of mana you feel right as it is!]</p><br/><p>This was an education method only possible because Yumir was a dragon. Even though he hadn\u2019t learnt anything from a parent dragon, he was teaching so well!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan left that location with a smile. He was worried that he may had to support them, but looking at the figure of Yumir was leisurely leading tens of thousands of dragons, it seems he was worried for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan turned around. Since he hadn\u2019t hidden his presence, all living and breathing beings in this world were wary against him. One emotion stood out from the others. It was that of fear and admiration, and of submission and slight resistance.</p><br/><p>There were also traces of hesitation and at the same time those of bewilderedness. They were being shaken amidst the emotions that even they didn\u2019t know about. The ones that may feel such feelings in this world should be\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragonkin, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[So you felt them. You\u2019re correct. Right now, this world had given birth to a lot of dragonkin and not just dragons.]</p><br/><p>\u201cOrochi was also a dragonkin right\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Orochi technically wasn\u2019t a dragon. His identity was a gigantic snake recorded in Japanese myths. However, he was a dragonkin, and had an overwhelming advantage in fundamental specs than the other species. You may call it OP, but dragons were just such unfair beings.</p><br/><p>Echjar asked him.</p><br/><p>[My lord and my ruler. Are you going to take in all of them as well? The past me only focused on raising the name of dragons, but I do not believe that the name of the Lord\u2019s faction, \u2018Dragon\u2019s Nest\u2019 to be so simple in meaning.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I also think like that too. Moreover, it also tugs my mind that the first world I came to after I became a leader of a faction was Dareu\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is a complete coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dareu was not a world specifically for dragons. It was innately a world where dragonkin were easily born. Wasn\u2019t the reason Yu IlHan first came to Dareu to wipe out dragonkin and not just dragons?</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan\u2019s current power was that to rule dragons and dragons were just a portion of dragonkin.</p><br/><p>If Yu IlHan was a man who was quick to give up, he would have just wiped them out with the excuse that dragons and dragonkin were separate, but if he was such a petty person, he would have retired already from the time he was left on Earth alone for a millennium.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not four-feeted after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You mean forf\u2026\u2026 hm\u2026\u2026.]</p><br/><p>Echjar instinctively tried to retort but stopped. His pride hurt after he was told that he was becoming like Orochi. In fact, it was just that Echjar was becoming similar to Yu IlHan like how Orochi once went through, he didn\u2019t know that himself.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan clapped his hand. The beings that were sneaking glances at him from underground, and from forests were all startled and twisted their bodies, while he uttered his grand ambitions again with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I should expand the realm of my powers at this opportunity. Just the dragons aren\u2019t enough. Let\u2019s put all dragonkin under my rule.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I thought you might say that.]</p><br/><p>There were unidentified enemies on his way as well. More allies were good! Though, it should be better if he could make them all into higher existences too! \u2013 Deluding himself, Yu IlHan expanded his mana into his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, those that think you\u2019re dragons!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of the ruler resounded across the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you ten seconds. Gather up!\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Ruby is using a \u2018female\u2019 form of \u2018brother\u2019 (i.e. Oppa) but in archaic language (orabuni for more info)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

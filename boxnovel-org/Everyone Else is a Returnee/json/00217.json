Not only did Yu IlHan still have stuff to take care of, he couldn\u2019t bear to send the children back to battles again.</p><br/><p>[And so you want me to do everything, huh!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI always believe in you, Mystic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving the cleaning of all the monsters including the perverted demons to Mystic, the Flying fortress that hunts well, what Yu IlHan did first was to make numerous attractions using his vast mansion grounds and garden.</p><br/><p>Liera asked Yu IlHan after seeing a long slide that connected all the way to the hall, and the toy train that passed below it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026\u2026 this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA general theme park.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera\u2019s expression turned strange after hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s reply. However, he was very serious right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese kids have competed for survival as soon as they came to themselves. I can\u2019t even imagine how twisted their emotions are. If we aren\u2019t going to make them battle for their lifetimes, we need to put some other things into them. Something peaceful, and warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, a theme park?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to rest if it\u2019s not now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were light, but the meaning was deep. There was no way Liera could stop him from doing that since she knew how he felt while looking at those children, and in the end, she decided to watch as the rather extreme park attractions that went in and out of the mansion, were being built.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was still another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can\u2019t you just go to a theme park on land?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe monsters already ate them all, so there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s it\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>3 years had passed since humanity was expelled, and the world was rapidly losing its civilization. Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t possibly take care of that as well.</p><br/><p>No, in fact, Yu IlHan helped in destroying civilization with the Flying fortress, and never helped in preserving them. Just freeing Earth again was annoying enough, so there was no way he would be looking after minor details!</p><br/><p>Restoring those things were jobs for the rest of humanity when they return. Although, it was unknown when they would!</p><br/><p>\u201cHero, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy heart is thumping when I see it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was engraved into their instincts? The children jumped around while looking at the attractions being installed all over the Flying fortress area. Even Yumir, who was supposed to be leading them all, had glistening eyes while looking at the interesting rides that he had never seen before!</p><br/><p>That scene made Liera, who was watching feel warm on the inside,\u2026.. but at that moment, she found Yu IlHan who was about to put a 4th class magic stone near a ride.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, stop moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, I was found out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you using 4th class magic stones on a mere attraction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis attraction is also a part of the Flying fortress. It\u2019s obvious for all the things that make up the Flying fortress to be used to attack enemies, whether it\u2019s a gram of air or a speck of dust, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a sec, did you make all these with\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, vibration demon\u2019s bones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me back my feelings and emotions!!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t lying when he said he was building attractions for the children. He was only taking care of two, or three things by just doing one thing! Liera clenched her teeth and spoke to him, in this situation where she wanted to slap him but couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, please explain before I feel like I\u2019ve been hit on the back of the head. I also want to escape this one-pattern reaction trope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it more interesting to find out later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you for one hour whenever you deceive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot one second!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd also.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera put up three fingers on one hand and put it in front of Yu IlHan\u2019s face when he had just turned back in shock. She approached as close as they could kiss if someone pushed them, and spoke with her red eyes containing a galaxy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if you do it three times, I\u2019ll do some\u2026..thick things for over one hour like slugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaaaaaaahk! Mir is listening!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan acknowledged that Liera was at her final form. She, reborn after throwing away shame and hesitation, and also having a strong sense of conviction towards Yu IlHan, became a being that the current Yu IlHan could not win against.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this! What\u2019s this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan made a total of 119 attractions in and around the mansion in merely 22 hours. After he finished that, he looked around at the 9,300 children and asked Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, you don\u2019t manage all these 9,300 kids in one go, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I group them according to attributes and divide them according to class!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan patted his son who worked so well. After that, he grouped them like how he did, and placed them in front of each attraction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I know! I saw something like this looooooooooooooooooooooooong time ago with mommy and daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a mommy?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t install just simple merry-go-rounds, spinning cups, or roller coasters. He even made stages where they could role play (PR: NOT THAT KIND, more of playing house or chef etc), and ones where they could only advance to the next stage if they indirectly learned about culture or the like, in order to hammer in minimum common sense into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI placed them in the middle of each course. They wouldn\u2019t do this if I only put the boring ones in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd your head always spins in stuff like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had made all the attractions and set the kids on each course, the only thing left was to play around freely! The children all went onto rides as soon as Yu IlHan and Yumir gave the permission.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, you go and play too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to say with dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go play, I won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still want to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Yumir who didn\u2019t want to be apart from him even while being really curious about the attractions, Yu IlHan made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Even though he was a dragon, Yumir was still a child. At the time where he had to be with his parents the most, he couldn\u2019t be there with him. He was worried about the emotional deficiency of the children, but in fact, the one he had to worry about the most was none other than his son, Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then stay with dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKyaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFast! High! So high!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attractions that Yu IlHan made while utilizing dragon tongue, ancient elf language, angel, and fallen angel magic language, as well as the best of magic engineering, were all more thrilling than any other rides on Earth, and it did not take a lot of time until the children were absorbed into the Flying fortress theme park. full of dreams and hopes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUwaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, I\u2019m flying faster than when I was kicked by a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was a drawback in the Flying fortress theme park, it was that all the rides were made for children over level 100, so an ordinary person may die of a heart attack if they rode on it.</p><br/><p>Those without a good dynamic vision wouldn\u2019t even know what the children were doing now, but Yu IlHan could even see the cheering kid furthest away from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, there are no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan checked that all 119 attractions were completely flawless in their activity, and nodded his head. Finally, he lightly touched the rails of a roller coaster nearby, when numerous text filled his vision.</p><br/><p>[The Flying fortress analyzes and records the information of the ones here.]</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, this side is perfect too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yu IlHan\u2019s mutters, Liera lightly laughed. She could imagine what other functions the attractions had other than just being attractions and as a weapon. She took Yumir from Yu IlHan\u2019s arms softly and covered his two eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMir, close your eyes for around an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUn, okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I said no! Collecting information is also attached to other basic utilities of the Flying fortress! I didn\u2019t add anything new, and it was already there before.\u201d</p><br/><p>And with Yu IlHan\u2019s Record skill, that had blossomed beautifully. He was only trying to make equipment for the 9,300 children by from the information on abilities, physical body, and records collected from the attractions while they enjoyed them!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are doing a lot of things at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to prevent the annoying stuff from popping up later. Well, then. Let\u2019s wait until I collect all their information\u2026..</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan turned back, and his eyes glistened while looking at Liera and Yumir.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make your equipments first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The start was Yumir. Of course, he had made epic-ranked equipment for him before. And no matter what kind of battle he had went through in such a harsh environment, that equipment was still as sturdy and strong as ever.</p><br/><p>However, the Yu IlHan of that time and the Yu IlHan of now was different! He always advanced forward!</p><br/><p>\u201cMostly in regards to offensive strength, though. That\u2019s why, the materials need to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sheesh.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, her words were right. Yu IlHan was planning to make an armor for Yumir using the remains of Chaos Will, which was mostly hunted by Liera alone!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I need to use it for my armor as well so I\u2019ll use only half of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I can\u2019t even touch it even though I can see it! Dad is amazing for killing something like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed it with Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, when he looked at Liera after saying that to Yumir, Liera was pouting for some reason. She asked with a pouty voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I need to use at least half to make a gear that can help Mir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut IlHan and I killed it, if you invest half of it to Mir, then you can only make yours with the other half.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.You didn\u2019t want something with a couple-look with this guy\u2019s remains, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera did not reply. Although she didn\u2019t look like she was moving, she had nodded very minutely, and he wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he didn\u2019t watch her closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a monumental incident\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to celebrate something like that though\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps girls were all special like this, or perhaps Liera was just like that. He sighed and took out something he had hidden inside one corner of his inventory.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve prepared something else to make your equipment. Here, these are it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The things Yu IlHan had pulled out so proudly, was a box containing hundreds of thousands of blinding-white feathers, tens of flasks containing white blood, as well as some dead skin and crust that were emitting a strong aura.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera looked down at those items and became silent for a moment, before asking with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you pick all these up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, the 5th option on your armor also had this in it as well\u2026\u2026 So [email\u00a0protected]#$^&amp;*@!^!#!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I have to close my eyes for one hour, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yumir, who was good at learning, closed his two eyes and turned around, while Liera\u2019s vicious assault on Yu IlHan began!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan struggled and squirmed like a fish out of water, but she did not let go no matter what he did. After all, it was her who taught Yu IlHan his martial arts back then!</p><br/><p>It really did take one full hour before Yu IlHan could start working and Yumir and Liera\u2019s equipment.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>The craft will be short but thick and passionate, and will proceed really fast to achieve the real purpose of this arc</p><br/>\n</div>"}

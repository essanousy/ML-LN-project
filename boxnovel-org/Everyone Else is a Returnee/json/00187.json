They just left a single note on the mansion.</p><br/><p>The news of the death of a fallen angel would probably reach their main HQ soon. At that time, they will shrink back in fear, and their scope of action would drastically decrease. Not only that, they would refrain from showing themselves on Earth and any other worlds connected to it. Yu IlHan\u2019s actions were actually so drastically effective.</p><br/><p>The reason he tried to kill a fallen angel was due to that as well, but now that he knew that not only were they a good source of experience, he had acquired the body and the magic stone, so he ended up thinking that he couldn\u2019t miss them while they were still in the dark.</p><br/><p>What made his actions more confident was the title \u2018Untouchable\u2019 that he had just acquired. Those with higher \u2018league\u2019 than him, in other words, against all 4th class beings or higher, his abilities would increase by 20%, so there was nothing to hesitate on now.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsually, one would rejoice that it became easier to hunt 4th class, and not think about killing higher existences with it~.\u201d</p><br/><p>[You should know that IlHan isn\u2019t considered ordinary anymore.]</p><br/><p>Naturally, those higher existences didn\u2019t just go to any world. The reason Yu IlHan could meet a fallen angel, was also because information was passed over to them through a traitor angel.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what they were planning to do by coming in contact with him, but that guy was definitely waiting for Yu IlHan. What were they trying to do? Check his level of power? Tell him something? Scheme? Warn him?</p><br/><p>In any case, he couldn\u2019t care less. Yu IlHan only wanted to beat them all up.</p><br/><p>The time Yu IlHan met the second fallen angel was after they had been to 4 more worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see~.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If they could be found by you, they wouldn\u2019t be higher existences.]</p><br/><p>The fallen angel didn\u2019t seem to be notified of his colleague\u2019s death (and in fact, wouldn\u2019t even believe even if he was told), and was waiting for Yu IlHan around the gate, but as soon as Yu IlHan noticed him, he didn\u2019t go destroy the magic formation, but hunt around 100 monsters before ambushing him.</p><br/><p>[I definitely felt some\u2026\u2026..Kergh!?]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are already dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>9 simultaneous hits ended with several criticals. They were the messages Yu IlHan liked the most.</p><br/><p>[Kak!? How, can this\u2026..!]</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. Stop there. Your friend already used that line before.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an opponent he could kill with a \u2018single\u2019 strike even without any critical hits, but there were critical hits stacked on top as well, so what would have happened? The area around the heart was completely perforated, and the shoulder blades were likewise shattered to pieces.</p><br/><p>[You\u2026\u2026 noticed me!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were just weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to kill Yu IlHan with the final bits of his power, but there was no way Yu IlHan would have attacked in the first place if he thought that he may be counterattacked and die.</p><br/><p>[Kurgh, you bastard\u2026..!]</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the rest to me. I\u2019ll send others for you to meet up on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Before that, I\u2019ll kill\u2026..KILLLLLL!]</p><br/><p>His attack effected himself precisely and fatally and twisted all the mana. Even if higher existences had the power to overturn the skies and move the earth, they were useless once their magic organ was destroyed. No matter how much he tried to gather power to the leaking body, it only leaked out as black aura.</p><br/><p>[However, you\u2019re late\u2026\u2026 you\u2019re too late!]</p><br/><p>Just as Yu IlHan was about to deal the final strike, the fallen angel said a line which made him really bothered. The contents were similar to the time when the first one died, but it had much more content, and had a desperate nuance to it.</p><br/><p>Even while knowing that nothing would come from asking a dying enemy, he ended up asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Kergh!]</p><br/><p>Justas he was about to reply, he died with a final vomiting of pitch black blood. However, despite the fact that he had a successful hunt, Yu IlHan\u2019s expression was not that bright.</p><br/><p>[You have earned experience.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Spear of Untraceable Trajectory, has become level 86.]</p><br/><p>[The skill, Deathgod, has become level 90.]</p><br/><p>[Killing 5th class 1/1]</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, I got done in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Collecting the body, Yu IlHan muttered in a frustrated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one had quite the ability to throw baits unlike the first one. I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m more surprised about your reaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the fact that it made me unable to prepare anything even while giving me concrete information, I can give about 79 points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Yu IlHan\u2019s expression was so stern as he said that, Na YuNa wanted to ask where the 21 points were deducted, but decided to hold it. Yu IlHan only licked his lips after checking that there was no magic stone after he cracked open the brain and the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo my luck isn\u2019t that good after all, eh? I wanted to evolve Language skill too\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[You must be the only 3rd class who needs so many 5th class magic stones.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s quickly go over to another world! They will probably notice soon, so it will be a fight for time from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we need to destroy the magic formation though~!\u201d</p><br/><p>[To think he made that woman make a comeback\u2026 IlHan sure is amazing\u2026\u2026!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan and Na YuNa took 25 minutes to enter a world and destroy a magic formation, then clean up, thanks to the combination of Ruin Calling and Leap. The fastest time people took before he came back to Earth was 4 days, so by simple calculations, he was 180 times faster.</p><br/><p>However, this was an AVERAGE of 25 minutes we were talking about, so there was no meaning to comparisons. His speed was so overwhelming that it made others wonder what they did for the past 2 years.</p><br/><p>Even while flying at insane speeds in Yu IlHan\u2019s arms, Na YuNa created a shield with all her power and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you make such an artifact? Flying that fast must require insane amounts of mana, but you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re consuming much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inefficient to consume mana when you\u2019re just flying. Instead, this requires ability on the user. Hm, mastering Physical combat and Leap would do, I guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh~, so that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa decided to ask no further. Of course it was like this. Using an artifact that has tremendous efficiency and little mana consumption would require like 2 mastered skill at the basics\u2026\u2026 Even though she hadn\u2019t mastered a single skill in the 10 years she was away from Earth!</p><br/><p>Of course, it was also thanks to her innately acquiring higher class skills, which were very difficult to train in, but even considering that, Yu IlHan\u2019s state was abnormal.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong or capable a person was, it should be impossible to break through the limits of time, right? Her eyes looking at Yu IlHan narrowed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have something you didn\u2019t tell me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to tell you though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tight guarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s my IlHan.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not yours, ahjumma!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ahjumma!?] (Means \u2018old lady\u2019, equivalent of \u2018oba-san\u2019 of JP)</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was nervous about when the Army of Brilliant Light would notice that he had killed two higher existences, but in fact, even after he had cleared the tenth world, it had only been 4 hours since he killed the first one.</p><br/><p>The fallen angels belonging to the Army of Brilliant Light only met at periodic meetings, which wasn\u2019t held once in just one or two days. As every member was a higher existences, they judged that most things would be solved by their independent actions.</p><br/><p>Just who in their right mind would predict that one of them was killed by a lower existence in an ambush in a lower world? It wasn\u2019t that the Army of Brilliant Light was lax, but that Yu IlHan\u2019s refinement in the spear was beyond their imagination.</p><br/><p>However, only Yu IlHan alone was in a hurry, and was clearing world in an average of 25 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we really not found yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>[We\u2019re really, really not found out yet. There\u2019s no way those fallen angels would move so diligently.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why don\u2019t I see any fallen angels! Even though I want to meet them so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Like how Heaven\u2019s Army is busy without actually seeming like doing anything, the Army of Brilliant Light is similar. Well, no, all higher existence factions are like that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do acknowledge that\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Destroying the magic formation in the seventeenth world he was in in an instant, Yu IlHan looked at the surroundings. He couldn\u2019t find the presence of any fallen angels. He was annoyed and he muttered while looking at the remains of the destroyed magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get what they\u2019re trying to do with this formation. No matter what I do, I can\u2019t feel any danger from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you insta-killed it. If not, it would emit strange smoke and shoot mana and cause all sorts of mess. Even we would have had a hard time if not for Mir during the past two years~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have so many additional functions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s eyes glistened. A magic formation created to activate a magic that will affect something of Earth\u2019s scale, had so many protective aspects? And one that higher existences couldn\u2019t even make by themselves due to the restriction?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.Is it really an additional function though?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan?\u2019</p><br/><p>However, it was natural for him to question that.</p><br/><p>\u201cA magic formation with so many attack capabilities. Would it really have another hidden function? In the end, they were created from humans or the like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the Army of Brilliant Light and the Destruction Demon Army helped~. In fact, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t thought of that either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, of course. There was no way the witty Na YuNa would not have doubted the true function of the magic formations.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, things would become meaningless that way. It only released mana to counterattack against the attackers. If it\u2019s just that, there is no way that could damage Earth in any way~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if their intention in the first place was to make us notice them? What if their intention was to make the people of Earth \u2018move\u2019 in some way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even more meaningless. The only thing I can think of is preventing us from being on Earth, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s another expert that destroys all common sense like you on Earth, nor would Earth just meet its apocalypse just because it lost some experts. Not only are there a lot of ability users on Earth right now, there are also plenty of support from other worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed due to the unreachable conclusion. He could just destroy them with ease if he knew that this magic formation was made by some almighty being and would put Earth into danger, but now that he started doubting, he couldn\u2019t help but think about them in another way.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what weighed on his mind the most was the fact that both the fallen angels he had killed mentioned that \u2018it was too late\u2019. Late? What is? It was impossible to prevent their schemes even though he was destroying so many formations? Or was the magic formations merely distractions, and there was a hidden plan instead?</p><br/><p>It was very improbable that the words of the fallen angels were wrong. That was because their words did not encourage others to act, but only declared about a situation that was already over.</p><br/><p>For comparison, checkmates in chess was similar. Whatever the opponent did, the situation would not change. Only when at an absolute advantage could they say such words. The ones listening would feel really bad but that couldn\u2019t be helped. Like how Yu IlHan was right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGosh, this is annoying me so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do, want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say the same thing as Liera.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Do you both really want a smack?]</p><br/><p>Pondering ended here. What he could do right now was only to do his best. Yu IlHan sighed and unfolded Ruin Calling. When he extended both of his arms forward, Na YuNa hopped into his arms while blushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes my heart pound.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no ulterior motives so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan was about to Leap with her in his arms, when something tugged on his mind and he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really curious but what perfume are you using?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa, who was feeling down when she heard that he had no ulterior motives, suddenly made a blooming smile when she heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use any perfume. Do I smell good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, lies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan snorted and turned his head around. Na YuNa found that more funny. How could both the father and son be so cute in praising others. Clinging onto Yu IlHan\u2019s arms, she leaned her body. Yu IlHan grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die if I get off. I\u2019m going to stay like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liera, who was watching this entire time, spoke in a very creepy voice.</p><br/><p>[Na YuNa, I wish you\u2019d become a higher existence quickly. Yes, as fast as possible\u2026.. before the boiling blood in my veins cools down.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan didn\u2019t particularly like Na YuNa, but decided to protect her from Liera\u2019s hands when she did become a higher existence.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Na YuNa and Liera\u2019s fierce psychological warfare</p><br/>\n</div>"}

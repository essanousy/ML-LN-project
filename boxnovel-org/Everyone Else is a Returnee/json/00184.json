The reason was simple \u2013 Na YuNa was not noisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll search now~.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps even she differentiated the time to rest easy with her allies, and the time to work hard. Well, they did repeat this process for the past 2 years, so she wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay immature all the time.</p><br/><p>While Yu IlHan was thinking of something slightly rude, Na YuNa raised her staff and struck on the ground. Holy power, in a scale incomparable to any, thanks to the blessing of the goddess, came into contact with the lands and read through the records.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Leytna, would you please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene of pink holy power covering Na YuNa, her staff, and the surrounding regions was very grand and beautiful. As she wasn\u2019t being noisy like usual, she even looked \u2018holy\u2019!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt his heart thump while looking at Na YuNa concentrating with her eyes closed, before quickly denying himself. He only felt nervous because a certain someone was acting unusual!</p><br/><p>The process ended not long after. The mana gathering towards Na YuNa seem to increase, before it all scattered at once to all directions.</p><br/><p>Then, she opened her eyes. She made a slight smile towards Yu IlHan, before raising her staff to point towards one direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe direction is around there, I guess~. We\u2019d be able to go if we break through everything in our way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo holy power could do such magic\u2026\u2026 but are you really sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019ve looked for them for 2 years. I have confidence in finding them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>[It should be different according to how much holy power she could bring out from a recorded god. Although it\u2019s very annoying, that woman is first rate in that regard.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSee? Fufu, aren\u2019t I amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa heard Liera\u2019s words, and straightened her back while pushing out her chest, and said \u2018ehem\u2019. However, even that was much more meek than Yu IlHan had imagined. Yu IlHan tilted his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being strange. Miss YuNa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being your usual self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not my usual self.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa replied while looking at Yu IlHan as if he was an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really excited right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Excited? Leaving aside the reason, she didn\u2019t look at all excited right now. In fact, Yu IlHan had misunderstood that she was feeling down because she was acting so meek. \u2026\u2026.He couldn\u2019t grasp whether she hid her feelings well or couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, sheesh. You should ask why I\u2019m excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan did not ask. He predicted that she would say nonsensical stuff again. Na YuNa grumbled since she didn\u2019t like that, but still, she was much more meek compared to her usual self. And that made Yu IlHan feel strange.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just what did she eat wrong?\u2019</p><br/><p>[Tch, I don\u2019t like this.]</p><br/><p>Only Liera, who saw through the situation a little, clicked her tongue. Of course, she would never tell Yu IlHan about that. She only tapped on Yu IlHan\u2019s head in mini mode.</p><br/><p>[You\u2019re the bad guy.]</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Everything\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps the reason why Na YuNa\u2019s state was strange, the reason why Liera was not in a good mood, the reason why the 4th Great Cataclysm descended upon Dareu, as well as the reason why the 3rd Great Cataclysm was descending upon Earth was all his fault. Yu IlHan sighed again and confirmed with Na YuNa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then. Now what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to go straight until we find the formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Spoke Na YuNa in a joyful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority of the time is taken here! At the longest, we even took one month!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one stupid labor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s like playing an RPG, meeting dungeons and bad guys on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have so much free time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan sighed and approached her. When Na YuNa extended her hand with a smile, Yu IlHan grabbed it and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can cast a shield magic on yourself, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, yeah, of course. But why\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s fly.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was close distance, even Yu IlHan would give up, but there was not much free time to enjoy the travel, when he had a much faster method.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Whah?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Na YuNa was absentmindedly blinking, Yu IlHan boldly lifted her body in two hands. This was the pose that husbands did a lot with their wives in weddings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYay! The service is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCast shield magic before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cheering Na YuNa felt seriousness in Yu IlHan\u2019s voice and instinctively cast a shield on herself. And concludingly, that was a very wise decision. Yu IlHan had immediately activated leap to jump into the air!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgyaaaaaaaaaak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Screamed Na Yuna. Well, anyone would be like that if they jumped 5 kilometers into the air in an instant!</p><br/><p>She was fine only because she had acquired an enhanced body and even cast shield magic on herself. Against normal people, Yu IlHan would be bringing them to their deaths, not to their destination.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the effects are much better now that I\u2019ve mastered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMastered it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan realized that he had jumped up too high, and finally remembered that he had mastered the Leap skill.</p><br/><p>Mastering a skill was incomparable to the previous stage. Moreover, when evolved to a higher skill, the growth of the higher skill would also enhance the effects of the original.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s Deathgod skill also enhanced the effects of concealment the more its level rose. Yu IlHan had evolved Leap to acquire Warp, so the more he used Warp, the stronger Leap would become. Of course, it would be hard for him to use it, since the materials required were insane\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re going quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Wait, faster than nowwaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan unfolded Ruin Calling, and shot shockwaves towards his back and repeated re-leaps several times to shoot forward. He was much faster than when he came up to the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go more softlyyyyyyyy!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Tsk, you can\u2019t even endure that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it even posssssssssssssssssibleeeeee!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems even the meeker Na YuNa couldn\u2019t endure this, and screamed a sound that was more like it was from the mouth of a monster than from a beauty. Yu IlHan repeated re-leaps several times and accelerated even more while he said to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might bite your tongue. Just stay still until we arrive at the destination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShtupid! Ithiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looked like she bit her tongue already. Even while laughing, Yu IlHan sped up once again. With the mastered Leap and Ruin Calling, he had the confidence to not lose against any higher existence in speed!</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s much more than that!]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Stoooop!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a result, Yu IlHan achieved a new record of reaching the place of the magic formation in 6 minutes, contrary to Na YuNa\u2019s expectation of more than a month. This was a world that was twice as big as Earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuiiiii.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew, that was refreshing.\u201d</p><br/><p>[So you finish it off with that line. You really are badass.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan recovered his injured muscles (due to the consecutive use of Leaps) with Transcendent Regeneration, and bit on a cheerpack with Breath inside it. Meanwhile, Na YuNa shouted even while panting with both of her hands on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot! Stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to go alone as expected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdioooot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan turned his head around while laughing, after he saw that Na YuNa couldn\u2019t use a better word than just idiot. By this time, Yu IlHan could also notice where this magic formation was.</p><br/><p>No matter how well it was hidden, it was impossible to hide the form of the magic power. A magic formation containing pitch black magic power was slithering nearby them.</p><br/><p>However, there was something else he was more concerned about.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it seems like they\u2019re at least pretending to sneak peek.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Are there humans nearby? Just clean them up.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t do that really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan shrugged his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a higher existence. This guy has one pair of pitch black of wings, so he must be a 5th class fallen angel in the Army of Brilliant Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026. Why is such a guy waiting here? Did they perhaps predict that you would come here?]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, perhaps they came to check the progress on their plan since the Great Cataclysm is coming soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>[If it isn\u2019t that, they might be on patrol since they heard that there was a new variable. Is this plan that much important?]</p><br/><p>The moment Erta and Spiera went back, the other angels should have been notified that Yu IlHan had come back. Her predictions were very reasonable. However\u2026\u2026. traitors won\u2019t be able to do anything reckless if they announce it publicly? Bullshit, they were no different from a leaking bucket!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have caught notice of something like that. Sheesh.\u201d</p><br/><p>[IlHan, do your best! I\u2019m always on your side!]</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt that it would be better if the Heaven\u2019s Army just left the three angels with him, and retracted all others. At least the three angels with him would not betray.</p><br/><p>[But there\u2019s nothing that he can do to you, so don\u2019t worry. Casting off one\u2019s shell is only possible for the Destruction Demon Army. Fallen angels were once angels so they have no shell to cast out.]</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that. He doesn\u2019t even notice that we\u2019re here in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, they were under concealment. Although he didn\u2019t have a party-specialized title like Yumir, he was still a master of concealment. Concealing Liera and Na YuNa with him was as easy as pie.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026 hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought for a moment in that spot. Then, he turned around to Na YuNa, who was still vomiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it will be hard without a buff. Would you please give me your strongest one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUu, fine~.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa obediently gave him the buff he wanted even while she was agonized due to the sky travel that started off as a princess carry, but had no romance at all. Yu IlHan felt that his power had risen by 30% in an instant, and nodded in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, it\u2019s no good as expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t tell me you were trying to kill a higher existence? Don\u2019t do it yet. The wall of a higher existence is not so simple!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so don\u2019t worry. I also didn\u2019t plan to go against them with just a mere 30% increase.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan denied her and charged against their original objective for coming here, the magic formation. Even the fallen angel could not notice him. Naturally, the magic formation did not notice Yu IlHan\u2019s arrival at all, and without any interference, he arrived right in the center of the magic formation, and struck with the pile bunker he had just taken out!</p><br/><p>[Critical Hit!]</p><br/><p>With that single strike, the magic formation disappeared without a trace. The pile bunker was only loaded to the 6th stage too!</p><br/><p>\u201cWao\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa forgot about the side effects of the flight and exclaimed. They had to fight for at least three minutes with Na YuNa herself, Kang MiRae, Kim YeSeul, and Yumir, at the same time, but this person just insta-crushed it!</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. IlHan are you perhaps 4th class\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m still 3rd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026..? Wait, 3rd? Then if you become 4th class\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The high-and-mighty (mentally) Na YuNa ended up falling into confusion. Yu IlHan pulled her up with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Where\u2019s that fallen angel? Now that your concealment wore off, he should recognize you, right?]</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look around so much, Liera. Nothing good comes out from me telling him that I noticed him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>The fallen angel looked very panicked due to the sudden destruction of the formation. However, he didn\u2019t do something useless like appearing out of nowhere and start lecturing nonsense in front of Yu IlHan, and just watched over him. He still believed that he wasn\u2019t found out!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan felt like things would come to this. Although he didn\u2019t believe that this guy would follow him over to Earth, he was probably planning to see what Yu IlHan was up to by sneaking peeks on him. Then\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it easy on the way back. Come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Even if you try to make my heart pound like that, considering the flight from before, it still adds up into a minus!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never planned to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPiih.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa sighed but still came over to Yu IlHan\u2019s arms. Although she was grumbling on the surface, she had a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me this girl actually likes\u2026\u2026 there\u2019s no way that\u2019s true.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan barely came to himself just before he started a forever-loner\u2019s sequence to deluding himself that someone liked him. Once he started misunderstanding here, everything would be over. He didn\u2019t want any more dark history.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf MiRae knew we were doing this, she would try to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I want to kill you too right now.]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan lightly ignored Na YuNa and Liera\u2019s words and flew up to the sky. He leaped lightly, and directed shockwaves to his back to rise steadily. Na YuNa became cheerful after she realized that their altitude was rising slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is it! Finally it\u2019s a little romantic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot a romance video with you, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m no idiot. I can\u2019t stay unknowing when you keep staying no so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa suddenly acknowledged him. When he widened his eyes, at her acknowledgement, Na YuNa giggled and added.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut perhaps I like you even more because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to understand how I feel easily. However, I\u2019m not lying so you can believe me. You\u2019re much more attractive than you think you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Hey, I might as well send you on your way if you keep hitting up on him like that.]</p><br/><p>\u201cSend me away, lol.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan had no intention to trust Na YuNa\u2019s words, but it didn\u2019t feel so bad. So, he decided to just pretend that he hadn\u2019t heard it. Even in aspects like this, he was acting like a loner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Mr. IlHan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bel\u2026.. why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing since a while ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Na YuNa while looking at a spear falling on the ground. They were definitely from Yu IlHan\u2019s inventory. And that wasn\u2019t the only one. Not long after Yu IlHan had flown up, he was throwing spears on the ground periodically.</p><br/><p>But although Na YuNa couldn\u2019t see, the thrown spears were collected back into the inventory after killing monsters on the ground, on the sea, and in the air.</p><br/><p>[So you\u2019re training Absolute accuracy? I should have noticed when you were flying slowly. You training maniac.]</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, training Absolute accuracy is just a side effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied as if to blame Liera who still didn\u2019t know him properly after all this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m training the Deathgod skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026Huh.]</p><br/><p>Liera replied.</p><br/><p>[Since when were we under concealment?]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied with a smile. While aiming for the back of the fallen angel that had lost his target and was flying around aimlessly in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least, he wouldn\u2019t know since when.\u201d</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Life always changes due to unpredictable things.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s Na YuNa\u2019s secret to becoming quieter when she\u2019s excited?</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, he\u2019s finally decided!</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>We all know what he\u2019s doing.</p><br/><p>Hint: Deathgod has an effect of XXXX when he does XXXX during concealment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I think it\u2019s super dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Oh my god, an Overflow!](Lita)</p><br/><p>[How can it be!](Erta)</p><br/><p>Lita and Erta, who noticed that a little earlier than Yu IlHan did, also shouted in shock. Yu IlHan, who realized that the situation was very urgent in any case, ran towards the same direction the monsters were running to and threw his spears to reduce their numbers as much as possible,</p><br/><p>However, if he could stop the situation with just that, an Overflow wouldn\u2019t have occurred in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverflow is a phenomenon that occurs when the performance of a Trap of Destruction is too strong, isn\u2019t it! Right now, not to mention Traps of Destructions, the dungeons are breaking down, so how the hell did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>[I don\u2019t know! Don\u2019t tell me an inactive Trap of Destruction suddenly\u2026 No, this doesn\u2019t even make sense!](Lita)</p><br/><p>The moment Lita shouted while shaking her head, Yu IlHan thought up of a frightening imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this situation, where an enormous amount of monsters were released to a limited area due to broken dungeons, if someone throws several Traps of Destruction at the same place, then wouldn\u2019t it be possible to artificially cause an Overflow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s estimation was correct. In fact, if an Overflow had occurred in this situation, a Dungeon Wave, there wouldn\u2019t be any other explanation.</p><br/><p>[Why would someone\u2026 just who!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[Traitors\u2026\u2026There were more!](Lita)</p><br/><p>While Erta was accepting and being shocked at the situation, Lita, having seen through the situation, gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>She knew very well that the traitor last time was just the bottom of the rung. He was only killed since they had no means to find out who was behind him, they were aware that there was a possibility of more traitors being amongst their ranks, so they were cautious. Wasn\u2019t the reason for more angels being dispatched to Earth to prevent situations like this?</p><br/><p>The problem was that such situations were happening again as if to laugh at them.</p><br/><p>What this proved was very simple. The traitor was deeper amongst their ranks than they thought, and their abilities were incredibly high.</p><br/><p>[Why would someone do this? Do they really intend to destroy Earth?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[There are a few who might think that. Anyway, for now, solving this Overflow is priority!](Lita)</p><br/><p>Lita was right. There was no need to think about anything else right now. Yu IlHan only just ardently ran forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe storm of Susanoo is chasing the monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, follow Lord Susanoo! If we don\u2019t then we will all die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOverflow, it\u2019s definitely an Overflow. If all these monsters gather in one place, and if a mutant species appear in this kind of place where the mana concentration is already so high\u2026 Shit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Susanoo Army also seemed to realize that the situation was not going well. Some among them had experienced Overflows in other worlds, and in LA a while ago, so they saw through the situation quite correctly.</p><br/><p>[Yu IlHan, please hurry up a little more! A little more!](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m running at full speed right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The location that was presumed to be the center of the Overflow, was around 30km away from where Yu IlHan was fighting. Thinking that it was fortunate that it didn\u2019t happen so far away, Yu IlHan pushed up his gear.</p><br/><p>After finding the combination of transcendent regeneration and superhuman strength, it was now possible for him to deploy superhuman strength almost continuously as long as the bloodrink allowed him to. Focusing all the power of his muscles into running, he renewed all his past records.</p><br/><p>Now that he could not wield mana, keeping the superhuman strength skill active all the time was a blessing for him.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s dangerous\u2026\u2026](Lita)</p><br/><p>Lita had become nervous.</p><br/><p>[This is too dangerous. The time isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s bad to the point that I\u2019m thinking that this Dungeon Break was planned meticulously beforehand.</p><br/><p>The mana concentration that was heightened beyond norm in the Kantou region, and the heightened levels of the monsters according to that, the Dungeon Break that occurred as if to strike the nail on the head, Dungeon Wave, and the gathered strong ability users. All these attributed to increasing the concentration of mana, and they scattered Traps of Destruction to induce an artificial Overflow.</p><br/><p>The monsters around here are mostly 2nd class, and perhaps, the monster that will be born at the end of this overflow maybe\u2026. just maybe.](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>While running at full speed, Yu IlHan checked his condition, his skills and his equipment once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will kill it. Whether it\u2019s 3rd class or 4th class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back to the mage that he ended instantly in the past, Yu IlHan thought that this wouldn\u2019t end easily like that and shook his head.</p><br/><p>This situation was completely different to the one last time. The mage was completely off guard, and did not receive the opportunity to bring out his full abilities, and was a mage, that had the lowest defense amongst all the 4th class people out there.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what monster would appear due to this Overflow, but its defense would be on a completely different scale to the mage. Perhaps, its attack power, and its destructive range, too.</p><br/><p>However, what difference does that make? Yu IlHan\u2019s humanity enhancement didn\u2019t even bud yet, and the monster would appear right now. So, would Yu IlHan have to give up and run away since it was hard to kill?</p><br/><p>Not possible. Simple. If he couldn\u2019t kill it, then Earth would step once towards the path of Destruction, and none, other than Yu IlHan would be able to kill it.</p><br/><p>[IlHan, we\u2019ve arrived!]</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan ended his thoughts and raised his head up.</p><br/><p>That place was truly a spectacle. A violent storm of mana, and the numerous monsters that ran towards it without regard for their lives, the ruined city, and the wandering humans that did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>Would it be different if he arrived a little earlier? Would he be able to prevent the appearance of a mutant species if he used all his weapons? These kind of questions were meaningless right now.</p><br/><p>The monsters that gathered here all threw their bodies into that storm, and a level more frightening mutant species were appearing in this world.</p><br/><p>And, even amongst the mutant species, a huge monster, that absorbed the powers of three Traps of Destruction, appeared.</p><br/><p>{Kwaaaaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>\u201cPff.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing its appearance that showed up with a loudly resounding roar, Yu IlHan ended up laughing. How did it end up like this. What coincidence was this?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a spare Ame no Habakiri?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No.](Lita)</p><br/><p>Lita replied with an absent minded voice. Yu IlHan nodded as if he knew the answer already, and straightened his waist at the front of the giant monster that had eight heads and eight tails.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I can only fight like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster that showed itself in front of humanity, looked similar to the monster, Yamata no Orochi, that was told to be slayed by Susanoo in Japanese mythology.</p><br/><p>{Kruoooooo!}</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are the principles of a mutant specie being born? Don\u2019t tell me that absurd myth is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>[No way, but in this Japanese lands, stories related to Yamata no Orochi is quite a hot issue, no?](Lita)</p><br/><p>Through books, through manga, through movies, through games, through anime, through other people \u2013 the story of that monster was retold countless times.</p><br/><p>The existence of Yamata no Orochi is false, so it is not recorded anywhere, but various media itself was recorded to pass down the false monster\u2019s existence and ability.</p><br/><p>[I think it acquired that appearance after absorbing those records. Truly a mutant specie.](Lita)</p><br/><p>In fact, Yu IlHan couldn\u2019t care less what it looked like on the outside. It wasn\u2019t like the nickname Susanoo that he had acquired gave him an advantage against it, so it was meaningless.</p><br/><p>What was important now, was that it harbored enormous amount of power, befitting of its horrifying appearance.</p><br/><p>{Kuwaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>Without any signs, it spat out a lump of purple light from its mouth. As it had 8 mouths, there were naturally 8 such lumps. They burned everything that they came into contact with, created craters on the ground, and devoured humans and monsters alike.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of lives evaporated in an instant. Truly, an absurd power.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYa, Yamata no Orochi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. We have Lord Susanoo with us. The myth is replaying on this land!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumb things, we will die if we don\u2019t move now! The enemy isn\u2019t only just Orochi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yamata no Orochi was just the head of the mutant species. The mutant species that appeared as a result of this Overflow wasn\u2019t just itself. Huge snakes, lizards, and fish that walked on two legs\u2026 they all had strong power.</p><br/><p>\u201cD, don\u2019t tell me they are all 3rd class?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot all, but some are, 3rd class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, how are we supposed to kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the people who did well against several hundred high level monsters had now fallen into panic.</p><br/><p>This was in a completely different scale than the ones they had seen until now. They were having a hard time against those who just passed level 50, and now, the minimum level of those monsters were 90. There were even tens of 3rd class monsters as well.</p><br/><p>{Kroooooaaaaaaaaaaaar!}</p><br/><p>Orochi spat out lumps of purple light again. Since the humans had fallen into panic due to seeing so many high level monsters, these purple lumps were a disaster for them. Moreover, the time it took to recharge those set of 8 lumps wasn\u2019t even that long either. If this was a game, the creators were making a level 30 challenge a hell mode boss!</p><br/><p>Moreover, those lumps of purple light didn\u2019t end with just a direct attack, and scattered flames of purple light everywhere. The ability to make the entire battlefield a hell of fire; this took the entire battlefield completely away from the human\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m going crazy, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>[No doubt about it. A 4th class.](Erta]</p><br/><p>Even Erta absent mindedly spoke as she did not know how to advise him.</p><br/><p>She wanted to help him, but angel\u2019s support skill was something that cannot be activated unless in an Abandoned World. She had provided Yu IlHan this subclass since she didn\u2019t want to drag him down, but now it couldn\u2019t even be brought out!</p><br/><p>[Aah, really!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[No, Erta](Lita)</p><br/><p>Just as when Erta was about to explode after holding in her frustration. in other words, just as she was about to go against the rules of the Army of Heaven! Lita restrained her with a calm voice.</p><br/><p>[Let\u2019s believe in IlHan and wait.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[This is a different situation to when he killed the mage!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[And take him and run if it seems like it really wouldn\u2019t work out.](Lita)</p><br/><p>[Got it.](Erta)</p><br/><p>The two talked about things that other angels would punish them when they heard it, but fortunately, there was no one to hear them right now. The humans weren\u2019t even aware of angels, and the angels were busy worrying about their own partners.</p><br/><p>However, Yu IlHan himself, the one that the two angels decided to help survive even with a compensation, was talking stuff like this while looking at Orochi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I need to attract it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Sorry?](Erta)</p><br/><p>[What?](Lita)</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this rate, everyone other than me will die. I need to attract it to somewhere else then fight it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After deciding, he kicked off the ground. In his hands was the pile bunker that had not many more uses left. Of course, with the ammo loaded to the 4th level.</p><br/><p>No matter how it was the Yamata no Orochi, it could not see through Yu IlHan\u2019s concealment, and since he had killed monsters endlessly while his deathgod skill was active, he was more than 60% stronger. Counting all abilities that would increase when attacking in surprise, he would be able to deal 3 times the normal damage.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to kill the Orochi, but it would be enough to make it chase Yu IlHan in berserk mode!</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan leaped several hundred meters into the air, but the Orochi still could not notice him.</p><br/><p>Even though the enemy was someone that would threaten his life, what was the reason that laughs came out of him? Laughing, Yu IlHan aimed the pile bunker on the central regions othe head. Then kicked off the air using re-leap!</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go, please-look-at-only-me attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t come up with weird move names at such an important time!](Erta)</p><br/><p>At that time, the pile bunker itself got struck in the throat of the Orochi, that was open as it was just after it had shot a magic bullet. The moment Orochi abruptly widened its eyes, Yu IlHan shot the ammo simultaneously as he transferred the weight of the Cross Bag!</p><br/><p>{Kroaaaakagagagagak!}</p><br/><p>A scream that seemed like it would split apart the Earth, resounded across. The ones that were running away in fear of the Orochi, and the ones fighting against the monsters all staggered due to the enormous vibration.</p><br/><p>And they could see \u2013 the one that hid until now, and the absolute one that had lead them until now.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t kill the enemy in a single strike, the long lasting concealment had finally worn off.</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, he\u2019s really a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>{Khaaaakaga!}</p><br/><p>The Orochi\u2019s neck, that was completely done in by the pile bunker, was obliterated into smithereens. The pile bunker ammo that had not lost its power, cut through the Orochi\u2019s neck to its body with several thousands of tons of weight, with a loud ripping sound, before finishing off with an explosion.</p><br/><p>While the Orochi roared in pain, Yu IlHan landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cL, Lord Susanoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that the people\u2019s gazes were directed at him, but he intentionally ignored it. To be exact, he had no time to pay attention to them; he had to kick off and run immediately.</p><br/><p>{Kuhaaaaaaa!}</p><br/><p>Everything was according to Yu IlHan\u2019s plan. Facing an enormous pain, the Orochi chased Yu IlHan with its eyes flipped. Despite the fact that there were many prey around it, it couldn\u2019t help it since its sense of vengeance burned brightly against Yu IlHan, who had destroyed one of its heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, follow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>{Kruaaaaa!]</p><br/><p>Bringing out the maximum power of his superhuman strength, Yu IlHan enhanced his leg muscles, and his speed was really fast to the point that his nickname, Sungdaein Bolt, was not a joke.</p><br/><p>Moreover, a bottle of bloodrink was already on Yu IlHan\u2019s mouth, so he was instantly dissolving the fatigue piling up in his body before the superhuman strength even wore off. He would be able to keep his superhuman strength up until the bloodrink ran out!</p><br/><p>This was only possible since Yu IlHan\u2019s ability to control his muscles and his skills were rapidly evolving in this rapidly changing, endless crisis.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Susanoo is\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking the Orochi to somewhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, we need to help him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t even scratch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Susanoo Army was mostly made up of those that were directly rescued by Yu IlHan. They naturally wanted to help him, but realistically, their power was too weak.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the monsters other than the orochi were charging towards them. Now, they had a hard time looking after their own bodies.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the clans realized that this was a good opportunity to get them known, while at the same time, being a crisis where their clan\u2019s fate was on the line.</p><br/><p>Rather, some of them even thought that they should be the ones to kill the Orochi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to sever the Orochi\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMirae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. we need to kill them first!\u2019</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae made a spear of lightning above his staff and threw it. The current strongest mage of humanity, the Empress\u2019, spear ripped apart a few monsters charging towards the Lightning God clan, but she couldn\u2019t be satisfied with just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even kill a 3rd class monster in a single strike. Even though this was after investing a quarter of my mana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuNa, buff MiRae.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, oppa. But I can\u2019t bring out my beeest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa grumbled while giving Kang MiRae a buff immediately with her holy power. Her latter words weighed on Kang HaJin\u2019s mind so he asked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t bring out your best? At such an important time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to buff IlHan lateeeerr.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t kill the Orochi here right now, then the Earth is doomed. But no one other than him can kill it, right? So I need to help him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether this was due to her lack of self-respect, or overflowing self-respect, Na YuNa was declaring quite firmly. Declaring that no one other than Yu IlHan would be able to accomplish it, she dissed all others, and brought herself up as if it was natural for her to help.</p><br/><p>Anyone who heard it would get angry. Kang HaJin being the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one other than Mr. Yu IlHan can kill it? Fuck, I know that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the moment the name Susanoo got famous on the SNS, the Lightning God clan also suspected that the identity of Susanoo might be Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>However, his battle methods were too different from the ones they had seen until now, and moreover, since his power was too overwhelming, they didn\u2019t want to believe it. More like, they denied that fact with all their heart.</p><br/><p>However, moments ago, when he destroyed one of the heads of the Orochi that was basically playing around with humans, Kang HaJin couldn\u2019t not accept it. On Earth, no, amongst the strong people of all the worlds, the only one that used a weapon like that was him alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang MiRae asked Na YuNa after killing monsters with a level stronger lightning spear after she was buffed by Na Yuna.</p><br/><p>She was quite upset when she heard that no one other than Yu IlHan could kill the Orochi, so her expression had become quite sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s because I\u2019m the Earth\u2019s number one buffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Na YuNa declared shamelessly. Her endless pride was extremely similar to her friend, Kang MiRae.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s clean this place up quickly and go help IlHaaaan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I need to take a place too. It\u2019s a good opportunity to make him owe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou girls really like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, oppa. Just defend the front!\u201d</p><br/><p>Like how the Lightning God clan was defending against the monsters, Metal Knights and Magia vaguely realized that they should defend against these lizard hybrids.</p><br/><p>No, instead, with the appearance of these absurd monsters, the situation was inducing their cooperation, which seemed like it would never happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader of Metal Knights, Michael Smithson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord of Magia, Carina Malatesta.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the bad impression, who had resolved to kill Yu IlHan, and a noble-looking lady, that seemed like she would have never worked throughout her life, joined hands.</p><br/><p>Both Metal Knights and Magia thought that they would only be running away after losing some manpower, but after the absurd monsters like the Orochi came out, they realized that this wasn\u2019t a problem of them running away, but one that concerned the fate of Earth.</p><br/><p>No matter how foolish and idiotic they were, they knew that in this situation, they should put their lives on the line and overcome this crisis, rather than leaving the Earth to doom.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they coincidentally had what their counterpart lacked; Metal Knights had absurdly sturdy defense, and Magia had absurdly powerful magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you really hold out? They are strong. They are on a completely different level to the ones that appeared until now on this archipelago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, they don\u2019t even itch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, they hurt like hell, but if they didn\u2019t hold out here, then Earth would really be doomed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take care of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuu, likewise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Michael and Carina were saying \u2018Fuck, fuck\u2019 within their minds, but they formed a party calmly on the outside. This was the moment two of the most well off clans had merged their powers into one.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you got into a party, then fight already, fuckers!\u201d</p><br/><p>And Kang HaJin, who was splendidly getting beaten up at the front lines with the mutant species, shouted. It was a shout with a soul.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>1. Thanks for the wait, the boss fight!</p><br/><p>2. Since the story is centered around Yu IlHan, I cannot erase the impression that the angels are powerless, and in fact, they actually are, but after this fight, I plan to explain about their situation a little. You might understand a little\u2026. Hm, actually no. Earth is holding out since Yu IlHan\u2019s super strong!</p><br/><p>3. Like in this chapter, Yamata no Orochi is a monstrous beast that was told to be slayed by Susanoo in Shinto myth. To categorize, he is an \u2018original\u2019, mutated one though!</p><br/><p>4. Ame no Habakiri is the sword that was passed onto Susanoo from Izanagi to slay the Orochi. However, this sword is broken during the fight with Orochi, and the sword that Susanoo acquires to replace it is\u2026.(T/N: Author leaves it hanging here\u2026 if you want to know, then it\u2019s the \u201cHeavenly Cloud Gathering Sword\u201d, a.k.a Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi)</p><br/><p>5. I was re reading through this chapter but I didn\u2019t like it so much. After several edits, a disaster where 3 chapters were made into 2 had occurred. The fact that the quantity of this chapter exploded is all due to that. I couldn\u2019t separate it\u2026. T^T</p><br/><p>6.I will answer some of your questions.</p><br/><p>\u20131. The angels requested Yu IlHan to make the Traps of Destruction since the ones they made didn\u2019t work, but how does that Trap of Destruction work so well! (T/N: The ones that created the Overflow) That\u2019s because the Traps of Destruction that Yu IlHan had made is resonating and helping the activation of the Traps of Destruction. This came out before, right?</p><br/><p>\u20132. Even though it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ll get insulted if they don\u2019t cooperate, why do they only gather up in clans? Humans are originally like that. They all act on their own, and if they succeed, they are deemed heroes, and if they fail, they are deemed losers. Of course, they are the latter. There are too many instances in history so it\u2019s hard to line them up here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u20133. How do people follow the concealed Yu IlHan? They don\u2019t, they follow the scenes of destruction and think that \u201cOh! Lord Susanoo his heading that way!\u201d.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>Erta is so nice\u2026 I can type her name with just the left hand.</p><br/><p>On the other hand\u2026 this chapter is around 50% longer\u2026</p><br/><p>So bear it for the 3 chapter/1 week hiatus\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator : Chamber</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yu IlHan was instead shocked by her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can hear her?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Although I had to take out the angel\u2019s ring, yes.](Erta)</p><br/><p>The moment Yu IlHan said the words Reta Kar\u2019iha, Erta realized that the situation was not normal and immediately took out her angel\u2019s ring to bring the communion with Yu IlHan to the limits. Only after that could she hear in in their conversation.</p><br/><p>[The weapon Yu IlHan made did say its abilities would increase when fighting against dragonkin, but to think it would actually refer to dragons\u2026](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cDragonkin aren\u2019t dragons?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The word \u2018dragon\u2019 doesn\u2019t refer to simple dragonkin.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s thoughts continued.</p><br/><p>[Dragonkin innately have a strong power, and dragons are those that are born with extremely strong bodies made made with the extremities of matter and magic even amongst dragonkin. They lord over all dragonkin.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Honestly, Yu IlHan had met neither dragonkin nor dragons so it wasn\u2019t anything surprising. However, Erta was already sighing.</p><br/><p>[Dragons are at least 3rd class, moreover, the ones who lived for a long time are even 5th class, who are treated as higher existences. You would not know how horrifying a higher existence is at full strength.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you guys are all about rules and laws and can\u2019t use your strength properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to retort, but as Yu IlHan seemed a little frustrated, Erta couldn\u2019t do anything. Instead of her, Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s thoughts kept speaking.</p><br/><p>[Our continent was one where elves and humans harmonized peacefully. However, from some time, strong monsters started rapidly appearing on the continent. Not long after, many Great Cataclysms occurred at once. This only happened within 50 years.](Reta)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, higher existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I think there was a mistake there too.](Erta)</p><br/><p>This was a mess. He did think that they screwed up on operating Earth, and they had a precedent! If there really was someone called God, he even wanted to go and complain, to change the manager of Earth.</p><br/><p>[The Army of Heaven realized the abnormality and started focusing on our world, but it was too late by then. This was because the race of dragons that enjoyed killing and violence, were already rampaging around.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s following words were tearfully tragic. The alliance of elves and humans, meticulous defense of the land, treachery, etc. Listening to the story that would probably make an 8 book series, Yu IlHan sympathized with her.</p><br/><p>She chatted so well, so how did she endure until now?</p><br/><p>[The point when Heaven abandoned us was when there was not a single country left on the continent. Dragons massacred humans and elves without even realizing that they were stepping on their own potential to evolve.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s voice trembled. Despite the fact that her real body had scattered after becoming ash, Yu IlHan could clearly imagine her wrathful face.</p><br/><p>[I, who was fatally injured after hundreds of years of battle, thought that I could not end everything like this and used a last resort.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Last resort, meaning becoming a Breaker.</p><br/><p>[A foolish choice.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta declared. Her eyes even had a trace of rage.</p><br/><p>[Breakers are no different from monsters, moving instinctively. No matter what emotion you had in your heart, the moment you fell into a Breaker, you\u2019ve lost your possibility for revenge forever!](Erta)</p><br/><p>[As you may know, I had a deathgod category class like the one that killed me.](Reta)</p><br/><p>That much could be deduced from the options of the items that she was using. Rookie Reaper, the class that Yu IlHan acquired, was a unique class, but it wasn\u2019t like there were no similar classes like it until now. However, Reta Kar\u2019iha also seemed to think the same thing.</p><br/><p>[As such, I thought that not everything would end even if I become a Breaker. Before I became one, I imbued my thoughts into the robe and the scythe using my powers that could tamper with the soul. Even if the one who kills me is not a deathgod, I waited for the day that someone who has a similar ability to me to come\u2026\u2026](Reta)</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, that\u2019s why such things happened when making the spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, not once did the thoughts in the scythe and the robe do anything.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan, who brought out all his strength in the battle with Reta Kar\u2019iha, miraculously acquired the Rookie Reaper class, and was able to acquire the biggest thought fragment that was in her body.</p><br/><p>[Although I did think that there wouldn\u2019t be anyone other than me left on the continent, I could not stop myself from doing those foolish things.](Reta)</p><br/><p>[Even though you know it\u2019s foolish, how!](Erta)</p><br/><p>Just as Erta was about to get more enraged, Yu IlHan spoke in a helpless voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that Abandoned World got connected with Earth like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>[As a result, fortunately, I have acquired this opportunity to pass on this truth to someone else.](Reta)</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s true.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Erta was just about to corner her when she became dejected. However, she then blamed it all on Yu IlHan.</p><br/><p>[If you\u2019re not such an OP character.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not, then I wouldn\u2019t even be here, listening to this talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Calming Erta, who was feeling both joy and despair at the unfair reality, down, Yu IlHan spoke back to Reta Kar\u2019iha.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how frustrated you must be, but I\u2019m very weak right now. Meaning, I don\u2019t have any ability to fight against those dragons and shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes. That was the point. He did understand how frustrated and angry Reta Kar\u2019iha must be, but he himself wasn\u2019t that strong yet. He might be able to kill a 3rd class dragonkin if he fought to death, but that was it.</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan liked new things and new adventures, but he declined in betting his life. He was just going to ignore the dead\u2019s thoughts as just thoughts.</p><br/><p>[However, Dar\u00e9u has already been connected to Earth. If we do not sever the connection, people of Earth would have to face dragons eventually.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Shivering, Yu IlHan spoke to Erta.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe defendant may answer to the judge\u2019s question. What has become of the dungeon in the Gra\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s true. The seal cannot be permanent, and that doesn\u2019t mean we can erase the dungeon itself.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Before he had even finished asking, the answer came back to him. He sighed.</p><br/><p>[Lita already said, didn\u2019t she? They will request the people of Earth using Heaven\u2019s Quests.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back to Lita\u2019s sorry face back then, Yu IlHan asked Reta Kar\u2019iha.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that urgent?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Of course, it may be alright right now. the probability that the existences inside Dar\u00e9u have found the connection with Earth, is very low. However, if the 2nd Great Cataclysm occurs\u2026\u2026](Reta)</p><br/><p>Stopping there, Yu IlHan thought back to what Erta talked about a while ago.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t she say that high level people would have to go inside lower level restricted dungeons when the 2nd Great Cataclysm occurs?</p><br/><p>He instinctively realized. Yu IlHan was about to hear what he didn\u2019t hear back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d</p><br/><p>[The concentration of mana on Earth would rise and the probability of a Dungeon Break occurring rises as well, so at that point, they would be able to come over to Earth.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain what a Dungeon Break is first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was annoyed with all the new proper nouns. Realizing how he was feeling, Erta obediently explained this time.</p><br/><p>Dungeon Breaks refer to the phenomenon where the Traps of Destruction break down due to the high concentration of mana after the 2nd Great Cataclysm. It would explode if unlucky, so it would be good if you cleaned it out beforehand.](Erta)</p><br/><p>That itself was something he had heard before. Even in other novels and games, when one left dungeons alone for a long time, then the overflowing monsters caused accidents.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you make it sturdy from the beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p>[As I already said, all dungeons naturally break down, so you cannot trust in dungeons. Dungeons only exist as a delay.](Erta)</p><br/><p>Yes, she definitely said that on the day Yu IlHan asked about that to her.</p><br/><p>Truly damned.</p><br/><p>[It is not that we can\u2019t make a sturdier and a longer-lasting dungeon, but naturally, it would require more precious materials. Heaven doesn\u2019t have an infinite amount of materials. Meaning, we can\u2019t distribute them to all worlds equally. Moreover, if we scattered strong Traps of Destruction, then overflows occur. Overflows are worse than Dungeon Breaks.](Erta)</p><br/><p>If the attraction force of the Traps of Destruction is too low, then monsters would simply ignore it, and if it\u2019s too strong, then an overflow occurs and mutated species are born\u2026 And even if it\u2019s properly made, then it was unknown when it would explode, and needed regular cleaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just not make dungeons?\u201d</p><br/><p>[That\u2019s easy for us, but humans would all die, right?](Erta)</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true, such a tiresome matter.</p><br/><p>Anyway, Yu IlHan now knew of the full situation. First, the sealed dungeon was still connected to an Abandoned World, and horrifying dragons were everywhere there.</p><br/><p>Earth would definitely go against them sometime.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we not know when the 2nd Great Cataclysm would occur on Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Unlike the 1st Great Cataclysm, the time of the 2nd Great Cataclysm is very dynamic. Earth\u2019s 2nd Great Cataclysm was originally set in 150 years after the first, but during the two months after the first Great Cataclysm, that time has changed tremendously.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many years?\u201d</p><br/><p>[50 years left.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cWao!\u201d</p><br/><p>100 years were reduced in 2 months, so using simple calculations, there was one month left.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s not!](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t read my mind again.\u201d</p><br/><p>[I can\u2019t help it since it\u2019s all readable! Anyway it won\u2019t be one month. Moreover, we sealed it using the power of Heaven so it wouldn\u2019t burst out quickly.](Erta)</p><br/><p>However, the more Erta assured him, the more worried he got. At least, it was clear that there was room for him to not care at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have no choice but to hurry a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>[It becomes possible to use the skill, Angel\u2019s Support, in an Abandoned World. You would become at least 1.5 stronger than now.](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, unless I can use mana, it will be impossible for me to go against 4th class. It might be somehow possible to go against 3rd class, but it\u2019s not like I can pick them out to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>[That.](Reta)</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha, her desperate thoughts interfered as if to answer Yu IlHan. With a desperate voice as if she had waited for this moment.</p><br/><p>[I can help you.](Reta)</p><br/><p>As the situation was like this, Yu IlHan took the bait without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Shall we hear more of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s following explanations were very simple.</p><br/><p>During the last stages of the war between the continental alliance and the dragons, she acquired control of the elven empire\u2019s magic formation which spread throughout the entire world of Dar\u00e9u.</p><br/><p>That was an OP magic formation was able to see through all the levels and the races of those who step on the ground, and enabled the user to teleport anywhere on the continent. The reason why Reta was able to do a guerilla battle over the long years was all thanks to that magic formation as well.</p><br/><p>[It\u2019s a magic formation that was created with the spiritual techniques unique to elves created over tens of thousands of years. Those that aren\u2019t elves cannot even notice the formation. It was passed down to generations of successors of the empire, but they all died and I\u2019ve gained control of it.](Reta)</p><br/><p>[There\u2019s such an OP formation, but why did they lose to dragons?](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you even see a life going as planned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan\u2019s criticism made Erta pout and Reta Kar\u2019iha\u2019s thoughts giggle. That was because he had said the exact words that she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo now, I\u2019m able to kill them after I pick them out?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Correct](Reta)</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m human though, can I use that formation?\u201d</p><br/><p>[As long as my power of life resides within you, it\u2019s possible if you have enough magic stones.]</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan thought for a moment before he tapped his cheeks. It did make him complex now that he had heard so many things at once, but organizing the stuff that he should do, the conclusion was very simple.</p><br/><p>Going inside the dungeon with Reta Kar\u2019iha, find the easy ones, and kill them. Simple.</p><br/><p>And if he hurried before the 2nd Great Cataclysm arrived, then that would be for the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this alone as far as possible. If I find that it\u2019s too hard, then it won\u2019t be late to spread it around at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Why, Yu IlHan? We don\u2019t want you to bear such a heavy burden by yourself. Moreover, a catastrophe would occur on Earth if it goes wrong, so even if you just have to tell the ones with guardian angels!](Erta)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu IlHan replied with a laugh.</p><br/><p>There were two reasons.</p><br/><p>First, the returnees were still too weak. Even if the told them this fact right now, he would only be sacrificing future battle power. Telling them should come later.</p><br/><p>And second.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon\u2019s skin should be awesome right? I cannot give such leather to anyone other than myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>[\u2026\u2026]</p><br/><p>This was the moment when Reta Kar\u2019iha realized that the one who killed her was a huge pervert.</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>You can just take it that starting from 5th class, they are higher existences. Of course, becoming one is extremely hard. Even 4th class are treated as national power.</p><br/><p>Special training does not end in one or two days, so Lita is planned to go back and forth Earth and Heaven for the time being. There were a lot of you that thought that Lita went away permanently again\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(Untranslatable reference)</p><br/><p>Erta already said in the beginning that dungeons aren\u2019t permanent. This is the reason why they cannot relax even when the dungeon was sealed with Heaven\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not that Yu IlHan would go kill dragons immediately. There\u2019s still quite a lot left before that.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes</p><br/><p>How many girls now? 2 angels, 2 humans, and one\u2026.soul?

They are antibodies.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAntibodies!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, Elena.</p><br/><p>Instead of directly getting rid of the disease, distribute the power to those fellows and fight the disease together.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. I\u2019ll try!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena raised the magic power even more,</p><br/><p>then, my body had started to gradually heat up.</p><br/><p>I surrendered myself and didn\u2019t resist the heat.</p><br/><p>The heat moves, spreading throughout my body\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>then,</p><br/><p>it bursts, becoming light.</p><br/><p>It seemed to have consumed a considerable amount of magic power,</p><br/><p>with\u300chaaa haaa\u300d, Elena\u2019s breathing had become disordered.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama, how is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I appraised myself, the disease had been completely cured.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to be completely cured.

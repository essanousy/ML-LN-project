It\u2019s amazing!</p><br/><p>Do monsters not appear here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed, monsters do not appear here.\u300d</p><br/><p>I answered laughingly\u2015</p><br/><p>It would be impossible to come across such terrible fellows on Earth.</p><br/><p>We, during this time, had no way of knowing\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

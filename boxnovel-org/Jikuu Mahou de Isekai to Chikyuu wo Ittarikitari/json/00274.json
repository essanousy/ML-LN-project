It can also mean the act of visiting someone who is ill (most often someone hospitalized), and just like in the west, when someone visits an ill-person, they usually bring flowers or fruits, it\u2019s kinda bad to visit someone empty-handed when you\u2019re visiting them the first time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

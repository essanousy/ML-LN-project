You can store the luggage using magic!?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I was talking with Hilda, Lela cut in on the conversation forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that you mention it, the things disappeared and reappeared, was it magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that's right.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I started talking with Lela, who suddenly cut in,</p><br/><p> Hilda fell behind a little as to not interrupt Lela.</p><br/><p> Lela looked at Hilda's appearance and had a triumphant expression.</p><br/><p> What on earth are you fighting for, Lela?</p><br/><p> When we were walking for a while, a great rat appeared.</p><br/><p> I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011but it was considerably weak.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, a great rat!\u300d</p><br/><p> With Aya's shout\u2015</p><br/><p> the great rat fled.</p><br/><p>\u300cThough we have come to the dungeon with so much effort, there is no monster at all.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems Aya wanted to run wild so bad.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it's a forked road. What should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p> As Elena said, other than the straight line passage, there was also a passage stretching to the right.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince there seems to be a trap straight ahead, let's head to the right.\u300d</p><br/><p> However, after advancing to the right for a while,</p><br/><p> it turned into a crossroad this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we do, Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment, I'll check the map with magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow can you do such a thing, Seiji?\u300d</p><br/><p> It will be known to Lela but it can't be helped now that we are adventuring together.</p><br/><p> When I switched the magic of the map to display the\u300estructure\u300f,</p><br/><p> it seems that it had become a sensing system that paints the places I passed through one after another.</p><br/><p> From there, whilst displaying the direction we have gone,</p><br/><p> we advanced to sense and fill up the places that haven't been explored yet.</p><br/><p> When I saw the map being filled up,</p><br/><p> sensing passages that spread out in all directions, leading to various rooms of all sizes.</p><br/><p> We also tried entering a room but</p><br/><p> there were great rats inside and they attacked without running away.</p><br/><p> However, in that place where we were attacked by great rats,</p><br/><p> Aya, Elena, and Lela killed them one after another.</p><br/><p> Hilda dismantles the great rats which they have defeated</p><br/><p> and sends them to me.</p><br/><p> Such Hilda is like a dog, so cute.</p><br/><p> As we were checking some rooms and fighting against great rats,</p><br/><p> we found 1 red and 1 blue great rats on the way.</p><br/><p> So this is a monster with a different color.</p><br/><p> As expected, the only difference were the colors and being slightly stronger but\u2015</p><br/><p> since they were only great rats, we were able to safely defeat them.</p><br/><p> And then, Hilda dismantled them and seemed to have found the magic stones.</p><br/><p> She brought them to me happily.</p><br/><p> When appraised, they were\u3010magic stone of ignition\u3011and\u3010magic stone of refrigeration\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, they are\u3010magic stone of ignition\u3011and\u3010magic stone of refrigeration\u3011but are these ones alright to make up for the shortage of magic stones?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes but speaking of wants, I want even rarer ones.</p><br/><p> They are also useful enough though.</p><br/><p> Let's collect rapidly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu!\u300d</p><br/><p> When we hasten the collection of magic stones for a while,</p><br/><p> we finally found the stairs to go up.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I found the stairs!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, Aya!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? What's wrong, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere's something!\u300d</p><br/><p> At the same time I said so,</p><br/><p> a large amount of great rats appeared to protect the stairs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

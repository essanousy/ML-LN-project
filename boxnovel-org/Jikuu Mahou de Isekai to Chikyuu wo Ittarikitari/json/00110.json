That place is probably those guys\u2019 campground.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I also found out that one portion of the goblins are approaching this direction. They are probably going to watch how things will play out in this place.</p><br/><p>The other one was the\u300eDemon army\u300f.</p><br/><p>I found out that the army is about 10, 000, the same as the Aristocracy union\u2019s army and is encamped in the western central plain.</p><br/><p>The other troops of the Aristocracy Union had already arrived at the frontline\u2019s encampment, nearly 15, 000 soldiers and adventurers jostled each other.</p><br/><p>There were shrewd merchants doing business, guild branches were established and military brothel was built.

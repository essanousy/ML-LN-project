Lela, how's it going?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji! You've come.\u300d</p><br/><p> Since Lela held out her hand, I shook her hand normally.</p><br/><p> However, no matter how much time passes, Lela isn't releasing my hand that she grasped.</p><br/><p> What does she want?</p><br/><p> Then\u2015</p><br/><p>*Pashi!*</p><br/><p> Aya chopped my hand from the side!</p><br/><p> With that momentum, the hand which was shaking hands with Lela came off.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you do that for, Aya!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing in particular!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Chopping your brother's hand without any particular reason, huh!?</p><br/><p> I don't get what the heck is that supposed to mean!</p><br/><p> For some reason, Aya and Lela are glaring at each other.</p><br/><p> Why are these two people at daggers drawn?</p><br/><p> Is it because I've been chopped?</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst of all, Lela, have you got any new information about the devil-kin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI haven't got any new information in particular.</p><br/><p> Since every town strengthened their vigilance, they can't attack readily.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that's good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd, something good has been completed.\u300d</p><br/><p> The thing that Lela showed proudly</p><br/><p> was something like a wooden cup.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the twin-magic-stone-style string phone!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That's right...why did you speak ahead.</p><br/><p> Even though I was going to surprise......\u300d</p><br/><p> I knew of it since I was also there in the actual creation site.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere is it going to be distributed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has been decided that the feudal lord of each town will have one each.\u300d</p><br/><p> That's good, the communication between each towns will be simplified with this.</p><br/><p> It may also be possible to start a telegram service before long.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will be noon soon, are you going to have lunch?</p><br/><p> I'll have it ready.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have a slightly minor errand.</p><br/><p> Please treat Aya and the others to lunch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?</p><br/><p> Are you perhaps going to a place of another woman?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, the destination has a woman as well......\u300d</p><br/><p> Huh?</p><br/><p> Why are you trying to bite off your handkerchief, Lela?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please take care of the rest.\u300d</p><br/><p> I sensed danger which I didn't understand well so I teleported to the dragon-kin's village to escape.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're the human who the Elder-sama was talking about, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p> The gatekeeper stared at me scrutinizingly.</p><br/><p> I don't have such a hobby.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell good, you may pass.</p><br/><p> Don't cause any trouble in the village.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Having managed to get in into the village, I rushed toward Elder-sama's place.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cHello.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou came.\u300d</p><br/><p> Gadol greeted me.</p><br/><p> Then, upon entering Elder-sama's house\u2015</p><br/><p> there was a crowd of men gathered and everyone glared at me simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-, Hello.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's somewhat an awfully away feeling.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry, but I have something necessary to discuss with everyone fast.</p><br/><p> Can you wait a little?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs something wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, the people who had gone out to hunt beside Gadol, Halva, and some people,</p><br/><p> were attacked by the devil-kin, you see.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elder-sama said so calmly,</p><br/><p> but the surrounding men were feverish as if they were going to start a yakuza dispute.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait a moment,</p><br/><p> can you tell me about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut this is a dragon-kin's problem.</p><br/><p> It has nothing to do with you, has it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHumans and demon-kind have also been attacked by the devil-kin.</p><br/><p> And I also happened to be present in both actual place.</p><br/><p> Would you like to exchange information?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?</p><br/><p> So it's not just us who have been attacked!\u300d</p><br/><p> Perhaps they have mistaken you for humans and attacked, but......</p><br/><p> I won't say that.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I put their stories together\u2015</p><br/><p>\u30fbThose who had gone out to hunt had been attacked in their sleep.</p><br/><p>\u30fbSeveral people who were injured managed to arrive at the village after a struggle.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThere's a lot of people who has gotten missing.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThose who suffered injuries have no chance to survive because of the poison.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment!</p><br/><p> Since I have several\u3010Poison healing potion\u3011here, please use them to treat those people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally!?</p><br/><p> That saved us!\u300d</p><br/><p> I handed out about 10\u3010Poison healing potion\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this enough?</p><br/><p> Because I will make them here at this place if it's not enough.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's alright, thanks.\u300d</p><br/><p> After receiving the\u3010Poison healing potions\u3011, Elder-sama's grandchild went to deliver them toward the injured people in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-dono, we kept being indebted to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it's nothing.\u300d</p><br/><p> They said that the good you do for others is a good you do for yourself.</p><br/><p> It's particularly not because Elder-sama's grandchild is cute, okay?</p><br/><p> The information I provided was the devil-kin uses varieties of magic stones,</p><br/><p> and discussed about the possibility of the village being attacked by monsters controlled by the devil-kin.</p><br/><p> The village was located on top of a cliff so if normal monsters were to attack, they wouldn't be able to come, but if the devil-kin were to use bird-like monsters that fly into the sky, they would not be restricted.</p><br/><p> The village people had decided to prepare\u300ebows\u300fand the like in preparation for that kind of monster.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> It was then when the devil-kin countermeasure meeting was about to end.</p><br/><p> Leaning on the shoulder of another, one of the injured people went inside Elder-sama's house with desperate look.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, There's something I have to report!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou've woken up!</p><br/><p> But, you went here to report in spite of your injury!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!</p><br/><p> A large number of devil-kin which appeared from the\u300ePine cave\u300fhas been sighted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300ePine cave\u300f!?</p><br/><p> Err, the devil-kin appeared from such a small cave?</p><br/><p> How many?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere were at least 100 or more.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStupid!</p><br/><p> It\u2019s impossible for such a small cave to contain so much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, we certainly saw it.\u300d</p><br/><p> When he reported up to there\u2015</p><br/><p> that injured person fainted.</p><br/><p>\u300cTreat him quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p> He was urgently transported by the men who were at that place.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, is there something in that cave??\u300d</p><br/><p> Everyone has been lost in thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, but what is the\u300ePine cave\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's a cave which was opened from a large rock that stood alone in the forest,</p><br/><p> and the people who had gone out to hunt sometimes used it for camping.</p><br/><p> The inside of the cave is only wide enough for about 10 people to enter.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps there's a hidden passage?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has been frequently used since long ago,</p><br/><p> there's nothing there other than a strange stone statue.\u300d</p><br/><p> Strange stone statue, huh~.</p><br/><p> It's suspicious......</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere is it located?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGadol, tell me its location.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Led by Gadol, I went out of Elder-sama's house.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cThe large rock which can be seen over there is the\u300ePine cave\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p> It could be seen from the front of Elder-sama's house!</p><br/><p> In the direction which Gadol was pointing at, a large rock was visible.</p><br/><p> Huh?</p><br/><p> That area was the place where I should have searched around yesterday.</p><br/><p> If there was a hidden passage, or a hidden room, and the devil-kins were there\u2015</p><br/><p> I should have been able to confirm it in the map.</p><br/><p> Why was there no reaction in the map?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

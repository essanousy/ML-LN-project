Oi.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's no good, she is absent-minded.</p><br/><p> Hilda, who was dazed for a while, finally recovered and slowly turned around\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, err, is this place by any chance,\u300eGod's country\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p> Why will it be so?</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, this country is called Japan. This is the country where Aya and I were born and raised.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, although I can't understand Hilda-chan's words, what should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that's right.\u300d</p><br/><p> I handed the replicate\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition +2\u3011to Elena and the common\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011to Hilda.</p><br/><p> I'll make another two later so each person can have one.</p><br/><p> Thanks to the magic stone, Elena is frolic as she can now read most of the kanjis.</p><br/><p> I understand that you're glad, now that you can read books but you must not take out so many books~.</p><br/><p> Hilda could not grasp the situation yet and was still dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, I wonder if I should cook dinner now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWaitt!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, Aya?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTake a bath before you do.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe smell! The smell will permeate the rice!\u300d</p><br/><p> How cruel.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> My sexy bathing scene had been completely cut,</p><br/><p> the three girls were now bathing peacefully and their voices producing kyakya ufufu could be heard.</p><br/><p> I, with such happy voices as BGM in return, is in the midst of dinner preparations.</p><br/><p> I've been considerably troubled but decided on a hamburger as the menu.</p><br/><p> It's Hilda's first Japanese meal.</p><br/><p> Since I loved hamburger when I was in Hilda's age, Hilda will surely be glad as well.</p><br/><p> And since it's especially Japan, it's\u300erice\u300frather than\u300ebread\u300f.</p><br/><p> When the preparation of dinner was over, the three people, who were playing in the bath, came out.</p><br/><p> Hilda is wearing my T-shirt for some reason.</p><br/><p> But, I can't believe what's happening!</p><br/><p> It should be short sleeves but it has become mid sleeves,</p><br/><p> the shirttail has been prolonged into a one-piece dress,</p><br/><p> the chest has been widely flared and something can be naturally caught in a glimpse.</p><br/><p> This is bad!</p><br/><p> When I'm being extremely wary of the critical situation\u2015</p><br/><p> Aya looked at me with eyes as if looking at a trash.</p><br/><p> No, I'm just......</p><br/><p> Anyhow, the dinner was ready and the four of us sat around the table.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cItadakimasu.\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> The three of us began to eat dinner but Hilda became stiff not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p> When she was eating dinner at Lela's, it was also like this. I wonder if she wasn't used to it yet?</p><br/><p> Aya and Elena sit on the opposite side, I have no choice but to do something here, huh.</p><br/><p> I served Hilda a bite of hamburger with a fork,</p><br/><p> and brought the meat with lots of juices close to Hilda's cute lips.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, ah~n.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes! A-, Ahn.\u300d</p><br/><p> I put the hamburger in Hilda's mouth,</p><br/><p> with her eyes wide open, Hilda immediately chewed whilst holding her cheeks with both hands.</p><br/><p> Your cheeks might drop, mightn't it?</p><br/><p> When she swallowed the bite with a *gulp*, she had been dazed for a while,</p><br/><p> and I suddenly noticed that she was now staring at the hamburger on the plate.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it delicious?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda silently nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u300cTry to eat rice too, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cR-, Rice?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe white one next to it. Try eating it with a spoon.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> This time, Hilda scooped a mouthful of rice with a spoon by herself and put it into her mouth.</p><br/><p> It's a common white rice but with nori[1] and egg\u300efurikake[2]\u300fsprinkled over it.</p><br/><p> When I was Hilda's age, I liked\u300efurikake\u300fvery much.</p><br/><p> Hilda finally ate with acquiescence\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbshe seemed to understand a fact</p><br/><p> and started eating the mug of consomme soup and the small salad dish with great relish.</p><br/><p> I can finally have my own meal. When I thought so\u2015</p><br/><p> Hilda finished eating most of her share, loathing to part with the few remaining of her dinner.</p><br/><p> There's about a mouthful of the hamburger and rice left.</p><br/><p> I took Hilda's plate of hamburger and rice away forcefully.</p><br/><p> Hilda was surprised at the sudden situation,</p><br/><p> regretting why she hadn't eaten immediately.</p><br/><p> Well, I'll only serve her a\u300esecond helping\u300f.</p><br/><p> I've placed a hamburger and another smaller but meaty piece.</p><br/><p> As well as rice with somewhat larger quantity of furikake than earlier and returned it to Hilda.</p><br/><p> The face full of despair has completely changed into face wrapped in joy.</p><br/><p> Hilda ate up the\u300esecond helping\u300fin no time with great relish.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there any dessert, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is.\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, it's ready-made though.</p><br/><p> I took out a pudding which can be served in a dish with one touch,</p><br/><p> decorated it with canned fruit and whipped cream and carried it to the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's a pudding! Yehey~!\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda ate up the pudding \u00e0 la mode in no time.</p><br/><p>\u300cWas it delicious?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> There's not even a pudding \u00e0 la mode when I turned 30.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, eat mine as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I give the pudding to Hilda\u2015</p><br/><p> Aya is looking this way wistfully.</p><br/><p> When she was about to say\u300cthat's good~\u300dlike usual\u2015</p><br/><p> Aya managed to read the mood.</p><br/><p> It seems she have grown up a little.</p><br/><p>[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori</p><br/><p>[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furikake</p><br/>\n</div>"}

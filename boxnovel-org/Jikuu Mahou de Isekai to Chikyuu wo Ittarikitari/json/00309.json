Why didn\u2019t you climb up immediately!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A small girl, who looks like a high-school student, was floating.</p><br/><p>Although I say small, it\u2019s not the age, but the size.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you think I am? \u300d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t get it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s because the [Appraisal] isn\u2019t working.</p><br/><p>When I tried to use [Appraisal], the magic failed.</p><br/><p>The shield that the Devil race had has also obstructed the magic, but this time, it seems to be different again.</p><br/><p>It seems like the [Appraisal] magic itself is not invoking for some reason.</p><br/><p>And then, from this fellow, I sense some kind of pressure for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen at the extent that the [Appraisal] doesn\u2019t work, it pathetically makes you tremble, doesn\u2019t it!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Shit, the information has been seen through.</p><br/><p>Just what the heck is this girl!</p><br/><p>\u300cIf the girls waiting down below see the current you, they may feel disillusioned.\u300d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re even aware of Aya and the others!?</p><br/><p>Did expressly leaving them down below backfire!?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Maruyama Seiji-kun of \u25cb\u25cb corporation.\u300d</p><br/><p>What did you say!?</p><br/><p>To even know such a thing, how!?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, enough messing around\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Is she coming!?</p><br/><p>Boss fight!?</p><br/><p>\u300cA quiz! Who am I?\u300d</p><br/><p>Q-, Quiz!?</p><br/><p>Whatever, let\u2019s take a guess.</p><br/><p>There were several hints from our conversation so far.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are\u2026\u2026 [Information Magic]\u2019s Spirit, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA big check!!2 How did you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere are eight towns in this country. One in each cardinal and ordinal directions respectively.</p><br/><p>There are mana crystals of attribute magic in the cardinal directions and in the three among the towns in the ordinal directions, there are mana crystals of non-attribute magic.</p><br/><p>And the only mana crystal unconfirmed\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>is just the Ikebu town\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Then, the mana crystal that I haven\u2019t found yet among the magics that I know is just the [Information Magic]\u2019s.</p><br/><p>From the things I\u2019ve mentioned above, I\u2019ve inferred that there\u2019s a mana crystal of Information Magic in Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>And if there\u2019s a mana crystal in Ikebu town\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>That place, a place where no one has ever reached before, there\u2019s only this top floor of the [Tower of Sunrise].</p><br/><p>And in there, was an existence, who knew all of my information, there\u2019s no one like that except the [Information Magic]\u2019s Spirit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCheck, check, big check\u30fc\u30fc!! Amazing, precisely as I expected, the information analysis ability is cut above the rest!\u300d</p><br/><p>When the Spirit said so, that pressure of sort enveloping the place vanished.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? The terror of not knowing what kind of person your opponent is, did you understand?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect it, although this time\u2019s [Appraisal] didn\u2019t work, such a situation where the [Appraisal] is being used by the opponent, it\u2019s so scary.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right~. Did you understand the dreadfulness of [Information Magic]?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there\u2019s an understanding person, it\u2019s such a happy thing~. The people of this world don\u2019t understand the dreadfulness of something called [Information Magic] that much, you know~? Same goes with my fellow Spirits, too and there\u2019s even guy, who said I\u2019m useless~.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, I was being tested if I understood the value of information, huh.</p><br/><p>Being an SE isn\u2019t just for show!</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s do a proper self-introduction. I\u2019m\u2026\u2026[Magical Girl Oracle-chan]&lt;3!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a lie!\u300d</p><br/><p>I reflexively tsukkomi\u2019ed with the fastest speed.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not a lie~. I can use magic~, and I\u2019m a girl~, and my name is [Oracle]! See? It\u2019s [Magical Girl Oracle-chan], right?\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a somewhat troublesome Spirit~.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, uh, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask [Oracle-chan-san], but is it okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine~. It\u2019s that black thing on Yurie-san\u2019s thigh, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, as expected of Information Magic\u2019s Spirit, you know everything, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know everything, you know~.\u300d</p><br/><p>If not everything, she\u2019ll probably say that she knows every nook and cranny, won\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, now, more importantly, form a [Spirit Contract] with me.\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s somehow a bit of reluctance, but oh well, I\u2019ll be able to strengthen [Information Magic].</p><br/><p>When Oracle-chan-san kisses my forehead\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e[Information Magic] has become level 6.\u300f</p><br/><p>the so-called announcement was heard.</p><br/><p>Yes, I did it!</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to visit the mana crystal next, but is it okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe mana crystal is this way.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Oracle-chan-san gently flew and approached a wall, the entire wall split into left and right, exposing a mana crystal shining in golden color.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, go on.\u300d</p><br/><p>Urged on, when I touched the mana crystal\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eInformation Magic was updated to the latest version.</p><br/><p>[Vigilance] updated.</p><br/><p>Perception range was expanded.</p><br/><p>Opponents causing danger will now be automatically [Appraised].</p><br/><p>[Map] updated.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s now possible to import information if it\u2019s an authentic map.</p><br/><p>[Appraisal] updated.</p><br/><p>It won\u2019t be sensed with magic power perception anymore.</p><br/><p>Guilt was added to the read information.</p><br/><p>[Concealment] updated.</p><br/><p>It now blocks tracking by means of magic.</p><br/><p>[Tracking] updated.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s now possible to remotely control the beacons.</p><br/><p>[Language Acquisition] updated.</p><br/><p>Languages are now acquired automatically.</p><br/><p>[Increase Skill Mastery Rate] updated.</p><br/><p>Increase rate has increased.</p><br/><p>[Summon Oracle] was added.\u300f</p><br/><p>Ohh!</p><br/><p>Amazing, there\u2019s like a lot of things!</p><br/><p>First is the [Map], there are lots of [authentic map] on Earth.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it possible to import all the information of Google Map!?</p><br/><p>Next is tracking.</p><br/><p>Moving the beacon?</p><br/><p>When I tried it for a bit, it seems that it can be controlled like a drone.</p><br/><p>Its travelling speed is slow, but this is quite convenient!!</p><br/><p>Finally, it\u2019s [Summon Oracle].</p><br/><p>\u300cOracle-chan-san?

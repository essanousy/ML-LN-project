I\u2019m sorry we have nothing else to offer you\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe children would be delighted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat said, where could we sleep?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf it\u2019s okay, please use the bed I am using.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no, we can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re ill so you have to sleep properly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUm, Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan\u2019t you take out my bed here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, we did bring along Elena\u2019s bed.\u300d</p><br/><p> Everyone had a \u300c?\u300d appear above their head. Getting Aria-san and the children to move to the side, the large bed from Elena\u2019s room appeared in the centre of the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cWooowww! Magic!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, what a big bed\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> The children ran around in excitement with the appearance of the huge bed.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this size, can\u2019t Aria-san, Elena and all the children sleep on it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell yes, however, what about you, Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll borrow Aria-san\u2019s bed and use that instead.\u300d</p><br/><p> We ended up spending the night in the church, tucking the excited children into Elena\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><br/><p> When I woke up the next morning, Aria-san had completely recovered.</p><br/><p> Because Aria-san had only just recovered, we told her not to get out of bed and decided to help with the chores instead.</p><br/><p> Miinya went out to buy more bread, Elena and the children did the cleaning and washing, and I was in charge of cooking breakfast, however I was in a bit of trouble with my remaining ingredients. There were cup noodles, instant noodles, canned food, and plastic-wrapped food, the kind of things that were for me alone.</p><br/><p> Without much choice, I used \u3010Lettuce\u3011, \u3010Tomato\u3011 and other vegetables to make some \u3010Salad\u3011. The salad dressing is my favourite \u3010Sesame Dressing\u3011.</p><br/><p> After that, I divided my only box of \u3010Cereal\u3011 for the number of people we had. We would pour the \u3010Milk\u3011 in when we eat.</p><br/><p> After Miinya came back with the bread she bought, Aria-san called everyone to eat breakfast.</p><br/><p> Aria-san and Elena seemed to like my salad, eating it with satisfaction.</p><br/><p> The children seemed to like the \u3010Cereal\u3011, or rather, the\u3010Milk\u3011, eating it along with bread pieces that were dipped in milk.</p><br/><p> When we finished breakfast, I told everyone that it\u2019s time for us to go home.</p><br/><p>\u300cEeeh!? Onii-san is leaving?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease stay!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can live here with us too!\u300d</p><br/><p> The children cried out unanimously.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe next time I drop by, I\u2019ll bring more delicious food. Until then, be a good child and help out Aria-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026 Okay\u2026 but, you have to come again! It\u2019s a promise!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSure, it\u2019s a promise! Also, Aria-san. With this, please give the children something good to eat.\u300d</p><br/><p> I handed over a 100 Aurum gold coin to Aria-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cI really can\u2019t accept this much money!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis money is for the children. You don\u2019t want them to feel hungry again, do you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand. Thank you very much. Everything you\u2019ve done, I will never be able to forget your kindness.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s fine if you remember until the next time we come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay!\u300d</p><br/><p> We could have actually used \u3010Teleportation\u3011 then and there, but I didn\u2019t want to spoil the somber farewells so we walked out of the church while we waved our goodbye to Aria-san and the children.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe children were cute weren\u2019t they?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, the next time we come, we\u2019ll have to bring a lot of delicious food.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah!\u300d</p><br/><p> After awhile, we found a deserted back alley. Because it\u2019s best that not many people witness \u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s use \u3010Teleportation\u3011 to go to my world. Hold on to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena embraced me.</p><br/><p> It\u2019s enough to hold hands, but why the hugging!</p><br/><p> Well, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not happy.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Teleportation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> I imagined the entryway of my home and invoked \u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

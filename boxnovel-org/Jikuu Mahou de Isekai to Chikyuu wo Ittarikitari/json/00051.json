I endured the acute pain that ran through my right hand and grasped the spear tightly with my left hand and tried to break it free from his grip.</p><br/><p>Gadol isn\u2019t saying a word for some reason, I struggled to make the spear move somehow.</p><br/><p>Shit! A pain transmitted to my right hand from the spear!!</p><br/><p>If you look closely, this was the spear with grim ominous aura which inflicted serious injury to Halva, this spear wasn\u2019t from the competition.</p><br/><p>It was brought in from somewhere! That explains as to why it penetrated through my right hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cSe-, Seiji-sama!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGet away Elena, it\u2019s dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, but, your hand was injured\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry about that!

Looking at Gadol, his condition is a bit strange. His eyes aren\u2019t focus and doesn\u2019t have life. Is he unconscious by any chance?</p><br/><p>\u300cParticipant Gadol, the match is already over. Please put down your weapon.\u300d</p><br/><p>The referee is trying to stop Gadol but Gadol doesn\u2019t react at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s useless, Gadol has lost his sanity.

We are already outside the castle!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena looked at our surrounding excitedly. The nearby people were surprised from us suddenly appearing.</p><br/><p> I took Elena\u2019s hand and quickly walked towards the main street.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, why are we in a hurry?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince we\u2019re gaining a lot of attention.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, because I was kidnapped we should not be standing out.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, right.\u300d</p><br/><p> For some reason, Elena began to giggle.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm? What\u2019s so funny?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, for Seiji-sama to kidnap me. It\u2019s somewhat amusing\u2026 giggle\u300d</p><br/><p> Seeing Elena giggling like that, I also couldn\u2019t help find our situation amusing.</p><br/><p> Elena and I giggled as we walked down the main street holding hands.</p><br/><p> Many people passed through the main street. Occasionally I spotted some cat-eared people mixed in with the crowd. As expected, so there are those kind of races too~</p><br/><p>\u300cOh right! We have to search for an inn!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed, I nearly forgot about it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena do you know where we can find an inn?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apologies, I do not know. Ah, I\u2019ll ask someone about it.\u300d</p><br/><p> Saying that, Elena asked the oba-san selling vegetables at a stall of the location of the inn. The stall\u2019s oba-san was taken aback by Elena\u2019s refined speech and manners.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe inn seems to be over that way.\u300d</p><br/><p> Guided by Elena, we headed to the inn.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis looks to be the inn.\u300d</p><br/><p> When we both arrived at the inn, I noticed a serious matter.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t have any money from this country. Elena, how much money do you have?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apologies, I do not have any money as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a problem\u2026 is there anywhere we can sell something for money?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will go ask someone.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elina suddenly spoke to a nearby oji-san, questioning him.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere seems to be a merchant guild that way.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, thanks for all of this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot at all.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena smiled at me sweetly and guided me to the merchant guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis looks to be the merchant guild.\u300d</p><br/><p> This place somewhat seemed like a bank made out of wood. For now let\u2019s enter.</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome! What kind of business do you have here today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI heard this place purchases goods, is that correct?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, please register first.\u300d</p><br/><p> We were guided to the registration window by the clerk.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey there, welcome to the merchant guild. Registration for the guild right? Please fill in this form here\u300d</p><br/><p> The busty onee-san greeted me with a business smile. After registering, I inquired about what they were buying.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt the moment, since we\u2019re lacking \u3010Salt\u3011, we\u2019ll buy it at a high price if you have any.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Salt\u3011? In that case, I do have some.\u300d</p><br/><p> When the receptionist onee-san wasn\u2019t looking, I took out the \u3010Salt\u3011 I bought from the supermarket out of my Inventory and placed it on the counter.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-this is \u3010Salt\u3011!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Huh? Was there a problem?</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease excuse me, please wait a moment as I need to call for an \u3010Appraiser\u3011\u300d</p><br/><p> The busty onee-san ran off to call someone.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there anything weird with this\u3010Salt\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p> I asked Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis \u3010Salt\u3011 is pure white isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe \u3010Salt\u3011 in this country isn\u2019t white?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe \u3010Salt\u3011 I have seen is a bit more grayish and more coarse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh I see, they normally use rock salt here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlso, this pouch is very beautiful and transparent! There are also magic runes drawn on it. What kind of pouch is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I see, there isn\u2019t any plastic here. Also, they aren\u2019t magic runes. They are the characters of my country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300ePlastic\u300f\u2026? What kind of animal\u2026 is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt isn\u2019t an animal, rather it\u2019s a petroleum product. Though I don\u2019t know how to make it yet .\u300d</p><br/><p> When we were talking, the receptionist onee-san came back with person who seemed like her superior.</p><br/><p>\u300cTh-this is\u3010Salt\u3011!? P-please excuse me! Since I will need to cast \u3010Appraisal\u3011 on it, can you put a little bit on this small dish.?\u300d</p><br/><p> I opened a hole on the edge of the plastic, pouring a little bit of \u3010Salt\u3011 onto the small dish.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u25cb\u25b3\u25c7\u00d7\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb \u3010Appraisal\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> Oh, this magic again.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-this, S Rank!?\u300d</p><br/><p> \u3010Appraiser\u3011-san fell down in surprise. Elena and I exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\u300cP-please excuse us. S-since this is S Rank \u3010Salt\u3011, we are unable to purchase this large amount right now.\u300d</p><br/><p> \u3010Appraiser\u3011-san took out a small vial.</p><br/><p>\u300cF-For filling this vial, how about we purchase it for 10,000 Aurums?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen let\u2019s go with that please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay. Please excuse me, I\u2019ll be taking the amount.\u300d</p><br/><p> \u3010Appraiser\u3011-san took out a small spoon and began to transfer the\u3010Salt\u3011 to the vial with his trembling hands.</p><br/><p> \u3010Appraiser\u3011-san was drenched in cold sweat after finishing the extremely stressful work.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere is the 10,000 Aurums. Please confirm the amount.\u300d</p><br/><p> The pouch we received contained 100 gold coins. The gold coin was about the size of a gold medal with \u300e100\u300f stamped on it. Though I don\u2019t know exactly how much 1 Aurum is worth, I wonder if I can use this 100 Aurum gold coin in a small store.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, could I get 1 gold coin in a smaller denomination?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> I exchanged one \u300e100\u300f Aurum gold coin for 9 silver coins with \u300e10\u300f stamped on it and 10 copper coins with \u300e1\u300f stamped on it.</p><br/><p> Having received this much money by selling just a little \u3010Salt\u3011, I left the merchant guild with a pleased face.</p><br/><p> When I left the guild, all the guild staff lined up and greeted me off. I know this is the guild\u2019s service, but isn\u2019t this overdoing it?</p><br/><p> Having left the merchant guild, it\u2019s time for me to head to the inn! My \u3010Vigilance\u3011 magic suddenly reacted and a map appeared. A \u300eYellow Dot\u300f was displayed on the map.</p><br/><p>Hm? \u300eYellow Dot\u300f?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

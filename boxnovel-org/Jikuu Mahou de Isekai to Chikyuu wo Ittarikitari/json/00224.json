That's a top secret request.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever......</p><br/><p> If it's a wooden cup, the vibration of the voice doesn't reach the twin magic stones, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cV-, Voice!? Vibration??</p><br/><p> Did you by any chance understand what this magic tool is made for?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn't this a magic tool to speak with a distant person?</p><br/><p> Wasn't it requested by Kiseri-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Why do you know that?\u300d</p><br/><p> It's like that after all, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn't you see the paper cup prototype in Kiseri-san's place?</p><br/><p> It is I who made that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Manager-san sidles up to me with bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cI can't make it successfully no matter what.</p><br/><p> Tell me its problems.\u300d</p><br/><p> Somehow or other, although it was requested, it seems she couldn't make it successfully and have gotten impatient.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe materials are no good with wood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, there's no such high quality paper like that of the prototype,</p><br/><p> and there is nothing that can make a cup with paper.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about a monster's leather?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, there's a monster's leather, but......</p><br/><p> It's also impossible to make a cup with leather.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's not necessary to make the whole cup with leather,</p><br/><p> it's fine to only make the bottom with leather and the rest with wood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so the material of the bottom of the cup is important.\u300d</p><br/><p> Manager-san began to violently smash the bottom of the wooden cup with a hammer.</p><br/><p> It was quite bold.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, when you attach the leather to it, it's better to stretch it out so that it will not loosen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> A leather had been attached to the wooden cup which had a hole opened up at the bottom, and then the magic stone was attached to the center of the leather part using some kind of an adhesive.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this now good with this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think that it's fine.\u300d</p><br/><p> When we try to perform an operational testing......</p><br/><p> on top of being durable, the sound is very audible and clearer than the paper cup version.</p><br/><p> This is good.</p><br/><p>\u300cYey! It's a success!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Manager-san was so pleased that she took my hand and jumped up and down with *pyon pyon*.</p><br/><p> This person has a quite cute side too.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhehe~. There will be a large profit with this!\u300d</p><br/><p> This person has a quite low-life side too.</p><br/><p>\u300cManager-san, do you know the matter of the devil-kin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, they seem to be attacking humans' towns.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUntil that matter is settled, please don't sell this magic tool to the general public.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN?</p><br/><p> Oh, I see!</p><br/><p> It's going to be exploited if the devil-kin get their hands on this!\u300d</p><br/><p> Did you just notice it now?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it can't be helped.</p><br/><p> Until then, the twin magic stones......</p><br/><p> are going to be bought up...guhehe.\u300d</p><br/><p> Low-life, beyond low-life!!</p><br/><p> Since the creation of the staff will take about five days,</p><br/><p> we entrusted the magic stone to her and left the weapon shop.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Since I will leave for\u300eShinaga town\u300fwhich is going to be the last destination,</p><br/><p> I had everyone to wait in Suga town,</p><br/><p> and ran eastwards from where we fought against the devil-kin with\u3010Lightning flash\u3011.</p><br/><p> After running for about an hour, the\u300eShinaga town\u300fcame into sight.</p><br/><p> Since everyone would be going to enter the town together, I went back to Suga town at once and went back with everyone using\u3010teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cEhh, so that place over there is the\u300eShinaga town\u300f, huh~.</p><br/><p> N?</p><br/><p> Somehow, smoke is rising up...is it all right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it's true.\u300d</p><br/><p> Although I didn't notice it until Aya said it,</p><br/><p> smoke rises up at many places of the town.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-onii-chan, those are blacksmith's smokes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Do you know this town, Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I'm from this town.\u300d</p><br/><p> Ehh, so Hilda is from this town, huh.</p><br/><p> However, there's a lot of smoke rising up,</p><br/><p> this town has a lot of blacksmith.</p><br/><p> When we arrived at the entrance of the town, we were called to a halt by the guard soldier.</p><br/><p> For the guard to prevent the infiltration of the devil-kin, he had performed a physical examination.</p><br/><p> Oi, stupid. Don't touch a strange place!</p><br/><p> Oh, by the way, it's fine since a female soldier was in charge in the girls' physical examination.</p><br/><p> There was really a lot of blacksmiths in\u300eShinaga town\u300f.</p><br/><p> The shops which lined up in the main street, about one to two buildings was a blacksmith.</p><br/><p> Well, since we had no business in the blacksmith,</p><br/><p> we asked the passersby the location of the\u3010Mana crystal of Fire\u3011and the\u3010Mana crystal of Light\u3011and rushed toward the place.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we arrived at the location of the\u3010Mana crystal of Fire\u3011,</p><br/><p> some kind of a construction work was being carried out.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, we'd like to visit the\u3010Mana crystal of Fire\u3011but......\u300d</p><br/><p> I tried to talk to the guards.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's prohibited to visit for now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? Why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to be a devil-kin countermeasure.</p><br/><p> It's to prevent the\u3010Fire magic\u3011from being exploited by the devil-kin.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing......</p><br/><p> We have come here with so much trouble.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, the visit that is allowed now......\u300d</p><br/><p> Is there any condition?</p><br/><p>\u300cseems to be those who can produce fire using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Then, the only ones who can visit are those who can use\u3010Fire magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it has been decided like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, it's entirely insignificant, isn't it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it seems so.\u300d</p><br/><p> Umu, what to do.....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

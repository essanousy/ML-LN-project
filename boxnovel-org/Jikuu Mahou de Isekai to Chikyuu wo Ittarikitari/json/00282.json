Let\u2019s ride this cloud.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you serious!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda walk above the clouds happily.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re just like angels.</p><br/><p>And then, Aya, who seems to be similarly happy, is frolicking.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s just like a child.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it\u2019s dangerous, don\u2019t go too far to the edge.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY~es.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is it really alright?</p><br/><p>\u300cNee, onii-chan. If we fall from here, where do you think we\u2019ll fall??</p><br/><p>The lower floor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know, would you like to test it out for a bit?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWai-, onii-chan, what do you want to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, to find out like you said.\u300d</p><br/><p>I went to the very edge of the clouds while watching my steps and threw a stone, which I took from the inventory, below.</p><br/><p>The stone dropped far off to the bottom and quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe stone has disappeared.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, who came next to me before I knew it, mutters so.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems like it has a reasonable altitude and since we don\u2019t know what happened after it disappeared either, let\u2019s be thoroughly careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY~es.\u300d\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When we, as much as possible, traveled along the center of the rather fluffy road of clouds\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>the sky gradually worsened.</p><br/><p>\u300cA lot of clouds appeared, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, clouds that were clearly different from the clouds under our feet began to engulf the surroundings with *moku moku*.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone be careful, there\u2019s a reaction of a monster!\u300d</p><br/><p>At the same time as I said so,</p><br/><p>a part of the cloud suddenly projected towards us.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya slashed the projecting cloud with a knife.</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019s like grasping a cloud. The opponent is nothing but cloud!</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya\u2019s knife passed through the cloud and slashed the air.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it seems to be a monster called\u300eThunderhead[1]\u300f.</p><br/><p>Its form seems to be made of clouds.</p><br/><p>\u300cPhysical attacks doesn\u2019t seem to be effective. Attack it using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya attacks using Wind Magic.</p><br/><p>Elena creates a wall of water, defending against the enemy\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Hilda joins in and attacks using flame.</p><br/><p>The most effective was Hilda\u2019s flame.</p><br/><p>When the cloud was scorched by the flame, interestingly, it seemed like it vanished and she was able to easily defeat it.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda played the most active role.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhehe.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I patted her head, Hilda was happily embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, what about me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShouldn\u2019t you try the\u3010Downburst\u3011that you learned a short while ago?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Downburst\u3011? I mean, can you make it fall even though there\u2019s no ground?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t a cloud something caused by an updraft?</p><br/><p>Then, why don\u2019t you do the opposite?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s easier said than done, though~.</p><br/><p>Rather than something called dungeon capture\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>it seems totally like studying.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, what about me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what you did a little while ago is fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince Elena takes the initiative to undertake the defense, the other two people can freely concentrate on the offense.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena was a little fired up again.</p><br/><p>Cutee~.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>After advancing for a while, a group of\u300eThunderheads\u300fappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena\u2019s wall of water defends against the attacks of the Thunderheads.</p><br/><p>Hilda creates several pillars of flame around the thunderheads using that opportunity.</p><br/><p>It seems to be just like a\u300ecage\u300fmade of flame pillars.</p><br/><p>Although they don\u2019t speak, the Thunderheads are frightened by the flame and move about in utter confusion.</p><br/><p>I block the Thunderheads that were trying to escape from the cage using barrier.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, aren\u2019t you going to use Downburst?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m trying to use it now!\u300d</p><br/><p>Using Wind Magic, Aya gathers the air, which was heated by the flame that Hilda created, together above the Thunderheads\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cCompressed, compressed, compressed the wind\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Aya, what are you doing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t talk to me anymore because I\u2019m concentrating!</p><br/><p>Here it goes! DOOOOWN, BUUUUUUURST!!\u300d</p><br/><p>She shouts so like it was some killer move.</p><br/><p>The burning hot air that Aya compressed,</p><br/><p>became a terrible downdraft and directly hit the Thunderheads.</p><br/><p>The Thunderheads were sucked in in order to be swallowed by the downdraft, and then, they dissolved and vanished.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it!! It\u2019s a huge success!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya takes Elena and Hilda\u2019s hands and happily jumps up and down with *pyon pyon*.</p><br/><p>Well, even if you didn\u2019t expressly use such a grandiose magic, it was the end if they were hit by Hilda\u2019s flame just as they were, though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hilda probably wouldn\u2019t mind for the sake of saving Aya\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>What a capable girl. I\u2019ll pat her later.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, there was no enemy that appeared so we advanced above the clouds smoothly</p><br/><p>and along the way, Aya was thinking about various poses when using Downburst; it was so annoying.</p><br/><p>You will fall from the clouds when you walk while doing such a thing!</p><br/><p>After advancing for a while, we were able to find the stairs that leads to the upper floor smoothly.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When we climbed up the stairs, the fifteenth floor was also a sea of clouds.</p><br/><p>However, the landscape we\u2019re on this time seems to be a mountaintop;</p><br/><p>only the mountaintop is sticking out above the sea of clouds, which makes it look like an island.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe view in this floor is also good~.</p><br/><p>The wind is also strong here, though.\u300d</p><br/><p>Right, the wind here is also strong.</p><br/><p>The floors where wind is strong follows after another.</p><br/><p>When I was thinking about such a thing\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama! Over there!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena shouted and pointed towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!</p><br/><p>What appeared together with a gigantic chirp\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>was a super huge bird.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]It seems the author intentionally rearranged the characters. The raw says ;  means cloud while  priest/monk/bald-headed person/monster. It\u2019s supposed to be Thunderhead, a rounded, projecting head of a cumulus cloud, which portends a thunderstorm.</p><br/><p>P.S Please support the author by buying the vol 1 of the LN version. \u2013Link\u2013</p><br/>\n</div>"}

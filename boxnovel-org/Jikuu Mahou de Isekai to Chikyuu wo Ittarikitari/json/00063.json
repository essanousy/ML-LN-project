Those lined-up strange stones from a little while ago was probably something like a calculator.</p><br/><p>The woman took out small potion vials while looking depressed.</p><br/><p>We can\u2019t work on transferring the potions to the vials from where we were talking, so we were shown to the crafting table.</p><br/><p>We were able to transfer the potions to the vials on the table and finally went back to the 3rd reception.</p><br/><p>It was long up to here\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that we had filled the vials with potions, I\u2019d like to sell it please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, well then, place them over here please.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I placed the vials,</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Are these of the same potions? Why did you separate them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, because they have different quality ranging from +1~+3, should I not separated them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, you have\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill, I\u2019m sorry.</p><br/><p>But, because it\u2019s a rule, we have to reappraise them here, will that be alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>The receptionist oniisan put the potion vials on a tray and brought it on the back, he came back after the potions were appraised.</p><br/><p>\u300cCertainly, the quality is as you said.</p><br/><p>And, here\u2019s the purchasing price list of the potions.\u300d</p><br/><p>He handed a paper which the purchasing price of the potions were written.</p><br/><p>\u30fbStrength recovery potion Unbranded: 5G,\u3010+1\u3011: 7G, </p><br/><p>\u3010+2\u3011: 10G and\u3010+3\u3011: 20G.</p><br/><p>\u30fbIllness mitigation potion Unbranded: 10G,\u3010+1\u3011: 15G,</p><br/><p>\u3010+2\u3011: 20G and\u3010+3\u3011: 40G.</p><br/><p>\u30fbBurning healing potion Unbranded: 25G, \u3010+1\u3011: 27G, </p><br/><p>\u3010+2\u3011: 50G and\u3010+3\u3011: 100G.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll buy them at these prices, are you sure?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>Now then, how will these difficult calculations be done?</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m thinking such a thing-</p><br/><p>The oniisan picked up the\u3010Strength recovery potion +1\u3011and replaced it with 7 Aurum.1</p><br/><p>Then he took the\u3010Strength recovery potion +2\u3011and placed 10 Aurum.</p><br/><p>And then, he took the\u3010Strength recovery potion +3\u3011and placed 20 Aurum.</p><br/><p>I see, replacing them with money individually, huh?</p><br/><p>When observing for a while till he was done with the\u3010Illness mitigation potion\u3011, he skipped the\u3010Burning healing potion\u3011\u2019s\u3010+1\u3011and\u3010+2\u3011and then proceed with the process\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>These 2 types are by 9 and 10, you\u2019re putting them off because of the large quantities?2 Is what I thought\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, Sarah! I\u2019ll leave this to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>The oniisan called someone.</p><br/><p>The one who came-</p><br/><p>was the woman on the 1st reception. It seems her name is Sarah.</p><br/><p>Sarah noticed and greeted us with grateful expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll leave the calculations for this to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>Apparently, it seems Sarah undertake all the calculations here alone.</p><br/><p>Sarah began the calculations of\u300e27 x 9\u300fand\u300e50 x 10\u300f.</p><br/><p>She finished the calculation of\u300e50 x 10\u300fquickly as expected, but the\u300e27 x 9\u300ftook a lot of time.</p><br/><p>The people here, are they living with such computation ability? It\u2019s a little worrisome.</p><br/><p>In the end, the purchasing price of the potions were as follows.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Strength recovery potions\u3011became 37 Aurum,</p><br/><p>the\u3010Illness mitigation potions\u3011became 130 Aurum,</p><br/><p>and the\u3010Burning healing potions\u3011became 843 Aurum.</p><br/><p>A total of 1010 Aurum.</p><br/><p>Having finished the job, Sarah went back to her post with a sense of fulfillment. Thank you for your hard work.</p><br/><p>This time, after inquiring about where we could buy ingredients for potions, we came to the second reception.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, do you have\u3010Mandrake root\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see, there are 7 in stock and they costs 100 Aurum individually.\u300d</p><br/><p>The obaa-chan in the 2nd reception answered.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, please give me all 7 of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, thank you for your continued patronage.\u300d</p><br/><p>I did it, I can brew\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011with this!</p><br/><p>So,\u3010Mandrake root\u3011is an ingredient for\u3010Elixir\u3011but, it\u2019s also an ingredient for\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011.</p><br/><p>N? Where would I use\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011for?</p><br/><p>Ahaha! The experience of having no girlfriend is equals to my age, so I can\u2019t use it!</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s for raising the level of\u3010Potioncraft\u3011.</p><br/><p>Ah, but, if there\u2019s a time when I might use it, well, that may cause some problems, probably.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, An-chan, why did you spend so much money for such a strange root?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo so so, such a thing, of course not.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rest of the money, isn\u2019t it considerably few?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, well, that\u2019s right but\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, let\u2019s go and subjugate monsters quickly to earn money, did you forget that you promised to show us the spirit?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I didn\u2019t forget.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left the\u300eCraftsmen\u2019s guild\u300f.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1This is confusing, in chapter 9 he was given 100 gold coins for 10,000 Aurum which means 100 Aurum is more or less equals to 1 Aurum gold coins or not? Well, if someone can clear this up, it\u2019ll be much appreciated. I probably messed the money system up already but still didn\u2019t notice.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2They made 9 of +1 and 10 of +2 of burning healing potion in chapter 61.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why aren't these panties for kids?\u300d</p><p class=\"ZYWGCeBnxWtywKAxyZOr\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"OqHzReXQToJiLdebquhW\">\u300cThere was only this! I went to three convenience stores and bought them!\u300d</p><p class=\"UmnXqonLwkxKLzKsUYuh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"GaofKHaJchhoRMPVCEjx\">Really\u2026\u2026. If that's the case, then it can't be helped.</p><p class=\"kHWWxRzcbWYtAxQDQHOy\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CPFaGiQoWprCvdfUhGvE\">\u300cBy the way, why do you have 14 puddings?\u300d</p><p class=\"GnUJtPRZkvlrfagqkdhP\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"dPhdVyoZFddfnOYyncYy\">\u300cI'm thinking of eating them with everyone\u300d</p><p class=\"ATtoRRCUQbyUYBONQotC\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"BSpcGdSVwvMzznocXfau\">It seems that the girls are hungry, or will she eat all of them after having eaten dinner?</p><p class=\"AkoNyqLDrfERRUfKrJGM\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"GzBBEmTnTGSXEJCwNzbD\">However, she bought this from the money I gave her. So, it's alright.</p><p class=\"vTrewNSWOwhVZuWbWBfh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bMxvIzskEAbvrJzxvKgc\">-----</p><p class=\"uPdepBzZHCGSgBmIyHdm\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"HvWiIFHpIUPjGEDBiiQf\">When I heard from Laila by phone, that their side is in a state of restlessness, we have time to eat dinner.</p><p class=\"BMSfpuoyktYKlRYfGAaY\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"davVYBByBAqenyrwAXrf\">I'm also getting hungry, and I'm going to make something now.</p><p class=\"KUwjmTJjkOYYkzonfvwc\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"SjPsydyUAAGkzfbtSCHw\">There are a lot of eggs. Well then, I would like to make omelet rice.</p><p class=\"RNgWPzPsglGMfczJzdhh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"vvwxVgWYoelMexUvMiXE\">The rice will be cooked and stored if it is for the time of the meal so that it will be in time.</p><p class=\"RHspBOcKLGPcRVKyEwTV\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"jrDfbbJxUEXElXBADIvd\">While heating the frying pan, in a few moments between that, I apply \u3010Quick\u3011 on myself and chop the onions quickly. There are no tears because I used \u3010Barrier\u3011 to shut off the air.</p><p class=\"xfduGEYpactjnlvjGMzp\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XBXjXgPJGfyEvSgMTXEv\">While frying the onions, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and fry it at the same time.</p><p class=\"HhtAogtlKPRCSjekSnhS\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"WInfMxXaEQgFmcKgWHlt\">When it comes to 13 people indeed, because it is impossible in one-split, we will divide it into 4 and make chicken rice.</p><p class=\"UeZXOgUvroYpmPyecmbu\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"wslmQpodrIymeqgocXmm\">Wind magic prevents it from falling when frying it with the frying pan and fire magic compensates for the lack of firepower.</p><p class=\"GKMXQaZOmlrsLyoprUqm\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CxnbLCsGTFgIgxhMVFzR\">I put the prepared chicken rice on a plate........</p><p class=\"wuOUBAPhZHTTfweZRFfs\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ApiWuiOZohIdxHBxycMc\">Ah, I haven't enough dishes. As it can't be helped, I substitute with paper plates.</p><p class=\"rnYZOvxRiAbHAiLaMmiM\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CCmLnnxAvkpmnSJZpAvW\">Once served, I put the chicken rice in the inventory to keep it fresh.</p><p class=\"vbioKiDlEAdNrmKRhSRX\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"YYhlJZsCRqolGfTCpmDn\">Next \u3010Eggs\u3011.</p><p class=\"qcrvVTLiwYKylLlisoak\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"PclBotTCtdJkeRcEYphX\">I put two frying pans on two stoves and let them heat up at the same time. I break up the eggs and stir them.</p><p class=\"OArFDWESeBefzFvtnMtz\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"RtxxPQKCjkGsZlQqMyMD\">When the frying pan is at a good temperature, I pour the eggs into one frying pan and keep the other frying pan in the inventory to maintain heat.</p><div><div></div></div><p class=\"xVKJMawkMZEJUmwIdFki\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"JLkVhTZNdhyFPMYLuRzG\">After that, I just make 13 omelets alternately.</p><p class=\"eZoRXamOzSjkHTPpSLdT\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XKORAdKmhDjHiEAHnMMr\">I put the omelettes on top of the chicken rice one by one and move it to the inventory again.</p><p class=\"GZtkAaymMPJIihGBFSID\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"srezXGeQpHccUvNqYfiU\">Therefore, it took only 30 minutes to complete 13 pieces.

No, the spoons aren't enough!</p><p class=\"AiiahUIpUUexeQnAgbwS\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"uvUkIuqKQjaGGzQoFsap\">I can't help it, so I take out 10 silver coins and produce pure silver with [Electrolysis]. Next, I shape it into spoons like that with [Metal Control]. By the way, I made the forehead part a little fork-like shape.</p><p class=\"tUjSLyxdyMwKUYjcECAi\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"DjABsDfUeoFxwsSmCIwa\">-----</p><p class=\"bwwtpJWXfWXdozxJaJlb\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"raLRxvRgHTHYdzWPmGYZ\">When I finished cooking, I went to the living room and all the panties had been worn by now.</p><p class=\"xxWXtMkaLjrUqPHVeVVq\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CEislewhZNNlqQGCKbEe\">After all, the size doesn't fit, so it seems we need to adjust in various ways.</p><p class=\"TzNJgpuiUyyZuZBBzLUI\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"NgrMHTmtNUgCpeFKqrkQ\">It was okay for me to be in charge of this.</p><p class=\"fDikiSAAcqbGhzoektqd\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"qBVPPZajpdEEfuFNwEty\">Because Aya has stopped me for some reason, I left them alone.</p><p class=\"ncxHIkdmECHLHdOBqoJy\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XcyaQZreJQGSYspGlaWD\">I clean up the sofa in the living room and connect two short tables.</p><p class=\"pRuHgaShXwmxvSjwmiNW\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"TiCMrZYzMVzOENeRqZMT\">Next, we let the children sit at the table and line up the chicken rice on omelette made by me one by one.</p><p class=\"XHzLLqcLdVcZhfNUUlpu\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"eqnkeiepxyfaAcEAghZd\">The children look at the food in front of them while making their stomachs are rumbling.</p><p class=\"ZLtcqTixTldoUHSSyGTH\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"iXUPQMowGWVFdAUOuEsZ\">I take out a knife in an odd manner, make a cut in the omelet and simmer the chicken rice with the simmering omellet.</p><p class=\"FiogccBHuANqRQROIhQj\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"JEmAwaiDQsZQaFRWghCk\">As we continue, Elena arranges ketchup and Hilda distribute orange juice in a paper cup.</p><p class=\"irrOinUqQfZFByNmPQSv\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"YqSweemUXHjgmhfxPdRY\">\u203b I abandoned the soup because there was nothing to put in it.</p><p class=\"fpHmveczVaTpzTbFPYLv\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"SujMvPBtAWFppYFIDHXr\">\u300cNow, let's eat\u300d</p><p class=\"jkkhPTKwQcAixIirYRlt\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"buxJCPItacFXkutDDNzH\">I spoke to the children...... but no one wants to eat.</p><p class=\"fZgAsJdfiLiMHNDHMshW\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ZviMZPzrXvyFVRzCknIE\">Again, this pattern....... It can't be helped, do they want me to make an ordering tone?</p><p class=\"hzcYYEimnNjhLWOvjkVf\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"YFkUtFeEBjMXGbGtmbPq\">\u300cOrder to the 10 of you.

When everyone ate one bite, they opened their eyes and were surprised and stopped.</p><p class=\"pIytYVhGquxBfdMOOECJ\">\u00a0</p><div><div></div></div><p class=\"qWmuJbjoESUQEQrrWGoB\">After a while, they started to talk slowly.</p><p class=\"PJmFaECGTeXuTxBVcuQc\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ZkvwLrzfhBziAfQgZnGM\">The children took their time slowly as instructed and finished eating the omelet.</p><p class=\"VUDbKJbXqNqlVZczFrga\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CiaClAhDGiLrNggKfwdP\">And, staring at the paper plate in a way that left a mark.</p><p class=\"ZzdgFNlcQaSiuEOcYLWp\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"wFBbuDafApSUdGnDVOss\">Hmmm, I wondered if it wasn't enough? I can't help it, so I divided my omelet into 10 equal portions and put it on the plates of the children.</p><p class=\"yMneaRaOkssqHPszTzWu\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"IwmyOMroILcxmFioBOWq\">I can eat cup noodles later.</p><p class=\"mjhSsvugsKLvCuJXYkHJ\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"RoJlYGkioUypKfiwRlto\">By the way, Elena, Hilda and Aya had already finished eating first.

Moreover, fresh cream and fruits are also expensive.</p><p class=\"OYJTuNMFJnKaGylAGlAD\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"CiMbumIFNlKyZagbMRAG\">Aya is giving a lecture on how to eat this pudding with a happy face.</p><p class=\"ccadjcQbCwTpUwjGxVkG\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"TjnqtUNoetburtSbCgcp\">And when I finally thought that the children had begun to eat the pudding, I needed to order them again.</p><p class=\"QlMkeNNlQcHXgskkvwos\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"DiNWtXrPlKPxkIWlovaK\">After eating the pudding, at last, the children had an expression that their consciousness got stuck somewhere.</p><p class=\"IdOrZaFvbqLIJHhNYkOA\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"zPMhXzfhnGaFSqzgamnq\">Well, it was fine if it was delicious, but it would be better if they were just a little innocently delighted, though there is a conflict.</p><p class=\"RdchDjhQxxtAhcKkRHbN\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"SLKVvVMcWzJoYbdgEvfG\">-----</p><p class=\"uqQwuXbPcHNXsqPMHLGi\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"SXHiMuPyaYJssfqvGIkk\">I let the children rest a little and see for a while the state of Dreados kingdom.</p><p class=\"KmEQDaxmkHfDMaBfSgBK\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"zfwAHBsNddOUEpiHLKLb\">All the children had gone to sleep when I came back from looking at the situation in each area and fixing the [barriers] in the shelters.</p><p class=\"YOgnXOZIAbgbGWhtepAN\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"GNdDUwHjXvreYOsXbggi\">\u300cElena, what is this?\u300d</p><p class=\"adHOwEQCLZZadSKZXQvN\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ZYhSJgPzCDRaVNfLLxjI\">\u300cSeiji-sama, as soon as you went out, everyone fell asleep, so we split them up\u300d</p><p class=\"nUmbZXNxhwVPfbKmtJtJ\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"sKYtukNdEwQduMCqaOJg\">The futons for customers are in the living room, and there are 5 girls.

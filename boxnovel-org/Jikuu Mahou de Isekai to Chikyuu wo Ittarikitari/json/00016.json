I also want to use magic~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c Even if you say that, I was only able to suddenly use it after I touched the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011 item.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere do we find it then?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe King has some.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen we just have to ask the king to let me touch it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can\u2019t, since Elena fled from the King.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, Elena, how did you learn magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI was bestowed the magic from the\u3010Mana Crystal\u3011 of the \u3010Temple\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u3010Mana Crystal\u3011 of the \u3010Temple\u3011?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya talked over my words.</p><br/><p>\u300c Will I be able to get magic from the \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there are a number of\u3010Temples\u3011 built around the continent, each holds a\u3010Mana Crystal\u3011. When you touch the \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011, you will acquire magic skills. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen I want to go and touch a\u3010Mana Crystal\u3011 too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there a\u3010Temple\u3011 in the town we were in?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that town is called \u3010Delaidos Royal Capital\u3011, the\u3010Temple\u3011 in \u3010Delaidos Imperial Capital\u3011 is a \u3010Wind Temple\u3011 where you can be bestowed \u3010Wind Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Do you mean that the power that each \u3010Temple\u3011 bestows is already decided?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, when I was 10 years old, I visited a number of \u3010Temples\u3011 where I was bestowed with \u3010Water Magic\u3011 and \u3010Recovery Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about \u3010Wind Magic\u3011? You didn\u2019t go to the\u3010Temple\u3011 of the \u3010Delaidos Royal Capital\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI did go to the \u3010Temple\u3011 of the \u3010Delaidos Royal Capital\u3011, however I was not able to be bestowed with \u3010Wind Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you mean that even if you touch a \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011, it\u2019s not guaranteed that you\u2019ll be bestowed with its power?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I believe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve mostly stayed inside since I was child and wasn\u2019t exposed to enough of the wind, therefore I wasn\u2019t bestowed with \u3010Wind Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo how you live your childhood is what decides whether you are able to be bestowed or unable to be bestowed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, a \u3010Fisherman\u3011 who soaks himself in water everyday will be able to acquire \u3010Water Magic\u3011, a\u3010Farmer\u3011who nurtures the soil everyday will be able to acquire \u3010Earth Magic\u3011, a \u3010Hunter\u3011who scours himself in nature will be able to acquire\u3010Wind Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHere! Here! I take a bath everyday!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you take a bath everyday. In that case, I certainly believe you\u2019ll be able to be bestowed with \u3010Water Magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYay!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat other kinds of \u3010Temples\u3011 are there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, there are 5 different types: 3 hold \u3010Elemental Magic\u3011 which are Water, Wind and Earth, then we have those of\u3010Recovery Magic\u3011 and \u3010Body Strengthening\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no\u3010Fire Magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is a \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011 of\u3010Fire Magic\u3011, however there is no\u3010Temple of Fire\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so all the locations with\u3010Mana Crystals\u3011 don\u2019t necessarily have a \u3010Temple\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s the difference between places with and without a \u3010Temple\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Fire Magic\u3011 for example, has very few people who are bestowed with its power, therefore not a lot of people visit it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see! There aren\u2019t any people who get burnt everyday from their childhood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen where are other\u3010Mana Crystals\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I do not know all their locations, but there was a\u3010Mana Crystal\u3011of \u3010Light Magic\u3011 near the \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011of \u3010Fire Magic\u3011.There is also \u3010Mana Crystal\u3011 for \u3010Lightning Magic\u3011 in the \u3010Wind Temple\u3011, \u3010Ice Magic\u3011 in the \u3010Water Temple\u3011 and \u3010Dark Magic\u3011 in the \u3010Earth Temple\u3011.Those are all I am aware of.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about\u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011and\u3010Information Magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c I have heard of\u3010Information Magic\u3011, where was it\u2026.. but I have never heard of\u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011. I am sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen first of all~ for I who takes a bath everyday, let\u2019s go to the \u3010Water Temple\u3011! Maybe I can also get\u3010Ice Magic\u3011 while we\u2019re at it. I really like ice.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, is there a \u3010Water Temple\u3011 near \u3010Delaidos Royal Capital\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, it takes approximately five days by carriage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can\u2019t go as I\u2019ve only got 4 days left for my paid leave.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEeehh! Just one more day should be fine!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be unreasonable!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRather, Aya, do you really intend on going to another world?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI mean, I can go with Nii-chan\u2019s\u3010Teleportation\u3011, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell that\u2019s true, but\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen let\u2019s go.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I want to go to see the children from the church.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee, Elena says she wants to go too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, well it\u2019s fine I guess\u2026 Then first we\u2019ll go see the \u3010Wind Temple\u3011 of the \u3010Dolaidos Imperial Capital\u3011. It\u2019s fine if we go to the church after, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYay~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, we should take the opportunity and go now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but we can\u2019t go today.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy not~ stingy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can only move between worlds once a day. I returned from the other world just now so I can\u2019t use it until tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo that\u2019s why~ then we\u2019ll depart tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, do you want to go shopping at the supermarket today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy the supermarket?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c For the children in the church, I want to treat them to something delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat sounds great, I am sure the children will be delighted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnother world sounds like it will be fun, how nice~\u300d</p><br/><p> And thus, we went out to go shopping at the supermarket.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I'll try to ask Ringo-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eNee, Ringo-chan.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat's wrong, Aya-chan?

Why are you going to bring her!!?</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Aya, what are you trying to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe two of us will go to the police station and bring along a policeman.</p><br/><p> Will that be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, just hurry up because I'm going to stand watch in front of the room.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p> I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to go in front of Ringo-san's house and waited for the two people.</p><br/><p> After a while, Aya and Ringo-san came over with a policeman.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's this room.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLend me the key.\u300d</p><br/><p> The policeman borrowed the key from Ringo-san, opened the door and cautiously entered inside.</p><br/><p> The man was in the middle of drug injection inside Ringo-san's room.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou! What are you doing in a place like this!\u300d</p><br/><p> When the policeman spoke,</p><br/><p> the man grinned with unfocused eyes\u2015</p><br/><p> and abruptly rushed at the policeman.</p><br/><p> As one would expect of a policeman,</p><br/><p> the man's left arm was squeezed to the utmost towards his back.</p><br/><p> Did he do it?</p><br/><p> The man, in spite of his left hand being squeezed to the utmost,</p><br/><p> tried to stand up forcibly.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, stand down!\u300d</p><br/><p> The man's left hand is making unpleasant a *crunch crunch* sound.</p><br/><p> The man finally managed to stand up at the expense of his left hand,</p><br/><p> and threw the policeman to the side.</p><br/><p> The policeman, who didn't think that the man would counterattack at the expense of his left hand,</p><br/><p> hit the wall and fainted.</p><br/><p> The man, who noticed Ringo-san, raised a strange voice.</p><br/><p> Ringo-san fell onto her rear due to excessive fear.</p><br/><p> The man, whilst raising a strange voice,</p><br/><p> took out a small hidden knife and held it in reverse grip.</p><br/><p> Aiming at Ringo-san who was still sitting on her rear\u2015</p><br/><p> he swung the knife down.</p><br/><p>*Busuri*</p><br/><p> An unpleasant sound of a knife piercing through the human flesh could be heard,</p><br/><p> and blood splattered around the area.</p><br/><p> The man,</p><br/><p> roared in joy at the sensation of stabbing a person.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya! Get Ringo-san to a safe place!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But...... O-, Oniichan......</p><br/><p> your hand!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon't worry about that! Hurry!\u300d</p><br/><p> It hurts!!!</p><br/><p> I've been planning to not use magic when in Japan and unconsciously caught the knife by hand.</p><br/><p> The man's knife was still piercing my left palm.</p><br/><p> *Guri guri* it grinds against my palm! It hurts!!</p><br/><p> When the man and I were struggling with each other,</p><br/><p> the policeman finally regained consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou-, are you okay!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's too much, I'm not okay!\u300d</p><br/><p> The policeman takes his gun out,</p><br/><p>\u300cPut down your weapon. If you don't stand down, I'll shoot!\u300d</p><br/><p> however, the man doesn't seem to hear it at all.</p><br/><p>*Pan!*</p><br/><p> The policeman fired a warning shot towards the wall.</p><br/><p> The man is still completely unfazed.</p><br/><p> Or rather, he's stimulated to a point which prevents him from hearing the surrounding sounds?</p><br/><p> The situation is completely out of control.</p><br/><p> I also cast\u3010sleep\u3011magic on the man a little while ago but it didn't work at all.</p><br/><p> Does the magic not work due to the abnormal secretion of adrenaline? It may be the effect of the drug.</p><br/><p> Ignoring the repeatedly fired warning shots, the man has turned the knife piercing my left hand violently.</p><br/><p> Finally, the policeman\u2015</p><br/><p> shoots the man with his handgun.</p><br/><p> The bullet that the policeman fired hit the man's thigh.</p><br/><p> It seems like it hit badly,</p><br/><p> blood flows out of the man's thigh profusely.</p><br/><p> Isn't this bad?</p><br/><p> The man, leaving a hideous laughter with\u300eKukekeke\u300f, slowly stopped moving.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

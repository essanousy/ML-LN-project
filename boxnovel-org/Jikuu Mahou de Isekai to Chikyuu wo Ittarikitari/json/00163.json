Beside you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela got tackled and had been blown away to the side.</p><br/><p>\u300cLela!\u300d</p><br/><p> However, it didn't seem to have dealt that much damage,</p><br/><p> Lela immediately stood up.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat on earth?\u300d</p><br/><p> Looking at the guy who crashed into Lela with a tackle,</p><br/><p> it was a hobgoblin.</p><br/><p> Since when did it appear?</p><br/><p> No, that's not it! While we were looking at the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder, it approached.</p><br/><p> We immediately got ready for battle but......</p><br/><p> while we were doing so,</p><br/><p> the Goblin\u30fbbodybuilder struck a pose again and shone.</p><br/><p> !!?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy am I,</p><br/><p> looking at the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder??\u300d</p><br/><p> Strange,</p><br/><p> for some reason, I can't take my eyes off of the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder.</p><br/><p>Don!</p><br/><p>\u300cUwaa!\u300d</p><br/><p> Before anyone knew it, Aya had been blown away by the hobgoblin this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cA-, Aya! Are you okay!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yeah, somehow.\u300d</p><br/><p> What is the meaning of this??</p><br/><p> For some reason, it's impossible to look away from the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's dangerous, let's fall back for now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d\u300c\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We hurriedly left the room,</p><br/><p> and the enemy didn't come after us.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's that guy~?</p><br/><p> I don't understand it at all!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor some reason, we couldn't take our eyes off of that guy.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya and Lela have Elena to cast recovery magic on them.</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder was using some kind of magic, don't you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder that macho guy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right,</p><br/><p> It's probably\u3010Light magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Light magic\u3011!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hearing the word\u3010Light magic\u3011, Lela snapped it up.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you also do the same thing with\u3010Light magic\u3011, Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?

I can no longer look away!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Truly!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela, who seems to be happy, uses the magic many times</p><br/><p> and each time, my eyes are glued to Lela.</p><br/><p> I tried to check Lela's status,</p><br/><p> and\u3010Visual attraction\u3011magic was added to\u3010Light magic\u3011.</p><br/><p> She seemed to be able to freely choose whose visual was to be attracted.</p><br/><p>\u300cUhm, Lela-san. It's fine already.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Sorry. J-, Just......\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela seems to be awakened from the joy of being the focus.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Rebuilding our strategy, we rushed back into the room.</p><br/><p> Aya and Lela ran up to the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder at full speed,</p><br/><p> carrying out a pincer attack at the front and the back.</p><br/><p> And, Aya dealt a vital strike from behind\u2015</p><br/><p> the goblin\u30fbbodybuilder tumbled down together with a \u300eAah!\u300fscream.</p><br/><p> The hobgoblin also appeared from the side as it paused for a short moment,</p><br/><p> it had been frozen in ice by Elena's magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was scary at first but</p><br/><p> it's an easy victory if we make a strategy properly, isn't it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya is right but</p><br/><p> on the other hand, if we don't make a strategy properly,</p><br/><p> even such a weak enemy can be a threat to us.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see,</p><br/><p> in other words, a strategy is important. Oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSomething like that.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda finished dismantling</p><br/><p> and brought the\u3010Magic stone of faint light +1\u3011and\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stone +1\u3011.</p><br/><p> Oh, something good has appeared this time.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We continued to advance steadily.</p><br/><p> In the fight against the goblins in each room,</p><br/><p> Lela attracted the attention of the enemy with\u3010Visual attraction\u3011</p><br/><p> and from a defenseless blind spot, Aya and Elena attacked. It was a complete tactical pattern.</p><br/><p> And then, we,</p><br/><p> finally......</p><br/><p> explored the third floor thoroughly.</p><br/><p> Huh?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

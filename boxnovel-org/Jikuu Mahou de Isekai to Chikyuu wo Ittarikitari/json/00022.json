My MP is more than 3000 so it won\u2019t get exhausted so quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow much is my MP?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYours is 170, Elena\u2019s is 100.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo there was that much difference\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s unfair only you get that much, Nii-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s because when the level of a magic rises, MP seems to increases. So if you work hard, it\u2019ll rise..\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Nii-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t you have any \u3010Candy\u3011 on you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s rather sudden.\u300d</p><br/><p> From my inventory, I took out a bag of strawberry flavoured \u3010Candy\u3011 and handed it over to Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don\u2019t know about \u3010Candy\u3011, Elena-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen Ill also give Elena some. Say aah~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAah~\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya threw a \u3010Candy\u3011 into Elena\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cMhh!? Sweet and derishish~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight~ I really like this strawberry \u3010Candy\u3011. I suddenly feel that I\u2019m being filled with power.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re right, it feels like my magic power is being filled..\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s exaggerated.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not true at all! Try using \u3010Appraisal\u3011, I\u2019m sure my MP has recovered.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s probably no way \u3010Candy\u3011 can recover MP.\u300d</p><br/><p> It recovered!</p><br/><p> When I used \u3010Appraisal\u3011, the MP had recovered!</p><br/><p> Seriously!?</p><br/><p> The amount a piece of \u3010Candy\u3011recovers seems to be about 100 I believe?</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? Has my MP recovered?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it recovered.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee! After all, it\u2019s just like I said!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor it to recover MP, \u3010Candy\u3011 really is amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p> After that, we licked our \u3010Candy\u3011 and then continued our special magic training.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it! I can also send electricity flying!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy \u3010Water Magic\u3011 too. I was able to make fly far away without an incantation.\u300d</p><br/><p> After seeing my and Aya\u2019s magic, Elena seemed to have copied us and practised using magic without an incantation.</p><br/><p> After practice, I used \u3010Appraisal\u3011 on the two again.</p><br/><p> Elena\u2019s \u3010Water Magic\u3011 rose to level 2.</p><br/><p> Aya\u2019s \u3010Lightning Magic\u3011 had rose to level 3.</p><br/><p> Along with it, their MP increased accordingly.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, I\u2019ll be using lightning now. Everyone, please be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh~! clap clap Go on Nii-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo your best, Seiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSure thing!\u300d</p><br/><p> I set my sights on a single growing tree slightly separated from the others\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Lightning Strike\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>BANG!!</p><br/><p> With an incredible explosion, the tree which I targeted was broken in half and was set ablaze.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy ears are ringing! Stupid Nii-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat was amazing, Seiji-sama!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks, that it was more powerful than I thought surprised me, sorry about that.\u300d</p><br/><p> However, it will stand out with this much power.</p><br/><p> Let\u2019s not use this in public as much as possible since there seems to be only one other person who can use \u3010Lightning Magic\u3011.</p><br/><p> I immediately tried \u3010Electrolysis\u3011 next.</p><br/><p> It says electrolysis, but what comes to my mind is the electrolysis of water. It would be troublesome to prepare the equipment for that so\u2013</p><br/><p> To try it out, I applied the \u3010Electrolysis\u3011 magic on a \u3010Stone\u3011 that was lying around.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Electrolysis\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> When the magic was executed, the \u3010Stone\u3011 I was holding in my hand decomposed. All that remained was a little amount of \u3010Black Sand\u3011 in my right hand and \u3010White Sand\u3011 in my left hand.</p><br/><p> When I used \u3010Appraisal\u3011 on each of them\u2013</p><br/><p> The \u3010Black Sand\u3011 was \u3010Iron Sand\u3011, the \u3010White Sand\u3011 was \u3010Quartz\u3011.</p><br/><p> If this magic can decompose anything, it might be a very useful magic to use.</p><br/><p> Elena and Aya were watching when I used \u3010Electrolysis\u3011, but it seemed they didn\u2019t understand what I did.</p><br/><p> When I was thinking about that\u2013</p><br/><p> My \u3010Vigilance\u3011 magic suddenly gave a response. I knew that from the other side of the cliff in front of me, something that required \u300eCaution\u300f was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, Aya! Something\u2019s approaching, be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes!\u300d\u300cEh!? What?\u300d</p><br/><p> After a short moment, 3 adventurer looking people were rushing out from the other side of the cliff at full speed.</p><br/><p> They seemed to notice us and called out.</p><br/><p>\u300cAn orc is chasing us! Run away!\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There\u2019s still the next trial, isn\u2019t there?\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s to make contracts with Spirits; though it seems troublesome, I should be able to do it.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can appraise the Sword of Trial!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a trial the seems to be impossible for a normal person, but if it\u2019s me, I think I can probably clear it.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I said so, Masamune-san\u2019s eyes shone with shing.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see! It seems you can clear it, huh! Nobody has been able to clear the trials beyond this so far. What will the next stage be, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Masamune-san said so, he foolishly laughed out loud and patted me on the back with bon bon!</p><br/><p>It hurts!</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>I went back home to fetch Aya, Elena, Hilda and Mai-san up and went to Lella\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>By the way, I haven\u2019t explained it to Yurie-san yet, so I have her wait at home.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, you came. Finally, it\u2019s the decisive battle with the Devil race. Let\u2019s all return home safely!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is Lella nervous?</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, have the members, who are going together with us today, been decided?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, first, Lyle Gewalt-otou-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh? That fellow is coming, too?</p><br/><p>He\u2019s a hindrance, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Rondo Warstar-dono.\u300d</p><br/><p>Golden Armor Rondo, huh.</p><br/><p>That fellow isn\u2019t strong, too, right?</p><br/><p>Well, he\u2019s better than Lyle Gewalt.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Bunmi-dono from the Demon race\u2019s side.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lella let the Demon race\u2019s side know, too, huh.</p><br/><p>Well, since Bunmi-san is quite strong, he will be useful than the other two.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rest are Rachel and Misha as Rondo-dono\u2019s companions and Cassandra as Bunmi-dono\u2019s companion. Those are all this time\u2019s participants.\u300d</p><br/><p>All members of the Magician Unit have gathered, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, where are the people in question?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey\u2019re still on standby at their respective towns, getting ready?\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m going to fetch each of them up, huh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>I went to each participants and brought them all at Lella\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, thank you for your hard work.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh boy, just by gathering the participants, I became mentally fatigued, but thanks to Elena\u2019s worries, my willpower somehow recovered.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Seiji. Since I\u2019d like to have a conversation with Bunmi-dono, be the interpreter.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lyle Gewalt smugly ordered.</p><br/><p>\u300cHand over a billion Aurum as the interpretation fee!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKu-, this money monger!\u300d</p><br/><p>Are you an idiot?</p><br/><p>Do you even understand what the unit [billion] is?</p><br/><p>This fellow doesn\u2019t seem to understand that I\u2019m telling him [I don\u2019t want to].</p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, I gave Bunmi-san a [Temporary Language Acquisition Magic Stone+2] and had him acquire the [Dolaidos Common Language].</p><br/><p>\u300cLyle Gewalt, you will be able to have a talk with him with this. Talk to Bunmi-san directly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-, Ou.\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh? Lyle Gewalt looks a little strange.</p><br/><p>Although he\u2019s having a talk with Bunmi-san, he looks fearful for some reason.</p><br/><p>Aha, this fellow Lyle Gewalt is scared of the Demon Bunmi-san.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>Well, as it became a situation where everyone could talk to each other, we started a strategy meeting.</p><br/><p>After showing everyone several videos being taken by the [Tracking Beacon] flying around the Devil race\u2019s town, I explained the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe problem is the [POW camps], we can\u2019t make move as long as they are being held hostage. To start with, we have to do something from there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh!\u300d</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san, who was looking at the videos, unintentionally raised a cry.</p><br/><p>It was a small number, but Demons being forced to work as slaves, too, were seen.</p><br/><p>Devils like slavery this much\u2026..</p><br/><p>The strategy meeting progressed and finally, the content of the strategy was decided.</p><br/><p>The 3 POW camps are areas A, B and C.</p><br/><p>A is the biggest and the place where there are Demons being detained, too.</p><br/><p>B and C contain only humans, but these places are apart from each other.</p><br/><p>The strategy is to first rescue the hostages at these 3 areas and to start the battle after that.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, the 3 people for area A are Bunmi-san, Cassandra-san and Hilda, Aya for area B and Mai-san for area C. You will sneak in while hiding with [Invisibility]. Everyone, understood?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-dono, is it alright for Aya-san and that little miss to go alone?\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo raised an objection.</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, Aya and Mai-san are much stronger than you, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, just them should be enough to protect the hostages until I start rescuing the hostages with [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I volunteer to take on the [decoy role] on behalf of Aya-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo wanted to show his good side to Aya and proposed something strange.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The whole town is bustling.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so that's why Lela was able to go to the Shinju town with a peace of mind, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're calling Lela-sama w-, without honorifics!?</p><br/><p> Is she by any chance your acquaintance?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, You might say......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're amazing, Seiji-san!\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, it is I who found the tower of sunrise's fourth floor!</p><br/><p> I will never say it though!</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, I have a lot of new magic stones in stock.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHou hou, what kind of magic stone?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's this!\u300d</p><br/><p> Kiseri-san boastfully lined up three magic stones.</p><br/><p> When I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011......</p><br/><p> They were\u3010Magic stone of night shade\u3011,\u3010magic stone of return\u3011and\u3010magic stone of monster outbreak\u3011......</p><br/><p> This......</p><br/><p> they are all just exactly the magic stones the devil-kin had!</p><br/><p>\u300cBy any chance, these magic stones......</p><br/><p> did you sell them to a suspicious person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuspicious person?</p><br/><p> That reminds me, a person covered with a hood bought them last time in large quantities.\u300d</p><br/><p> That's something unexpected......</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the customer my wife is attending right now is that person.\u300d</p><br/><p> In the direction where Kiseri-san was pointing at, there was a suspicious customer who was deeply covered with a hood,</p><br/><p> he was trying to buy magic stones right now.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat customer, wait a moment!\u300d</p><br/><p> Since I suddenly yelled out,</p><br/><p> Kiseri-san's wife drew back the bag she was going to hand over.</p><br/><p> The suspicious customer tried to snatch the bag but caught empty air.</p><br/><p> When I cast\u3010Appraisal\u3011magic toward that customer\u2015</p><br/><p> that customer jumped back and dodged the magic.</p><br/><p> Bingo.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are a devil-kin, right!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I purposely shouted in a loud voice which can be heard in the entire shop.</p><br/><p> That customer covered with a hood took out a poisoned knife and took a fighting stance.</p><br/><p> After the adventurers inside the shop saw it,</p><br/><p> some people took up arms and assumed a fighting stance,</p><br/><p> while some took a distance and watched the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cI leave the salesclerk to you, Mai-san.</p><br/><p> Hilda, protect Kiseri-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger.\u300d\u300cUnderstood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDevil-kin!?</p><br/><p> They said that they live far away in the north.....\u300d</p><br/><p> Kiseri-san trembled with fear at the sudden development.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou're a devil-kin, right?\u300f</p><br/><p> This time, I tried to speak to it with devil language.</p><br/><p>\u300eHornless, you bastard!\u300f</p><br/><p> Yep, it's confirmed.</p><br/><p> I promptly sneaked around the back of that person\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cGya!\u300d</p><br/><p> and knocked him unconscious with\u3010Electric shock\u3011.</p><br/><p> And, when I took off the hood of that person\u2015</p><br/><p> it was a female devil-kin with two grown horns.</p><br/><p> Indeed, the horns of the female devil-kin are smaller.</p><br/><p> Their mission is to break into the town, in order to not get exposed as a devil-kin, women with smaller horns are in charge.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, what's the meaning of this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, the devil-kin is targeting the humans and demonkind towns.</p><br/><p> The demonkind town had already received the devil-kin's surprise attack.</p><br/><p> The devil-kin who attacked the demonkind town were using the magic stones that you showed me a little while ago, Kiseri-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, I......</p><br/><p> does it mean that I've lent the devil-kin a hand!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cProbably, it seems so.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat......\u300d</p><br/><p> When I inspect the body of the female devil-kin......</p><br/><p> splendid huge boo...that's not it!</p><br/><p> She had a\u3010magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-san, where did you touch her?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere's no helping it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I'll keep it a secret from Aya-kun.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> The female devil-kin have been taken by the town's soldiers.</p><br/><p> I could've performed a little bit more physical examination but......</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, what should I do......?</p><br/><p> Because I've sold the magic stones to the devil-kin......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's not your fault, Kiseri-san.</p><br/><p> Because the devil-kin are to blame.</p><br/><p> If it caused you to become worried, please talk with Lela next time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela-sama!?</p><br/><p> However, Lela-sama has gone to Shinju town.</p><br/><p> I have to run this shop......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll do something about that somehow.</p><br/><p> Do you have some\u3010twin magic stones\u3011I've got from you before?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Twin magic stones\u3011is it?</p><br/><p> If it's that, I have about 10 but......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, please give me two.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out paper cups and sellotape from the inventory,</p><br/><p> I divided the\u3010twin magic stones\u3011up into two and attached each one of the pair at the bottom of the paper cups with sellotape.</p><br/><p> By the way, the other pair of\u3010twin magic stones\u3011is a gift to Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cKiseri-san, please press it against your ear.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I speak on the string phone from a slightly remote position.</p><br/><p>\u300eHello, Kiseri-san. Can you hear me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUwa, a voice!?</p><br/><p> I see! I need to press it against my mouth when speaking.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it?</p><br/><p> You can talk to Lela who is in Shinju town with this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is an amazing magic tool!</p><br/><p> Can I make and sell one the same as this?\u300d</p><br/><p> Kiseri-san got a little excited.</p><br/><p>\u300cKiseri-san, please calm down.</p><br/><p> What will happen if the devil-kin got their hands on this magic tool?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That's right. I'm sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease mind your surroundings as well when you talk with Lela.</p><br/><p> That's right~.</p><br/><p> There's no problem even if you sell it to Lela and Lyle Gewalt.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLyle Gewalt!</p><br/><p> Lela-sama's otou-sama......</p><br/><p> I see, the relationship of Seiji-san and Lela-sama is already like that......\u300d</p><br/><p> N?</p><br/><p> What are you talking about, Kiseri-san?</p><br/><p>\u300cAnyway, since I will bring this to Lela,</p><br/><p> the rest, I'm counting on you, 'kay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Perhaps it lacks\u3010Zinc\u3011?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhile eating, we should talk about what are we going to do from now on.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFrom now on?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think, we should stay at an inn today then head back to Japan tomorrow morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!- I want to do a little more sightseeing~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou understand that the\u3010Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011is aiming at us, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, is that so, I\u2019m being targeted? Is he aiming at onii-chan or Elena-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, both. I think, he\u2019s aim is to kill me and recapture Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that adventurer was going to take Elena-san too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor that reason, I think it\u2019s better not to stay long in this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, with onii-chan\u2019s current\u3010Teleportation\u3011, we can only come to this town, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s the problem, what to do\u2026\u2026 let\u2019s think about it later. After this, let\u2019s go see the\u3010Merchant\u2019s guild\u3011at once and make a little money then after securing an inn, we\u2019ll go the the church.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Merchant\u2019s guild\u3011? Isn\u2019t it like, we\u2019re going to go to\u3010Adventurer\u2019s guild\u3011and then we\u2019ll encounter a strange guy, that kind of template?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a real world not template.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We left the dining room and went to the\u3010Merchant\u2019s guild\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s Seiji-sama, welcome.\u300d</p><br/><p> A boss-like ossan called out to us while rubbing his hands together.</p><br/><p>\u300cUhh\u2026have we met?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy apologies for the late introduction. My name is\u300eGilde\u300f, the vice-guild master. I\u2019m pleased to make your acquaintance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe other day, you sold to us a very valuable thing, it was very helpful. So, what kind of business we have today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAgain, I was thinking of selling something.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I see, I see, then, please come this way.\u300d</p><br/><p> We aren\u2019t brought to the counter but to the private room in the back instead.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll get to the point Seiji-sama, if you still have the salt you sold to us the other day, I would like to purchase it at 3 times the previous price. How about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c3 times!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hmmmm\u2026 it\u2019s just a salt, why did it gain such a price?</p><br/><p> It\u2019s somewhat suspicious.</p><br/><p> Certainly the previous transaction is about 10000 Aurum per 100 g.</p><br/><p> 1 Aurum should be about 100 yen\u2026\u2026 1 million yen!?</p><br/><p> Now it\u2019s 3 times therefore it should be about 3 million yen\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> As expected, I should see what\u2019s behind this.</p><br/><p> Let\u2019s not jump right off the bat, I need to get more information before making a deal.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t have anymore of those salt, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, it\u2019s regrettable.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn fact, we came to the merchant guild because there is something I would like to ask.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou want to ask?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to ask about\u3010Elixir\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Elixir\u3011!?\u300d</p><br/><p> As soon as I mentioned\u3010Elixir\u3011, Gilde\u2019s face turned pale. What\u2019s wrong exactly?</p><br/><p>\u300cIs something wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it may not be beneficial to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, what do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou win\u2026\u2026 All I know is this certain gentleman wants a stock of that salt so much, naturally because that\u3010Salt\u3011is one of the ingredients of\u3010Elixir\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p> What did you say!? \u3010Salt\u3011is one of the ingredients of\u3010Elixir\u3011!?</p><br/><p> I tried my best to hide my astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u300cR-really now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the truth.\u300d</p><br/><p> Did you mean,\u3010Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011bought the\u3010Salt\u3011last time and used it to make an\u3010Elixir\u3011to heal his wrist?</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you mean, the client is\u3010Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!!? \u2026\u2026H-how did you know that much\u2026\u2026 please forgive me for asking a confidential matter.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I understand now.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hmmmm\u2026 if it goes to that guy, all the more reason I shouldn\u2019t sell\u3010Salt\u3011anymore.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, should I show you the goods I have this time?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this is it! We would like to buy this.\u300d</p><br/><p> I take out a vinyl with white powder inside in a manner of taking it under the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt looks like\u3010Salt\u3011but it\u2019s different?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is called\u3010Sugar\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Sugar\u3011?

I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a little delicacy of mine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Chirinchirin</p><br/><p> The vice-guild master rang the bell and had a person to bring me a\u3010Black tea\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, excuse me. You just need to put a necessary amount of\u3010Sugar\u3011in the black tea.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this something you put in a\u3010Black tea\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, there are also other applications.

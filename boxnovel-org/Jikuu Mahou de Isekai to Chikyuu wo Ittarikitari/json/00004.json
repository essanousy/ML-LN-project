I was level, however my status seems to considerably exceed Lyle Gewalt. If we were to fight again I\u2019d likely win by a large margin.</p><br/><p> However, fighting against an opponent in slow motion, for my level and skills to rise so much, \u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011 is pretty good~</p><br/><p> While flauting the sword dripping with Lyle Gewalt\u2019s blood I\u2019m holding, I slowly walked in front of the king.</p><br/><p> The king was scared and pale.</p><br/><p>Now, what do you think of this, king?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you doing! Capture this guy everyone!\u300d</p><br/><p> However, no one moved.</p><br/><p>\u300cY-You\u2019ve got it wrong. Thay guy Lyle Gewalt did it on his own\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> He just said to \u300ecapture\u300f, what an unsightly excuse.</p><br/><p> I \u3010Playback\u3011the video and audio of the conversation between the king and Lyle Gewalt that I heard before with\u3010Tracking\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle Gewalt, I\u2019ll give this job to you\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes my king, what kind of job is it?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll attract that guy\u2019s attention, you\u2019ll kill him with a slash from behind\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUnderstood, please leave it to me\u300f</p><br/><p> It was my first time using the skill so I made a little mistake controlling it and ended up playing it with a high volume. It wasn\u2019t on purpose, really?</p><br/><p> The video was projected with three dimensions in the centre of the room.</p><br/><p> The conversation between the king and Lyle Gewalt played back with high volume. When the playback finished, the people in the room became noisy.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat was that just now!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA video and audio recording of your conversation with Lyle Gewalt-san\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cVideo and recording you say.. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, you had clearly said to\u300ekill him with a slash\u300f\u300d</p><br/><p> The king\u2019s faced turned pale and he began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am the king! I\u2019m free to do what I want with the life of the likes of a commoner!\u300d</p><br/><p> You\u2019re angry at me!? Japan is a democratic country so I\u2019m not a commoner.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo you\u2019re saying that for me to survive I need to destroy this country? To destroy this country\u2026\u2026 isn\u2019t killing the king the quickest way?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-Y-You\u2019re saying you\u2019ll kill me, the king!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no choice other than to do so for me to survive right? Honestly I don\u2019t want to do such a thing, however I have no choice\u300d</p><br/><p> I slowly approached the king.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-Stop! Someone! Kill this guy!! H-Hurry up! SOMEONE!!!\u300d</p><br/><p> However, no one moved.</p><br/><p> As I approach closer\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGYAA~!\u300d</p><br/><p> The king let out an ugly scream and fled.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Barrier\u3011! \u3010Barrier\u3011! \u3010Barrier\u3011! \u3010Barrier\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> I put up \u3010Barriers\u3011 around the king, surrounding his every direction.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-What the hell is this!? An invisible wall!? I can\u2019t get out!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going? King\uff5e\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-Stay away! I SAID STAY AWAY!\u300d</p><br/><p> The king was completely terrified, but then I came up with a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u300cR-Right! Don\u2019t you want to go back to your original world?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKukuku, if you kill me, you\u2019ll lose your way to go back to your original world!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so that\u2019s what you mean\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you get it then quickly let me out of here. And then defeat the Demon Lord. Hurry up!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way in hell!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-What!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019d keep your promise at all. Also, I haven\u2019t met this Demon Lord you speak of so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re evil or not. You seem much more evil to me don\u2019t you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a stupid thing to say. I\u2019m more evil than the Demon Lord!? I am the King!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTry remembering what you\u2019ve done! You abduct me to this country that I\u2019m unrelated with, you try to trick me into a slave, you attempt to kill me with a surprise attack when that fails, and on top of that you have me go defeat the Demon Lord to return home. Who in this world would be more evil than you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGununu\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou call me the hero, but as a hero that acts like hero, don\u2019t you think I should subdue the greatest evil in this world? Everyone else here, what do you think?\u300d</p><br/><p> Abruptly questioning the people around, they became noisy.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m evil and should be subdued by the hero!? I am the king! There\u2019s no way I can be evil! Don\u2019t you think so everyone!?\u300d</p><br/><p> However, the people around were still noisy but there was no one that answered the king\u2019s question.</p><br/><p> No one answering shocked the king and he fell to his knees.</p><br/><p> Did I go a little too far?</p><br/><p> I decided to quickly finish up.</p><br/><p>\u300cKing! I\u2019ve decided to spare your life this time, however if you make the same mistake again I won\u2019t show any mercy at that time. I\u2019ll always be monitoring you, keep that in mind. Now then, farewell!\u300d</p><br/><p> After I putting away the blood covered sword into the inventory, I departed the place using \u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

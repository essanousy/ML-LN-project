But it should cost 10 Aurum to visit the lightning mana crystal, right?</p><br/><p>Why did you bother to visit the Lightning mana crystal?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t you know? In the Royal Capital, once a year, there\u2019s a thing called liberalization of mana crystal, a child who turned 10 years old that year can visit for free only on that day.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so you went and visited the mana crystal and acquired lightning magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>I was so happy when I acquired the lightning magic,</p><br/><p>and then, a man, who introduced himself as a magic researcher, heard that I acquired lightning magic. He came over accompanied with an appraiser and said that they will cast\u3010Appraisal\u3011on me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAppraisal?</p><br/><p>Since you\u2019re a demonkind, isn\u2019t it bad for you to be appraised?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m a demonkind at that time.</p><br/><p>I, who was so happy, had consented to the\u3010Appraisal\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh oh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, they found out that I\u2019m a demonkind.</p><br/><p>I became an outcast, </p><br/><p>and managed to somehow escape from the human\u2019s country.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why I arrived at the demonkind\u2019s country after a struggle.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is it because of the trauma of that time that the King of the demonkind hates\u3010Appraisal\u3011?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

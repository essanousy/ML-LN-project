This way.\u300f</p><br/><p>When I followed the toki, there was a stairway toward the bottom in the center of the islet.</p><br/><p>It seems to be a little bigger than the entrance of the subway.</p><br/><p>The toki climbs down the stairway while stooping a little.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat on earth is this place?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019ll understand once we get there.\u300f</p><br/><p>Well, this stairway is awfully long.</p><br/><p>We have probably climbed down roughly 50 m or so?</p><br/><p>After a short while, we finally reached the end of the stairway</p><br/><p>and an entrance of some kind could be seen.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s here.\u300f</p><br/><p>When I was urged by the toki and went inside\u2015</p><br/><p>there was a huge dome-shaped room.</p><br/><p>I recognize this room.</p><br/><p>It seems to be the same room as the one in the tower of sunrise\u2019s underground where I fought the golem.</p><br/><p>\u300cAm I by any chance going to fight you here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eFight? Why?\u300f</p><br/><p>Hm? It\u2019s wrong?</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I fought in a room like this when I contracted the Earth spirit so, I thought\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s also a spirit who likes to fight among the spirits.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not that good at fighting.\u300f</p><br/><p>Considering all that, didn\u2019t you beat the people who came to attack at their own game?</p><br/><p>\u300eOur objective is that.\u300f</p><br/><p>When I looked at where the toki was pointing at with its wing\u2015</p><br/><p>there was a mana crystal!</p><br/><p>\u300cMana crystal!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s the\u3010Space-time mana crystal\u3011.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cThe space-time magic also has a mana crystal, huh.</p><br/><p>Am I going to visit that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, that\u2019s why I invited you.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cBut I already acquired the\u3010space-time magic\u3011, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eYou can\u2019t master the\u3010space-time magic\u3011properly yet.</p><br/><p>You will be able to master it once you visit.\u300f</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t master the\u3010space-time magic\u3011, it said!?</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s a time when my activities become a web novel, I wonder if there will be a\u3010space-time magic\u3011in the title since I keep using it\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u300eCome along, please go and visit.\u300f</p><br/><p>I swallowed hard with *gulp*</p><br/><p>and touched the mana crystal timidly.</p><br/><p>And then-!</p><br/><p>the mana crystal started to emit an intense light.</p><br/><p>What on earth is this?

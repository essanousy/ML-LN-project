Azide-san was working at Shinju town. While Nancy was staying in Greece from India via Turkey.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, since it\u2019s Golden Week from today onwards, during the holidays, let\u2019s quickly solve the matter about the war!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? It\u2019s golden week for Oniichan from today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I will have a six-day paid leave, so 16 consecutive holidays.\u300d1</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s enviable.~ I want a paid leave too.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right. Aya has to go back on Monday because of the Junior College. Are you going to stay at home this time, Aya?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo way, don\u2019t leave me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped. We\u2019ll return on Sunday night and go to the other side again on Monday morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf we\u2019re going over to the other side on Monday, when are we going to return?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFriday, I think?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhh.. Showa day?\u300d2</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, on Showa day. That\u2019s why we won\u2019t be able to go back and forth for a day on Wednesday.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I will be alone this week?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is no helping it because we\u2019re going to solve the matter about the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not your fault, Elena-chan. Un, it\u2019s because of the problem of Elena-chan\u2019s country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKay~\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to\u300eShinju town\u300fusing Teleportation.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> \u300eShinju town\u300fwas in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this amount of soldiers.\u300d</p><br/><p>The\u300eShinju town\u300fhas a military-like atmosphere, it was full of stern looking men.</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, the war has finally begun.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow so?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u300eShinju town\u300fis the nearest town to the demon country that the demon lord governs.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, the soldiers will gather from this town and will march towards the demon country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s what I think.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there\u2019s no movement in the present situation. First, we must gather information.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went around the adventurers\u2019 guild, merchants\u2019 guild and craftsmen\u2019s guild to gather information.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThe survivors of the Scab village were living in the\u300eSlums\u300flocated at the north of the town.</p><br/><p>\u30fbUnder the decree of the King, the aristocrats governing each town were to send the soldiers they have gathered to\u300eShinju town\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u30fbBecause the soldiers have been gathered,\u300eShinju town\u300fis on food shortage.</p><br/><p>\u30fbRumor has it that the organized military units will march in the next few days.</p><br/><p>\u30fbBecause the merchants were also gathered in anticipation for the war\u2019s special procurement, all the inns were full booked.3</p><br/><p>Such was the information we had gathered.</p><br/><p>First, we decided to go to the\u300eSlums\u300flocated at the north of the town.</p><br/><p>But, on the way to the\u300eSlums\u300f, I noticed an abnormal thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, Elena, wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere is something that shows\u300eCaution\u300fup ahead. And a lot of it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Monsters?4 But, inside the town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know if they are monsters.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow many?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere are 1000 or more.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c1000!!? You didn\u2019t make a mistake?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know. But, let\u2019s be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we were advancing carefully, a bad odor filled the surroundings. </p><br/><p>I know this smell. It smells like a rotten fish.</p><br/><p>When we advanced deeper inside the area that smelled like a rotten fish, we encountered about five skinheads who walked slowly and blocked the road.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, what, business. Beyond this point, our town, if no business, turn back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve heard that the survivors of the Scab village are here. I want to talk to them, can you let us through?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDunno, go home.\u300d</p><br/><p>Unapproachable.</p><br/><p>I felt uncomfortable and tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on these fellows.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026Understood, sorry for troubling you. You two, let\u2019s leave.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Leave?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked over my shoulders, they went back to the position which wasn\u2019t visible\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cThose fellows are orcs!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? Orc?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, it\u2019s the same smell as an orc.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey are disguised as human beings using\u3010Magic stone of human transformation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEe!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Using the\u3010Magic stone of human transformation\u3011that the goblins made, the orcs snuck into the human town? I wonder what they are up to.</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, the\u300eScab village survivors\u300fis just a deception and their true objective is to sneak into the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I summoned the lightning spirit and asked it to scout the\u300eSlums\u300fout with Aya\u2019s beacon on.</p><br/><p>\u300cI specialized in attacking. Recently, it\u2019s nothing but reconnaissance!\u300dThe lightning spirit complained.</p><br/><p>I felt uneasy. I was almost certain that before long, the situation might turn into something where the lightning spirit needs to go on a rampage.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let\u2019s go back to the town and gather information about the\u300eSlums\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOkay.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>We went back to the town. I was able to hear something from the elderly staff of the merchants\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, the\u300eSlums\u300fgradually grew bigger a few years ago.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa, it is so. Since there\u2019s an unpleasant smell, no one approaches it. It\u2019s troublesome.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did the people over there do about things like food.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe aristocrat ruling this town seems to provide food to the\u300eSlums\u300fin large quantities. Because the survivors of the Scab village can\u2019t be left alone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat kind of relationship does the Scab village and the\u300eSlums\u300fhave?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that respect, I don\u2019t know much. There was a merchant who was from the\u300eSlums\u300fand came into this town. Because he commonly went in and out of the Scab village, he might be the only one you could rely on.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA merchant from the\u300eSlums\u300f!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI heard that that merchant seemed to witness the Scab village when it was attacked by the demon lord\u2019s army.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, the root of this war\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBased on the testimony, there was a crack formed between the demons leading to this situation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>After listening to the story of the merchants\u2019 guild staff, we left the guild. The lightning spirit also came back.</p><br/><p>\u300cAno, in the.\u300eSlums\u300f\u30fb\u30fbthere was nothing but orcs.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing but orcs\u30fb\u30fb!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I tried to verify the video.</p><br/><p>A guy who used\u3010Magic stone of human transformation\u3011was guarding near the entrance and inside the\u300eSlums\u300fwas full of orcs.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, this might be bad.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYour otousama, I think he is being tricked by the goblins and orcs.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s highly likely.\u300d</p><br/><p>Translators notes and references:</p><br/><p>1Uh\u2026 correct me if I\u2019m wrong, so starting from the current day, Saturday, April 23 to 24th (his day-offs), April 25 to 28th (paid leave), April 29 to May 5th (Golden Week), May 6 to 9th (day-offs and his remaining paid leave), totaled 16 days?\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Sh\u014dwa Day (\u306e Sh\u014dwa no Hi?) is a Japanese annual holiday held on April 29. It honors the birthday of the Sh\u014dwa Emperor (Hirohito), the reigning emperor from 1926 to 1989.[1] The purpose of the holiday is to encourage public reflection on the turbulent 63 years of Hirohito\u2019s reign. \u2013 Wikipedia\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Uh\u2026 can someone please explain what is this special procurement?\u21a9</p><br/><p>4I\u2019m translating mamonos as monsters i.e Goblins and Orcs while Mazoku as Demons</p><br/>\n</div>"}

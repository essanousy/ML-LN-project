For the time being let\u2019s put it away in the inventory.\u300d</p><br/><p>The rotten-fish-smelled Orc was put away in the inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cN? That\u2019s all?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s it, why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I was just wondering, why\u2019d you told those people to get back first?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it would be bad if I were to be seen using inventory. By the way Elena, while we were fighting the Orc, did you said something to those guys?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThose people said\u300eIt\u2019s dangerous, let\u2019s escape first.\u300f. But I said to them\u300eI can\u2019t just escape while Seiji-sama is fighting.\u300f, they couldn\u2019t understand me and was troubled.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300eTo run away first\u300fhuh~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNii-chan, is there something you also worried about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen the Orc approached earlier, I sensed\u300eCaution\u300fwith my\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic. After defeating the Orc, I also sensed\u300eCaution\u300ffrom the adventurers.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? In other words~ you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, I want to ask, in the vicinity of this town, does orc appears frequently?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I haven\u2019t heard such a story.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen adventurers were attacked by a monster, if they escape to the town while being chased by it, isn\u2019t it bad?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know the rules of the adventurers well but an appearance of a monster in town is no good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words~, those adventurers are bad guys?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a possibility.\u300d</p><br/><p>In front of me, I projected an image of the adventurer who I cast track onto so the two could see it.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, how did he do that!? What a bummer.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eNo way, to knock down that orc.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are we going to say to the client!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cTh-this is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a surveillance video of those adventurers, it\u2019s a magic I cast a while ago.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eI wonder how much that\u3010Monster ball\u3011costs.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThe cancellation fee of the request is a problem.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIf we can\u2019t pay, are we going to be sold off as slaves?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, do you know what a\u3010Monster ball\u3011is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a magic tool to catch monsters. You\u2019ll need to put to sleep, paralyze or severely weaken a monster and then throw the\u3010Monster ball\u3011to it, the monster will then be locked up inside the ball. When you use a\u3010Monster ball\u3011with a monster inside, it\u2019s possible to summon that monster anywhere.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, it\u2019s possible that the Orc was summoned using\u3010Monster ball\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTh-they\u2019re entering a mansion.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s true, is the mastermind in this mansion?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat! It failed!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, have you seen this guy!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis person is\u2026\u3010Lyle Gewalt Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? This guy\u2019s hand\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWe instigate the\u3010Monster ball\u3011as usual but it was only brought down by that man\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThe Orc was defeated!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, for such an opponent, we could\u2019t cope with\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s enough, put a\u3010Slave collar\u3011to these guys and locked them up in the dungeon!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eS-such!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this, the\u3010Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011is the mastermind. But, this guy, how did he heal his wrist?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s with the wrist?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis guy was supposedly has his wrist severely wounded but it is now healed for some reason. Was it healed by magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow much of the injury was healed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was completely gone from the wrist.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor such a severe wound\u2026\u2026 But, that kind of severe wound, can\u2019t be healed by magic completely.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, how?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAssuming that kind of remedy is possible\u2026\u2026 perhaps it\u2019s an\u3010Elixir\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there such a medicine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Elixir\u3011is a legendary grade medicine, but it wasn\u2019t easy to obtain.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c An\u3010Elixir\u3011will make people\u2019s heart beat like crazy. Let\u2019s go see the merchant guild whether it\u2019s available or not.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, those fellows have been locked up in the dungeon, what are we going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet see~\u3010Aristocracy Union Knight Leader\u3011seemed to be dangerous, let\u2019s just stay vigilant for the time being.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re not going to help them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s troublesome.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, if you say so onii-chan, then it\u2019s good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, are we going to go back in town soon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, let\u2019s. I\u2019m hungry too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I\u2019m hungry-\u300d</p><br/><p>I held hands with the two as usual and went back to town using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

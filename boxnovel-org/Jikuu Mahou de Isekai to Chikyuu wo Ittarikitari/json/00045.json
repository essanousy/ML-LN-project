What about the time when it was me?</p><br/><p>Once she confirmed that Aya has no injury, Elena rushed towards Luca and began healing her injuries.</p><br/><p>Luca\u2019s scratches were healed in an instant, Luca was surprised by the power of Elena\u2019s recovery magic and using both her hands, she greatly shook Elena\u2019s hands, expressing her gratitude towards Elena.</p><br/><p>The competition is also a good experience for Elena, it was really a right decision to participate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You're safe!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela approached with momentum to hug me\u2015</p><br/><p> she stopped midway, took my hand and shook it.</p><br/><p> Strange Lela.</p><br/><p> Hilda seemed to have also been worried, she tugged the hem of my clothes and looked up with a pleasant smile.</p><br/><p> Hilda is so cute~. I'll pat her head.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Whilst having breakfast, I've talked about the tower of sunrise's underground to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, after climbing up the stairs from the underground's fourth floor, we can go to the surface's fourth floor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's something like that, Lela.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, let's go there at once.\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela is very enthusiastic.</p><br/><p> Well, it will be alright since I've already defeated the boss.</p><br/><p> After eating breakfast, we got ready and headed to the tower of sunrise with\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we arrived at the space of the underground's fourth floor, Aya started to be in high spirits.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's so wide!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Something fun, running around with frightful momentum, jumping, playing and generating a tornado.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya~! Stop playing and let's go quickly~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya came back with frightful momentum but\u2015</p><br/><p> she was gasping for breath and sweating profusely by playing too much.</p><br/><p> Are you a child!?</p><br/><p> Elena, Lela and Hilda were all amazed.</p><br/><p> We climbed up the spiral staircase in the central pillar cautiously\u2015</p><br/><p> the stairs had been cut off right when we had climbed up to the surface's third floor and a strange room appeared.</p><br/><p> There's only one door inside the room.</p><br/><p> When I tried to open the door cautiously, the other side of the door turned out to be a room too\u2015</p><br/><p> and there was a\u300eGoblin General\u300fwhich wasn't moving as it slept.</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p> apart from being not particularly high leveled, it also didn't have any special ability, it was a very common goblin general.</p><br/><p> When I finished using\u3010appraisal\u3011and was preparing to fight\u2015</p><br/><p>*Bang!*</p><br/><p> the door had automatically closed.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it an automatic door!?\u300d</p><br/><p> When everyone was paying attention to the door in surprise\u2015</p><br/><p> the door assimilated into the wall and disappeared.</p><br/><p> I checked the wall where the door had disappeared but I couldn't find the door no matter how.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's one-way, huh......\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, I can easily go to the other side of the door if I use\u3010teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p> I don't have any business there though since the other side of the door only lead to the underground's fourth floor so it's particularly fine.</p><br/><p> When I approached the general carefully\u2015</p><br/><p> the general suddenly woke up and attacked!</p><br/><p> When I promptly respond to its attack with the sword of trial\u2015</p><br/><p> the goblin general's head flew with a single stroke.</p><br/><p>\u300cWeak!\u300d</p><br/><p> Apparently, the surface's floors seem to be considerably weaker than the underground's.</p><br/><p>\u300cMou, oniichan is unfair.</p><br/><p> I want to kill too!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I have the sword of trial, give me the prey for a while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMou, there's no helping it~.</p><br/><p> Until the trial is over, 'kay~.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda finished dismantling and brought me a magic stone and equipment.</p><br/><p> The magic stone was a\u3010magic stone of biribiri +1\u3011.</p><br/><p> What a pity, keeping this should be cheap when sold.</p><br/><p> When we were about to climbed up to the fourth floor, immediately\u2015</p><br/><p>*rumble rumble rumble*</p><br/><p> A sound of something can be heard from the wall.</p><br/><p> This wall is a wall opposite to the wall with one-way door.</p><br/><p> When I put myself on guard against what about to happen\u2015</p><br/><p> a part of the wall collapsed and a door appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat kind of door is it, Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm, as far as I can see on the map, it should only lead to the third-floor passage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere are we going to go, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, even if it's a one-way, we can return with\u3010teleportation\u3011so let's go.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I opened the door and advanced cautiously, we appeared on the third-floor passage as expected.</p><br/><p> The door didn't disappear and one could come in and out normally.</p><br/><p> It's completely insignificant for us but......</p><br/><p> even a normal adventurer without\u3010teleportation\u3011can now go to the fourth floor with this.</p><br/><p> Let's report it to the adventurer's guild later.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's go to the fourth floor quickly, oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu!\u300d</p><br/><p> We climbed up the stairs and went to the fourth floor.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> On the fourth floor\u2015</p><br/><p> a grassland which overflows with brightness spread out.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's this!?</p><br/><p> It's a grassland!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya started to run again.</p><br/><p> She's completely a kid......</p><br/><p> Elena finds the flowers blooming and does a\u300eflower picking\u300fwith Hilda.</p><br/><p> Lela watches over Elena and is wary whether there is no enemy.</p><br/><p> There doesn't seem to be an enemy nearby for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, try using this.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a certain magic stone from the inventory and handed it to Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, is this by any chance the one from this morning......\u300d</p><br/><p> When Elena seemed to be glad and bloomed with a smile, she brought the magic stone close to a flower bud that had yet to bloom.</p><br/><p> Then\u2015</p><br/><p> The flower bud unwrapped and its flower bloomed\u2015</p><br/><p> and like a ripple spreading out, the one side of the flower carpet......</p><br/><p> spread throughout the entire grassland.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwawa!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Big and small varicolored flowers stretched out as far as the eye could see\u2015</p><br/><p> and the fragrant floral scent spread throughout the area.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's this!? What did you do, Elena-chan!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUhh...... I......</p><br/><p> just only brought the\u3010magic stone of earth\u3011close to the flower and poured magic power.\u300d</p><br/><p> Although it has been stated that\u300ethe effect is enhanced when loaded with magic power\u300f, to produce a widespread effect like this......</p><br/><p> is amazing, huh.</p><br/><p> All the girls are admiring the flower carpet that stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's take a break here.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a leisure sheet and prepared tea and sweets.</p><br/><p>\u300cWow, it's flower viewing.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya's tension is strange......</p><br/><p> Everyone sits on the leisure sheet, eats sweets and drinks tea whilst appreciating the flowers.</p><br/><p> We enjoyed the flower viewing for a while......</p><br/><p> Multiple red dots which indicates\u3010danger\u3011were approaching.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

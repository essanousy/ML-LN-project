160%;\">\n<p>In the depths of the room which was one level higher and where I defeated the\u300eDragon Eel\u300f, there were stairs which led down below.</p><br/><p> I took off the long trunks, changed into sneakers and started to go down the stairs towards the underground's fourth floor.</p><br/><p> I've been going down the stairs since a little while ago but......</p><br/><p> somehow, I have a foreboding.</p><br/><p> These stairs are smooth and soft as if they have been polished.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe stairs will transform into a slide......\u300d</p><br/><p> No way.</p><br/><p> Halfway down the stairs, I've become unable to take the next step.</p><br/><p>\u300cA trap will surely be activated if I took the next step.\u300d</p><br/><p> My\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic was telling me that.</p><br/><p> ......</p><br/><p> Having said that, there's no other way to go down these stairs.</p><br/><p> I put my foot on the next step cautiously.</p><br/><p>*Shakes!*</p><br/><p> I've heard a sound of something moving\u2015</p><br/><p> and the stairs transformed into a slide as expected.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight~.\u300d</p><br/><p> I strengthen the frictional force under my feet using\u3010Earth magic\u3011and stood in place without slipping.</p><br/><p> But in the end, it's necessary to get off this slide.</p><br/><p> When I'm thinking what to do\u2015</p><br/><p> a rattling sound can be heard upward.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat could it be?\u300d</p><br/><p> The sound was the sound of a huge rock rolling down.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a cliched development!!\u300d</p><br/><p> With the approaching rock from behind, I ran down the slide.</p><br/><p> How far will I have to run?</p><br/><p> The rock is still chasing from behind.</p><br/><p> The next moment, the steps had been terminated exhilaratingly.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I wonder what happened.</p><br/><p> The slide has been terminated midway and I've been thrown in the air.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis may be bad!\u300d</p><br/><p> I concentrated my whole energy to grasp the situation whilst free-falling.</p><br/><p> There was a vast space the size of a domed baseball stadium spread out at the bottom and I would soon hit the stone floor below.</p><br/><p> After casting\u3010Body reinforcement\u3011magic on myself, I concentrated on preparing to reduce the impact with\u3010Earth magic\u3011and got ready for crashing with the ground.</p><br/><p>*Thud!!*</p><br/><p> As I landed, I dispersed the shock with\u3010Earth magic\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p> and the shock which couldn't be removed ran through my whole body.</p><br/><p>\u300cOuchh!!\u300d</p><br/><p> I've got both my feet numb with the fall's impact.</p><br/><p> When I forcibly detached my numb feet off of the floor,</p><br/><p> I jumped forward with all my might and rolled over.</p><br/><p>Thuuuuud!</p><br/><p> Immediately after, the rock which had been rolling over from behind fell on the place where I've been a little while ago.</p><br/><p>\u300cHah.\u300d</p><br/><p> I wiped the sweat off of my brows.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I finally regained my composure and surveyed my surroundings.</p><br/><p> There were 64 pillars lined up in a circle at equal intervals surrounding the space slightly larger than a baseball field.</p><br/><p> However, about five of them haven't reached the bottom and are in the state of hanging.</p><br/><p> Is it a shoddy construction?</p><br/><p> A huge pillar also stood in the center of the space, near it......</p><br/><p> a huge stone statue stood.</p><br/><p> Is that the boss of this floor?</p><br/><p> Well, anyhow, there is no other enemy so it will be easier to battle a single monster.</p><br/><p> However, the atmosphere is clearly different from other floors.</p><br/><p> Did I by any chance finally reach the very bottom?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I tried to approached the stone statue cautiously.</p><br/><p> Then, the stone statue raised its head and its eyes flashed dangerously.</p><br/><p> And, at the same time, from underneath the outermost wall of the underground space, a shining barrier-like something appeared and wrapped the whole underground space up in a hemispherical shape.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's that!?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011to that shining barrier-like something\u2015</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Spatial Combat Protective Barrier\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A barrier which doesn't let a shock go outside,</p><br/><p>\u2502until it's released, it's impossible to escape.</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible to escape!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I tried to use\u3010Teleportation\u3011as a test\u2015</p><br/><p> although it can be used inside the barrier, it can't be used to move outside!</p><br/><p> This is dangerous!</p><br/><p> I have to fight with my full strength!</p><br/><p> First, I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011to the enemy.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Race: Earth

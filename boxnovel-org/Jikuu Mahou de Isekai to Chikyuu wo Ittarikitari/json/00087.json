Ah, Elena! How wonderful, you\u2019ve come back safely. Hurry, come over here!\u300d</p><br/><p>In the audience hall, other than the King and the magician who summoned me, there was only a small number of soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t come back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI went to the\u300eScab village\u300fwith the Hero.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u300eScab village\u300fwas ruled by the goblin army led by the goblin prince. The people who were abducted were forced to work.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cForced to work? What do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe people were threatened by the goblins and were forced to make\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic stone of human transformation\u3011? What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook here, this is the\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>I showed the\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011to the King, the King ordered the magician to used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on it.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s certainly a\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011. It\u2019s\u300eA magic stone that can transform the appearance of the user to Human.\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe also found out that the orcs have snuck into the\u3010Slums\u3011of\u300eShinju town\u300fusing this\u300eMagic stone of Human transformation\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSpeaking of\u300eShinju town\u300f\u2019s\u300eSlums\u300f\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. As for the merchant from the slums who reported that the\u300eScab village\u300fhad been attacked by the demon lord\u2019s army, I think it was a goblin or an orc disguised as a human using\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama, you\u2019ve been deceived by the goblins and orcs! Please stop this war immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026No, it\u2019s different.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you mean by \u2018it\u2019s different\u2019?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe start of the war against the demon lord\u2019s army\u2026 wasn\u2019t because of the\u300eScab village\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? Then, what exactly was the cause?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn addition to that, a demon snuck into this castle and tried to abduct you, Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? I haven\u2019t heard such a story.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI thought it would scare you so we remained silent.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But, was it really a demon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m sure. The demon snuck in but as soon as it was discovered, it ran away. There were 3 maids and a gardener who saw its appearance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, just a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, Hero.\u300d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re still calling me Hero? Oh well.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe maids and the gardener, can you call them here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand. Oi, somebody go and call them.\u300d</p><br/><p>After a while, one of the soldiers brought the 3 maids and the male gardener\u2015</p><br/><p>But. This gardener smells like something.</p><br/><p>\u300cAll of you, tell us about the time when you saw the demon.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the maids began to answer.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere was a report that someone invaded the castle so we went to confirm the princess\u2019 safety. When we arrived in front of the princess\u2019 room,\u300esomething\u300fsuddenly appeared, it was many times larger than a Human. When we screamed, it ran away. That\u2019s all.\u300d</p><br/><p>What? </p><br/><p>The gardener began to answer next.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen, I went to, check, the garden. There was, demon. Demon, escaped.\u300d</p><br/><p>The witnesses\u2019 testimonies are over and it\u2019s my turn to interrogate.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, let me ask the maids. The one you had seen, was it really a demon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEto\u2026we weren\u2019t sure because it was dark.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo the 3 of you have the same answer?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, it\u2019s certainly not a human.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, the next question is for the gardener. \u2026\u2026You, what is your objective?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t understand, the question.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll say it again clearly. An orc sneaking into a human castle, what is your objective?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you talking about, Hero!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow should I put it, it smells like a rotten fish!\u300d</p><br/><p>The gardener who had its smell pointed out suddenly ran away.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Electric shock\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa!\u300d</p><br/><p>The gardener was paralyzed by the electric shock and collapsed on the ground. For the time being, it seems that it\u2019s still breathing.</p><br/><p>I approached the gardener and searched its body. I found a\u300ecertain thing\u300f.</p><br/><p>When I took away the\u300ecertain thing\u300ffrom the gardener\u2015</p><br/><p>*Buwatsu!* The gardener\u2019s body grew blurry and its appearance suddenly turned into a black orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cAn orc!? H-, Hero, what is the meaning of this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it like what Elena said? It\u2019s the\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cC-, Could it be\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat \u2018something not human\u2019 that the maids had seen, was it this fellow?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2026 probably.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, what are you going to do? The demons have been falsely accused.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama, since you now know that it wasn\u2019t a demon\u2019s work, please stop the war immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The King fell silent. Well, if you suddenly learned such a thing, it\u2019s only natural to be confused.</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama! Please, do it quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s already too late, the war can no longer be stopped\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMobilizing this kind of large-scale army, the demon lord\u2019s army won\u2019t stay silent too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The audience hall was wrapped in a heavy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, shall we stop the war?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Stupid, it\u2019s impossible to do such a thing!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing, you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand. But, leave Elena behind!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKing, do you know?~ Elena is strong, she even defeated the goblin prince, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, what\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s possible that Elena is their target. We won\u2019t know what will happen if she get dragged into the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTarget? What do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe demon\u2026\u2026 No, when this orc invaded, it was aiming for Elena\u2019s room. Its purpose was probably to abduct Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the one to talk, even though you trapped Elena in prison.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s different.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s different about that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026 the safest place in this castle, is that prison.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere were several layers of locks and also, a large amount of soldiers were deployed to guard it. But, you, Hero, managed to abduct Elena from there.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, locks didn\u2019t have any effect against\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince then, we conducted a large-scale search. Though we finally found a trace, we tried to take her back using an underhanded method. But it was easily seen through, after that, we could no longer find any trace.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, there were times when we had to return to Japan and because we were using\u3010Teleportation\u3011, it wasn\u2019t easy to be discovered.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs it is, if we mobilize a large-scale troops to take her back, there would be a possibility of being discovered by the enemy. More importantly, it\u2019s definitely safer under the Hero\u2019s protection than inside the castle. After my discussion with Lyle Gewalt, I decided to let the Hero protect Elena as is.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so that was why there was no one who came after us.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStill, otousama, I\u2019ll go and stop the war with the Hero. This is my\u300eObligation\u300fwho was born as a Royalty.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, with such a reason, please give it up.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand. But Hero, you must protect Elena at all cost.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I know.\u300d</p><br/><p>This fellow is seriously caring for Elena. But he is hopeless as a King\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let me do some things before we go and stop the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you need to do, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, it\u2019s this fellow!\u300d</p><br/><p>I approached the unconscious black orc, ripped its clothes open and shoved the\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011into the breast pocket. Its appearance returned to that of the gardener.</p><br/><p>And then, I tied its hands behind its back and forcefully wake it up by splashing water over its face using water magic. </p><br/><p>Because it seemed it couldn\u2019t speak words while in orc form.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi! Wake up!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*Bumotsu*\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOrcy-sama, tell us everything! What are the goblins and orcs up to?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUgu\u2026\u2026 at, failure\u2026\u2026 information, speak, no good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you don\u2019t talk, I\u2019ll make your eyes horrible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFailure, death\u2026\u2026 *gutsu!* *gugetsu!!*\u300d</p><br/><p>The gardener suddenly started to groan and instantly ceased to breathe.</p><br/><p>Its appearance also reverted back to being a black orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It\u2019s no use. It\u2019s already dead.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy did it become suddenly like this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt might be under a curse.\u300d</p><br/><p>We weren\u2019t able to get any information and left a bad taste in our mouths.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In retrospect, I want to prank her...... I (and the spirit) sneaked into that girl's room with [Night shade] by using [Teleportation]. Is this a prank chance?</p><p class=\"kbqNNvLtqIWNkyONkPSH\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"yTAXIohygPjWiIjUIVRc\">That girl was messing with her cell phone in her jersey appearance.</p><p class=\"yLLhVFQRxSPxqitXqXhF\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XXxgqvxnCcetPqQslakV\">She has a traditional Japanese-style cell phone? Doesn't she have any money?</p><p class=\"tjjKZBWaMRNniYnQmAGa\">[EN: The \"traditional Japanese-style cell phones\", from what I understand, are just those old flip phone models, which still are a popular trend in Japan nowadays apparently. A popular brand for these is called Softbank and another popular clich\u00e9 attached to these phones is the \"Gal\" girl stereotype.]</p><p class=\"KJcIWTVxzVrSHdgubKwP\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"pgxsmRuXnjFfWvdGUcnO\">When I approached with sneaky steps to prank her while I\u00b4m invisible.......</p><p class=\"QYambHgeUVZypQdjwCbq\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"hIlYLuunwKgFcLoHVRxZ\">RingRing!</p><p class=\"uBAgQhbHEbhIcpGhMEut\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"knFzTMlxgFXVoCcXIXWL\">Suddenly the phone rang!</p><p class=\"noDQrByoykEOAMDmUVbG\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"rPddtqXorEdrkrPIRYyK\">I was surprised and thought that my heart would jump out of my mouth........</p><p class=\"DujVjSNhrxETpcpGeeJh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"WmNYCtcGdkcikTLxwJkc\">\u300cYes\u300d</p><p class=\"HEXBpvXZFaHgexTrpGWz\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"esMCldRSZrKxoAujJUKn\">The girl hurried to the phone.</p><p class=\"reuSyEBtpOAikTKeSUvc\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"agLTRPLLkOxasMOLKqLo\">I confirmed the screen, and it was the phone number of the mastermind.</p><p class=\"OkpBYaloMzmOvpbyZZbI\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"yXQNYoMXquvURbWUHgov\">What a timid omenism.</p><p class=\"EMNGIHnOWJbteKzvQBYf\">[EN: The word here comes from \"omen\". Just clearing it up since someone told me it might come from onanism... and trust me, that is something completely different, R18 stuff.]</p><p class=\"PUXAutqVswTsOdgrPuds\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"LvkPBCEWGWAaEcrkiRDP\">I ask Super Oracle-chan (Lightning-chan version) to reverse detection with a gesture. My intention seems to have been transmitted, and Super Oracle-chan (Lightning-chan version) is inside the cell phone when the girl talks.</p><p class=\"LjLOAVWszMEldhGrvZwN\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"gAnngEJgawVnWKfLchLC\">\u300cAh, I'm sorry, the condition of the radio wave is now a bit....... It's okay, sorry\u300d</p><p class=\"WKuHPgJXRmmpyvmUtHTG\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"FymaLhusabEYvHpKfHZb\">It seems that there was a disturbance in the radio waves, but it appears that there was no problem in particular, so the girl continued with the call.</p><p class=\"pNTWcDcJCdhMKQPNQuiZ\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"DPNtFBkZKjMTQgeQnLAj\">After that, while looking at the image of [Tracking beacon], I just waited for reverse detection to be completed.</p><p class=\"AtgGyXUkxdaZWOxAdUAv\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"cWgRuGUogqJjVsimQorP\">\u300cTh, That.......

Somewhat, the clouds are getting doubtful.</p><p class=\"UFDewnXUhCXdwdDxePJi\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"KksOOPSEzbInJiIXeDuT\">Well, I wonder if I can somehow hear the other party's voice? I might be noticed if I get too close.......</p><p class=\"RrXaZVeCqYpcnOjvnKpS\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"McFBmaOXqGelpZAEAdbe\">When I thought, I could hear the voice of the mastermind whom the girl talked with.</p><p class=\"KAqKbUkeWpYmoHSiaSAu\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"WXsDQBEIbZRFQXPscsAv\">\u300eIn the first place, it may be because you failed! There is no one who would fail such a simple task!\u300f</p><p class=\"CqbAftDyTYunmkktPVzf\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"AgXLqqBmQGYsYRBttVAF\">When thinking about it, Oracle-chan succeeded in [Reverse detection], and the voice came from the [Tracking beacon] on that side.</p><p class=\"GopxQJQLjvltDqMtvTps\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"BzsSlMnfcGPPdpLVTrvu\">\u300cWhy don't you just give me something else.......

What are they talking about?</p><p class=\"uHWwhGBtgfLFqGBgxpOX\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"DShjtnHJbFqScOkrqeKY\">\u300eIt was written properly in the agreement signed by you in the past, and you are supposed to compensate for any damages caused by failing your work.

The price setting of 100 million yen in the first place is stupid. Do you deceive minors with such a contract?</p><p class=\"pwNtGrwcGhysfQhHGQKa\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"dFRUNyBEiBaxUMUDljbK\">I'll go to the mastermind for a moment.</p><p class=\"TfIFamRknCVcjWXsEvgA\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"cWnYUGDqMdWKeEvvLsGB\">-----</p><p class=\"crmGMIseoTiYqGtIKpiK\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"wFNcYwNnFxCpefBBCQeG\">I relocated to the location of Oracle-chan's tracking beacon and moved to the mastermind\u00b4s side in an instant.</p><p class=\"pdmvFNXvSEKCHHyTXZsU\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"vzCdYvbXOVUbqEmlwjTd\">The place was like a president's office room where there are plenty of gorgeous things with bad taste. I am there with a bad guy with a blind eye around 40 years old. Is he the mastermind......?</p><p class=\"ZizDvLaEEdSvRyEUkdIT\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XKLwpFGsnAQeCliLZAZU\">\u300cI understand, it's 100 million yen, I will sell you overseas if you can't pay it!\u300d</p><p class=\"jvHvEtuespfFogHNRzrT\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"oDDvkrnKJgWDLHwruUrz\">The mastermind said absurd words and ended the call with the daughter.</p><p class=\"HAcoWtJRLjpmiYrmowAB\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"DScCkpQHPryRJmQcoZgo\">\u300cGaGaGa! What a fool! What a foolish girl! Being deceived by such a fake contract! But, I will sell someone who can't be used anymore away quickly to someone, so I wonder if I can get a single shot before that\u300d</p><p class=\"NuyZkAokGCKyrMqEJTen\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"FhCsxgbrkpGtaujsWwZb\">Are you guilty?</p><p class=\"lSxGbQDxQFVkgUYsUtAC\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"hnqcmIWFjyFwQNQvirFc\">When I appreciated the mastermind, the name was Kuroyama, and his occupation was president of an entertainment company.</p><p class=\"NtlAkHJBmLQmBCofBTVD\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"vDOYSTzLOduHWjArLpVk\">I see, it's Megumi's dad\u00b4s rival.</p><p class=\"WTEfuVQKRbkdeigklKVE\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"aLRjScuDYYfZBmfSRQMJ\">In that case, what he is doing is too vicious.......</p><p class=\"RPtdVmULYDTAYWYyRiOv\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"TxXQwvHEkdKpOETHrsnT\">Well, I knew the identity of the mastermind so how shall I deal with him?</p><p class=\"zwJeqqvIEpsnBNxbhcBx\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"YHcMeeThGqNACUEYXzjh\">For the time being, I collected Super Oracle-chan and approached the mastermind for an attack.</p><div><div></div></div><p class=\"BKQvoOtOXBcRqPAcrvun\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"SttIUwZpQngAcwpzpaLr\">KnockKnockKnock.</p><p class=\"EvMbKmqLYIKxMAfTTqPO\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"PEcpJVjaLXFpbTqnmOXz\">Uwa!

A little more and I would have punished him.</p><p class=\"ODDOYjUZiZXBMVZSJCaz\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"qoCmovVRvvByDSukzKDq\">It is hard to put out my hands when he is with others.

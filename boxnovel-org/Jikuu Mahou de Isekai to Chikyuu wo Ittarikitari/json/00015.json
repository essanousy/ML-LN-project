This girl is the Princess of the Delaidos Kingdom, Princess Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd this noisy person here is Maruyama Aya, my little sister.\u300f</p><br/><p> Aya is currently 18 years old, she passed the exams for a junior college and will soon be attending. The reason she came to my place is to commute from here to the junior college. I heard she would be coming soon, however I completely forgot about it.</p><br/><p>\u300cAledos Kingdom? Princess? Nii-chan, is there something wrong with your head?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I\u2019m telling you the truth.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eSo you are Seiji-sama\u2019s little sister.

This current interpretation, is there some way to solve it~</p><br/><p>PIKON!</p><br/><p> That\u2019s it! I can use the\u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011.</p><br/><p> I handed Elena the \u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011that I had been carrying for awhile.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh right, if I have this, I\u2019ll be able to understand the language of Seiji-sama\u2019s country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Japanese!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-sama, it is a pleasure to meet you.

A-Aya-sama! What are you!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya who was embrassing Elena, begun to caress her. Elena fell into a panic from being embraced suddenly.</p><br/><p> Well, it\u2019s good that these two are intimate, but I can\u2019t help but wonder what is going to happen from now on\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although I'm quite worried,</p><br/><p> I entrusted it to Aya and went to work.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood morning, Maruyama-kun.\u300d</p><br/><p> At the entrance of the company, the President, and the Director greeted me.</p><br/><p> What on earth is this!?</p><br/><p> While being looked at by other people with strange looks,</p><br/><p> I was seized by the president and the director and was brought behind closed doors.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat on earth is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIya, we've been waiting for you, Maruya-kun.\u300d</p><br/><p> The eyes of the president and the director are scary for some reason.</p><br/><p> The president put something which seems to be heavy in front of me.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's a duralumin case.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is, you will understand once you see it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, please accept it without saying anything.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I have a foreboding......</p><br/><p> that feeling seems to be strong when the president carried the duralunim case.</p><br/><p> Well, having said that, I have no choice but to accept, right?</p><br/><p> The director added a few words from the side too.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy share is also included.</p><br/><p> By the way, the president and my share's ratio is a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p> Is that so, oh, well.</p><br/><p> All day long of that day, I was working while occasionally looking at the duralumin case.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> The duralunim case was troubling, I couldn't feel relax at all,</p><br/><p> but I somehow managed to finish that day's work, and when I got back to the house, I became completely exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm home.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWelcome home!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> Since Elena and Hilda greeted me, my fatigue vanished in an instant.</p><br/><p> Well, should we try to check its content~?</p><br/><p> I was scared and didn't check it inside the company.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere will be lot of bills inside, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah......\u300d</p><br/><p> Inside the duralumin case were bundles of 1 million yen bill, and there were 100 bundles......</p><br/><p> an unpleasant sweat trickled down my forehead.</p><br/><p> what to do about this......</p><br/><p> When I look closely, only one of the 100 bundle had a currency band of a different bank.</p><br/><p> I see, it's 99 to 1, huh......</p><br/><p> I quietly put it away into the inventory.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I drank the coffee that Elena made to calm my mind\u2015</p><br/><p> I got a phone call from Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300eHello, onii-chan?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat happened, Aya? Have you found Yurie-san?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eNo, I haven't.</p><br/><p> She didn't go to the school, even when I asked her acquaintances, nobody knows......</p><br/><p> So, I will go to Yurie-san's house with Captain after this.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see, if anything happens, call me at once.</p><br/><p> Since I will go immediately if my help is necessary.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUn, understood, I'll call you later again.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cThey haven't found Yurie-san yet?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, just what on earth has happened~?\u300d</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> After a while, I got a call from Aya again.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat is it, Aya?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWe arrived at Yurie-san's mansion right now....</p><br/><p> it looks strange after all.</p><br/><p> Come here, onii-chan.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI understand, I will go at once.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, Hilda, since I will go to Yurie-san's house, please take care of the house.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> Both Elena and Hilda looked worried.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry to have kept you waiting.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're slow, onii-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's not even one minute passed after I hung up the phone, you know?</p><br/><p> Let's leave it at that.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this Yurie-san's mansion?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, no doubt.\u300d</p><br/><p> It definitely looked strange.</p><br/><p> First, the continuous sound of running water can be heard.</p><br/><p> The water tap has probably been left open.</p><br/><p> Next, the electricity meter installed on the door is spinning round and round.</p><br/><p> The electricity has probably been left turned on.</p><br/><p> Nevertheless, even if I ring the doorbell, or hit the door, there's no reaction at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, it looked strange, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that's right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-san, can't you enter the room using warp?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can only go to places I've been to.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut you used warp to come here, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's because of the beacon attached to Aya, I moved here using it as a landmark.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see......\u300d</p><br/><p>Pikon!</p><br/><p>\u300cI've came up with a good idea.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a wire from the inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I understand, we're going to open the lock with that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's not it, Aya. Watch carefully.\u300d</p><br/><p> I installed a\u3010tracking beacon\u3011on the tip of the wire,</p><br/><p> and inserted the wire from the door's mailbox.</p><br/><p> Then, I displayed the\u3010tracking beacon\u3011's video so that Aya and Mai-san can see it.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, the inside can be seen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is amazing, it's totally like endoscope.\u300d</p><br/><p> Just like that, I controlled the wire using\u3010Earth magic\u3011and kept moving toward the inner part.</p><br/><p> When it went through the mailbox's small window toward the inner part, the hallway was visible.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe electricity of the hallway has been left turned on.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's not normal after all.</p><br/><p> When it advance further, there's a toilet and a bathroom on the right.</p><br/><p> I controlled the wire and tried to open the bathroom's door, but Yurie-san wasn't inside.</p><br/><p> Oi, Aya, why are you looking at me with such eyes!?</p><br/><p> Isn't it serious if she collapsed inside?</p><br/><p> Next, I surveyed the bathroom,</p><br/><p> the hot water had been left as it was, and it continued to overflow from the bathtub.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, can't you turn the faucet off?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's leave such a thing for later.\u300d</p><br/><p> When it went out of the bathroom and down the hallway, there was a kitchen.</p><br/><p> In the kitchen, there was a large cake that was left unfinished.</p><br/><p> Something may have happened to her in the middle of making this cake.</p><br/><p> When it went out of the kitchen and proceeded toward the inner part, there was the living room.</p><br/><p> In the living room, the meals to greet Mai-san were lined up on the entire table.</p><br/><p> However, the meals...had all cooled down.</p><br/><p>\u300cJust like the Mary\u30fbCeleste case\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> In the living room, there was another door, and that way, there was a bedroom.</p><br/><p> There were two pillows set up on the bed......</p><br/><p> I wanted to strongly tsukkomi,</p><br/><p> but Yurie-san's figure was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo good, it seems Yurie-san isn't here.</p><br/><p> It's also better to contact the police.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p> I'll retrieve the wire for now.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-chan, wait a moment!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya suddenly called out while I was retrieving the wire.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook, here.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya pointed at a place in the tracking beacon's video.</p><br/><p> The retrieval of the wire was almost over.</p><br/><p> And, only the front door was being displayed.</p><br/><p> What Aya was pointing at......</p><br/><p> was the door-chain.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's wrong with the door-chain?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI mean, although the door-chain is fastened, there's no people inside, isn't it strange?\u300d</p><br/><p> That's for sure, you can't get out of the door if the door-chain is fastened.</p><br/><p> The door-chain isn't fastened from the outside.</p><br/><p> Strange, if I think about it in common sense, Yurie-san should still be inside.</p><br/><p> What on earth has happened?</p><br/><p> I finished retrieving the wire,</p><br/><p> and Mai-san called the telephone line for the police report.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

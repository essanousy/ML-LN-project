hood.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood evening.</p><br/><p> What are you doing in a place such as this?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I suddenly called out, that person was startled.</p><br/><p> He tried to ignore me and was going to leave hastily.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon't ignore me, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p> I quickly sneaked around and blocked his way.</p><br/><p> Still that person tries to change direction and run away many times.</p><br/><p> When I kept on blocking his way like basketball defense\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cTehanisuwa, kesonu!\u300d</p><br/><p> That person shouted something in an unknown language.</p><br/><p> A language I don't know of?</p><br/><p> I used\u3010Language Acquisition\u3011at once.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cLanguage Acquisition\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Devil

huh!!</p><br/><p> I immediately acquired level 5 devil language</p><br/><p> and tried talking.</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you a devil-kin?</p><br/><p> Why are you in the demon town?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat!?</p><br/><p> A hornless but can understand our language!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHornless?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eLowly people such as hornless, don't speak our holy language!\u300f</p><br/><p> Is the hornless he is referring to the humans?</p><br/><p> That person took out a knife from his breast pocket.</p><br/><p> Whilst holding a sword,</p><br/><p> I tried to also use\u3010Appraisal\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300e!?\u300f</p><br/><p> However, that guy moved quickly and dodged the\u3010Appraisal\u3011magic.</p><br/><p> Not only demonkind but devil-kin can also sense magic, huh!</p><br/><p> The guy flew into a rage and attacked with a knife.</p><br/><p> Dangerous!</p><br/><p> I've barely dodged the knife,</p><br/><p> that knife is obviously smeared with\u300epoison\u300f!</p><br/><p> Even a scratch can become a fatal injury.</p><br/><p> With me dodging his knife stroke, the guy was astonished\u2015</p><br/><p> he seemed to have become considerably wary of me.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou can't escape.</p><br/><p> Why don't you just give up?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI wonder about that.\u300f</p><br/><p> When that guy broke into a grin\u2015</p><br/><p> he took out some kind of a\u300emagic stone\u300ffrom his breast pocket.</p><br/><p>*Buzz buzz!!!*</p><br/><p> I immediately fired off an\u3010electric shock\u3011,</p><br/><p> preventing the magic stone to be used.</p><br/><p>\u300eY-, You......\u300f</p><br/><p> The guy received my electric shock directly,</p><br/><p> he immediately dropped down and lost consciousness.</p><br/><p> After confirming that he completely lost consciousness,</p><br/><p> I approached and removed his hood and\u2015</p><br/><p> it was a young\u300ewoman\u300fwith two grown horns......</p><br/><p> While admiring her face, I tried to use\u3010appraisal\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Name: Natasha</p><br/><p>\u2502Race:

can't be helped, in order to check whether or not she was concealing something dangerous,</p><br/><p> I checked her body.</p><br/><p> It's really because\u300eit can't be helped\u300f!!</p><br/><p> She had two magic stones.</p><br/><p> The first one, the\u3010magic stone of return\u3011.</p><br/><p> She seemed to be going to escape with this a little while ago.</p><br/><p> The second one, the\u3010Magic stone of night shade\u3011.</p><br/><p> There's such a thing, huh!</p><br/><p> She probably used this when she entered the town.</p><br/><p> I confiscated the two magic stones and the knife,</p><br/><p> and I tied up her hands and body with a rope.</p><br/><p> However, it seems to be hard to carry her while unconscious......</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, wake up!\u300f</p><br/><p> I slapped her face and wake her up.</p><br/><p>\u300eWa!? I-, I'm...... what......</p><br/><p> Ku! Untie this rope! This hornless!!\u300f</p><br/><p> She finally woke up, huh.</p><br/><p> However, she's running wild too much......</p><br/><p>\u300eShit! W-, Wedgie......\u300f</p><br/><p> Ah, I didn't particularly\u300etie her up in a strange way\u300f, okay?</p><br/><p> It's true, you know?</p><br/><p> I brought her to where Bunmi-san is.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cThat person! Isn't she a devil-kin!!?</p><br/><p> What happened, Seiji-dono!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo match up with the monsters' invasion,</p><br/><p> she had invaded from the other side of the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eG-, Go ahead and kill me right now.\u300f</p><br/><p> Since there's already that character, don't steal it away!</p><br/><p>\u300cDevil-kin language, huh.</p><br/><p> It's good if I understand what you are saying but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?</p><br/><p> As one would expect of the interpreter!\u300d</p><br/><p> I'm not an interpreter!</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what was the fellow doing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll ask her for a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat did you come here to do?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHumph, I'm not going to say!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems she's not willing to talk.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, then, you want to be tortured, huh!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right! It can't be helped, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I'm feeling cheerful\u2015</p><br/><p> A reaction of multiple devil-kin showed up on the map.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnfortunately, it seems we don't have time for torturing.</p><br/><p> There's a reaction of multiple devil-kin in the direction where the great rats came.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Bunmi-san hurriedly makes the soldiers prepare to intercept.</p><br/><p> The spy woman had been taken by another soldier......</p><br/><p> I-.

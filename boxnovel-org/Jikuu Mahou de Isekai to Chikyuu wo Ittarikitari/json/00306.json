Thank you for your hard work, everyone.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cNo, thank you for your hard work, onii-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>As we think back on the incident that has been resolved, we were finally able to take a breather.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, onii-chan, what happened to the conquering of the tower of sunrise?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAh, now that you've mentioned it, there was also that one, huh. I was able to conquer up to the 59th floor in the end and there\u2019s only the 60th floor left.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Why did you come back when the goal was in front of you? By any chance, is onii-chan the type of person who stops just before the boss in an RPG?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s right on the money, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not it, this time\u2019s event happened right when I was going to the 60th floor, so I came back home in a hurry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Well then, are we going to go to the 60th floor now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, let\u2019s stop for now. Since there\u2019s probably a boss, there\u2019s no time as I\u2019m worn out with work. Let\u2019s go on Saturday with all preparations ready.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, well then, it\u2019s the Tower of Sunrise\u2019s boss fight on Saturday, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Even as the plans on Saturday were decided, the four of us ate dinner together.</p><br/><p>However, while eating dinner, Elena\u2019s countenance is a little strange.</p><br/><p>She seems somewhat down and lost in thought\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When we were drinking tea after the meal, I decided to ask Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, you seem to be down, is something wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, um\u2026\u2026Seiji-sama, I have something to say.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it? You don\u2019t need to stand on ceremony.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s rare for Elena to bring up a subject like this.</p><br/><p>\u300cI learned about it at the church, but in this world, there seem to be a lot of people suffering from injuries and diseases. Because of that, I\u2019ve been thinking. Can\u2019t I help healing those people using my magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmmm, it\u2019s a good thing that Elena is suggesting something she'd like to do independently.</p><br/><p>However, there are various problems with this\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, you know that magic doesn\u2019t exist in this world, right?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt would cause an uproar if Elena uses magic in public just like this time. I don\u2019t want to cause too much uproar if possible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I understand Elena\u2019s feelings as even I would like to do something. </p><br/><p>However\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, too, keeps acting violently in ninja form, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya butted into the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs for that, it can\u2019t be helped because it was to solve the incident. Besides, it\u2019s fine since I covered my face with a mask.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, isn\u2019t it fine for Elena-chan to use magic if she wears a mask, too!?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAre you stupid? No one would believe a suspicious guy wearing a mask to do something like healing wounds and diseases for them, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf a mask is no good, wouldn\u2019t an omen1 mask be fine?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cOmen mask? </p><br/><p> What kind?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, wait a minute.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya took out an omen mask from her [Storage Bracelet].</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about this?\u300d</p><br/><p>It was a Nezumi-Mouse2 omen mask.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re going to make Elena wear this?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cIs it no good? I think it\u2019s cute, though.\u300d</p><br/><p>Whoohoo, it is I, Nezumi-Mouse! </p><br/><p>I will heal your injuries and diseases using recovery magic~!</p><br/><p>Oops, I imagined something strange.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I also have something similar.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, too, took out something from her [Storage Bracelet].</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s this.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena wore the thing she had taken out and showed it to me.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s that. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s something like a masquerade mask.</p><br/><p>However, it has something like a feather decoration; it looks very elegant and suits Elena.</p><br/><p>Elena, who wore that mask, looks just like a [masked magical girl] or some such.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s good! Onii-chan, this is fine, right? Right?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, is this fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>Mmmm, what to do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll give you one condition.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cCondition?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, you should acquire [Invisibility] magic. Then, I\u2019ll say that it\u2019s OK.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c[Invisibility]? Alright, I\u2019ll do my best to acquire it!\u300d</p><br/><p>If she were able to learn [Invisibility], she will be able to escape safely when push comes to shove.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only limited during the day, but since Elena can\u2019t acquire [Darkness Magic], it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>Now, how is she going to go about it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about you, Hilda? Are you going to help Elena?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cNo, uhh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>There are times when even Hilda would like to do something, huh?</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, by any chance, would you like to continue helping Megumi-chan?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYes! I\u2019d like to help Megumi-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve already become close friends.</p><br/><p>There seems to be no problem with regards to this.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, it\u2019s fine.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd then, Hilda will become an idol, too!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, do your best.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYes!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda have found something they\u2019d like to do, huh. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, do you also have something you\u2019d like to do?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Me?\u300d</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t have!?</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see, we will be having a tournament as a club activity this time, but can I go?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Tournament? What kind?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a karate club so, of course, it\u2019s a karate tournament.\u300d</p><br/><p>Karate tournament? </p><br/><p>Aya is going to participate?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026Ugh, my head\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re not going!!!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cWhy not!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Not the bad/good omen kind of thing. It\u2019s a mask used traditionally in Japanese plays, the likes of anbu mask and oni mask, if you\u2019re familiar with them. \u21a9</p><br/><p>Let me see, it\u2019s this guy here. \u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

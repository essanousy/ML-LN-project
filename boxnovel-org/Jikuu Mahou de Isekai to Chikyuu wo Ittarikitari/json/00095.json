An orc appeared at the town\u2019s gate.</p><br/><p>2. When Lela charged, the orc ran away.</p><br/><p>3. Lela chased after the orc who had been lost in sight alone.</p><br/><p>4. The battle against the orc horde had began during Lela\u2019s search.</p><br/><p>5. They learned that a detachment force of the orcs were attacking the town.</p><br/><p>6. They withdrew to the town\u2019s gate and engaged in a defensive battle.</p><br/><p>Lela was completely deceived by the orc\u2019s strategy, huh.</p><br/><p>As the one who commanded the troops, weren\u2019t her actions a bit thoughtless?</p><br/><p>Should I also participate in the war momentarily? Just when I was considering it!</p><br/><p>A soldier from the front line voiced out.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the orcs\u2019 reinforcement!!\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s still more?</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, I\u2019ll be going out in a bit. I\u2019ll entrust this place to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, Seiji-sama. Be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the frontline\u2015</p><br/><p>Around 200 orcs came out of the forest and head towards the town. High orcs can be seen sparsely amongst them.</p><br/><p>As expected, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>I decided to give up quickly.</p><br/><p>What did I give up on? It was to hide my abilities.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011,\u3010Summon lightning spirit\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I exclaimed so, from inside my body, the spirit flew out.</p><br/><p>\u300cFinally, I got bored waiting for my turn. Hm? It feels like my magic power is somehow stronger than usual.\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011also affected the summons as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve kept you waiting.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre those preys? Can I finish them all?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, permission granted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh!!\u300d</p><br/><p>After I gave the confirmation to the spirit, it flew out energetically. I went back to where Elena is.</p><br/><p>I erected a barrier which insulated Lighting and sound around us and the soldiers.</p><br/><p>At the same time as I finished setting the barrier up,</p><br/><p>the surrounding area became pure white and a delayed explosion which can break the eardrum resounded. Though I insulated the sound, the sound probably circumvented around the exterior of the barrier.</p><br/><p>The orcs\u2019 reinforcement had all been roasted brown and a part of the forest had also been burnt.</p><br/><p>As for the soldiers and orcs who were fighting against each other, though they were far from ground zero of the explosion, were knocked unconscious, or paralyzed to move.</p><br/><p>\u300eLevel went up to 31.\u300f</p><br/><p>As one would expect, I also leveled up after defeating that many.</p><br/><p>The allied soldiers, though they received no damage, stood stock still and dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u300cIyaa, it felt gooood.\u300d</p><br/><p>The Spirit, with a clear refreshing smile, went back into my body.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama! Please say it earlier if you\u2019re going to do it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>I was scolded by Elena. (\u3066\u3078\u307a\u308d)*Tehepero*</p><br/><p>After seemingly a moment passed, none of the soldiers could understand what had happened.</p><br/><p>Since the forest has started to burn, I fought fire with\u3010Water magic\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>The soldiers who recovered their wits, started to clean up the remaining orcs.</p><br/><p>During which, I selected the high orc corpses which weren\u2019t burnt too much and put them away in the inventory. </p><br/><p>With High Orc x 20 and Orc x 100, they should sell for a fair amount of money.</p><br/><p>After a while, the sound of the battle ceased. The townspeople fearfully came out and looked at the situation.</p><br/><p>The scene which the townspeople saw was\u2015</p><br/><p>Around 150 orc corpses, though ragged,\u300eIron wall Lela\u300fwith the soldiers survived and defended the town.</p><br/><p>Lela in particular, while having a high aristocratic position as the daughter of the aristocracy union knight leader, fought in the frontline, though ragged, risked her own life and defended the town. (Though, the truth was different.)</p><br/><p>Lela and the soldiers, who finally regained their consciousness, were greeted by the townspeople with loud cheers and applause.</p><br/><p>As for Lela in question\u2015</p><br/><p>though she didn\u2019t know the reason and her eyes turned into dots, paraded forth.</p><br/><p>The fallen orcs were dismantled by the townspeople and cooked, and the victory party was held just like that.</p><br/><p>Elena and I also partake in the oshouban1 a little, after eating our fill\u2015</p><br/><p>We went to Shinju town in secret.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We arrived at Shinju town and headed towards the merchants\u2019 guild first.</p><br/><p>When I went to the reception and inquired about the situation\u2015</p><br/><p>Last night, the foodstuff were stolen and it seemed that the food crisis had become even more serious.</p><br/><p>The purchasing price of 3 times the norm inflated to 5 times.</p><br/><p>I felt embarrassed like I\u2019m profiteering, since the aristocrats were the ones who were going to pay, I decided to sell the foodstuff I just procured.</p><br/><p>When I went towards the warehouse at the back of the guild, the macho-warehouseman seemed to be leisuring out again.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, the lad from before, how are you today? The warehouse is empty today, there\u2019s no food.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve come to deliver foodstuff.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously!? Did you bring the goods using magic again?\u300d</p><br/><p>I put out the 25 kg\u3010Wheat flour\u3011x 10 bag,\u3010Orcs\u3011x 100 and\u3010High orc\u3011x 20 from the inventory and stored them inside the warehouse.</p><br/><p>The macho-warehouseman was surprised again.</p><br/><p>In the end, the wheat flour was sold for 12, 500A x 10, totaled 125, 000A.</p><br/><p>The orcs were sold for 10, 000A x 100, totaled 1, 000, 000A.</p><br/><p>The High orcs were sold for 20, 000A x 20, totaled 400, 000A.</p><br/><p>All in all, it was 1, 525, 000A.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s 152, 500, 000 yen when converted.</p><br/><p>When I add the previous amount, it\u2019s over 200 million yen\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What should I use such a large sum of money for!?</p><br/><p>But, it seems the money will be paid at a later date as expected.</p><br/><p>While thinking about the use of such a large sum of money, we went to the Adventurers\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>It was to report the information about the food theft.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve witnessed the food theft so I\u2019ve come to report.\u300d</p><br/><p>I told the receptionist what I\u2019ve seen in the tracking beacon, I talked as if I\u2019ve seen it myself\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cYou need to tell what you said just now directly to the requester, will that be alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDirectly? Well, it\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve got a letter of introduction and a map.</p><br/><p>We went to where the requester is.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere?\u300d</p><br/><p>There was a military camp whom an aristocrat of some town have brought.</p><br/><p>I handed the letter of introduction to the soldiers guarding the entrance.</p><br/><p>We were guided to the central tent.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, the guy who\u2019ve seen the one who stole the food\u2026\u2026 eh! You\u2019re Seiji! And Elena-sama as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Who are you??\u300d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t recognize this tall man with seemingly conceited look.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, please look at that armor.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena points at the mischievous golden armor. Let me see, I think I\u2019ve seen it somewhere\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! \u300eGolden armored Rondo\u300f!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1\u2018Oshouban\u2019 means \u2018going along together\u2019 and refers to pairing of wines and kaisen.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

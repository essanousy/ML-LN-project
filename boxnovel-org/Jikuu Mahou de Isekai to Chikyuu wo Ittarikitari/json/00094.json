Because I cant\u2019 afford to use Lightning under the watchful gaze of many people. The\u3010Water cutter\u3011was the strongest besides Lightning magic.</p><br/><p>I should\u2019ve also practice more magic other than Lightning.</p><br/><p>Elena was contributing to the battle by healing the injured soldiers and enabling them to return to the frontlines.</p><br/><p>With Elena and my participation, the frontlines had gained the advantage but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That reminds me, Lela was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>When I checked her position through the tracking beacon, Lela was moving away from the battle field.</p><br/><p>What the heck are you doing!?</p><br/><p>When I confirmed Lela\u2019s present situation on the video\u2015</p><br/><p>4 orcs were holding each of her limbs? She was being carried away with her limbs outstretched.</p><br/><p>She had been caught!</p><br/><p>But, these orcs had bodies one size larger than a normal orc.

Moreover, this female, really, ugly. Goblin king, might get angry.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eArmor, high class. If he gets angry, armor, take off, use.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThat, good idea. Armor, once taken off, ugly female, throw away.\u300f</p><br/><p>Those are terrible things to say\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps, orcs and humans have different aesthetic sense.</p><br/><p>Because she was indeed pitiful, with\u3010Teleportation\u3011, I moved in front of the orcs to take Lela away.</p><br/><p>\u300eWait a moment.\u300f</p><br/><p>The orcs were surprised when I suddenly appeared and abruptly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou, who? Human, how, speak?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ve come to help that female.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou came, to help, this, ugly female? You, amusing.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been laugh at by an orc. Shit! </p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on the\u300eOrc\u300f, it was a\u300eHigh orc\u300f. It was a High Rank as expected.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou guys, what do you intend to do by abducting this ugly female? You don\u2019t intend to mate, do you?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUgee! I won\u2019t do, such a thing! If I\u2019m to do it, those pigs, better than, this!\u300f</p><br/><p>That was a terrible thing to say, but of course Lela didn\u2019t understand what had been said, or she would shout\u300cRapist!\u300dor something like\u300cMurderer!\u300dand struggle. Even I didn\u2019t want to see that coming.</p><br/><p>When I took out the Replica Sword and lowered myself into a fighting stance, only two of the High Orcs stepped forward, while the remaining two held Lela.</p><br/><p>The two high orcs and I break into a run simultaneously but the other side\u2019s feet were hit by the Electric shock and came into a stop. The high orcs cooperation had collapsed.</p><br/><p>One of the high orcs drew a sword from its waist and made a side sweep, while dodging it with a jump, I completely cut off its defenseless neck.</p><br/><p>Stepping over the shoulder of the high orc who had its head missing, I jumped over towards the high orc who was paralyzed by the electric shock.</p><br/><p>At the same time the high orc recovered from the electric shock and raised its eyes, its head also rolled over with a *tumble*.</p><br/><p>The two, who held Lela, threw her at the back. They drew their swords from their waist and took a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>Lela was suddenly thrown to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cGya! Ouch! Ouch!! You don\u2019t need to be so rough!\u300d</p><br/><p>It seemed Lela thought that the orcs were being rough and wailed furiously.</p><br/><p>\u300cErrr\u2026 Lela-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa! An orc talked!\u300d</p><br/><p>Muu, she was already in a state of panic and no matter what I say, she just wailed *Gyaa! Gyaa!*.</p><br/><p>I was fed up and decided to keep quite for a while.</p><br/><p>With Lela\u2019s wailing as BGM, the two high orcs and I glared each other.</p><br/><p>The high orcs attacked me from left and right, intending to pincer attack.</p><br/><p>The swords of the high orcs had been swung down simultaneously from both sides. As I dodged them using\u3010Teleportation\u3011and moved behind the orc from the right, I slashed it across its back.</p><br/><p>While the high orc who was slashed screamed, it frantically tried to cover the cut across its back with its both hands. The next moment, both its hands were also cut off by me and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>The high orc bled intensely and fell down. It stopped moving.</p><br/><p>The last monster was pierced by\u3010Lightning flash\u3011, paralyzing its body, and was beheaded from behind.</p><br/><p>I wiped off the filth on the Replica Sword with cooking paper and sheathed it\u2015</p><br/><p>Finally, the cut off head of the high orc fell down with a *tumble tumble* and hit Lela, who was crouching, in the head with a *thud*.</p><br/><p>Lela finally regained her composure and looked up\u2015</p><br/><p>In front of her, was the freshly-severed head of the high orc with a terrible expression\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaaaaaaa!!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela directly fainted.</p><br/><p>But, I hope she won\u2019t get traumatized by the orc\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, she\u2019s rather convenient to carry when unconscious.</p><br/><p>I lifted Lela up and returned to the original position where Elena is using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1\u305bKu! Korose!\u201d (Confound you! Go ahead and kill me right now!) is a stereotypical eroge phrase by a female knight about to be raped by orcs.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

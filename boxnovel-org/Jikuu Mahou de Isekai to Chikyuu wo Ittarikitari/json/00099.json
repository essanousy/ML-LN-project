Elena and I were talking secretly.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, what are we going to do from now on?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor the time being, since it\u2019s necessary to the be cautious for Suga and Ikebu town, let\u2019s stay at the Suga town today.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, we better do so.\u300d</p><br/><p>While we were talking such a thing, Rondo approached.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama, and Seiji as well, there will be a little dinner party, would you like to come?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAm I a bonus?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry. Because there\u2019s a place that I must go, I can\u2019t attend.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ignoring the astonished Rondo, Elena took my hand and left the conference hall briskly.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, isn\u2019t it fine to attend the dinner party?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, we need to go to Suga now, isn\u2019t that right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena looked at me with a worried expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are you so worried about Suga and Ikebu town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, well then, let\u2019s go immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena embraced me joyfully.</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena-sama! What are you doing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Crap! it was seen by Rondo.</p><br/><p>But, whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, Rondo.\u300d</p><br/><p>Leaving those words, we\u3010Teleported\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena-sama! Seiji! \u2026\u2026d-, disappeared!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo remained standing there for a while.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Seiji-sama, isn\u2019t this Ikebu town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa. First, I think we should warn Lela that this town is being targeted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. We better do so.\u300d</p><br/><p>For the time being, the number of monsters on the map didn\u2019t increase that much. It seemed okay for a while.</p><br/><p>I checked Lela\u2019s location via the beacon.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be staying at a luxurious inn.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat fellow, staying in a place such as this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis inn is reserved. Find another one.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we tried to enter the inn, the soldiers who guards the entrance stopped us.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I ask you to send Lela a message. Tell her that Elena and Seiji have come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, You are!\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, they recognized us in the end.</p><br/><p>\u300cAren\u2019t you Elena-sama!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The one they recognized was Elena!</p><br/><p>\u300cImmediately, convey a message!\u300d</p><br/><p>The soldiers conveyed the message in a hurry and we were able to meet Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama, Seiji. Where have you been? You disappeared in the middle of the victory party yesterday.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela is inside a suite-like room, having a tea gracefully. What a carefree fellow.</p><br/><p>Moreover, unusually, Lela is not wearing an armor. I have seen her figure without armor before but since Aya had destroyed the armor, she ended up naked.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat a very carefree fellow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAccording to our newly acquired intelligence, the troops led by the Goblin Prince seems to be targeting this place. You better be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cG-, Goblin Prince!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing the name, Lela\u2019s face suddenly went pale.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What to do. E-, Escape quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEscape? What about the townspeople?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe townspeople doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m from a noble house!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou!~ Though you celebrated victory together with them yesterday, you\u2019re just going to abandon them easily?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, B-, But\u2026\u2026 the opponent, is a Goblin Prince!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll come to help when it become dangerous. Just hold on until then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to help? Didn\u2019t you come to guard me all the time?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m Elena\u2019s guard. Elena and I will defend Suga town. While you defend Ikebu town during that time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuga!? You! Which is important, Suga town or me!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Suga town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela started to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much, I\u2019ll immediately come to help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, but, from Suga to here, it takes 2 days in a hurry!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. I have a magic that can enable me to come immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic! Is there such a thing? Is it true?\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, Lela was completely scared. What to do?</p><br/><p>\u300cListen, Lela. If you defend this Ikebu town in the time of this crisis, you\u2019re a hero.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHero!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, if you run away\u2026\u2026 you are, a coward. You will be reviled as a coward. Your family as well, will despise and look at you with contempt.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela\u2019s expression suddenly stiffened and she firmly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf there is anything, tell me with this.\u300d</p><br/><p>I handed a counterpart of the twin-magic-stone-style string phone I made before to Lena.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a magic tool I made that can enable us to talk even from far away.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>I handed the other counterpart to Elena and let her teach the method of using it.</p><br/><p>The two people seemed to enjoy themselves.</p><br/><p>Only a little while back, she was almost crying\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThen Lela, I\u2019ll rely on you later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, yeah. Be sure to not prioritize the searching for the enemy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>We said goodbye and deliberately used\u3010Teleportation\u3011in front of Lela. We teleported to Suga town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we teleported to Suga town\u2015</p><br/><p>In the distant forest, I was able to confirm that there are many monsters there with the map.</p><br/><p>Quite a huge number.</p><br/><p>Moreover, not only goblins and orcs, there are also, hobgoblins and high orcs mixed in.</p><br/><p>Because there is some distance, it will be tomorrow if they attack Suga town.</p><br/><p>If I have something to worry about\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eLela-san, do you hear me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eElena-sama. Yes, I hear you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Elena and Lela are still playing with the string phone.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t confirmed yet if it can be used properly in the distance but there seems to be no problem for the time being.</p><br/><p>We looked for an inn close to the north side of the town, which seemed to be the area where the goblins will attack.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t particularly choose the inn on purpose.</p><br/><p>Because when we looked for an inn in the north side of the town, there was nothing but only one there!</p><br/><p>For some reason, the entire building of the inn we found was pink in color\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama, are we going to stay here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe can notice immediately when the monsters attack if here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That\u2019s right. It\u2019s for the sake of the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and I nervously entered the inn.</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome!\u300d</p><br/><p>The receptionist has a small window in a strange position so that the guests weren\u2019t identifiable. It turned out to be a way to exchange money and keys from there.</p><br/><p>\u300cOne\u2026\u2026one night please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnly the best room is available, would that be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, it\u2019s 300 Aurum a night.\u300d</p><br/><p>E-, Expensive.</p><br/><p>I paid 300 Aurum reluctantly, I received the key and went to the room.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at the room, the room was pink. It was painful to look at.</p><br/><p>Elena and I will stay o-, overnight in such a place?</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, there\u2019s a bathroom.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I look at where Elena is pointing, there is a bathroom.</p><br/><p>Huh? Something is strange.</p><br/><p>So, even from inside the room, you can immediately find the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Because the bathtub is visible from inside the room.</p><br/><p>Why is it visible? Because there\u2019s a glass between the room and the bathroom.</p><br/><p>The glass is probably a high-class item here. Using it like this is a waste\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama, this bathroom. To be in sight\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can go in first, Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook, there\u2019s a curtain. Just close this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, you\u2019re right.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena went into the bathroom cheerfully.</p><br/><p>But, how it became like this?</p><br/><p>This curtain, is thin and\u2026\u2026 slightly see-through\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s nothing.</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m appreciating the curtain with all my might, Elena came out dressed in a bathrobe while the smell of soap permeated in the air. </p><br/><p>I immediately looked away.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, you can go ahead.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-, Oh.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I entered the bathroom, probably the effect of light but, I noticed that one can\u2019t see the outside from the inside. I see, in this way\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I washed my whole body cleanly just in case.</p><br/><p>Upon exiting the bathroom, Elena\u2019s face was deep red.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, this curtain, it\u2019s thin\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems Elena also appreciates the curtain somehow or another.</p><br/><p>And, Elena fidgets.</p><br/><p>N? Elena holds something in her hand while fidgeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what is that you\u2019re holding in your hand?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this? It was inside the room, it seems to be a magic tool or something. What kind of magic tool is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s probably, used to ease stiff shoulders?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo it\u2019s a magic tool to ease stiff shoulders.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena brought the magic tool to her shoulders and channeled magic power. The magic tool started to vibrate.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it feels good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It feels good?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, it feels good.\u300d</p><br/><p>I engraved Elena\u2019s words deeply into my heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So you were safe!\u300d</p><br/><p> Right, I had come to the room of Princess Elena who I left \u3010Tracking\u3011 on.</p><br/><p> Well, I thought I should say a farewell to this person at least.</p><br/><p> Princess Elena seemed to be crying alone in the room, there were still traces of tears remaining.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks to the princess who warned me of the danger, I managed to avoid being killed. I wanted to say a few words of gratitude so please excuse my rudeness for entering your room without permission\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot at all, it\u2019s my father\u2019s fault you got involved in this kind of thing. I\u2019m really sorry about this. Are you hurt?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m fine, not a single scratch\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of Hero-sama, you\u2019re really strong\u300d</p><br/><p> I\u2019m a little embarrassed with the Princess saying such a thing. Her age is about 15, 16 perhaps? I\u2019m 30 years old so isn\u2019t that a double score! No, calm down me! I shouldn\u2019t be a lolicon.</p><br/><p>\u300cUm, Hero-sama, is something the matter?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, no, it nothing. Oh, come to think of it, I had something to ask you Princess\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm\u2026 if possible, could you call me \u300eElena\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Princess Elena\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust \u300eElena\u300f is fine\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOk, got it. Then Elena, can I ask you a question?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, Hero-sama\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, rather than \u300eHero-sama\u300f, could you call me \u300eSeiji\u300f instead?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen \u300eSeiji-sama\u300f\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I guess that\u2019s fine\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen about my question, in regards to the \u3010Demon Lord\u3011, what do you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe \u3010Demon Lord\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, what the king said sounds kind of false, so I wanted to hear your impressions\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell let me see~ I don\u2019t really know much about it, however a little while ago I heard one of the frontier villages were destroyed by the \u3010Demon Lord\u2019s Army\u3011\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA frontier village? So it was destroyed rather than occupied? Was that village some kind of important village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt wasn\u2019t occupied, it was destroyed without a doubt. As for the village, it should be a very ordinary village\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, I wonder why the \u3010Demon Lord\u2019s Army\u3011 bothered to destroy such an ordinary village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, I wonder why? I didn\u2019t consider it up to there. I\u2019m sorry\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s nothing for you to apologise for. The \u3010Demon Lord\u2019s Army\u3011 destroying the village seems really doubtful, they didn\u2019t seem to have any incentive to\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, thinking about it again, it does seem a little strange. From now on let\u2019s both think about what the truth is\u300d</p><br/><p> Her face seems full of determination, but is that alright? I\u2019m worried that it will be something in conflict with that king.</p><br/><p> Hmm, seems like I need to use this \u3010Tracking\u3011 to monitor Elena regularly.</p><br/><p> D-Don\u2019t get the wrong idea. I-It\u2019s not like I\u2019m using \u3010Tracking\u3011 so I can peek on her alright! Worried, it\u2019s because I\u2019m worried.</p><br/><p> Who the hell am I making an excuse to? It\u2019s about time to go home.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s about time for me to go. Now that this much has happened, I can\u2019t act for this country\u2026\u2026 but take care Elena\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes Seiji-sama, you take care too\u300d</p><br/><p> After I said my farewell to Elena, I used \u3010Teleportation\u3011 while calling to mind my own room.</p><br/><p>\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e</p><br/><p> It seems like \u3010Telelportation\u3011 from another world to Earth is a success, I had returned to my room.</p><br/><p> Feeling relieved coming back to my room, I suddenly grew hungry so I decided to eat cup noodles.</p><br/><p> I went to the living room, opened up the stock of cup noodles and poured hot water in from the electric kettle.</p><br/><p> However! The hot water ran out midway! This is a pinch!</p><br/><p> I can\u2019t eat it as it is now, on the other hand if I go boil hot water, during that time the lower half of the cup noodles would absorb the hot water and become soggy. To overcome this pinch, I put my brain of high gear.</p><br/><p>PIKON!</p><br/><p> I felt like a light bulb lit up on top of my head.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! I can put it in my inventory and stop its time!\u300d</p><br/><p> I put the cup noodles filled midway with hot water into my inventory, then made its time stop.</p><br/><p> Then quickly boiling the hot water with the kettle, I took out the cup noodles I put in my inventory and poured hot water in it again.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease work\u300d</p><br/><p> I waited 3 minutes like I was praying, then took a slurp of the noodles with chopsticks after quickly removing the lid.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! It didn\u2019t go soggy!!\u300d</p><br/><p> I overcame the greatest pinch of my life and continued eating the cup noodles that didn\u2019t go soggy.</p><br/><p> This isn\u2019t just a single victory against cup noodles. When the cup noodles I eat later on run out of hot water midway, at that moment the world\u2019s greatest crisis will be completely conquered! I ate the cup noodles while being moved to tears.</p><br/><p> Hm? I feel like I was in a much greater crisis a little while ago? Was it my imagination?</p><br/><p> Being filled, I quickly grew sleepy so I crawled into bed and went to sleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

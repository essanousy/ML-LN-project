The light!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, sorry, my bad! This light comes from a thing that\u2019s like a lamp of this world.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is so bright, I am truly astonished. But if you place the lamp so high, wouldn\u2019t it be very difficult when you need to replenish the oil?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if we don\u2019t replenish the oil, it\u2019s will be all right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen is it a magic tool?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt isn\u2019t magic\u2026 but something like that I guess? That aside, this isn\u2019t the best place to have a chat so let\u2019s head in.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, of course. Excuse me for entering.\u300d</p><br/><p> Finishing our conversation, I noticed Elena was entering with her shoes still on.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment, can you take off your shoes here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTake off my shoes!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I take off my shoes first and put a pair of slippers in front of Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cTake off your shoes and wear these slippers instead.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so I have to change shoes before entering the room\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena took off her shoes, then suddenly looked over to me while fidgeting for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTaking off my shoes in front of other is somewhat\u2026 e-embarrassing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cE-embarrassing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-sorry, it\u2019s strange isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, no, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re bewildered because of the cultural differences. If you\u2019re embarrassed, then I\u2019ll turn around.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m very sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p> Behind me, Elena is\u2026</p><br/><p> Even though it\u2019s just taking off her shoes and putting on slippers.</p><br/><p> It\u2019s a somewhat strange feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI have finished changing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cR-right\u300d</p><br/><p> I, while still having that strange feeling, guided Elena into the living room.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is the living room. Take a seat on that sofa and wait, I\u2019ll brew some tea.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHy-yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena observed the room with a bit of nervousness. Probably because the things in this world are all unusual to her.</p><br/><p> I took out 2 tea cups, put in the tea bags poured in the hot water from the electric kettle, then placed a cup down in front of Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cWould you like some \u3010Sugar\u3011 and \u3010Milk\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Milk\u3011 is the thing we had this morning right? You can put in tea?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? You never put \u3010Milk\u3011 in your tea?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I never did. I have also never heard of \u3010Sugar\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!? You really don\u2019t know \u3010Sugar\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I didn\u2019t think that they wouldn\u2019t have \u3010Sugar\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you want to try putting it in?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, please do!\u300d</p><br/><p> I scooped a spoon of \u3010Sugar\u3011 and \u3010Milk\u3011 powder each into Elena\u2019s cup.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, have some.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena timidly brought the tea cup to her lips.</p><br/><p>\u300cD-delicious! Since it looked so similar to salt, I thought it would be salty. I\u2019m very surprised it\u2019s so sweet!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, I\u2019m glad you like it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHave a taste of these as well, it goes well with tea.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out and offered some snacks and cookies to Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much. Mm!! Th-these also taste amazing!!\u300d</p><br/><p> We both enjoyed our tea for a while, it was very delicious, and Elena\u2019s tea cup was soon emptied.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about another cup of tea?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much, if I may.\u300d</p><br/><p> I put a new tea bag into Elena\u2019s cup and poured hot water into it. Elena had a look of awe on her face.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, hot water comes out from there, but how does it do that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this is an electric kettle. Once you put water in it, it will keep boiling the water automatically.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA tool to boil water?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll let you see for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a \u3010Kettle\u3011 from my Inventory, poured water into the kettle in the kitchen, then came back.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst of all, you open up the lid.\u300d</p><br/><p> I opened the kettle lid to let the hot steam loose. Then I slowly add water into the kettle. When the water level reached the marked line, I closed the lid.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow if we wait a while, the water will be boiled.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!? That is all? You do not need to light a fire?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, you don\u2019t have to do anything. Well, just wait a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p> Soon, steam started gushing out from the exhaust port of the kettle.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, you don\u2019t have to anything..\u300d</p><br/><p> After waiting for a while again, an electric chime rang from the kettle.</p><br/><p>\u300cEeeeeehh!? W-what was that sound just now!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat sound just now lets you know the water has boiled.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is an incredible tool!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena immediately took interested in many things and started bombarding me with questions.</p><br/><p> After a while of bombarding me with questions, Elena suddenly became quiet. What happened?</p><br/><p>\u300cU-ummm~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, that is\u2026 may I borrow your lavatory?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, ah, t-the lavatory, right?\u300d</p><br/><p> I had behaved somewhat strangely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Uh, because I'm a slave......</p><br/><p> I'll follow the order of the person who has become my master.\u300d</p><br/><p> It can't be helped. Well, I will manage somehow.</p><br/><p> As I crouched down and patted Hilda's head\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWill you come with me, Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda made a slightly joyful expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, Seiji. Let's perform the slave transfer.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it done?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? You don't know?</p><br/><p> The two of us will have to send magic power from the front and back of the slave collar respectively.</p><br/><p> I'll have the back and you will have the front, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> I touched the front part of Hilda's collar and sent magic power at Rachel-san's signal.</p><br/><p> Then, Hilda's collar started to shine,</p><br/><p> Hilda began to fidget whilst staring at me.</p><br/><p> Is it the effect of some magic?</p><br/><p> Then, the light gradually became stronger.</p><br/><p> When the light became remarkably strong, it burst and vanished.</p><br/><p> At the same time as the light burst, Hilda's body shook with *shiver shiver*.</p><br/><p> Hilda's breathing was a little disordered,</p><br/><p> suddenly, she clung around my waist.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I'm sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems her legs staggered, throwing her off balance.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Somehow,\u300eSlave transfer\u300fsmells like a horrible crime but is it alright?</p><br/><p> Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this, Hilda has become Seiji's.</p><br/><p> Ah, that's right. This is a knife for dismantling monsters that Hilda used, consider this as a parting gift.\u300d</p><br/><p> I received a knife from Rachel-san\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cTake this, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> When Hilda received the knife from me,</p><br/><p> she hang the knife on her waist strap protectively.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy business is only this, send my regards to Misha and Cassandra if you see them.</p><br/><p> Well then, since I'm busy, quickly go.\u300d</p><br/><p> Rachel-san suddenly talked fast</p><br/><p> and rapidly turned around, ending the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cStay well.\u300d</p><br/><p> Rachel-san muttered something under her breath,</p><br/><p> and quickly went to the tent's inner part.</p><br/><p> I wonder what happened suddenly?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We left Rachel-san's tent,</p><br/><p> and after walking a little, we had come to a forest's bower.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, hold my hand because I'm going to use magic right now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> The four of us take each other's hand and formed a circle. We moved to Shinji town using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda, who was surprised at being suddenly transferred to another location, had her eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, don't tell others about this magic, do you understand?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHii-yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda, whilst holding her own mouth, nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p> You don't need to be tensed that much.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> There are hardly any soldiers left in Shinju town,</p><br/><p> instead, a lot of merchants can be seen.</p><br/><p> We, after inquiring someone in the city the location of the special trade envoy's office, visited Cassandra.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji. And, Hilda!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, Cassandra-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHave you already met Rachel? Seiji, you're fast.\u300d</p><br/><p> No need to say fast or something like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, a trade envoy?</p><br/><p> Cassandra-san is knowledgeable not only in magic but also in trade, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, not at all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? But you're a special trade envoy, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm just going along with it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy are you still doing it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey said that it's better for a non-human to be here.\u300d</p><br/><p> As Cassandra-san said so, *piko piko* her cat ears moved.</p><br/><p> I don't understand the things such as trade and diplomacy well,</p><br/><p> is that how it is~?</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon't you have a\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? I have.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou have!? Really?</p><br/><p> Give it to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI won't! That's beecause I will be in trouble if I don't have it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I see......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy do you need a\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm going to use it when I go to the demonkind's town but I don't have enough of it.\u300d</p><br/><p> That's right, I forgot that they can't communicate with the demonkind through language.</p><br/><p> The magic stone shop in Ikebu may have it, let's go there later.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have another question for you, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDuring the fight with the goblins, there was a demonkind who protected me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you know the name of that person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I certainly know the name of that person.~</p><br/><p> It's\u300eBunmi\u300f-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300eBunmi\u300f, huh. Thanks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy are you asking about his name?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm going to thank him while I'm trading in the demonkind's town.\u300d</p><br/><p> Eee, Cassandra-san is quite dutiful, huh.~</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, when are you going to depart to Demonkind's town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe day after tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's very fast, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot really, we have been preparing a little sometime ago.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I'm going to deliver the\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011if I find some by then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks, you've saved me some trouble.\u300d</p><br/><p> I shook hands with Cassandra-san</p><br/><p> and moved to the next location.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

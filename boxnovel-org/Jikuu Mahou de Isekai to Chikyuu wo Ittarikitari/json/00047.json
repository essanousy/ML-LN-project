To answer the question, aristocrats aren\u2019t particularly prohibited to participate in this competition.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, aristocrats originally have admissions to the mana crystals even if they don\u2019t compete in this competition, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy purpose isn\u2019t the admission to the mana crystal, it\u2019s to win the championship of this competition.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, you are here to harass.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say? It\u2019s different kind of thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? If you win the competition, a commoner won\u2019t be able to have an admission to the mana crystal.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAn aristocrat\u2019s circumstances takes precedence over the circumstances of a commoner. You don\u2019t even know such a thing, this is why a commoner\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so.\u300d</p><br/><p>This fellow is hopeless.</p><br/><p>I left the place and came back to where Aya is.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnchan, what did you talk about with that person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRather than talking, she just picked a quarrel when I got closer. It seems I was impertinent in spite of being a commoner.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh~ She\u2019s that kind of person.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNext up, women\u2019s division\u2019s second round will commence. </p><br/><p>Participants no. 1 and no. 2, please come up to the arena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it\u2019s me, see you later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, good luck!\u300d</p><br/><p>After showing me a v-sign, Aya head towards the arena.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, women\u2019s division, third match, participant no. 1\u300eLela\u300fversus, participant no. 2\u300eAya\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, begin!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and Lela took their stances and glared at each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome now, observe the great battle, Iron wall\u300eLela\u300fand Swift wind\u300eAya\u300f\u2019s match has begun.\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s something attached to the names of the two?</p><br/><p>Since Lela won\u2019t be making a move herself and just stood there, Aya slowly shorten their distance.</p><br/><p>Shu!</p><br/><p>\u300eLela\u300f\u2019s rapier suddenly thrusts forward and attacked Aya.</p><br/><p>Aya was caught off guard by the sudden offensive, she wasn\u2019t able to completely evade the attack and grazed her shoulder. </p><br/><p>Aya quickly take a distance, the shoulder part of the leather armor got torn off and there\u2019s a little blood visible.</p><br/><p>What the hell!</p><br/><p>That weapon, its blade hasn\u2019t been dulled.</p><br/><p>Aya was surprised too about her injury.</p><br/><p>\u300cUh-oh, participant Lela attacked and injured participant Aya! Participant Aya is in a pinch!\u300d</p><br/><p>Such slow and leisurely commentary of the situation! It\u2019s a foul play to use a weapon with its blade hasn\u2019t been dulled. </p><br/><p>I looked for the competition\u2019s staff to appeal for Lela\u2019s foul play.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, wait a moment, the blade of Lela\u2019s weapon hasn\u2019t been dulled?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that\u2019s right, is it a problem?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHaa!? Don\u2019t\u300eYes, that\u2019s right\u300fme!</p><br/><p>Using a weapon with its blade hasn\u2019t been dulled is a foul!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, because the rule is that when an aristocrat fights a commoner, normal weapons can be used, it\u2019s not a foul play.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, what did you say? Why is there such a rule!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOriginally, the rule about using weapons that has its blade dulled is a measure in order for a commoner to avoid injuring an aristocrat accidentally, there\u2019s no need for aristocrats to follow it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s good, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>I understand shit!!</p><br/><p>Aya seems to have understood the situation from the surroundings, glaring at Lela with more focus.</p><br/><p>Aya observe Lela carefully while moving and sneaking behind Lela.</p><br/><p>Lela didn\u2019t even move, following Aya by only moving her neck. Perhaps, she can\u2019t move? </p><br/><p>Only when Aya tried to approach that Lena quickly assumed a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>Aya circled around Lela once more to increase her speed.</p><br/><p>Finally, when Lela could no longer keep up with the reaction velocity, Aya plunge in towards Lela\u2019s blind spot, slashing with a knife.</p><br/><p>Kin!</p><br/><p>Although Aya\u2019s knife hit, it was blocked by Lela\u2019s armor and didn\u2019t manage to do any damage.</p><br/><p>Lela attacks with her rapier.</p><br/><p>Aya barely dodged by going underneath the rapier at the last minute, rolling over to take a distance.</p><br/><p>Shit, it\u2019s getting dangerous.</p><br/><p>However, Aya move towards Lela persistently.</p><br/><p>And then, barely avoiding the rapier in the last minute in the same way and move towards Lela again repeatedly.</p><br/><p>What are you doing!? Watch out! Think a little bit more how to fight!</p><br/><p>However, as the similar attack repeated for a while, Aya gradually became skillful at dodging it. It seems to be a timely use of wind magic to correct her trajectory.</p><br/><p>Then, the nth attack happened.</p><br/><p>Lela attacks with her rapier aimed at Aya\u2019s face, but Aya without trying to dodge, keep charging.</p><br/><p>Watch out!</p><br/><p>At the time when Lela\u2019s rapier was about to pierce through Aya\u2019s face, Aya slashed with her knife, raising it up from below, deflecting the rapier\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Lela\u2019s attack had been brushed off and her arm was completely stretched out into the air.</p><br/><p>\u300cGya!!~\u300d</p><br/><p>It was Lela\u2019s scream.</p><br/><p>When you look carefully, the knife was pierced through the armpit of Lela\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>Apparently there\u2019s a gap on the armpit part of the armor.</p><br/><p>Lela writhes scandalously on the arena.</p><br/><p>\u300cOuch!! What\u2019s the medical team doing!? Help me quickly!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The unseemly grievous cry of Lela resounded through the arena.</p><br/><p>\u300cP-, participant no. 2, \u300eAya\u300f\u2019s win\u2015\u2015\u2015!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The medical team heard the voice of the referee and hurriedly came over and placed Lela on something like a stretcher and carrying her away to the medical team\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u300cA huge eventful unexpectedness, participant\u300eIron wall Lela\u300fhas been unexpectedly eliminated on the semi-finals, winning and advancing to the finals is\u300eSwift wind Aya\u300f!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWa~~~!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The arena was engulfed by loud cheers!</p><br/><p>It was terrifying!</p><br/><p>Because my\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic reacted with only\u300eCaution\u300fdegree, I endured from forcefully breaking in, the feeling almost kill me.</p><br/><p>On the arena, while Aya is having Elena heal her wounds around the shoulder, she answered the spectators\u2019 cheers with a smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This is?\u300d</p><br/><p> In front of us, a big hole appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's a big hole, oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p> I've tried to peer in but I can't see the depth because it's dark.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, how are we going to get down?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe're going to get down from here?\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela is also anxious.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, nothing can be seen below. It's pitch black.</p><br/><p> Going down there as it is, isn't it dangerous?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right, we have to first make sure of what's down below\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out an adequate wooden stick from the inventory, wrapped a piece of cloth that I don't need around it and soaked it in a firelighter for camping.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, can you please set fire to this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p> When Hilda used\u3010Ignition\u3011magic, the improvised torch vigorously burst into flames and brilliantly illuminated the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy bother with a torch, oniichan?</p><br/><p> Besides, its light can't reach the bottom.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, you'll see.\u300d</p><br/><p> I attached again the\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011, which I had put on myself, to the torch and tossed it into the hole.</p><br/><p> The torch fell down dozen of meters below and with a splash, it fell into a water, extinguishing the fire.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it has been extinguished.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo the bottom is water! I give up.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, I saw something before the fire has been extinguished.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's review it.\u300d</p><br/><p> I tried to playback the\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011's video that I attached to the torch from the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji! W-, What's this!?\u300d</p><br/><p> It's awkward when you get surprised every time.</p><br/><p> Not only Lela, it seems Hilda is also surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is the view that can be seen from that torch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven such magic......\u300d</p><br/><p> When I paused the video just before the torch fell into the water, it showed the view at the bottom.</p><br/><p> At the bottom of the hole was a room, filled with black, muddy liquid.</p><br/><p> I had no way of knowing how deep the liquid was from the video.</p><br/><p> Inside the room, not just black liquid but also something like a wreckage could be seen.</p><br/><p> If I had to take a guess from its form, wasn't it formerly the stairs?</p><br/><p> That means\u2015</p><br/><p> there have been stairs in this hole before and collapsed into this state for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe bottom seems to be somewhat dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf we use\u3010Teleportation\u3011on top of the wreckage, we might be able to come down.\u300d</p><br/><p> I can't let the girls go, if we get on the top of the wreckage below in great numbers, it might collapse~.</p><br/><p> So I should get down alone first.</p><br/><p> I'd been seen off by everyone who was anxious,</p><br/><p> and moved to the bottom of the hole alone with\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When I moved toward the bottom of the hole using\u3010Teleportation\u3011,</p><br/><p> the wreckage under my foot shook for an instant with a bang, I almost fell over but I was able to resist it somehow without falling over.</p><br/><p> However, what's this smell?</p><br/><p> An oily kind of smell wafts through the air.</p><br/><p> When I turn on the\u3010Incandescent light bulb\u3011and look around\u2015</p><br/><p> there's a wide room and it's entirely flooded with black liquid above floor level.</p><br/><p> Looking a little further ahead, a doorway can be seen.</p><br/><p> Let's head towards that doorway first.</p><br/><p> I took out an adequate wooden stick from the inventory slowly and tried to put it into the black liquid.</p><br/><p> The stick immediately reached the floor and I found out that the depth of the water was around 20 cm.</p><br/><p> It seems to be alright to walk through this.</p><br/><p> I took out the\u300eboots\u300ffrom the inventory and put it on, and went toward the doorway whilst confirming my steps with the stick.</p><br/><p> When I arrived at the doorway and left the room\u2015</p><br/><p> it was followed by a passage way.</p><br/><p> As far as I can see, there are several forked roads in the passage as well as several places which seem to be the entrance of the room.</p><br/><p> This is completely the\u300efirst floor's underground\u300fas soon as I thought whether there's only a hidden passage.</p><br/><p> When I check the map, unidentified enemies covers a wide range.</p><br/><p> It's no good.</p><br/><p> Once I get back, I'll inform everyone of the situation.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I came back to where everyone is using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou stink, oniichan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe first thing you say is that!!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I took off the boots and put it back to the inventory after washing the boots' dirt with\u3010Water magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou still stinks, oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can't be helped since I walked through the stinking water.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow does the bottom look, Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p> I projected the\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011's video that had been attached to me whilst explaining the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji. In other words, we need to capture the first floor's underground.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's that kind of thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, it's unpleasant to walk while being soaked in the stinking water!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou~!\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, even I bring Elena and Hilda to such a place, it's a little unpleasant.</p><br/><p> Later, I want boots with pants not just ordinary boots.</p><br/><p> Let's re-enter after preparing in Japan.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough it's still early, let's call it a day.</p><br/><p> Let's continue again next week.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNext week?</p><br/><p> We will not capture it again tomorrow?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI want equipment for walking in the water.</p><br/><p> And we also have other works.</p><br/><p> We can't work as adventurers every day.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, well, it can't be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we left the\u300eTower of sunrise\u300f,</p><br/><p> the setting sun had been dyed in red outside.</p><br/><p> When we arrived at the adventurers guild, inside was packed with adventurers.</p><br/><p> We sold the magic stones at the reception.</p><br/><p> And after we reported that there was a first floor's underground at the bottom of the pitfall,</p><br/><p> as well as the possibility to go to the fourth floor from the underground and the like,</p><br/><p> they had been greatly surprised.</p><br/><p> Somehow or another, the monsters we had also encountered seemed to be nothing but fairly rare monsters.</p><br/><p> The reward for selling the loot as well as the discovery of the underground were as follows:</p><br/><p>\u3010Great rat's tail\u30113A x 50</p><br/><p>\u3010Big great rat's tail +1\u301110A x 2</p><br/><p>\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stone\u301110A x 2</p><br/><p>\u3010Darkness great rat's tail\u301130A</p><br/><p>\u3010Darkness reinforcement magic stone\u301130A</p><br/><p>\u3010Fox's tail\u30113A x 20</p><br/><p>\u3010Darkness fox's tail\u301150A</p><br/><p>\u3010Darkness reinforcement magic stone\u301110A</p><br/><p>\u3010Fox's tail +1\u301120A x 2</p><br/><p>\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stone\u301110A x 2</p><br/><p>\u3010Lightning fox's tail\u3011100A</p><br/><p>\u3010Magic stone of biribiri\u301110A</p><br/><p>\u3010Ice fox's tail\u3011300A</p><br/><p>\u3010Ice fox's fur\u3011500A</p><br/><p>\u3010Magic stone of refrigeration +1\u3011500A</p><br/><p>\u3010Goblin's ear\u30113A x 20</p><br/><p>\u3010Goblin magician's ear\u301130A x 5</p><br/><p>\u3010Magic stone of refrigeration\u3011200A x 5</p><br/><p>\u3010Goblin bodybuilder's ear\u3011500A</p><br/><p>\u3010Magic stone of faint light +1\u3011500A</p><br/><p>\u3010Hobgoblin's ear\u3011200A</p><br/><p>\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stone\u301150A</p><br/><p>\u300eDiscovery of the first floor's underground\u300f1, 000A</p><br/><p> the total amount was 5, 300A.</p><br/><p>\u300cWel then, let's leave with this but,</p><br/><p> are you still going to stay in this town, Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I'll be in this town until I secure a little more magic stones.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, we'll come again next week.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I'm waiting.\u300d</p><br/><p> After saying goodbye to Lela, who seemed to be reluctant to part, we returned to Japan with Hilda.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

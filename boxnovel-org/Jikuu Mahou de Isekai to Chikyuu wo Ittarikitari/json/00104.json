Magician unit! Commence firing!\u300d</p><br/><p>By Lela\u2019s command, the archers and magicians launched their attacks.</p><br/><p>Since the opponents were common goblins, that alone was enough to defeat them steadily.</p><br/><p>However, there were also shots that failed to hit and the distance between the goblins gradually grew closer.</p><br/><p>Soon, the leading group of the goblins will likely reach Lela.</p><br/><p>I cast\u3010Quick\u3011on Lela and, each and every soldier.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, it feels that the goblins\u2019 movements has suddenly become slow, why is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems the exhilarating feeling of war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, so it\u2019s such a thing, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela completely regained her confidence at the slow movements of the goblins.</p><br/><p>Finally, the goblins reached Lela and were cut into two with a single stroke of the rapier.</p><br/><p>Several goblins avoided the soldiers and snuck around to the sides.</p><br/><p>Those fellows were killed by the adventurers.</p><br/><p>Since the goblins\u2019 bodies interfered with the battle, I moved them by hand so it became less crowded, forming a mountain of goblins.</p><br/><p>When the battle against the goblins continues ceaselessly for a while.</p><br/><p>Hobgoblins start to appear.</p><br/><p>However, with my\u3010Slow\u3011and Elena\u2019s\u3010Water magic\u3011weakening their movements, Lela and the soldiers dispatched them one after another.</p><br/><p>About several people received injuries but were healed by the healers at the back, enabling them to return to the frontlines immediately.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation being fought well beyond anyone\u2019s expectation, the soldiers morale heightened as well.</p><br/><p>In addition, far from being exhausted, their movements as a whole improved in reverse.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, with the effect of my\u3010Skill Mastery Increase\u3011, the unit probably increased in skill as a whole as well.</p><br/><p>With an easy victory mood, the whole unit grew exhilarated.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuoo!\u300d</p><br/><p>From the forest, a huge goblin appeared.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t a prince, it was larger than a hobgoblin.

an interview left,</p><br/><p>we held a briefing session.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis means, Megumi and Ringo think that the last person is good?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy\u300eability to judge character\u300fis accurate.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, Megumi-chan\u2019s\u300eability to judge character\u300fisn\u2019t accurate, though\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cLook, Nancy,</p><br/><p>it\u2019s better to give that last person a miss.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?</p><br/><p>That person seems to be most excellent one, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, that\u2019s right, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Umu, it\u2019s hard to explain.</p><br/><p>She hasn\u2019t done anything yet\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m forced to say something, it would only be to the extent that the name,\u300eHiyama Ai\u300f, is a\u300efalse name\u300f.</p><br/><p>However, I won\u2019t be able to answer if they were to ask me how I know that it\u2019s a false name~.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, I didn\u2019t think that you would object~.</p><br/><p>Well, for the time being, let\u2019s hire all of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t we supposed to choose 1 amongst the 4!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, the manpower isn\u2019t enough at all.\u300d</p><br/><p>Since Nancy has the final decision, I can\u2019t say it somehow or other.</p><br/><p>However, I\u2019m worried.</p><br/><p>The dangerous person who took the interview using a false name,</p><br/><p>we don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to.</p><br/><p>For the time being, I put a\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011on\u300eHiyama Ai\u300f,</p><br/><p>but to be safe, I put\u3010Tracking beacons\u3011on Ringo and Megumi-chan, too.</p><br/><p>Ah, while I\u2019m at it, I will also put one on mama-san, too.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>While Nancy and the others were chatting at the\u300etea party\u300f\u2013held on the pretext of\u300ebriefing session\u300f\u2013I was secretly peeking into the situation of\u300eHiyama Ai\u300fthrough the beacon.</p><br/><p>\u300eHiyama Ai\u300fwas cautiously and restlessly looking around and she secretly entered an accessory shop called\u300eArc\u30fbGold[1]\u300ffrom the back entrance.</p><br/><p>Is this person someone from another accessory shop</p><br/><p>and is plotting something like that of an industrial spy?</p><br/><p>\u300eGold-sama, I\u2019ve come.\u300f</p><br/><p>Gold?</p><br/><p>He\u2019s called with\u300esama\u300f, so that means this fellow is the boss?</p><br/><p>Since they are talking in English, he\u2019s probably not Japanese.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow\u2019s the situation of Nancy\u30fbJewelry?\u300f</p><br/><p>The conversation partner was an ossan with an asian-ish villain expression and he was wearing a jinggling, bad-preference gold accessory.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt was easy, they only had Nancy, 2 children, and an interpreter;</p><br/><p>They completely trusted me.\u300f</p><br/><p>She thought that I was an interpreter, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see, I see,</p><br/><p>check properly the information I told you about, got it?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eLeave it to me!\u300f</p><br/><p>They sneak in to check some kind of information, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300f, what on Earth are these fellows?</p><br/><p>\u300cNancy, it\u2019s an abrupt question to ask,</p><br/><p>but do you know the\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t think that I would hear that name from your mouth, Seiji.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re fairly knowledgeable about accessory, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not like that at all, I just happened to hear a little.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well,</p><br/><p>\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300fis a jewelry brand which grew rapidly in the United States recently, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen I asked mama, she said that it\u2019s not that sort of jewelry.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, such a flashy, bad-preference ornament, it\u2019ll also be rated low as a jewelry.</p><br/><p>Or so I thought, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is\u300emoney wear\u300f,</p><br/><p>they use it as a countermeasure against tax.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMoney wear?\u300d</p><br/><p>According to Nancy\u2019s story,</p><br/><p>It\u2019s said that the company does a Las Vegas show business</p><br/><p>and turned most of their profits to\u300emoney wear\u300fnot cash.</p><br/><p>Why do they do something like that?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s said that if, for a dancer, an accessory is a part of one\u2019s tool of trade,</p><br/><p>then the\u300emoney wear\u300fis calculated as an\u300eexpense\u300f.</p><br/><p>If all the profitable balance is calculated as\u300eexpenses\u300f, the profitable balance endlessly nears 0.</p><br/><p>It seems that because of that, they don\u2019t really have to pay tax.</p><br/><p>Moreover, since the\u300eMoney wear\u300fconsumes gold lavishly and the value of itself is gold, if you smash it and turn it back into gold, it can be converted into money at the amount close to its original cost.</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing, isn\u2019t it simply a tax evasion?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, that\u2019s right,</p><br/><p>but they have made necessary preparations at various places from behind the scenes and do something wonderfully at the last moment\u2026it seems.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, those guys are like that, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Nancy.</p><br/><p>Mama-san speaks ill of them like that, so that means,</p><br/><p>the\u300eNancy Jewelry\u300fand\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300fare on bad terms with each other?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, we are probably on bad terms with each other.</p><br/><p>After interfering with each other many times over, mama and the president over there are having a huge fight each time.</p><br/><p>Ah, come to think of it, it seems the\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300f\u2019s president have come to Japan right now.\u300d</p><br/><p>The president have personally come to man the ship, huh.</p><br/><p>That flashy ossan is probably the president of\u300eArc\u30fbGold\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll go to the restroom for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>I went inside the toilet stall,</p><br/><p>transformed myself into a ninja man,</p><br/><p>became invisible using\u3010Transparencification\u3011of\u3010Light Magic\u3011</p><br/><p>and then used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to where Hiyama Ai was.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300eIyaan, you\u2019re lewd, Gold-sama~.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eCome on, come on, guhehehe~\u300f</p><br/><p>Uwa, I encountered them at an unpleasant place\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019ve become transparent, so naturally, they haven\u2019t noticed me.</p><br/><p>Although I decided not to look at the strange scene that much,</p><br/><p>I put a\u3010tracking beacon\u3011on the\u300eGold\u300f\u2019s boss.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]This \u2018gold\u2019 is written in katakana, \u2018Gorudo\u2019 and I\u2019ve translated it as \u2018aurum\u2019 in the past chapters, so whether they\u2019re connected/one or not, I still don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll leave it as gold for now.</p><br/><p>Please support the author by buying his work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

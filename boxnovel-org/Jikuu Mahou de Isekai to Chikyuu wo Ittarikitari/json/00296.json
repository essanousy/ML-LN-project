Such a thing as raising a hand against a girl, aren\u2019t you embarrassed!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan\u2019s grievous scream echoes in the surrounding.</p><br/><p>However, Megumi-chan\u2019s scream is also ineffective as the merciless attack of the tall man continues.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whooosh!</p><br/><p>Hilda somehow avoids the succeeding continuous attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cStop! Since I will do what you say, don\u2019t do something cruel to Hilda......\u300d</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan weakly declares that she gives up.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou should\u2019ve listen to me obediently from the beginning...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda interrupted the leader\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi-san, I\u2019m fine.

The way they fought was they closed in between their hand-to-hand strikes and cast their spell directly.</p><br/><p>As I\u2019m observing the demokind\u2015</p><br/><p>on the contrary, the demonkind\u2019s leader questioned me.</p><br/><p>\u300eAre the humans comprised of those who use magic and those who doesn\u2019t?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, that\u2019s right. Are the demonkind different?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDemonkind who can\u2019t use magic don\u2019t participant in battle.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see.\u300f</p><br/><p>The demonkind only have those who can use magic as soldiers?</p><br/><p>Everyone of the demonkind fought using same battle style.</p><br/><p>A single demonkind is a jack of all trades, they are good at close combat, magic and recovery magic.</p><br/><p>On the human side, there are scout unit, tank unit, vanguard unit, archer unit, magician unit and non-combatant unit such as healers and Hilda. They specialized in their respective roles.</p><br/><p>The demonkind\u2019s leader seemed to be greatly interested about the role assignment of the humans.</p><br/><p>All told, as we advanced\u2015</p><br/><p>On the map, a bad movement has occurred.</p><br/><p>When I say bad movement, it\u2019s not upfront but in the rear.</p><br/><p>A part of aristocracy union army has started to marched toward the demon army.</p><br/><p>What are those fellows doing!?</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, after I acquired\u3010Earth magic\u3011, it enabled me to determine the position by footsteps. It seems that I could now also pinpoint the position of allies.</p><br/><p>\u300cRachel-san, I\u2019m going to report the situation to Rondo in a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, we better do so, huh. Understood, go.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger.\u300d</p><br/><p>The demonkind and adventurers, who fought with each other, had formed a certain degree of mutual understanding. I think it would be okay for the interpreter to be gone temporarily if it\u2019s only a bit.</p><br/><p>I went back to\u300eCentral plain\u300fin a hurry.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, what happened!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji.

Joined forces with the Demon army!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa. </p><br/><p>If you start the war with the demon army now, the adventurers, who are joined forces with the demon army, are going to be affected.</p><br/><p>At least wait until the adventurers come back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll call back Branford.\u300d</p><br/><p>I leave it to Lyle Gewalt and returned to where Elena is.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, thank you. It\u2019s already fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena seemed to be doing her utmost in keeping the rain and was breathing raggedly.</p><br/><p>I had Elena eat Japanese sweets\u2015</p><br/><p>This time, the demon-adventurers mixed troop has a movement.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, they withdrew.

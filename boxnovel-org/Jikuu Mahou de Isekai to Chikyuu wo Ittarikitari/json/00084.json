While holding my bag, I was brought to the\u300ePresident\u2019s Office\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, you\u2019ve come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAno.~ for what reason did you call me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, it\u2019s about the you-know-what medicine\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>You-know-what medicine\u2026 it\u2019s about the\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011!?</p><br/><p>\u300cDirector! Did you mention it to others!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, just\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Certainly, it wasn\u2019t forbidden to tell it to others but of all the people he could tell it to, he told it to the president\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, the President has shown great interest in that medicine and there\u2019s a probability of a huge contract to be made. Depending on the circumstances, a project and backer inside the company\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Mixing up official business with personal affairs is serious and will also bring too much trouble. I don\u2019t quite understand but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cTherefore, I want you to get those you-know-what periodically, can I rely on you for that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThough I promised Director with 1 per week, I could get another one.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf possible, I want you to prepare two of them a week.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTwo?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs an important client, I will personally become test subject in advance. No! Rather than for me, I\u2019ll sacrifice myself to become the test subject for the sake of our company. Don\u2019t misunderstand because I need to become energetic 24 hours!\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, I\u2019ve become tired\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I will try to somehow procure two of it separately from Director\u2019s in a week.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu, I see I see.\u300d</p><br/><p>The President was smiling from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, I hope you won\u2019t divulge this to others carelessly anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>The President suddenly became serious.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026By the way, did you bring some vials today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>I pretended to be searching my bag and took out 3\u3010Strength recovery potion +3\u3011and\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011from the inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cHohou, so this is the one that you\u2019ve said that recovers strength, huh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease be careful about drinking it excessively. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>As the President replied, he took something out from the desk and held out a brown envelope to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs for this, it\u2019s not much but please keep it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks.\u300d</p><br/><p>I received it casually but in that instant, I had an intense foreboding.</p><br/><p>When the Director and I left the President\u2019s office, in passing, I saw the President making a phone call to somewhere. Is it his wife? That reminds me, the President\u2019s wife passed away when he was young and remarried. Well, it has nothing to do with me.</p><br/><p>\u300cIyaa, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>As the Director said so with a smile, he hastily put away the 2 vials I gave him inside his suit pocket and passed a brown envelope to me.</p><br/><p>Then, after returning to my desk, I immediately went to the rest room and checked the contents of the 2 brown envelopes.</p><br/><p>Inside the Director\u2019s envelope, there were about 15 Yukichi Fukuzawa while there were about 50 inside the President\u2019s envelope.1</p><br/><p>\u300cWaa!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I unconsciously let out a weird voice. No matter how you look at it, this is too much!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Since the work in the afternoon has also been settled, I peeped into Aya and Elena which has become a daily routine.</p><br/><p>Elena was surrounded and playing with small children in the park. It was so heartwarming.</p><br/><p>There were also the children\u2019s mothers too who were talking about something to Elena.</p><br/><p>When I tried to listen to the audio, words such as\u300eAllergy\u300f,\u300eAtopy\u300fand\u300eGood luck charm\u300fcan be heard.</p><br/><p>Elena cuddled one of the children and did something. Sure enough, she\u2019s using magic.</p><br/><p>Well, since there wasn\u2019t any sudden change in appearance, I think it\u2019s fine\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Aya is having a conversation with her seniors in the practice room of the Karate club.</p><br/><p>Apparently, they\u2019re talking about cosplay.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-chan, cosplay!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yurie is very excited for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan is a young lady who is homestaying in our house and she wants to participate in a cosplay convention.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat does she look like?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou want to see a picture of her?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya showed her seniors a picture of Elena taken with her smartphone.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaa~! Cute!! She\u2019s like a doll!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight.~\u300d</p><br/><p>Said Aya with a somehow smug look.</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to meet Elena-chan without fail.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, do you want to come to our house now? My pervert oniichan has a hobby of peeping, but since he cause no harm, it\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>What the hell! It\u2019s regrettable that I couldn\u2019t retort. What kind of thing is \u2018I caused no harm\u2019!? Well, I would be in troubled if I cause any harm.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s go! Captain will also come along.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-kun, is your oniichan there? I want to meet him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, it\u2019s decided.\u300d</p><br/><p>All told, everyone in the Karate club will come to the house.</p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, while on the way home, I stopped by the supermarket and bought a high class melon. Well, I also have a large amount of extra income.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1About \u00a5650k or US$5.7k?\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

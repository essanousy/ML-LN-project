Something is coming.\u300d</p><br/><p>We hid ourselves and watched the situation.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the mark isn\u2019t coming towards us but towards the village.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood, they didn\u2019t seem to notice us.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, look at that!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked at the direction where Aya was pointing,</p><br/><p>there was an orc, not a goblin.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy is an orc in a place like this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, the orc has come to attack the goblin village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it doesn\u2019t seemed to be the case.\u300d</p><br/><p>The orc knelt down towards the goblins for some reason and handed a huge box to one of the goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy is the orc obeys the goblins? No matter how you look at it, an orc is stronger than a goblin.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji-sama! There are people going inside!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>We saw the orc brought a cage where people are confined inside. So the orcs had been abducting people to offer to the goblins!? But, why would the orcs abduct people for the goblins? I don\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the orc left the village.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe must help those people quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, let\u2019s look at the situation first with the lightning spirit.\u300d</p><br/><p>I cast\u3010Summon lightning spirit\u3011and the lightning spirit appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cScouting again? I\u2019m not a scouting spirit.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI~ understand!\u300d</p><br/><p>I put Aya\u2019s tracking beacon on the lightning spirit temporarily and make it go on a reconnaissance.</p><br/><p>Besides the ordinary goblins, there\u2019s also a goblin with large build inside the village who gives orders to the ordinary goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that big goblin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a hobgoblin.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena told me.</p><br/><p>The lightning spirit continued to scout, it found the building where the captives are kept and sneaked in.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the people are being forced to work.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey are creating something.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are they making?\u300d</p><br/><p>The lightning spirit approached the things they are making.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it\u2019s a magic stone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe goblins are abducting people using the orc in order to create a magic stone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, the workers are divided up.\u300d</p><br/><p>The workers are divided by gender and age from 12 to 50 years old, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a reason in dividing the people they abduct to make a magic stone.</p><br/><p>When the lightning spirit moved to the next room, a craftsman-like person was teaching a large group of people how to make a magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you don\u2019t learn how to make a magic stone, you\u2019ll be killed by the goblins. Everybody, let\u2019s work hard to learn how to make magic stones.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300eYes.\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>I see, after abducting the suitable people, they are teaching them by force.</p><br/><p>The lightning spirit returned after scouting.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much, you helped us out a lot.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you going to raze the village using magic again?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s fine this time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Well then, I\u2019m going to return.\u300d</p><br/><p>As the lightning spirit said so, it returned.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s go and rescue them immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, let\u2019s do it according to the original strategy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere are too many captives. We won\u2019t be able to fight if those people are made to become a shield.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTherefore, luring out the goblins from the village then defeating them is a better strategy. Do you agree, Elena?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We decided to implement the strategy as planned.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, I\u2019ll entrust you to lure out a smaller number as possible at the beginning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood.\u300d</p><br/><p>I put the tracking beacon on Aya again and let her lure out the goblins. Elena and I moved under the big tree nearby which serves as a landmark and wait while watching the video of Aya.</p><br/><p>Aya picked up a pebble and threw it towards the goblin from the forest near the village.</p><br/><p>\u300cFa!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The pebble hit the goblin on the head, it turned around to the direction where the pebble came from. There, Aya posed\u300espanking her own buttocks\u300f\u2026\u2026 are you a kid!!?</p><br/><p>\u300cFugoffugof!\u300d</p><br/><p>The goblin who was hit by the pebble started to run towards Aya, there were also two other goblins who noticed the goblin\u2019s actions and followed.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, I was able to lure in three of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, good! Elena, do your best.\u300d</p><br/><p>With a feeling of a support, I cast\u3010Quick\u3011and\u3010Barrier\u3011on Elena and\u3010Slow\u3011on the goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cGet ready!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, with\u3010magic rod\u3011in her right hand, rushed towards the goblins who were confused and surprised. With a form similar to the tennis\u2019 backhand, she hit the first goblin on the flank.</p><br/><p>Supan!</p><br/><p>The attacked goblin flew to a far away tree while rotating. It crushed, drilled into the tree and stopped moving. </p><br/><p>The remaining goblins were struck dumb by the exaggerated occurrence. And Elena\u2026. was also dumbfounded. The magic rod\u2019s power probably surprised even herself.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena! You mustn\u2019t let your guard down.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena focused again when she heard my voice and carefully approached the remaining goblins.</p><br/><p>The two remaining goblins were scared and stepped backwards.</p><br/><p>\u300cGig!\u300d</p><br/><p>The goblins were driven into a corner and one of them rushed blindly towards Elena. Elena flinched a little but firmly resisted it. Elena thrust the magic rod around the chest area of the rushing goblin in order to push it back.</p><br/><p>Donn!</p><br/><p>With Elena\u2019s thrust, the goblin was blown away to the back and collided with the other goblin. The two goblins were tangled to each other and collapsed. They didn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan is amazing! Defeating two monsters simultaneously.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seemed Elena couldn\u2019t believe that she did it herself and was dumbfounded. She was astonished and confused.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood going Elena! Keep it up!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYosh Aya, make the next one also about the same.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>Next, Aya brought along 5 goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a bit too much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYosh Elena, attack using magic first.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena held the\u3010Water rod\u3011in her left hand and with\u3010Cloudburst\u3011, she brought a rain right above the 5 goblins. Perhaps her magic power rose from before, the rain\u2019s might is frightening. </p><br/><p>The goblins struggled under the cloudburst but only 1 managed to come out from it.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rain is exactly right on the money!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, who was around the cloudburst, kicked the goblin who managed to come out back inside.</p><br/><p>When the rain stopped before long, although only 4 out of 5 monsters were drowned and were not moving anymore, there\u2019s still 1 monster breathing.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, there\u2019s still 1 of them left.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena held the magic rod in her right hand, she hit last goblin hard and dealt the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Dual wielding rods looks good too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

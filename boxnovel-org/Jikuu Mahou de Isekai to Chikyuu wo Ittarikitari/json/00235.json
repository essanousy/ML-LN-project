Is that so?</p><br/><p> I thought it was certainly new years~.\u300f</p><br/><p>As expected, she looks strange.</p><br/><p>Is she by any change under control of some magic?</p><br/><p>I may understand it if I use\u3010Appraisal\u3011.</p><br/><p>When I thought so and used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on Yurie-san who is donned with a hannya mask.</p><br/><p>!!?</p><br/><p>The woman who was hiding behind Yurie-san suddenly got in between Yurie-san and me,</p><br/><p>and the\u3010Appraisal\u3011magic had been blocked by a suspicious shield.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that!?</p><br/><p>That woman\u2019s shield is made from a material I don\u2019t understand well, it has a dull feeling, and black in color.</p><br/><p>Although the\u3010Appraisal\u3011magic hit, I wasn\u2019t able to appraise it.</p><br/><p>The moment the magic hit, it felt like it was diffused, and canceled.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably something that can cancel magic.</p><br/><p>\u300eAra~. Koneko-chan, you protected me, right~?</p><br/><p> I will lick you later~.\u300f</p><br/><p>Yurie-san said such a thing to the woman with a shield,</p><br/><p>but since she talked in Japanese, it probably didn\u2019t make any sense to that woman.</p><br/><p>\u300eYurie-san, please return to your sanity.</p><br/><p> Let\u2019s return to Japan together.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI don\u2019t want~.</p><br/><p> Since it\u2019s a special dream that seems to be interesting,</p><br/><p> I have to enjoy it more.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s not a dream! It\u2019s reality!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAhaha~. Such a strange thing happened, it\u2019s impossible to be real~.\u300f</p><br/><p>No good, Yurie-san completely believes that it\u2019s a dream\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right! Since Elena has specially appeared too, it\u2019s a good opportunity to do it!\u300f</p><br/><p>Dangerous, I have a terribly dangerous feeling.</p><br/><p>When Yurie-san picked her skirt up a little\u2015</p><br/><p>from inside Yurie-san\u2019s skirt,</p><br/><p>several jet-black tentacles gushed forth with *une une*.</p><br/><p>\u300cHii!\u300d</p><br/><p>Overwhelmed by fear, Elena uttered a short scream,</p><br/><p>and hid behind me.</p><br/><p>\u300eElena-cha~n, you don\u2019t have to run away, you know~.</p><br/><p> Because it\u2019s not going to be painful~.\u300f</p><br/><p>From the bottom of my heart, I\u2015</p><br/><p>felt Yurie-san to be frightening.</p><br/><p>[1] The Hannya () mask is a mask used in Noh theater, representing a jealous female demon.

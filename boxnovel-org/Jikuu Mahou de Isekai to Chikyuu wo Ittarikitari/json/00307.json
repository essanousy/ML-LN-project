The rich people, who have lots of money? Or else, politicians or someone like that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout that, I talked about it with Aya-san and came up with something.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Elena said so, she held out a piece of printed-out paper.</p><br/><p>Uhhh, what is it, what is it?</p><br/><p>\u300eA magnitude 7.8 major earthquake occurred in Nepal. 8, 000 people dead and 14, 000 injured.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019d like to go to Nepal and volunteer?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and Elena nodded with uh-huh.</p><br/><p>I thought she was going to make money with recovery magic, but it was different, huh.</p><br/><p>When I try to think about it, Elena has no reason to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut how do you plan to go there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan\u2019t go there with onii-chan\u2019s [Teleportation]?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I tried to check the map, I\u2019m able to go to the neighboring country, India.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s because Nancy dropped by at that country during her round-the-world trip before.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too far, though, even the nearest among the places that we could go to head towards Nepal is 1, 000 km away.</p><br/><p>Even moving at the speed of sound, it\u2019s a distance that would take about an hour.</p><br/><p>After searching for an airplane going to Nepal on-site, we would be able to go there if I put a [Tracking Beacon] on someone boarding it, right?</p><br/><p>Considering the time difference, it\u2019s around evening in India right now, huh. Let\u2019s go there for a bit and check if there\u2019s an airplane going there.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait here for a moment since I\u2019ll check if we would be able to go there.\u300d</p><br/><p>I flew towards New Delhi in India.</p><br/><p>First, I acquired [Hindi], which is the local language and checked whether there\u2019s an airplane going to Nepal at the airport, then I put a [Tracking Beacon] on someone who was just about to board the plane and went back home immediately.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems that we will be able to go there. I put a [Tracking Beacon] on someone heading to Nepal.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs one would expect of onii-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I will go together with her tomorrow, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re going, too, Aya?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it better than Elena being alone?\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m more anxious with that than Elena being alone.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs Hilda-chan going to stay overnight at Megumi-chan\u2019s house today as well? Don\u2019t we have to invite Hilda-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs for Hilda, I\u2019ll contact her.\u300d</p><br/><p>With this and that, Aya and Elena are suddenly going to Nepal.</p><br/><p>With work, I can\u2019t move that much during the day, is it going to be alright?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

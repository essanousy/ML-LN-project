floor of the [Tower of Sunrise] with so much effort, thought it should\u2019ve been commemorated, there wasn\u2019t a boss.</p><br/><p>Well, there wasn\u2019t a reason for having a boss in every 10 floors either, but it became such a motivation\u2026</p><br/><p>That reminds me, is this tower really up to 60th floor? </p><br/><p>There was someone who said something like that before, \u201cthat\u2019s right~\u201d, the other people said, believing so for some reason, but they probably haven\u2019t discovered the 64th floor yet, besides, there might be 128 floors. </p><br/><p>If I\u2019m unlucky, it seems like it\u2019s also possible that there are 256 floors.</p><br/><p>Honestly, sometimes I\u2019m little anxious towards the circumstances of this tower.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s about the law-like nature of each floor that I\u2019ve passed so far.</p><br/><p>First, from the 5th floor to the 12th floor. </p><br/><p>Only these 8 stratum were an aquarium and sea-like floors.</p><br/><p>And then, from 13th floor to the 20th floor. </p><br/><p>The [Wind] was blowing in all of these strata.</p><br/><p>In the same way, from the 21st floor to the 28th floor was [Fire]. </p><br/><p>From the 29th floor to the 36th floor was [Darkness], from the 37th floor to the 44th floor was [Ice] and then from the 45th floor was [Lightning]. </p><br/><p>With such a feeling, it seems like the atmosphere of the whole stratum is changing every 8 floors.</p><br/><p>The 8 kinds of attribute magic\u2013[Wind, Lightning, Water, Ice, Earth, Darkness, Light and Fire]. </p><br/><p>With 8 kinds of magic \u00d7 8 floors, 64 floors\u2026 </p><br/><p>It seems to be like that?</p><br/><p>If my estimation is correct, the [Lightning] stratum is up to 52nd floor and it will be a new attribute from the 53rd floor.</p><br/><p>Since from the 4th floor underground to the 4th floor above ground is [Earth] attribute, perhaps it\u2019s going to be [Light] attribute from the remaining 53rd floor to the last?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s something to discuss about when my estimation was proven to be correct, though.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>While eating lunch, I checked the [Tracking Beacon] attached to everyone.</p><br/><p>The 4 people, Aya, Mai-san, Yurie-san and Ringo were watching a movie about love. </p><br/><p>For now, there seems to be no danger.</p><br/><p>As for Elena\u2026</p><br/><p>Her legs were spread wide and she was breathing heavily with pant pant. </p><br/><p>Immoral!</p><br/><p>Well, the three people, with Nancy and her mom, are just climbing a [bouldering] wall, though.</p><br/><p>Although it looks hard, but it seems quite fun.</p><br/><p>Hilda was singing a song in a karaoke box with Megumi-chan. </p><br/><p>It probably also serves as a practice for Hilda\u2019s singing, but-</p><br/><p>the two people, instead of a lunch meal, were eating with great relish a whole bread loaf, the one which seems to be high in calories and has honey, ice cream and the likes as toppings.</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan\u2026 you took a [Fat-reduction Potion] before, are you overeating because there\u2019s a fat prevention effect for a year?</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>I finished eating lunch and resumed conquering the tower.</p><br/><p>The 51st-floor enemy was a grandpa [Super Orc] with a cane and was quite strong.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s not a threat for the [Brown Belt Sword], which has its sharpness increased, though.</p><br/><p>Moreover\u2026 although it only took that much to go up from 49th to 50th floor, my level also rose up by 4 for just a day. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably because the level of the enemy has increased.</p><br/><p>And then, as expected, the atmosphere completely changed from the 53rd floor.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s so bright!\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because the dungeon\u2019s wall is shining brightly. </p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s [Light] attribute on and after the 53rd floor, huh.</p><br/><p>That day\u2019s conquering progresses up to the 55th floor. </p><br/><p>On the 53rd floor, a shining golem. </p><br/><p>On the 54th floor, a gigantic slime. </p><br/><p>On the 55th floor, a shining, great bird.</p><br/><p>Eventually, my level quickly rose up to 60.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\u2500 </p><br/><p>\u2502Name: Maruyama Seiji </p><br/><p>\u2502Job:

now.</p><br/><p>After that, my [Body Reinforcement] magic surprisingly became level 5!</p><br/><p>The skill that I acquired was [Overall Reinforcement]. </p><br/><p>It said that, using magic power, it can temporarily increased all stats\u2013an outrageous skill.</p><br/><p>Since there seems to be a problem in various ways when used too much, I\u2019ll only use it at a critical moment.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re unfair, onii-chan!

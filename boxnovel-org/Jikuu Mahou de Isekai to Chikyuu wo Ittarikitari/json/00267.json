Fuji\u2019s summit. Nancy, who believed so, finally started to get up.</p><br/><p>I had a delicious breakfast which had been brought into the suite room with everyone.</p><br/><p>\u300cNancy, see you later~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Since Aya also has junior college today,</p><br/><p>I send her off to Tokyo using\u3010teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-chan is also busy, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess so.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>For the day two of Kyoto sightseeing\u2015</p><br/><p>we\u2019re going to start from\u300eFushimi Inari[1]\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I feel that this place is somehow filled with mysterious power.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed, there\u2019s such feeling.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is it the effect of learning magic?\u2015</p><br/><p>I feel like it is filled with magic power for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! What\u2019s this!?</p><br/><p>A large number of gates(?) continue throughout the way!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is what called Senbon Torii[2].\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSen\u30fbbotorii??\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Sen(thousands)\u30fbShuiro(vermillion)\u30fbTorii Gate.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI seee.</p><br/><p>But, it\u2019s entirely vermillion, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis vermillion seems to be painted using dyes made from a mineral called cinnabar.\u300d</p><br/><p>Speaking of\u3010cinnabar\u3011, didn\u2019t I use it as an ingredient before when I made a\u300ephilosopher\u2019s stone\u300fwhich was an ingredient of\u300eelixir\u300f?</p><br/><p>I used the\u3010cinnabar\u3011from the other world at that time, can the philosopher\u2019s stone also be made using the\u3010cinnabar\u3011from Earth?</p><br/><p>We passed through the senbon torii while having such a talk.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, although Elena healed a rheumatic obaa-san who happened to passed by using\u3010Recovery magic\u3011, there had been no problem in particular and we finished our sightseeing in\u300eFushimi Inari\u300f.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>We, who left\u300eFushimi Inari\u300f,</p><br/><p>moved to\u300eHimeji\u300fnext.</p><br/><p>First, we had\u300econger eel meal\u300ffor lunch in Himeji,</p><br/><p>then, we went to sightseeing the\u300eHimeji Castle\u300fafterward.</p><br/><p>\u300cShimeji\u30fbCastle is cool, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Particularly, the white wall.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not shimeji, it\u2019s himeji.</p><br/><p>We have to get ready to go back to Tokyo soon.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhh!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to go back today\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Where did you learn such a line!?</p><br/><p>Moreover, such a line is said when two people are drinking at a bar and have gotten drunk.</p><br/><p>Nancy *giggle giggle* laughs happily while saying so.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s good, she seems to have enjoyed herself.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>We went to Himeji Station to take a train home.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re finally going home, huh~. It\u2019s somewhat regrettable to part, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, since we still have one day tomorrow, let\u2019s go somewhere around Tokyo. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! Then, I wonder where should we go~.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we were having such talk, I felt a sign that something was approaching from far away.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Something\u2019s coming.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gogoo-!!</p><br/><p>\u300cHiee-!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was an excessive event, Nancy embraced me.</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda hugged me, too.</p><br/><p>\u300cAll three of you, calm down. That\u2019s the Shinkansen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShinkansen!? Does the Shinkansen move that fast?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen it travels along this station, there are times when it passages through at 300km/hr.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c300km/hour!? A\u2026Amashing\u2026[3]\u300d</p><br/><p>The shinkansen passed by several times, Nancy and Hilda seemed to have grown accustomed to it and were delighted, while Elena didn\u2019t seem to have gotten used to it; every time the shinkansen passed by, *gyu gyu* she pressed two soft things on my body.</p><br/><p>For a short while, I patted Elena\u2019s head who was in a somewhat slouching posture.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When we returned to Tokyo, the sun had already set.</p><br/><p>\u300cAah, we have returned to Tokyo~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, was it fun?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn!\u300d</p><br/><p>Everyone got off at the Tokyo Station with a smiling face,</p><br/><p>however, I discovered something unpleasant on the map.</p><br/><p>A large number of dots that indicates\u300edanger\u300fsurrounded the area of Tokyo Station.</p><br/><p>They numbered 30!</p><br/><p>This is bad.</p><br/><p>At that moment-</p><br/><p>my smartphone got a call.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s from Director, what could it be?\u300d</p><br/><p>I have Nancy and the others to wait and answer the call.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, is there something wrong, director?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026u.\u300d</p><br/><p>U? What in the world is the director doing?</p><br/><p>\u300cHe\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHe?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHelp me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Director!?\u300d</p><br/><p>After the voice of the director asking for help, I heard a sound like a person getting struck.</p><br/><p>What on Earth happened!?</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you Maruyama?\u300d</p><br/><p>From the director\u2019s phone, I hear a voice which isn\u2019t the director\u2019s.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve heard this voice before.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the aforementioned mafia boss\u2019 voice.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>For the time being, I pretend not to know what he is talking about and play along with him.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis man have been restrained. Bring Nancy along in exchange.\u300d</p><br/><p>What to do!?</p><br/><p>Alright, let\u2019s ignore him!</p><br/><p>\u300cStop with the stupid joke. I\u2019ll hung up because I\u2019m busy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, this isn\u2019t a joke\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I hang up without listening to him until the end.</p><br/><p>Immediately , I got a call from the director\u2019s phone again.</p><br/><p>I turned the smartphone off without answering the call.</p><br/><p>Of course, I know that it\u2019s not a joke.</p><br/><p>However, I mustn\u2019t negotiate here.</p><br/><p>First things first, let\u2019s take Nancy to a safe place.</p><br/><p>The director may have been hit, but I have no choice but to have him endure.</p><br/><p>While they think that I think it\u2019s a joke, he won\u2019t be killed.</p><br/><p>The director will also probably be kept to the place where the pursuers from last time are getting tortured.</p><br/><p>I have to rescue the director one way or another.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, is the call already over?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>First, we must escape from the Tokyo Station in order to be not discovered by the thirty mafias.</p><br/><p>All the Shinkansen\u2019s exit ticket barriers are being watched, but it\u2019s ridiculous that there\u2019s only one transfer/change(train) exit which is being watched.</p><br/><p>I lead Nancy and the others from the transfer/change(train) exit which isn\u2019t being watched towards the conventional train line.</p><br/><p>The conventional train line is being watched too, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Japan is best for its number of platforms, there are also countless entrances and exits too.</p><br/><p>All of it can\u2019t be covered with only thirty people.</p><br/><p>We boarded a train from the platform that wasn\u2019t being watched and escaped from the Tokyo Station leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u300cNancy, you should stay at my house today.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji\u2019s house!? U-, Un, okay\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Nancy was fidgeting for some reason.</p><br/><p>Do you want to go to the toilet or something?</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. \u2013 Wikipedia</p><br/><p>[2]Thousands of torii.</p><br/><p>[3]Shu\u2026shugoi\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

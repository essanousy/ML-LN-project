It\u2019s too hot!</p><br/><p>Moreover, we\u2019re still in the middle of the stairs.</p><br/><p>How hot will it be on the upper floor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, we need to change our clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We transformed ourselves into\u300eswimwear\u300fusing\u3010Magic stone of transformation\u3011and climbed up the stairs again.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s hot even with a swimwear.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I complained,</p><br/><p>Elena looks cool for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Elena, what\u2019s that clothing?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena wore something like a sheer dress on top of her swimsuit.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a clothing made with Water Magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh! Good, it looks cool!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, Hilda and I copied Elena</p><br/><p>and created clothes using Water Magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cTa-dah! It\u2019s Water Armor!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I boasted about my Water Armor with a self-satisfied look,</p><br/><p>Aya and Hilda wrapped their bodies with water, too.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s quite difficult, huh.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two people probably weren\u2019t that good at Water Magic,</p><br/><p>they looked like they were wearing a transparent\u300ekigurumi\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, it\u2019s a little difficult, but let\u2019s continue exploring while maintaining this for a while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYe~s.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>The temperature of the Water Armor rose up on our way up and we almost had a hot flash,</p><br/><p>but the water temperature was lowered using Ice Magic and the exploration somehow continued.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, the path is blocked.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked, the path was blocked with a\u300elava flow\u300f.</p><br/><p>The\u300eLava flow\u300fcontinues to flow from the right to the left.</p><br/><p>That seems to be difficult to cross.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs far as I can see on the map, beyond this point looks dangerous, though.</p><br/><p>We have no choice but to take a detour, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, can\u2019t the lava be cooled down using water?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, that\u2019s right, let\u2019s give it a try!\u300d</p><br/><p>The four of us began to spray water toward the lava flow using\u3010Water Magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>*Sizzleeeeeeeeeeeeee!!*</p><br/><p>Together with a frightful sound, a tremendous steam was generated.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s hot, hot!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya stopped spraying water alone and volunteered to take charge of blowing away the incoming steam using\u3010Wind Magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>The lava cooled down and hardened, it seemed like we could somehow cross over it on foot.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, let\u2019s go across!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>We crossed over the still warm lava in a big hurry and were able to somehow breakthrough.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u300cPhew, it was hot!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we broke through the lava flow and took a rest\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>a\u300elava\u300fattacked again.</p><br/><p>The new lava was not a lava flow,</p><br/><p>but a\u300eGolem\u300f.</p><br/><p>The\u300eLava Golem\u300fis said to be a golem with a body made of lava.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to use a valuable sword toward a golem like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, water attack!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The Lava Golem was struck by the water attack from the four of us, generating a cloud of steam with *moo-moo*.</p><br/><p>And then, it cooled down and hardened\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>*Creak creak*\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The Lava Golem wasn\u2019t able to move anymore.</p><br/><p>In spite of being golem, it hardened to the extent of being unable to move,</p><br/><p>it\u2019s weak, huh.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>After that, when we found the stairs and climbed up the twenty-second floor\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>a\u300ebuilding fire\u300fwas taking place.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s not a\u300ebuilding\u300fbut a\u300etower\u300f.</p><br/><p>The landscape seemed to be similar to the twenty-first floor,</p><br/><p>but something like an oil was burning in many places.</p><br/><p>And this floor was hot, too.</p><br/><p>\u300cAgain, is it going to be hot on the following floors, too?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is a little weary, too.</p><br/><p>After advancing for a while\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>a flame attacked.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it was a monster called\u300eOil Slime\u300f.</p><br/><p>Or rather, it seems more like a Flame Slime rather than an Oil Slime because it\u2019s on fire.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s put out the fire using\u300ehosing down\u300f.</p><br/><p>We were able to defeat the slime that had its fire put out easily.</p><br/><p>As expected, it\u2019s an easy victory if one can use the magic of its weakness attribute.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>After that, we found the stairs to the next floor\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The time was a little early, but we decided to stop today\u2019s exploration,</p><br/><p>partly because we were tired and partly because it was hot inside to advance.</p><br/><p>\u300cAaah, so tired~.\u300d</p><br/><p>As soon as we went home, Aya sat down on the sofa still dressed in a swimsuit.</p><br/><p>\u300cGet up, relax after you change your clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>It seemed Aya was tired, she got up with a\u300eheigh-ho\u300fand went to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>I called such Aya to a halt.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, onii-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it going to be your final exam soon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUhh\u2026\u2026for the whole week next week, it\u2019s going to be an exam holiday,</p><br/><p>and exams the week after.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?</p><br/><p>Then, you must study, so take a time off from tomorrow\u2019s dungeon capture.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s hard if you repeat the same class, you know.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s-\u2026that\u2019s right, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cConsult with a senior and have him show you the past exam questions or something.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood~.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll ask Mai-san and Yurie-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>So obedient.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s going to be Aya\u2019s first exam in the Junior College.</p><br/><p>I decided to sleep early to be prepared on the next day.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s note:</p><br/><p>Please support the author by buying his work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Aya wasn\u2019t home yet.</p><br/><p>I put the high class melon I bought in the refrigerator. Different from my usual routine, I changed my clothes to a dandy housecoat.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, they aren\u2019t your usual clothes, are they?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Aya\u2019s friends will drop in today so I intend to meet them with an appearance that suits the occasion.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh! Well then, I will also change my clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena went to change clothes. But the clothes she wore just now were fine.</p><br/><p>Elena changed her clothes and returned\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what on earth is that attire\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, what is it? Is it strange?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena wore a princess dress.</p><br/><p>When I was thinking about what to say and explain\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m home!\u30fc\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya had returned home.</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena went to the front door dressed as it is.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan! Why are you dressed like that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, welcome back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPardon the intrusion.\u300d\u300cExcuse me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Following Aya, Mai-san and Yurie-san made their appearance.</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena greet the two visitors elegantly. She held the hem of her skirt and lower her posture a little.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a princess!\u300d\u300cThere\u2019s a princess!\u300d</p><br/><p>Mai-san was a little surprised, while Yurie-san excitedly approached Elena. Going with the flow, she kissed the back of Elena\u2019s hand. Elena tried to pull it back a little.</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome. You\u2019re Aya\u2019s club senpais. I\u2019ve heard a lot from her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, this fellow is my oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? Good evening\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>As I greet them, Mai-san cautiously stared at me for some reason. Yurie-san was crazy about Elena and almost didn\u2019t notice me. </p><br/><p>I led the two to the living room but Yurie-san still held Elena\u2019s hand. Rather than kissing, she began to lick the back of Elena\u2019s hand in the end. Even Elena was also smiling wryly.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey Yurie, quit it. Everyone is looking at you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hold myself back.\u300d</p><br/><p>I knew that she was a dangerous person but this much was\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s now hold our first cosplay meeting.\u300d</p><br/><p>*clapclapclap*</p><br/><p>Aya loudly declared the start of the meeting. Elena applauded while Mai-san and Yurie-san smiled, their expression was like watching a small child.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, oniichan! Prepare something delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, alright.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, I knew Aya would say such a thing. </p><br/><p>I took out the melon which I especially cooled in the refrigerator. Because it wasn\u2019t that cold, I cooled it using\u3010Ice magic\u3011with just the right temperature. I sliced it into 8 equal parts then put 2 parts each on 4 plates and gave it to the four people.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cThank you very much.\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? What about oniichan\u2019s share?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe? I\u2019m good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust because you\u2019re in front of the visitors, you\u2019re trying to look cool. Should I give you half of mine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHalf! If you\u2019re going to share, don\u2019t give me with nothing but the rind left!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, you like the melon\u2019s rind, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re talking about the salmon\u2019s skin!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?\u300d</p><br/><p>Why are you saying such comedic dialogue in front of the visitors!?</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch intimate brother and sister.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWhere!?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>I overlapped with Aya. So embarrassing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cMore importantly, let\u2019s push the meeting forward!\u300d</p><br/><p>With Aya\u2019s onward movement, the meeting proceeds. Everyone watched the DVD of\u300eMagical girl \u30fbC\u300ftogether.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> The first episode is something like this:</p><br/><p>1. C was admitted to the University and was forcibly put into the Magic Research Club.</p><br/><p>2. She became friends with Apure and Ran who joined the club together.</p><br/><p>3. In the beginning, the club was only verifying the pataphysics regarding magic\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>4. The club Captain, Sigil called them to the river bank and showed them magic.</p><br/><p>5. The three people were given magic batons from Captain Sigil.</p><br/><p>6. The 3 new members became real magical girls.</p><br/><p>But, after watching the first episode, Aya began to play episode 6 for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, why episode 6 after episode 1?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, you\u2019ll understand once you\u2019ve seen it.\u300d</p><br/><p>The sixth episode is something like this:</p><br/><p>1. The\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300fappeared in Akihabara.</p><br/><p>2. The four magical girls were dispatched to exterminate the monster-man.</p><br/><p>3. The magician of fire,\u300eRan\u300fwas bathed in\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300f\u2019s\u300eLoli Loli beam\u300fand became a\u300eLoli girl\u300f.</p><br/><p>4.\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300ftemporarily withdrew,\u300eRan\u300fcould not return from being a\u300eLoli girl\u300f.</p><br/><p>5.\u300eRan\u300fspent an eventful day being a\u300eLoli girl\u300f.</p><br/><p>6.\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300fappeared once more.</p><br/><p>7. \u300eRan\u300fwho was humiliated furiously beat the shit out of\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300f.</p><br/><p>8.\u300eRan\u300freturned to normal after defeating\u300eBug monster-man Lolicon\u300fbut when she returned to normal, the clothes she was wearing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was unexpectedly interesting. Especially the end\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAno, the\u300eRan-chan\u300fwho became small looked similar to Captain.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you talking about, Yurie? I\u2019m not that small!\u300d</p><br/><p>No no, I think it looked very similar.</p><br/><p>In the end,\u300eLoli girl\u300fversion of\u300eRan\u300fwill be Mai-san. </p><br/><p>In the process of elimination,\u300eSigil\u300fthe magician of earth will be Yurie-san. </p><br/><p>Still, it seems me being the man who woks as a sales clerk in the game arcade was determined. Well, it\u2019s fine since that character seems to have a cool feeling, I think?</p><br/><p>After the assignment of the characters had been determined, we talked about the costumes.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes yes! I will make the costumes!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, Yurie is good at it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat being the case, Elena-chan, please take off your clothes there in the dark because I need the body size and various measurements.~\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, Yurie-san broke\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, stop it Yurie! Don\u2019t try to strip off Elena-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>Yurie-san stopped her sexual harassment with Mai-san\u2019s desperate persuasion and took normal measurements.</p><br/><p>*Haa haa* Yurie-san, while panting, took everyone\u2019s measurements. Was this person really okay?\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, I didn\u2019t listen to everyone\u2019s measurement, okay?</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Elena-chan\u2019s hair ornament is really beautiful.\u300d</p><br/><p>Yurie-san was breathing heavily while taking in Elena\u2019s size and noticed the\u3010Hair ornament of recovery\u3011which Elena was wearing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAs if a real magic power is dwelling inside this hair ornament and it\u2019s very beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yurie-san is sharp! It was bullseye.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s also similar to the hair ornaments after the transformation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, you\u2019re right. But the color is slightly different.\u300d</p><br/><p>The color of the hair ornaments of each magical girl were green for C, red for Ran, blue for Apure and yellow for Sigil.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, how are we going to make magic batons?\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, there\u2019s a baton with similar feeling. Please wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>I took out the\u3010Water rod\u3011from the inventory in my room and showed it to everyone back in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u300cGreat, it\u2019s solidly made. The color is just like the magic baton of Apure-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf only there\u2019s a heart symbol mounted on it, it would look exactly like it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll also try to procure hair ornaments and batons with different colors.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.Well, I\u2019ll try my best to make the costumes.\u300d</p><br/><p>As such, the first cosplay meeting was brought to a close.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

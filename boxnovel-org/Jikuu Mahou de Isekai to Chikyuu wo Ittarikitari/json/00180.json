The body separated from the part that seemed to be the head and fell on the mud with a splash.</p><br/><p> And, it was no longer moving as it is.</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it was a\u300egreat eel\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo it's an eel!! I wonder if it's delicious when grilled?\u300d</p><br/><p> I put it away into the inventory after washing it in water a little.</p><br/><p> By defeating the 1st monster, 90% of the enemies in this underground's third floor are no longer undetermined.</p><br/><p> I moved toward the room where the enemy was still undetermined.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When I entered the next room, a similar enemy from a little while ago attacked again.</p><br/><p> But, the enemy is not only one size larger this time,</p><br/><p> when it jumps out of the mud, its wings-like pectoral fins spread out like a flying fish and glides in the air!</p><br/><p> However~</p><br/><p> it's somewhat troublesome because it approaches from hiding in the mud\u2015</p><br/><p> but if it glides in the air, it's completely exposed to view......</p><br/><p> I launched a\u3010Wind blade\u3011and it flew, slicing off the head of the enemy who is in the air.</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, the enemy was called\u300eFlying great eel\u300f.</p><br/><p> The bones of the pectoral fins have to be taken out properly, it seems to be sticking in the throat when eaten.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When I defeated the second monster, the undetermined enemies had become only one.</p><br/><p> It had determined that one to be the boss.</p><br/><p> I went underneath the hidden room before going to the boss but I couldn't enter it as expected.</p><br/><p> There's still a bottom, huh......</p><br/><p> Up to what floor is there underground?</p><br/><p> Is the floor above the ground by any chance a dummy and the route that leads to the bottom actually the right course?</p><br/><p> It's no use even if I think about it here so I'll go to defeat the boss.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When I entered the room, there was a huge\u300edragon\u300f.</p><br/><p> It's not an\u300eeel\u300f!?</p><br/><p> Did the\u300eeel\u300fby any chance evolve and became a\u300edragon\u300f?</p><br/><p> Isn't a\u300ecarp\u300fthat evolves into a\u300edragon\u300f??</p><br/><p> When I look at it carefully, its gleaming exterior appears to be eel-ish too.</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010appraisal\u3011, it seems to be a\u300eDragon eel\u300f.</p><br/><p> Although it's dragon-ish, it's still an\u300eeel\u300f.</p><br/><p> When I heard the enemy's movement\u2015</p><br/><p> it suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a very powerful water current.</p><br/><p> However, I can't move my feet well in the mud.</p><br/><p> Since there's no helping it, I set up a Water blocking barrier and stopped it.</p><br/><p> Immediately after blocking the water for a moment, it spat out a big rock this time.</p><br/><p> I transformed the barrier into Earth blocking this time and defend against it.</p><br/><p> It seems this guy is good at attacking by spitting out water and rock, it attacks repeatedly with this two kinds of attack at random.</p><br/><p> I tried to attack with the indomitable\u3010Wind blade\u3011but it wriggled its body, dodging my\u3010Wind blade\u3011.</p><br/><p> The exchange of long-ranged attacks continued for a while but it will get nowhere at this rate.</p><br/><p> The\u300eDragon Eel\u300flaunched a big\u300erock\u300fand it rolled over without sinking into the mud.</p><br/><p> I climbed up on the rock, looking for an opening and jumped with all my might from there.</p><br/><p> The\u300eDragon Eel\u300flaunched a rock towards me who is in the air once more.</p><br/><p> I knocked the\u300erock\u300fdown with the back of the blade of the sword of trial but I fell down with the rock as well.</p><br/><p> I jump once more using the rock which I knocked down as a foothold.</p><br/><p> The water current attack assaulted me this time.</p><br/><p> I set up a barrier diagonally and glided over the water current in the same way as surfing.</p><br/><p> I, who finally managed to come close to the\u300eDragon Eel\u300f\u2015</p><br/><p> sent that fellow's head with the sword of trial smoothly.</p><br/><p> The\u300eDragon Eel\u300ffell down, making a big splash of water.</p><br/><p>\u300cPheww.\u300d</p><br/><p> Even the enemy itself is weak, it's hard to do an intense battle if the footing is bad.</p><br/><p> When I checked the sword of trial, it had become\u300e67/100 monsters\u300f.</p><br/><p> Since I've gone directly to the boss, the trial doesn't progress.</p><br/><p> Well, I don't have to intentionally fight on such bad footing, let's proceed to the next floor.</p><br/><p> Ah, but, it will be delicious if I make a kabayaki[1] with it, I'll come again!</p><br/><p> While putting away the\u300eDragon Eel\u300finto the inventory, I came down from the stairs which were in the depths of the room and went to the underground's fourth floor.</p><br/><p>[1] Kabayaki () is a preparation of fish, especially unagi eel, where the fish is split down the back (or belly), gutted and boned, butterflied, cut into square fillets, skewered, dipped in a sweet soy sauce-based sauce before being broiled on a grill. -

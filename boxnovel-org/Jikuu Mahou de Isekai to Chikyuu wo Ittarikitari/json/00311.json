[Specified location]?</p><br/><p>I was curious and used the magic stone several times, but\u2026\u2026no matter how many times I\u2019ve used it, I was [Teleported] to the same place.</p><br/><p>\u300cSay, Oracle-chan, does the destination point of this magic stone perhaps fixed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right~, since it was recorded with [Absolute Reference1], the position has become fixed.\u300d</p><br/><p>It has such a mechanism, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, there\u2019s also a [Relative Reference2], right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, amazing, as expected of Seiji, you realized, huh~. However, you better not record [Teleportation] with [Relative Reference].\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not going to do such a thing because if I\u2019m unlucky, it isn\u2019t unlikely for me to end up [inside a stone].\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s just as you said~.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Oracle-chan and I are talking like that,</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, I don\u2019t understand what you guys are talking about\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems to be too difficult for Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I don\u2019t understand it that much, was the magic stone completed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it was completed. However, it seems it can\u2019t be used like my [Teleportation], the destination point is fixed at this room.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, if I have that magic stone, I can go home anytime instantly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I made magic stones of the same kind for the three and gave one each.</p><br/><p>\u300cYehey! I will be able to go home easily from the junior college with this!! Onii-chan, onii-chan, make a magic stone that can go to the junior college, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s definitely no good!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy~!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you suddenly appear with magic, it will be exposed that you can use magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I see~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t \u201cah, I see~\u201d me!</p><br/><p>Aya was foolish up to this point\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s shameful even though she\u2019s my younger sister.</p><br/><p>Well, if an [Invisibility] magic stone is made, she can use [Teleportation] without anyone finding out, but stupid Aya didn\u2019t realize it.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I have a question.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, Elena?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWith the [Teleportation Magic Stone], is it possible to go to the Dolaidos Kingdom?\u300d</p><br/><p>I see\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Elena, you\u2019re saying this and that, when actually, you\u2019re yearning for your father, the King, huh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it\u2019s possible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, could you make me a magic stone that can go to the church\u2019s orphanage in the Royal Capital?\u300d</p><br/><p>It was different! It wasn\u2019t the King!</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, I understand! I will make as many as you\u2019d like if it\u2019s a request from you, Elena!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena is really a good girl!</p><br/><p>The King is outside the mosquito net3 though!</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about you Hilda, don\u2019t you have a magic stone you\u2019d like to be made?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe magic stone that can go to Megumi-chan\u2019s house, it\u2019s no good, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it\u2019s no good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case~, I\u2019d like a magic stone that can go to Rachel-san\u2019s, Misha-san\u2019s and Cassandra-san\u2019s place, is it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll make three especially for you, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-onii-chan, thank you very much!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMou, both of you are unfairrr. Why only mine is no good!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya looked like a child, who wasn\u2019t given a candy; she threw a tantrum, throwing herself on the floor and flailing her hands and legs.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s completely a child\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What was Oracle-chan doing while we were having such a conversation, you said\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She was stuck to the PC, browsing through a lot of various sites while smirking.</p><br/><p>Are you a male middle-schooler browsing through an ero-site!?</p><br/><p>1.

A Japanese expression referring to the people outside of the community and so they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, while everybody else, who\u2019s under the mosquito net, does, but it also used metaphorically like \u2018x is not part of the people/things y cares about\u2019 and etc etc.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

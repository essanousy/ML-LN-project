Let go of my arm! My arm will break!!\u300d</p><br/><p> When I release the arm of the man who was going to grab Aya-</p><br/><p> the 3 hooligan cautiously took a distance.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you! Where did you came from!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I take this chance to use\u3010Quick\u3011on myself.</p><br/><p>\u300cAppearing suddenly and putting a brave front. Do you think you can beat the 3 of us with just yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you think you can beat me with just the 3 of you? Stop talking garbage and come at me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cScoundrel! Get him!\u300d</p><br/><p> The 3 thugs attacked me at the same time.</p><br/><p> But the attacks felt so slow because of\u3010Quick\u3011and my several level ups.</p><br/><p> I casually dodged the attack of the 3 thugs but they are stubborn and formed an encirclement.</p><br/><p> It looks stupid, they think I can\u2019t fight with this.</p><br/><p> With\u3010Future prediction\u3011, I\u2019m aware of the attacks coming from behind, I avoid it quickly and tripped him with my foot, he stumbled down to the guy in front.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere\u2019s that energy you used to brag awhile ago? You can\u2019t even do anything to me with 3 people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s do this!\u300d</p><br/><p> Surprisingly, each of the thugs took out a knife and lowered themselves into a fighting stance.</p><br/><p> Oi oi! This is Japan, bringing out weapons, this guys must\u2019ve gone crazy.</p><br/><p> The 3 thugs attacked me at the same time.</p><br/><p> I deflect the knife coming from the man in front causing it to pierce the arm of the man in the right, to avoid the knife coming from the man in the left, I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011and moved to the back of the man in front.</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa! It\u2019s painful!!\u300d</p><br/><p> The man in the right with a knife pierced into his arm crouched down in pain and unable to fight anymore, it became 2 vs 1.</p><br/><p> The thugs who was confused by the\u3010Teleportation\u3011stopped their thoughtless attacks and became vigilant.</p><br/><p> The silent stand-off continued for a while.</p><br/><p> The guy in front of me a while ago who looks like a spaniel in a handbill seems like the leader, winked to the other guy for some reason.</p><br/><p> What on earth are you scheming?</p><br/><p> The guy who seemed to be the leader plunge into me alone.</p><br/><p> I continue to dodge his knife-</p><br/><p> The other guy rushed over to Aya.</p><br/><p> Shoot, he\u2019s going to attack Aya.</p><br/><p> I gave the leader a counter punch in the face then I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011and appeared between the other man and Aya.</p><br/><p> The guy thrust his knife, I tried to deflect it in order for it to not hit Aya but it only shifted slightly and grazed my cheek.</p><br/><p> I strike him into his solar plexus, and cast a weak\u3010Electric shock\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cGyoe~tsu!\u300d</p><br/><p> That fellow gave a short scream, fell down and stopped moving.</p><br/><p> The leader who recovered from the punch earlier looked at me with disbelief when he saw that his friend was defeated.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the only one left, are you going to hide your tail behind your legs and run away?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn!!\u300d</p><br/><p> The leader rushed to me in desperation-</p><br/><p> I sneaked in to his back using\u3010Teleportation\u3011and chopped his neck with a weak\u3010Electric shock\u3011, causing him to faint.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan!\u300d\u300cSeiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p> Taking away the knives of the 3 thugs into the inventory, I embrace Elena and Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome on, let\u2019s go home.\u300d</p><br/><p> I put a hand on Aya and Elena\u2019s head, hugging them lightly and went home using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m extremely worried.</p><br/><p>Well, if it\u2019s absolutely no good, there\u2019s no choice but to help again, huh.</p><br/><p>Because it will be troublesome if it don\u2019t turn out well, the same goes for Ringo, too.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>With this and that,</p><br/><p>I put the matter about the Nancy\u30fbJewelry aside for the time being.</p><br/><p>We decided to resume capturing the\u300eTower of Sunrise\u300fwhich had been postponed.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m also worried about what happened to Yurie-san during the party, it\u2019s something that can\u2019t be postponed for too long.</p><br/><p>With that, on Saturday morning,</p><br/><p>Aya, Elena, Hilda and I departed for the different world.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>First, we went to meet Lela as usual.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo, Lela.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the kind of behavior similar to lovers who weren\u2019t able to meet all the while.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only last week that I wasn\u2019t able to come, it\u2019s very exaggerated~.</p><br/><p>\u300cI wasn\u2019t able to come last week,</p><br/><p>but was there any changes?\u300d</p><br/><p>According to Lela\u2019s story,</p><br/><p>because the\u300eDevil-kin\u2019s statues\u300fin various places have been destroyed, the surprise attack of the devil-kin seems to have been completely stopped.</p><br/><p>The devil-kin came using those as expected.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any problem.</p><br/><p>Is there any problem that occurred elsewhere?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not a problem, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>N? Is there something else?</p><br/><p>\u300cThat magic tool with which the feudal lord of each town can talk to each other;</p><br/><p>there are organizations that would like to use that, I want to get permission from you, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOrganizations? Which organizations?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe three organizations\u2013the Adventurers Guild, the Merchants Guild and the Healers Association.\u300d</p><br/><p>I see, they are groups who need intelligence network everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no problem with me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so!? That\u2019s great.</p><br/><p>The price of the magic tool is special, we\u2019ll have to discuss it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well honestly, we have enough gold, so it\u2019s not really necessary, though~.</p><br/><p>But I will accept it, if they say that they will give us.</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, Lela.</p><br/><p>What are you going to name that magic tool?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe inventor usually name the new magic tool.</p><br/><p>If possible, I want you to decide, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>then, it\u2019s fine with\u300eMagic Stone Phone\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300ePhone\u300f, you say. What\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a tool that does something similar in my country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, there\u2019s such a tool in your country, huh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela looks at me in they eyes that seem to say\u300ebring me there, too\u300f\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>but still, should I bring her along even though she doesn\u2019t have any business there?</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, since we\u2019re going to capture the Tower of Sunrise again,</p><br/><p>contact me with the\u3010twin magic stone\u3011if there\u2019s anything, best regards.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to the Tower of Sunrise to escape.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300c*Phew,*</p><br/><p>finally, we can resume the dungeon capture.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we went to the Tower of Sunrise\u2019s thirteenth floor\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>in there, a vast wilderness stretched out.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Is this place inside the tower?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is surprised and puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u300cI seems so.</p><br/><p>Well, since there was even a flower bed in the lower floor, I suppose this floor is like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm.\u300d</p><br/><p>However, there\u2019s something in atmosphere that\u2019s different from the other floors.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut onii-chan, the wind is blowing in this floor.\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right! It\u2019s the wind!</p><br/><p>Even if there\u2019s a vast landscape that stretched out in the other floors, it feels contrived in some respects. It\u2019s probably because there\u2019s no wind.</p><br/><p>However, the wind is blowing quite naturally in this floor.</p><br/><p>That completes the atmosphere as though it was really an another place.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere may be something different in this floor from the other floors.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s act carefully.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY~es.\u300d\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>When we explored the vicinity\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, a bird is flying.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya said and when I looked up into the sky,</p><br/><p>a bird which seems to be a slightly bigger seagull was flying.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that an enemy?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011,</p><br/><p>it seems to be a monster called\u300eAlbatross\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to be an albatross[1].\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlbatross? When you say Albatross, that albatross?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it seems to be a monster, too, it may be different from the Earth\u2019s albatross.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Aya and I were making such talk\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>the albatross noticed us and attacked!</p><br/><p>The albatross swooped down at me.</p><br/><p>I promptly dodged with a back-step.</p><br/><p>*Bote*</p><br/><p>\u300cAh.\u300d</p><br/><p>The albatross fell down crashing into the ground.</p><br/><p>*bata bata*</p><br/><p>The albatross gets up with a somehow comical movement;</p><br/><p>it walks unsteadily trying to escape.</p><br/><p>When I was going to kill the albatross, which was about to fly, with the White Belt Sword\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, wait!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya suddenly stopped me.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, what\u2019s the matter?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it looks pitiful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPitiful? But, it\u2019s a monster.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked at the albatross,</p><br/><p>it was walking unsteadily trying to escape.</p><br/><p>It probably can\u2019t fly out easily once it lands on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, it may attack us again if we let it escape?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will do something at that time!\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh well, let\u2019s leave it to Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, Aya, you do something about it.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s no use, I will kill it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we were advancing for a while, another albatross attacked us again.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, it came.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya tries to send the albatross away using Wind Magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis-! Teya! Dang it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya\u2019s wind hits the albatross,</p><br/><p>but as one would expect, it\u2019s something only birds have,</p><br/><p>it somehow manages to recover its posture again in the air.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s the matter, Aya? You didn\u2019t manage to do it at all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince those fellows can\u2019t move if they fall into the ground,</p><br/><p>shouldn\u2019t you make the wind blow downward?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019ll try it.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Aya generates a downward wind,</p><br/><p>the albatross lost its dynamic lift and fell into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid I do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>The albatross doesn\u2019t seem to be dead,</p><br/><p>it somehow stood up and escaped with *toko toko*.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it! The downward gust is a huge success!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDownward gust? It\u2019s\u300eDownburst\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat does\u300eDownburst\u300fmean? Cool!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya seemed to like the\u300eDownburst\u300f,</p><br/><p>she routed the albatrosses, which attacked in large quantities, with\u300eDownburst\u300fafterwards.</p><br/><p>\u300cKuhahaha! Eat my Downburst!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is in high spirits.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t you just going to drive them away because they were pitiful!?</p><br/><p>After that, thanks to the outstanding performance of Aya,</p><br/><p>we were able to find the stairs upwards.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He deserves to die 10000 times.)</p><br/><p>Such heartfelt voices filled with emotions and dreadful gazes, went through me.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-san. Let\u2019s entrust this place to everyone here, we must go the the next place.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, I understand!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, after saying goodbye to the adventurers, disappeared into the town\u2019s back street along with me.</p><br/><p>\u300eWho is that fellow!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHe\u2019s flirting with my Elena!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWho is yours!? Elena belongs to me!\u300f</p><br/><p>From the back, I thought I heard quarreling voices. Let\u2019s pretend I didn\u2019t hear anything, in order for us to escape, we teleport towards Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we have arrived in Ikebu town, the soldiers are tense.</p><br/><p>There is indeed a horde of goblin on the way to the town but it\u2019s still alright today.</p><br/><p>One\u2019s body won\u2019t last long if he\u2019s too tense.</p><br/><p>When I went to the inn where Lela is, the soldiers at the entrance let us through with face pass.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, their attitude was almost like telling us, \u201cI was waiting\u201d.</p><br/><p>When we entered Lela\u2019s room\u2015</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been embraced by Lela.</p><br/><p>How did this happen!?</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, what\u2019s wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThough you said you\u2019ll rush immediately, why didn\u2019t you come sooner!? What are you going to do if by any chance, I\u2019m attacked!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped, the monsters haven\u2019t made an attack yet!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Such, I don\u2019t know! We just probably haven\u2019t discovered them yet and they are hiding nearby!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t hiding nearby.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Truly!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYah.\u300d</p><br/><p>Last time, weren\u2019t you enthusiastic to become a hero?</p><br/><p>Did she recall being taken away by High orcs that\u2019s why she\u2019s nervous again?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou want to become a hero, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the commanding officer of the troops left to defend this town! If you\u2019re nervous, the soldiers will be too. Since the goblins will attack tomorrow, let the soldiers take a proper rest. If you don\u2019t, they won\u2019t last until tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that true!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I can grasp which position where the goblins are now at. So, take a rest too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>I told the soldiers outside Lela\u2019s room the order the take a break.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, since I\u2019ll be going out in a bit, you take a rest properly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, W-, Where are you going!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s for weapons supply, because the current weapons are a bit unreliable.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt any rate, there aren\u2019t any weapon in this town\u2019s weapon shop anymore, I\u2019ve already collected everything for the defense of this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s all right because I\u2019ll go to other towns to buy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOther towns!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn\u2019t you see it yesterday? Since I have teleportation magic, I can go there immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Then, I will also come along.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the commanding officer. What kind of commanding officer leaves his troops behind?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Really, she\u2019s so frightened\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why the troops are tense.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, Elena. Please wait here for awhile.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena has Lela sit down and makes tea.</p><br/><p>Among other things you let a princess make tea, are you a person of importance?</p><br/><p>I left Lela to Elena and teleported to Nippo town using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I came over to Gamudo-san\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cHelloo.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Seiji. It\u2019s unusual that you\u2019re alone today. Did you obtain equipment with attribute reinforcement?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I was able to gather everything.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I see. What do you need today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cToday, I would like to buy a weapon for myself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? What happened to the Replica sword you bought previously?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere was a guy who was difficult to deal with using Replica sword, I want a better one.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? What did you fight against.\u300d</p><br/><p>I should probably tell the truth to Gamudo-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cGoblin Prince.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPrince!!? Are you serious!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s true.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san brought a sword from the back of the shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis here, is the best weapon I can sell in the shop.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san unsheathed the sword\u2015</p><br/><p>Revealing a sword which shone in silver.</p><br/><p>It seemed somewhat great.</p><br/><p>I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Mithril sword\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Sword made from silver mithril.</p><br/><p>\u2502Sharpness increases when magic power is applied.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u300cM-, Mithril?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, you recognized it well.\u300d</p><br/><p>I received the mithril sword from Gamudo-san.</p><br/><p>Its weight and length fit perfectly in my hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou seem to like the sword. That sword is better than the Replica sword. That\u2019s something you won\u2019t be able to obtain unless you go to the Dwarf country. Until then, use that Mithril sword.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you. How much?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019d like to say \u2018I need you to do something\u2019 but, only priestesses would say that. It\u2019s 50, 000 Aurum.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>I forked out 500 pieces of 100 Aurum gold coins and put them on the table\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWai-t, you-!\u300d</p><br/><p>The table creaked and nearly broke.</p><br/><p>\u300cPurchasing outright!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it bad?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI intend to have you pay little by little and as interest during that time, I will request liquor each time. My plan was ruined.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t worry, I will often come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, then it\u2019s good.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san and I shook each other\u2019s hands and laughed wildly.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Upon returning to Lela\u2019s place\u2015</p><br/><p>Elena and Lela are having a tea gracefully.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWelcome back.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena is fine but it feels slightly strange being greeted by Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what kind of weapon did you buy?\u300d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Elena\u2019s follow up, I seem to completely recover my composure.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I remove the sword from the sheath, the two people\u2019s eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>Especially the brightness of Lela\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s like the eyes of a maiden in love.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s, Mithril!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy rapier is also mithril!!\u300d</p><br/><p>As Lela said so, she retrieved her rapier and put it on top of my sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Lela\u2019s is mithril as well?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yeah. I-, It\u2019s the same.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Lela said so, she pleasantly smiled at me.</p><br/><p>Did Lela like mithril that much?</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she has some sort of mithril fetish?</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, it\u2019s now late so, shall we look for an inn?\u300d</p><br/><p>I put the sword away and tried to depart\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Wait. Why don\u2019t you stay here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHere? Isn\u2019t this place reserved?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s my room. So, y-, y, you may stay at this room!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t there only 1 bed in this room?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yeah\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>In the end, we received vacant rooms at both sides of Lela\u2019s and decided to stay there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

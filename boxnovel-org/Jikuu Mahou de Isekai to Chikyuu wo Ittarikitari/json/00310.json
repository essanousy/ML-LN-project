I told you to wait down there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince onii-chan didn\u2019t come back quickly, we were thinking whether you have died or what and came here to look at the situation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, Aya-san was very worried.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, Elena, I wasn\u2019t worrying!\u300d</p><br/><p>Seriously now, it\u2019s impossible for Aya to be worrying about me, perhaps, Aya was behaving misleadingly.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you guys are Aya-chan, Elena-chan and Hilda-chan, huh. I wanted to see you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oracle-chan speaks to the three people.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Who\u2019s this girl? She\u2019s small!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not small because among the Spirits, I\u2019m big!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Spirit-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing that it\u2019s a Spirit, Elena and Hilda knelt down immediately.</p><br/><p>\u300cRight! I\u2019m the Spirit of [Information Magic]. It\u2019s Magical Girl Oracle-chan~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOracle-chan is small and cute! Are those clothes sailor uniform?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve told you already, I\u2019m not small! These clothes were made using your world\u2019s clothes as a reference~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Even though Elena and Hilda are kneeling, Aya is so over-familiar.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s also good to be respectful like Elena-chan and Hilda-chan, but like Aya-chan, it\u2019s also better to talk like a friend.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy any chance, Oracle-chan doesn\u2019t have any friends?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho\u2019s a loner!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll be a friend of Oracle-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-chan, did you not hear what I said? Well, friends\u2026 alright, you may.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda were looking at Aya\u2019s behavior with dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, you guys may visit the mana crystal, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys are using the smartphone that were given to you in Seiji\u2019s world, aren\u2019t you? If you guys were using information familiarly like that, you will certainly be able to acquire [Information Magic].\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes, I\u2019ll certainly meet your expectations.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, you\u2019re stiff.</p><br/><p>Toward such a gal-like Spirit, you don\u2019t need to humble yourself like that.</p><br/><p>With this and that, the three people visited the mana crystal.</p><br/><p>Aya acquired [Information Magic] level 2 while Elena\u2019s and Hilda\u2019s were level 1.</p><br/><p>With this, the three of them will be able to acquire [Caution] magic.</p><br/><p>This is good.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Oracle-chan, now that everyone acquired [Information Magic], can you now tell me about the matter regarding Yurie-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, I\u2019ll tell you! To tell you the truth, that black thing is a magic tool used to imprison Spirits.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cImprison Spirits? Then, is there any Spirit imprisoned inside?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, which Spirit do you think is imprisoned?\u300d</p><br/><p>Listening up to here, it\u2019s easy to guess,</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s [Darkness], isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that\u2019s right, the [Darkness Spirit] is imprisoned inside that black thing. As for making the [Appraisal] ineffective, it\u2019s the [Darkness Spirit]\u2019s power.\u300d</p><br/><p>Like, using it to catch a Spirit, those guys of the Devil race are quite troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, if we released the imprisoned [Darkness Spirit], Yurie-san will go back to normal?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, just as you said~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we do to release it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe need various things and follow the necessary steps. There should be something called [Altar of Darkness] inside the stronghold of the Devil race. We need to locate that first.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe stronghold of the Devil race, huh. If I remember correctly, the Devil race is residing somewhere in the north, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, but I also don\u2019t know anything aside from it being somewhere in the north.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmmm, I should\u2019ve located the stronghold of the Devil race beforehand.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s useless even if I say it now.</p><br/><p>\u300cI should hurry and look for it, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, I will help, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will help, too!\u300d\u300cMe, too!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>With that said, among the places we could go to, we went to the northernmost one.</p><br/><p>That place is the [Sekabu Village].</p><br/><p>There are probably a lot of people who had forgotten it.</p><br/><p>This place is thought to be destroyed by the Demon King\u2019s Army, but the truth is, the village was occupied by the Goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, are we going to search for the Devil race\u2019s town from this place?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll split up around 1 km apart from each other and all search northwards at the same time. It\u2019s Operation Roller.1\u300d</p><br/><p>Actually, I\u2019d like to do it with a remote-controlled [Tracking Beacon], but since the movement speed of the [Tracking Beacon] is about the same as walking-speed, it would take time.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you find anything, take out a handkerchief and wave it to inform me and I\u2019ll rush over immediately. Well then, let\u2019s start searching!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>I sent each of them to their respective starting point and with the four of us, the Operation Roller began northwards.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>The Operation Roller began and the four of us had differences in speed.</p><br/><p>The fastest one is naturally me.</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m using [Lightning Speed], I\u2019m picking up a considerable speed.</p><br/><p>Second is Aya.</p><br/><p>Although she\u2019s exerting herself to some degree, her speed is about half of mine.</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda are moving at approximately the same speed, about more than half of Aya\u2019s.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m hesitant to make a girl act alone inside a forest, but the monsters inside this forest aren\u2019t that much strong and everyone\u2019s level has risen considerably, too, so they should be alright.</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m thinking about such things, Aya is fighting against a tiger-looking monster.</p><br/><p>Is she going to be alright?</p><br/><p>Aya defeated the tiger-looking monster with ease and put the monster\u2019s corpse in the [Storage Bracelet].</p><br/><p>She seems to be alright.</p><br/><p>When the search continues for a while, I\u2019ve seen Elena suddenly stops, takes out a handkerchief and waves it.</p><br/><p>I stopped searching and rushed over to where Elena is.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, is something up?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, please look at this.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I tried to look at the ground where Elena pointed at, there was a leaf that looked familiar for some reason\u2026..</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this?</p><br/><p>When I tried to use [Appraisal],</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Mandrake\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A plant which root can become an ingredient for various medicines,</p><br/><p>\u2502especially, using it when the root is dried.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>Among the ingredients of the Elixir, it\u2019s the ingredient that became a bottleneck.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this [Mandrake] has grown en masse with a considerable number.</p><br/><p>If I use the [Earth Magic Stone] to nurture the [Mandrake], wouldn\u2019t I be able to make Elixir as much as I\u2019d like?</p><br/><p>I patted Elena, who found it, a lot.</p><br/><p>However, we weren\u2019t able to find the stronghold of the Devil race with today\u2019s search in the end.</p><br/><p>1. R\u014dr\u0101 sakusen(\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3060). Basically, a search operation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

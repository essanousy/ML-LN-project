Is it alright?</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Seiji-dono. I want you to come with me for a little while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don't particularly mind.\u300d</p><br/><p> I've been taken in by Bunmi-san's cajolery and followed him nonchalantly when\u2015</p><br/><p> we have been surrounded by approximately 300 demonkind soldiers.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou are-!</p><br/><p> You're the human child who had given me the thing called candy!</p><br/><p> Is there anymore candy of that time?\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems to be the people who had gotten candy from Hilda somehow or other.</p><br/><p> Hilda looked troubled.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p> I handed a bag of candy that I've prepared over to Hilda.</p><br/><p> Since the candy has always been consumed in large quantities, I've prepared a decent amount.</p><br/><p> Hilda began to distribute the candies to the demonkind soldiers cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this is it!

I'll give this to you in exchange.\u300d</p><br/><p> The soldier handed Hilda a fruit as thanks for the candy.</p><br/><p> It was probably a fruit from the demonkind's country.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll give this to you too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I'll give this.\u300d</p><br/><p> The demonkind soldiers handed Hilda a lot of things one after another.</p><br/><p> Fruit, nuts, herbs, mushrooms, folkcraft.</p><br/><p> When Hilda got various things and she couldn't hold them in both of her hands anymore, she brought them to me.</p><br/><p> When I received the goods, she handed out candies again and then it would be repeated.</p><br/><p> It was totally like an idol's handshake event.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, this fruit is delicious~.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya has already eaten the gift to Hilda......</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, here.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena is also holding something in her hand.</p><br/><p> Has Aya's gluttonous infected Elena as well?</p><br/><p> However, what Elena handed to me was some kind of grass.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, is something wrong with this grass?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's, Isn't that the\u3010purple nettle\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011to the grass.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Purple nettle\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A medicinal herb with an effect of cleaning impurities.</p><br/><p>\u2502Can be used as a talisman against evil.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's really the\u3010purple nettle\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, does Seiji-dono in need of\u3010purple nettle\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p> Bunmi-san heard it.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I want to use it for the ingredients of a potion.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you still need more?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right, I need 100 more.\u300d</p><br/><p> If my prediction is correct, after making 100\u3010curse dispelling potions\u3011, my\u3010potioncraft\u3011should be able to level up to 5.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, listen up everyone.</p><br/><p> It seems Seiji-dono is looking for\u3010purple nettle\u3011.</p><br/><p> Is there any one of you who has?\u300d</p><br/><p> When Bunmi-san asked the soldiers, 29 soldiers had\u3010purple nettle\u3011and gave them to me.</p><br/><p> I was able to obtain a total of 30\u3010purple nettle\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll look for shops and the like afterward.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, it may be slightly difficult.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause the human merchant had just bought it, I think that there's hardly any of it remained.\u300d</p><br/><p> That reminds me, Lyle Gewalt had said that it's one of the trade items.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there a place where we can pick up\u3010purple nettle\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you go to the\u300eMita forest\u300f, I think you can find it on your own but monsters became more ferocious recently so you can't take it easily.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMonsters that became more ferocious, forest dungeon, it has come!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya raised the tension.</p><br/><p> You need to calm down from time to time!</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you intend to go to the\u300eMita forest\u300f?</p><br/><p> I think it will be alright if it's you guys but be careful, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I'll go once all the\u3010purple nettle\u3011I've got this time has been used up.</p><br/><p> Where is the\u300eMita forest\u300flocated?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can reach that place by heading west for a short while from this town.\u300d</p><br/><p> We obtained\u3010purple nettles\u3011and new information.

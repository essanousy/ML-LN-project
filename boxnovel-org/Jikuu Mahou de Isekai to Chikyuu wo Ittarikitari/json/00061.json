water\u3011.</p><br/><p>Looking at the\u3010Purified water\u3011\u2019s recipe, it seems possible to use\u3010Purification\u3011on the\u3010Water\u3011with\u3010Water magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>Its name will become\u3010Purified water\u3011after using\u3010Purification\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>it\u2019s\u300ePure water\u300fwith practically no impurities, it doesn\u2019t matter what it\u2019s called, right?</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, it seems\u3010Water magic\u3011\u2019s \u3010Purification\u3011is required for the next recipe.</p><br/><p>First, we should acquire it for us to be able to use it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Purification\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, let\u2019s try to do it with an image of cleaning the\u3010Water\u3011for

it, I was able to do it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it is amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p>I showed Elena how to do it several times\u2015</p><br/><p>shortly after, Elena was able to successfully

our\u3010Potioncraft\u3011went up from 2 to 3.</p><br/><p>Even if there\u2019s the effect of\u3010Skill mastery increase\u3011, it raised a little too fast.</p><br/><p>There should probably be another factor that makes level up easy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was due to the tools that have been brought from Japan?</p><br/><p>Since Elena was already feeling sleepy, we decided to end our potion crafting

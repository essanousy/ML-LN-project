What on earth could it be?</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat the heck is this, it\u2019s beyond perfect!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIsn\u2019t that girl the lolita Ran-chan of episode 6!?</p><br/><p>Yes, lolita, no touch!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eA-, Apure-chan, moe~!!</p><br/><p>She\u2019s cuter than in the anime!!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSygil-chan is also perfect as well\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Sygil-chan, who is supposed to be a cool beauty,</p><br/><p>is panting while looking at the girls around.</p><br/><p>Has she been brainwashed by\u30fb\u30fb\u3010Bug monster man\u3011?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eC-chan is also cute but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>she seems to be a bit bad-natured compared to the anime.\u300f</p><br/><p>Speaking of the\u300eMagical girl\u30fbC\u300fwho has bad-natured personality\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>it seems to be Aya and the others.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me. Let me through please.\u300d</p><br/><p>I push my way though the crowd, trying to join Aya and the others but I can\u2019t get close easily because there are so many people.</p><br/><p>Notwithstanding, I keep on pushing my way through the crowd and somehow advance.</p><br/><p>Uwa, who is that? Someone touched my butt!</p><br/><p>Whilst overcoming various troubles, I finally arrived to where Aya and the others are.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, you\u2019ve finally come, oniichan.

He\u2019s a bit of an ossan.\u300f</p><br/><p>The people around us were making various talks.</p><br/><p>Or rather, I\u2019ve heard everything!</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause we are now the characters of\u300eMagical\u30fbC\u300f, we must completely become them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it? I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to convince Elena and sort of avoided the worst-case scenario.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the four people struck a variety of poses whilst the surrounding people took pictures one after another.</p><br/><p>Speaking of myself, I just did nothing but this or that odd jobs like a manager-san.</p><br/><p>After a while, the surrounding people calmed down but.</p><br/><p>That fellow suddenly appeared!</p><br/><p>\u300cI found you, Magical girl C!</p><br/><p>Coming across me here is nothing but your bad luck! Be prepared!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Who has appeared!?</p><br/><p>It was an unknown woman.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, that\u2019s\u300eMagical girl\u30fbC\u300f\u2019s rival character,\u300eRingo-chan\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>There is such a character as well, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for popping in on you unannounced.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, back to normal.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo be also wearing characters of the same work, can I join you guys?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood good!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m Maruyama Aya. Best regards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m called Ringo.</p><br/><p>My real name is also\u300eRingo\u300f. Nice to meet you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, with the addition of the rival,\u300eRingo-chan\u300f,</p><br/><p>the cosplay convention continued peacefully.</p><br/><p>But, I feel like I\u2019ve seen seen this Ringo-chan somewhere before\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>where have I seen her before?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Suddenly, *dizzy* its body began to sway and immediately after, it collapsed, toppling sideways. </p><br/><p>(Small) and (Medium) rushed over anxiously while the Prince had a surprised look.</p><br/><p>Great cat tiger (Large) , while being watched by (Small) and (Medium), stood up slowly. But, *stagger* its steps were unsteady.</p><br/><p>The liquid I threw into the mouth of the great cat tiger (Large) was a liquor. Besides, it has a concentration of 96, it was a liquor with the world\u2019s highest concentration.</p><br/><p>I bought it for the time when we plan to make the Elixir. It wasn\u2019t needed immediately, so I will just buy it again later.</p><br/><p>Great cat tiger1 (Large) staggered and bumped into (Small) and (Medium), it had to have support each time. Its steps were completely tottering.</p><br/><p>Seeing how things were, it began to coil itself around (Small) and (Medium).</p><br/><p>(Small) and (Medium) tried their hardest to soothe it.</p><br/><p>Great cat tiger (Large) trampled on the tail of Great cat tiger (Medium). And finally started to fight.</p><br/><p>(Small) was at a loss, circling around the two fighting animals.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe pets, your last ray of hope, are like this. What will you do?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eUseless pets.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the prince said so, *walks slowly* it approached the Great cat tiger and swung the huge club from its waist.</p><br/><p>The Great cat tiger (Large) and (Medium), who were fighting with each other, received the Prince\u2019s blow and collapsed. </p><br/><p>The Great cat tiger (Small) was frightened with the sudden occurrence and fled into the forest.</p><br/><p>What a cheap bastard, doing such a thing! Pet abuse is a felony!</p><br/><p>\u300eIt was only entertainment thus far. I\u2019ll flatten you immediately.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eTry it if you can!\u300f</p><br/><p>Inside the forest where trees burned in the surroundings, there was only the Prince and I. The mortal combat will finally begin.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> While the face-off with the Prince continued.</p><br/><p>I tried to check up on Elena.</p><br/><p>The town\u2019s adventurers followed Elena and fall back near the town\u2019s entrance. The battle\u2019s situation is reflected.</p><br/><p>Her MP is running low, without using magic, the enemies are sent flying with\u3010Magic rod\u3011.</p><br/><p>But, when I tried to check the map, the small fries decreased to the extent that it seems they will soon be annihilated.</p><br/><p>I can now face the Prince in a mortal combat with a peace of mind.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> The Prince who had become irritated, brandished his huge club and attacked.</p><br/><p>But, as it was a huge weapon, its speed was slow.</p><br/><p>I quickly moved to the side and dodged it. The huge club directly hit the ground and the ground shook.</p><br/><p>Uh-oh.</p><br/><p>As the ground shook, I lost my footing\u2015</p><br/><p>The next instant, I was blown off directly to the side!</p><br/><p>I set up a barrier just before it hit and suppressed the power. Since I blocked it with the Replica sword, there wasn\u2019t that much damage.</p><br/><p>But, an attack that shakes the ground is troublesome.</p><br/><p>My timing is going to be delayed when I lose my footing.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat kind of? Can\u2019t do a thing?\u300f</p><br/><p>The guy prepared the same attack again.</p><br/><p>I dodged it to the side in the same way and at the moment when the ground was about to shake, I jumped.</p><br/><p>\u300eFool!\u300f</p><br/><p>The guy stopped in the middle of his first attack, at a trajectory like the character \u201c\u30ec\u201d , unleashed his second attack.</p><br/><p>I can avoid it quickly with\u3010Teleportation\u3011if I like but I intentionally used\u3010Wind magic\u3011\u2019s wind gust and dodged the upward attack. And, as it is, I swung down the Replica sword towards its defenseless head.</p><br/><p>*Thud*</p><br/><p>With a dry sound, the helmet that the Prince was wearing, split into two.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat!?\u300f</p><br/><p>Riding on the momentum, I destroyed the Prince\u2019s armor in the same way.</p><br/><p>\u300cCurse you! What a cheap bastard, doing such strange movements!\u300f</p><br/><p>Then, aiming at the Prince\u2019s body that has become bare, I slashed using the Replica sword.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026But.</p><br/><p>The Replica sword, which cut the Prince\u2019s body about 1 cm, stopped.</p><br/><p>\u300eWas that an attack? With such an attack, you can\u2019t damage this body of mine!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Prince triumphantly laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>I give up, the attack doesn\u2019t go through, there\u2019s no choice but to attack using magic. But, I don\u2019t want to reveal too much of my magic.</p><br/><p>I put away the Replica sword and took out the\u3010Knife\u3011made in japan instead.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s that small weapon?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Prince\u2019s laugh immediately ceased.</p><br/><p>*Pierce pierce*</p><br/><p>I approached while dodging the Prince\u2019s club and kept stabbing the Prince\u2019s body producing spattering sounds.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt hurts! How can you pierce my body with such a weapon!?\u300f</p><br/><p>In this way, I could defeat him if I just kept on stabbing *splatter spatter*.</p><br/><p>Just when I thought so\u2015</p><br/><p>The prince, at the moment when the knife pierced, contracted its muscles on that spot making the knife can\u2019t be pulled out.</p><br/><p>I was puzzled for an instant on how to pull the knife out. The Prince having completed its aim, swung down its club.</p><br/><p>I promptly throw a\u3010Lightning fist\u3011. The Prince became paralyzed, stopping its attack. I hastily pulled out the knife.</p><br/><p>Dangerous!</p><br/><p>After that, it became a one sided development.</p><br/><p>The Prince gradually lost the sharpness of its attack from bleeding and pain. I can now easily get close.</p><br/><p>After attacking with a stab, I paralyzed him using\u3010Lightning fist\u3011.</p><br/><p>As for pulling the\u3010Knife\u3011out, rather than pulling it out as it is, *grind* I rotate it and pull it out after the wound expanded.</p><br/><p>I considerably get used to handling the\u3010Knife\u3011. Not only stabbing, I can now also use it to cut.</p><br/><p>When such a thing continued for a while\u2015</p><br/><p>The Prince, who was covered with blood from all over, knelt down at last.</p><br/><p>\u300eI, I\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Leaving those words unsaid, the Prince fell on his face and didn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>I dealt the finishing blow and cut off the prince\u2019s neck. When I put the knife away in the inventory\u2015</p><br/><p>The\u300eGaze\u300fI felt all the while, finally disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300eLevel went up to 35.</p><br/><p>\u3010Short blade techniques\u3011acquired.</p><br/><p>\u3010Short blade techniques\u3011is now level 4.\u300f</p><br/><p>As there was a level difference, I leveled up at once.</p><br/><p>But, battling while hiding the trump spells till the last moment was really tiring\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When I checked the map, with Elena\u2019s participation, the monsters had been nearly wiped out.</p><br/><p>I can now finally let out a breath.</p><br/><p>And I returned to where Elena is.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1 a pun, also means drunkard cat.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

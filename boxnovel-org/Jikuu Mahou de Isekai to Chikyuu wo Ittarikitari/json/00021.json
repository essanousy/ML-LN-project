Having bookmarked the grassland, I went back and used \u3010Teleportation\u3011 to get to the grassland with the 3 of us.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let\u2019s try out our magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOooh~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, Elena. Could you show us an example?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, please leave it to me! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOoh~ clap clap clap\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Seiji-sama, do you have any water on you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWater? I do have mineral water.\u300d</p><br/><p> I take out a plastic bottle of mineral water from the inventory, opened the cap and gave it to Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much. I\u2019ll be using \u3010Water Magic\u3011. Please watch carefully.\u300d</p><br/><p> Oh, so the water wasn\u2019t for drinking, but was for using magic.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u25cb\u25b3\u25c7\u00d7\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena, began to chant a strange incantation.</p><br/><p> I\u2019ve never chanted an incantantion like that though\u2013</p><br/><p> Is that chanting really necessary?</p><br/><p> Whe Elena finished chanting, the water in the plastic bottle began to faintly glow.</p><br/><p> Eventually the water flowed out of the plastic bottle and began to form a sphere in the air.</p><br/><p> The sphere of water floating in the air began to slowly move, following Elena\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p> However, at that moment!</p><br/><p>\u300cHakuchu~!\u300d</p><br/><p> When Elena made a cute sweet\u2013</p><br/><p> The sphere of water that was just above my head bursted and splash over me, orz.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m so sorry! Seiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAhaha, Nii-chan is soaked! \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo hit the great me with that attack, you sure are motivated Elena!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTh-that\u2019s not it, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ll wipe it immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Elena-chan, wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, Aya-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll use\u3010Wind Magic\u3011 and dry my dripping wet Nii-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I\u2019ll catch a cold if you do it so leisurely like that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo no, it\u2019ll be fine so leave it to me. Elena-chan too, don\u2019t wipe him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJeez, it doesn\u2019t really matter so just do it quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, here it goes! Wind, blow~!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Along with Aya\u2019s strange shout, whoosh, the wind blew.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it! The wind blew!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPrecisely, it\u2019s only natural that the wind is blowing, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not it! Are you making a fun of my \u3010Wind Magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not really it\u2013 but, I\u2019m trying to get dry so rather than regular wind, make a wind like a blow dryer please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, right, a blow dryer.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya held out her hands like she was holding a blow dryer in front of me\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300cDryer\u30fbGO!\u300d</p><br/><p> with a strange shout.</p><br/><p>Vwoosh!</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it works!\u300d</p><br/><p> A blow dryer-like wind, was blown on my face.</p><br/><p> However, the strength of the wind is \u300cWeak\u300d.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not going to dry like this, make it stronger.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJeez, you sure are a demanding Nii-chan. Dryer\u30fbAverage~!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vwwoooosshh!!</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, the wind got stronger than before. You did it, but why \u300eAverage\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJeez, be quiet. Things have an order to them!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen next is\u2026 Dryer\u30fbStrong!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vvwwwoooooossshhh!!!</p><br/><p> A powerful wind was blown on my face.</p><br/><p>\u300cHold on, not in the face. Dry the wet areas, also it\u2019s a little cold.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCold? Oh right, I need to make \u300eWarm Air\u300f. But, how am I supposed to make \u300eWarm Air\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow would I know.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe warm air of a blow dryer, it\u2019s electricity that heats up the air, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, air passes through an electrically-heated coil which warms up the air.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I can also use \u3010Lightning Magic\u3011, could I also make warm air?\u300d</p><br/><p> While blowing me with cold air, Aya was mumbling.</p><br/><p> Anything is fine, so please hurry up, I\u2019ll really catch a cold.</p><br/><p>\u300cDryer\u30fbWarm Air!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Vrrwaaaaar!</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s warm!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYay! It worked!\u300d</p><br/><p> When me and Aya had completed the \u3010Warm Dryer Magic\u3011, Elena was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing Aya-san, to have created a new magic!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya and Elena held each other\u2019s hands and jumped up and down in delight of having completed a new magic.</p><br/><p> But then\u2013</p><br/><p> Aya suddenly lost strength and sunk to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong, Aya-san!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems like I\u2019m worn out.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWorn out?

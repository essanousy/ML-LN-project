Well then, see you later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're going already?</p><br/><p> At least, leave Elena behind...\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee you!\u300d</p><br/><p> Interrupting the King's talk, we went to Nippo town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! It has been a long time, Rondo.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, Elena-sama,</p><br/><p> and...A-, Aya-san!\u300d</p><br/><p> Rondo, why are you being embarrassed......</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san.</p><br/><p> Since I will have the dinner prepare right now, please eat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo......</p><br/><p> rather than such a thing, the magician at the King's place seems to have been sighted in this town, I'd like to hear it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that thing.\u300d</p><br/><p> At Rondo's instruction, a timid looking soldier came.</p><br/><p>\u300cTalk about that magician.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, understood.\u300d</p><br/><p> According to the soldier's story......</p><br/><p>\u30fbAlmost two months ago, he happened to see that magician going out of Nippo town.</p><br/><p>\u30fbHe left the town and headed north.</p><br/><p>\u30fbHe didn't come back to the town since then.</p><br/><p> These were everything I could learn.</p><br/><p> When he went to the Royal Capital along with Rondo, he seemed to have seen a magician who was with the king at that place and remembered his face.</p><br/><p> Speaking of two months ago, it was exactly the time when I was competing in the fighting competition in Nippo town.</p><br/><p> Was he perhaps watching the fighting competition back then?</p><br/><p> He hasn't come back from Nippo town toward the north.</p><br/><p> When I think about it normally, there's a high possibility that a person who hasn't returned has been attacked by monsters, but......</p><br/><p> If we assume that it involves Yurie-san's case, he should be in good health somewhere.</p><br/><p> Is there something northwards of the town?</p><br/><p>\u300cI will try to search the north for now.</p><br/><p> Everyone, wait for me here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will also come together with you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMai-san, I'm sorry, but\u2015</p><br/><p> I can't take you with me since I'm going to search using magic.</p><br/><p> Since I will inform you once I find something, please wait with everyone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see......</p><br/><p> Understood......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWith that decided, Aya-san, let's have a dinner together......\u300d</p><br/><p> Rondo has suddenly became spirited, he's trying to take Aya's hand and escort her.</p><br/><p> He's not a bad guy, but......</p><br/><p> I feel somewhat irritated.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> The sun set, and inside the pitch-black forest,</p><br/><p> I was running through it using\u3010Lightning flash\u3011.</p><br/><p> Recently, I think that I'm often running about inside the forest by myself......</p><br/><p> I was running around for three hours,</p><br/><p> but I only encountered goblins, orcs, and normal monsters.</p><br/><p> I've already come considerably northward.</p><br/><p> As expected, I magician can't come deep into the forest by himself\u2015</p><br/><p> let's expand the search's rage a little bit more to the east and west.</p><br/><p> About three more hours has passed, and it's completely dead at night.</p><br/><p> After I finished searching to the western side,</p><br/><p> I've begun to search the eastern side this time.</p><br/><p> Finally, there was a reaction of a devil-kin!</p><br/><p> Apparently, it seemed to be battling something.</p><br/><p> I approached hoping to not get noticed.</p><br/><p> One devil-kin was fighting a pair of a man and woman.</p><br/><p> The woman is injured and the man is fighting while protecting her.</p><br/><p> Due to that, it has become the man just keeps on fighting defensively, it's a pretty bad situation.</p><br/><p> And, these man and woman were people I know.</p><br/><p> I used\u3010teleportation\u3011toward the back of the devil-kin and made him faint with\u3010electric shock\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cWha-!?\u300d</p><br/><p> That man was surprised at the sudden turn of events.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's been a while,\u300eGadol\u300f, and\u300eHalva\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!?</p><br/><p> Y-, You are......\u300eSeiji\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p> The man and woman who were fighting against the devil-kin were the dragon-kin siblings,</p><br/><p> \u300eGadol\u300f, and\u300eHalva\u300f.</p><br/><p> There might be someone who forgot,</p><br/><p> but these two people were players who fought against me and Aya in the fighting competition.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, why are you here!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm looking for someone,</p><br/><p> likewise, why are you fighting against a devil-kin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen we were camping out in the middle of hunting, Halva was attacked from behind when it was her turn to stand guard.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, is your injury alright, Halva?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It's fine.\u300d</p><br/><p> Halva says so, but she doesn't seem very good.</p><br/><p> She's probably poisoned from the cut toward her back.</p><br/><p> Since I made\u3010Curse dispelling potions\u3011and\u3010Wound healing potions\u3011in a somewhat larger quantity than usual while I was making elixir, I had her drink one each,</p><br/><p> and Halva's wounds and complexion slowly recovered.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry to trouble you.\u300d\u300cThanks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it's fine, we have gotten rid of a devil-kin while we're at it.</p><br/><p> Other than that, are you going to Nippo town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, we are going back to the dragon-kin's village rather than the Nippo town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDragon-kin's village? Is it near here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry, but the location can't be told.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's what they call hidden village, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cOops, I almost forgot.</p><br/><p> I happened to have another task, Gadol.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI've kept the spear you entrusted me before.</p><br/><p> I have to return it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat spear......</p><br/><p> However, that spear was cursed, you didn't dispose of it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI still have it.</p><br/><p> and it's possible to remove its curse since I have a\u3010curse dispelling potion\u3011. What will you do?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Curse dispelling potion\u3011......</p><br/><p> is it expensive?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, in its own way.\u300d</p><br/><p> It's a lie.</p><br/><p> To be frank, since a lot was made with my skill up, there's a lot of excess~.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo be honest, that spear is an important thing which has been passed down from generation to generation in our village.</p><br/><p> Although I can't pay the price immediately,</p><br/><p> I want to remove the curse if possible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, well then, right away.\u300d</p><br/><p> I immediately took out that spear, the\u3010devil-kin's spear\u3011with *boron*.</p><br/><p> And then, I sprinkled the\u3010curse dispelling potion\u3011on the\u3010devil-kin's spear\u3011.</p><br/><p>*Jutsu!*</p><br/><p> A black-smoke-like something rose from the spear, toward the sky, and then vanished.</p><br/><p> I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on the spear.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Dragon-kin's spear\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Raises the status,</p><br/><p>\u2502and calm the spirit of the wielder,</p><br/><p>\u2502and if the wielder is a dragon-kin, the effect will rise even more.`</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>The\u3010Devil-kin's spear\u3011had changed into\u3010Dragon-kin's spear\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cI've removed the curse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for the trouble, and thanks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI want to thank you for the spear, would you like to come to our village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn't the location of the village a secret?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's a dangerous place to promote,</p><br/><p> furthermore, if it's the benefactor who removed the curse of the spear,</p><br/><p> the village people will also probably understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> I'm in the middle of searching a person, but......</p><br/><p> it's better to tell the dragon-kin about the devil-kin as well,</p><br/><p> let's try to go for a bit.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, what are we going to do about this devil-kin?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKill it.\u300d</p><br/><p> Gadol thrust his spear toward the devil-kin's heart without hesitation.</p><br/><p> Merciless......</p><br/>\n</div>"}

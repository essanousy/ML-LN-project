We will also go to the other world this week.</p><br/><p>The purpose for this week is to look for information about that black thingy on Yurie-san\u2019s thigh.</p><br/><p>Since Yurie-san is being kept in after school together with Mai-san,</p><br/><p>the members are the four of us\u2013Aya, Elena, Hilda, and I.</p><br/><p>First, we went to where Butte-sama was.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, Butte-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy, my, if it isn\u2019t Princess Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems Butte-sama completely ignored us except for Elena, huh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cHonestly\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I explained Yurie-san\u2019s situation and asked whether she has any idea what it is.</p><br/><p>\u300cI haven\u2019t heard of such curse.</p><br/><p>Besides, I don\u2019t have any idea what is if even the appraisal displays that it\u2019s not a\u300ecurse\u300f.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry, Princess Elena. I\u2019m not much of a help.\u300d</p><br/><p>Umu, now that would be a problem.</p><br/><p>Even Butte-sama doesn\u2019t know what it is.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right, do you want this, Butte-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>I handed Butte-sama a certain thing.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Butte-sama stares at it as if wanting to eat it.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama!</p><br/><p>Why did you give Butte-sama our photo album?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? It\u2019s a good result of much effort so, don\u2019t you want various people to see it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>We left Butte-sama who continued to eagerly look at Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo albums alone.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Next, we went to where Lela was.</p><br/><p>Although there\u2019s Yurie-san\u2019s matter, I\u2019m also worried about what happened to the battle with the devil-kin.</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Lela, we came again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, you came!\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela greeted us with a pleasant smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cI returned hastily last week, is there any new information since then?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there is!</p><br/><p>That twin magic stones\u2019 magic tool has finally been distributed to each town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s good to hear.</p><br/><p>So, did you have any talk with each town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, we shared what kind of situation each town was in after the war with the devil-kin last week,</p><br/><p>and it was decided that each town will interchange materials and the likes that were lacking.\u300d</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve used it quite constructively, huh.</p><br/><p>It feels good, isn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u300cHowever, there\u2019s one problem\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat problem?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAll of the magic tool\u2019s pairs are at my place.</p><br/><p>Properly speaking, I think they should be at otou-sama\u2019s place.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, not at all. They\u2019re here at your place to save me the trouble.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Why is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAren\u2019t you the only one who can contact me, Lela?</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you call out to me with the twin magic stones?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so!? That\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela is glad the she nods with *un un*.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s a surprise attack of the devil-kin at some town, I will know it through Lela.</p><br/><p>In that case, it\u2019s the outline which we can rush there immediately.</p><br/><p>Oh, we can\u2019t rush there immediately if it\u2019s on weekdays, though.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right. I have a favor to ask of you, Lela.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, say anything!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI want you to check it using the communication network.\u300d</p><br/><p>I told her about Yurie-san\u2019s matter.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, to help a woman who was manipulated by the devil-kin\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you ask the people of the other towns?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, understood, I promised that I will listen to anything you say.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela went to the string phone\u2019s private room and asked everything to the feudal lord of each town.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor the time being, there\u2019s no immediate information,</p><br/><p>but since there\u2019s also a place where you can ask a well-informed person in each town too,</p><br/><p>let\u2019s wait for now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, thank you.</p><br/><p>But, do you communicate with this magic tool, Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? What do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, if there\u2019s someone who contacts you when you go out, wouldn\u2019t you be in trouble?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it better to appoint an expert to receive the calls?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, is that so\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s something like a phone number.</p><br/><p>\u300cHave trustworthy men to stand guard at this room in turns,</p><br/><p>and, it\u2019s also better to keep a record of the conversation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026..</p><br/><p>You know a lot about such things, huh, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>Come now, taking a memo during a phone call is only a natural thing for me to do as a working adult!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When I was relaxing at Lela\u2019s place for awhile\u2015</p><br/><p>we finally heard from each town.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn the end, we didn\u2019t obtain any valuable information from any of the towns.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? It can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>We have no choice but to check other places.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs there any prospect somewhere?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right~.</p><br/><p>they are places where we can\u2019t hear from using the twin magic stones\u2019 magic tool\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>the demon town, and the Nippo town\u2019s pioneer village.\u300d</p><br/><p>And, there\u2019s also the dragon-kin village,</p><br/><p>but that place is a secret.</p><br/><p>\u300cOr rather, even to those two places,</p><br/><p>shouldn\u2019t we install a twin magic stone\u2019s magic tool?</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s an opportunity, should I deliver one to them?</p><br/><p>There\u2019s probably a surplus of the magic tool, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s true, that would save us the trouble.</p><br/><p>Since I will talk to otou-sama regarding that matter, please wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>After a short time, Lela finished talking to Lyle Gewalt and came back.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince we can\u2019t directly hand the magic tool over to the demonkind\u2019s king in the demon town,</p><br/><p>it seems he wants you to hand it over to the person called Cassandra who can speak Delaidos Common Language and a former special trade envoy.</p><br/><p>Do you know her?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, she\u2019s an acquaintance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd about the pioneer village, since it\u2019s an area under the direct control of Nippo town,</p><br/><p>he wants you to deliver one set of the magic tool to the pioneer village and Nippo town so that they will be able to communicate with the Nippo town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger that.\u300d</p><br/><p>I received the twin magic stones\u2019 magic tools from Lela,</p><br/><p>and teleported to the demon town first.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>I met with Cassandra-san in demon town,</p><br/><p>and handed her the twin magic stones\u2019 magic tool.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is Cassandra.</p><br/><p>Can you hear me, Lela-sama?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, I can hear you.</p><br/><p>It seems it has arrived safely.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s something at the demon town, inform me with this magic tool.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, understood.\u300f</p><br/><p>Cassandra-san and Lela confirm that they can talk properly, so my delivery mission here is completed.</p><br/><p>And when I gave Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo album to Cassandra-san, she was very glad.</p><br/><p>I was asked if there was a photo album of Mai-san by Bunmi-san, but\u2015</p><br/><p>it seemed to be a violation of the law if I make a photo album of Mai-san so\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The people at the demon town didn\u2019t understand Yurie-san\u2019s case either.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Then, I met with Rondo, and Misha-san at Nippo town,</p><br/><p>while giving them the twin magic stones\u2019 magic tool,</p><br/><p>I also gave them Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo album.</p><br/><p>Misha-san was also pleased with Hilda\u2019s photo album,</p><br/><p>and Rondo wanted a photo album of Aya, but I completely ignored it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The third place is Rachel-san\u2019s pioneer village.</p><br/><p>When I gave her the twin magic stones\u2019 magic tool and confirmed they she can communicate with Rondo, Rachel-san was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>And after giving Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo album to Rachel-san\u2015</p><br/><p>Rachel-san was also very happy with Hilda\u2019s photo album.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, Rachel-san. Do you have any information about a woman who was manipulated by the devil-kin some time ago?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, this village doesn\u2019t have such information.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight~.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m at a loss\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cAt any rate, if you don\u2019t find any information\u2015</p><br/><p>it may be helpful to go to Toki town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Toki town, is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s a famous\u300ediviner\u300fwith accurate predictions in Toki town.\u300d</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t believe in divination that much\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>let\u2019s try to go there since there\u2019s also no clue.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

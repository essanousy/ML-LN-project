It\u2019s like a wind swept through this place.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Aya\u2019s fault.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>That was rare, Aya obediently apologized.</p><br/><p>Aya began to clean the training room up alone but Mai-san and Yurie-san helped her without saying anything.</p><br/><p>By the time they finished the clean up of the training room, the three people became really close. Aya acknowledged the strength of Mai-san, and they seemed to become a complete kohai and senpai. Visually, it doesn\u2019t look that way at all\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Yurie-san seemed to like Aya in various meaning, other than doing skinship somewhat a bit too much, she gave off a good manager-like feeling.</p><br/><p>Then, the three people get along with each other and enjoyed a new member welcome party at a ramen shop.</p><br/><p>In the end, Mai didn\u2019t ask about Aya\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When it was almost evening, Elena started her activity at last and went to the shopping district. She came to see how the obaa-chan of the Japanese sweets shop were doing.</p><br/><p>But, the attitude of the people who come and go at the shopping district is a little strange. They seemed to be more amiable to deal with than usual.</p><br/><p>Upon arriving at the Japanese sweets shop, innocent faced is working hard in making Japanese sweets.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello! How is obaa-chan doing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-san! I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t able to properly say thank you this morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>Innocent faced looked slightly different from usual, he deeply bowed to Elena courteously.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo no. So, is obaa-chan fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, her condition has already improved to the extent that she wanted to work immediately. I\u2019ve told her to sleep well today so she\u2019s sleeping at the back.\u300d</p><br/><p>This guy, isn\u2019t his atmosphere somehow changed too much?</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it fine if I go and see her?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy all means, you\u2019re welcome here!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena went to the room at the back, in there, obaa-chan was sleeping on the futon.</p><br/><p>\u300cObaa-chan, how are you feeling?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, if it isn\u2019t Elena-chan! How could I ever thank you for saving the life of this senile old woman.\u300d</p><br/><p>The obaa-chan jumped out of the futon and bowed deeply while sitting in seiza. The attitude is as if the God has visited.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease don\u2019t say that you\u2019re a senile old woman. Because I love obaa-chan\u2019s sweets very much, please rest well and recovery quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can take no matter how many Japanese sweets you want.\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, the obaa-chan is also feeling deeply grateful to Elena. Had we really gone too far? But, it\u2019s not something that can be exchanged with life\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, Elena returned home with a lot of Japanese sweets from innocent faced.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That week, there was nothing strange happened in particular.</p><br/><p>Aya spent all her time training with Mai at the karate club. I looked at her status at home and her\u3010Body techniques\u3011had become level 3.</p><br/><p>Elena remained as usual, she cast good luck charm at the shopping district and came back with lots of things. It seemed that the goods that she was getting were becoming more and more luxurious.</p><br/><p>As for director, he was asking me persistently on when will the next sample be available, I avoided it properly with\u300eMonday next week\u300f. Rather, has that 1 already been used up?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>With those, weekend came.</p><br/><p>Per usual, I confirmed the current location of Nancy who tours around the Earth and Azide-san who travels around Delaidos Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Nancy visited Thailand and India. Currently, she\u2019s about to depart from India.</p><br/><p>As for Azide-san, he\u2019s about to depart from Ikebu town to Shinju town.</p><br/><p>It seemed, I will be able to go to Shinju town next week.</p><br/><p>After solving the issue of Delaidos kingdom\u2019s war, I wonder if it\u2019s fine to travel abroad?\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s investigate the village that was destroyed by the demon lord\u2019s army.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>We teleported towards the\u3010Ikebu town\u3011.</p><br/><p>Although I didn\u2019t notice when I was here previously, there are quite a number of stern-looking soldiers wandering about. What are these guys?</p><br/><p>While thinking about the soldiers, we head towards the\u300eAdventurers\u2019 guild\u300ffirst.</p><br/><p>I inquired about the village which was destroyed by the demon lord\u2019s army. The village name is\u300eScab village1\u300f, it seems that it was located a few days to the north. Although there\u2019s a proper road, there seems to be a lot of monsters that appears frequently so there\u2019s now a few people going to that place.</p><br/><p>I also inquired about the tower of sunrise but the information that I obtained was about the same as the one I got from Azide-san.</p><br/><p>Anyway, I tried to check on the request board and there was this D rank request.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cSubjugation request\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Orc\u3011subjugation (repeatable request)</p><br/><p>\u2502Contents: Subjugate 1\u3010Orc\u3011monster.</p><br/><p>\u2502 Bring in the\u3010Orc\u2019s tusk\u3011as the subjugation proof.</p><br/><p>\u2502Reward: 100 Aurum</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>Seriously, there are more than 100\u3010Orcs\u3011inside the inventory. I think we could rank up to C rank immediately when I turn in these tusks? Well, there\u2019s no particular meaning in raising rank so not for now.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the only request for E rank is still only the\u3010Wolf\u3011subjugation as before.</p><br/><p>Next, we went to the\u300eMerchants\u2019 Guild\u300f.</p><br/><p>As usual, there\u2019s a shortage of wheat. I sold the 25kg wheat flour which I used a little bit in the church last time. Although, it\u2019s in the condition where I used a bit of it, it was still sold for 2,500 A.</p><br/><p>When I asked about the shortage of wheat, it seems that the aristocrat who governs the Ikebu town gathered all the soldiers for war. It seems there\u2019s not enough wheat to secure the food of the solders.</p><br/><p>Next, we went to the\u300eCraftsman\u2019s Guild\u300fand sold 12\u3010Stimulat potion +3\u3011. The\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011were sold for 2, 000 Aurum per vial, totaled 24, 000 Aurum. With this excessive money, we don\u2019t have to worry about luxury\u2026..</p><br/><p>Next, we looked for\u3010Purple nettle\u3011and\u3010Holy water\u3011which were the ingredients for\u3010Curse healing potion\u3011that I\u2019d like to make but we didn\u2019t find both of them. I have to get them somewhere.</p><br/><p>Because as we gather information, we went to places we could go around the town, we found a temple-like building.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, isn\u2019t that a temple?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that\u2019s the temple of\u300eOracle\u300f. That temple doesn\u2019t enshrine a mana crystal but a huge flat rock called Monolith.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, there\u2019s also a temple of mana crystal unexpectedly.\u300d2</p><br/><p>After not getting a particular valuable information, we decided to hold a strategy meeting during lunch at the dining room.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, our goal is to go to the scab village but that\u2019s where the problem lies.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUsually, we could go to that place by borrowing a carriage\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe won\u2019t be able to return till tomorrow even with a carriage, it\u2019s a little troublesome.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about running?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll become a hindrance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNot, If I run alone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you going to go by yourself, Seiji-sama!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, Aya and I will run in turns.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe too!? But, taking turns?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I can use\u3010Teleportation\u3011to drop off and pick up Aya at any place when it\u2019s time for the shift.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Well then, is Elena going to remain here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I will also run.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry but Elena can\u2019t use any speed magic like\u3010movement speed reinforcement\u3011,\u3010Tailwind\u3011or\u3010Quick\u3011\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, when Aya and I came back tired, we\u2019ll rely on you to recover.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Our determined strategy was Aya\u2019s turn will be in the afternoon while mine will be at night.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, I don\u2019t think you would get lost since you only need to follow this road all the way to the north and be careful with the monsters, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, leave it to me!\u300d</p><br/><p>We saw off Aya who departed from the north exit of the town triumphantly. </p><br/><p>There\u2019s a low possibility of encountering a dangerous monster during the day, with Aya\u2019s speed, it will be easy to escape. I will noticed it using\u3010Vigilance\u3011when it gets dangerous then I could go there and help using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>Elena and I rented a room in the inn. I decided to take a nap while Elena stayed quite inside the room.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Sekabu village, I thought Scab would fit because it was destroyed and it\u2019s like a scab? lol.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Okay, I\u2019m confused about this part, maybe a typo?.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

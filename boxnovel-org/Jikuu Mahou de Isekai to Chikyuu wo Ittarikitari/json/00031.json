Though I can actually attack using magic but I can\u2019t do anything when cowered in fear. I don\u2019t want to be protected by niichan. I want to protect Elena-chan with my own power!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if you say something like that, you\u2019re a girl after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong with me being a girl?

It\u2019s dangerous to fight against monsters!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMonsters aren\u2019t scary at all. A bad man is scarier.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s scary or not, either way is dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf niichan\u2019s not there, what am I gonna do if I\u2019m to be attacked by a bad man like today? Do I need to keep niichan to protect me all the time? What if niichan aren\u2019t able to come to rescue? Even if niichan is here to help, what if I\u2019m kidnapped? That is definitely more dangerous! Therefore! I\u2015</p><br/><p>I want to protect my loved ones with my own power!!\u300d</p><br/><p>With Aya this serious, I couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

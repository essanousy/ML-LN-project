Or an accident?\u300f</p><br/><p>The girl was puzzled, but when her eyes went back and forth between my face and the 110 number on the smartphone\u2019s screen, she seemed to have understood that I was urging her to talk.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-, Help!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat happened?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cI have been kidnapped by strange people!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eIs there anyone nearby?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s a tied-up oji-san and a suspicious ninja.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eNinja??

Do they search it using the GPS?</p><br/><p>They will be able to manage somehow or another with this.</p><br/><p>\u300cNinja-san, t-, thank you.</p><br/><p>The call was over.\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl finished the call with the 110 and bowed timidly.</p><br/><p>Alright, let\u2019s leave the rest to the police.</p><br/><p>Uh-oh, bad. The girl was still tied up.</p><br/><p>I untied the rope that binds the girl.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>I handed the smartphone to the girl and started walking towards the first floor.</p><br/><p>Although the girl was worried about the director, who was still tied up, she followed behind me.</p><br/><p>When we leave the basement, climb up the stairs and appear in the first-floor lobby, the girl is frightened seeing the scene where many combatants are tied-up.</p><br/><p>\u300cE\u2026 excuse-, excuse me.</p><br/><p>N-, Ninja-san,</p><br/><p>what on Earth is this\u2026\u2026?\u300d</p><br/><p>Since I have to pretend to not understand Japanese, I ignore the girl\u2019s remark and walk through the gap between the tied-up combatants towards the entryway of the hideout.</p><br/><p>Although the girl shivers like a newborn fawn, she somehow manages to follow.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>The girl and I went to the front entrance of this hideout.</p><br/><p>The siren, which could be heard from the distance, suddenly became quiet</p><br/><p>and in a few minutes, the sound of many cars stopping outside the hideout was heard.</p><br/><p>With the kidnapping incident, they probably turn the siren off and surround the scene of the crime.</p><br/><p>I opened the lock of the hideout and urged the girl to go outside of the hideout.</p><br/><p>\u300cN-, Ninja-san, t-, thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl goes out after bowing deeply.</p><br/><p>When the girl turned around, I disappeared with\u3010Night Shade\u3011and stealthily followed behind the girl.</p><br/><p>When the girl went outside of the hideout, she was immediately protected by the police.</p><br/><p>The girl is taken care of by a policewoman and finally shows a smile.</p><br/><p>And then, when the girl told the situation of the hideout to the police, the police stormed into the hideout.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>This time, I followed behind the police, who stormed into the hideout, while still concealed using\u3010Night Shade\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis fellow is the \u25cb\u25cbsociety\u2019s boss!\u300d</p><br/><p>The police discovered the boss, who became lumpy.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!? This fellow is the guy, who sold a stimulant to a certain big-shot baseball player?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, even so, I never would have thought that he would be arrested in a place like this.\u300d</p><br/><p>Not only kidnapping, you were also trafficking stimulants, huh!</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, he seemed to be considerably evil.</p><br/><p>The combatants are dragged by the police one after another,</p><br/><p>and some seriously injured guys are immediately carried in the ambulance.</p><br/><p>Finally, the director was also rescued from the basement and left the hideout escorted by the police with dead-tired steps.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t rescue you using my hand.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When I followed behind the rescued director and went outside\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The president have come, too.</p><br/><p>Why is the president here??</p><br/><p>And then, the president\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>and the the rescued girl embraced each other!!</p><br/><p>With such a young girl, you aren\u2019t possibly-!?</p><br/><p>\u300cOjii-chan, I was scared~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere, there, you\u2019re now safe.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, so it\u2019s grandfather and grandchild relationship, huh!</p><br/><p>According to what I learned from the contents of the police interview:</p><br/><p>1.\u300eMegumi-chan\u300f, who is the president\u2019s grandchild, was kidnapped.</p><br/><p>2. Since the president was on a business trip abroad, the president\u2019s wife talked with the director.</p><br/><p>3. The director negotiated with the criminals, but the director himself had been kidnapped in the middle of it, too.</p><br/><p>4. The president returned home in a big hurry.</p><br/><p>The course of events seems to be as such.</p><br/><p>As for this, Nancy and I are summoned by the police, too and it seems that we are going to be questioned about the situation\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Investigate the war against the demon king army.</p><br/><p>2. Visit various mana crystals and acquire more magic.</p><br/><p>3. Level up by working as adventurers.</p><br/><p>Also,</p><br/><p>4. Try to concoct medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>Something like this.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, the\u300eWar investigation\u300f, let\u2019s start the investigation with the first village destroyed by the\u3010Demon king army\u3011. Where was the village located at?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s located north of\u3010Ikebu town\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince\u300eAzide\u300f-san is still on the way to\u3010Suga town\u3011, it\u2019ll be a while before we\u2019ll be able to go to\u3010Ikebu town\u3011,</p><br/><p>until then, let\u2019s try to prioritize the others.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>We also have to consider how to travel from\u3010Ikebu town\u3011,</p><br/><p>when we arrive at the\u3010Ikebu town\u3011, what then?</p><br/><p>\u300cNext is,\u300evisit mana crystals\u300f. Since the next town is\u3010Suga town\u3011, they are\u3010Water mana crystal\u3011and\u3010Ice mana crystal\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI take a bath everyday, my\u3010Water magic\u3011will surely be high leveled, I\u2019m looking forward to it~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSpeaking of which, the theory that a person who touches water everyday tends to acquire\u3010Water magic\u3011easily, I think it\u2019s a little different than that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? How so?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, why do you think so?\u300d</p><br/><p>I decided to explain the hypothesis that I thought about to these two.</p><br/><p>\u300cMe and Aya grew up in roughly the same environment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNevertheless, why would our magic level be considerably different from each other?\u300d4</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that you mentioned it, you\u2019re right but why do you think it\u2019s related?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is my hypothesis, isn\u2019t it because of the difference in\u3010Knowledge\u3011to an\u3010Attribute\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Knowledge\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI studied about\u3010Electricity\u3011while in school, I think that\u2019s why my\u3010Lightning magic\u3011is at a higher level.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see~ Mine is still only at level 3 because I didn\u2019t study anything about electricity at all?\u300d</p><br/><p>Oy oy, says the fellow who\u2019s going to college from now on!</p><br/><p>Well, since the college where Aya will be attending is focused on liberal arts so it\u2019s inevitable to a certain extent.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd living surrounded by electrical appliances in Japan, even without studying anything about it, there will be some accumulated\u3010Knowledge\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see~ It might be so.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama! Then, if I also study, I can use more magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think it\u2019s a possibility.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I-, I want to study!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena exclaimed with her eyes shining.</p><br/><p>I hope Aya will learn from Elena\u2019s example.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a good idea, try to study science and math while studying Japanese.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy am I limited to only science and math?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWind, Lightning, Water, Ice, Earth, Darkness, Fire and Light,</p><br/><p>and more will be in science course, I think?</p><br/><p>To begin with, liberal arts doesn\u2019t seem helpful for magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven Earth and Darkness are included in science course?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Living things\u3011and plant relationships, and\u3010Geology\u3011seemed to be related to Earth.</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t understand darkness well, it might be related to\u3010Zymosis5\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, it\u2019s a hard course\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, let\u2019s study together!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, there\u2019s no choice but to study for magic~\u300d</p><br/><p>With this, Aya will be willing to study a little, he-he-he.</p><br/><p>\u300cLastly, to work as\u3010Adventurers\u3011and\u3010Pill concoction\u3011, we\u2019ll gain Levels and money, while collecting the ingredients at the same time, understood?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow are we going to do those things at the same time?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll collect ingredients outside the town,</p><br/><p>subjugate monsters on the way and turn it into money at the guild,</p><br/><p>if there\u2019s a surplus money, we can also buy ingredients in shops,</p><br/><p>if we were able to concoct pills, we can also turn it into money.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c3 birds with 1 stone? It\u2019s more like, 4 birds?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right~\u300d</p><br/><p>Everything\u2019s in order, I will go to work while Aya and Elena will study then we\u2019ll work as adventurers on weekends,</p><br/><p>we hardened our resolve and persevere on our everyday life.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Alcohol concentration\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Rechecked it several times, it really is strength recovery pill. Perhaps, it\u2019s a typo by the author\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Thanks! BANAROK\u21a9</p><br/><p>4Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but Aya and Elena still didn\u2019t know that Seiji\u2019s elemental magics get maxed out whenever he acquired them, probably they differ on how they learn original magics?\u21a9</p><br/><p>5Or Fermentation, probably darkness is related to plague/curses?\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And because I\u2019m fighting, I can\u2019t cover my nose!</p><br/><p>This is a psychological damage.</p><br/><p>The orc who smells like a rotten fish, made a back swing with his big ax, and swung it down towards me.</p><br/><p>Because the attack is in slow motion, I was able to simply receive it with my sword but because of the difference in power, it almost knocked me over.</p><br/><p>While I move side-wards, I dodged the attack and deflect it, the ax who missed its target slammed towards the ground.</p><br/><p>With the orc\u2019s body lowered, its face became defenseless, without missing the chance, I slashed it with the sword from the side.</p><br/><p>Kakin!</p><br/><p>My sword hits the orc\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>Despite of that, the sword was just able to inflict a scratch.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-hard\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>After that, the battle continued for a while.</p><br/><p>The Orc attacks, I dodged.</p><br/><p>However, my attacks doesn\u2019t do any damage to the orc either.</p><br/><p>The fight have completely fallen into a deadlock.</p><br/><p>If only I can use\u3010Lightning magic\u3011, even if only once\u2026</p><br/><p>The adventurers who was chased by the orc are watching the battle while protecting Aya and Elena.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been convenient if you guys just run away.</p><br/><p>Although they felt responsible and acted to be a little bit useful, it made me feel irritated in reverse.</p><br/><p>I gave up~</p><br/><p>Because they are watching, overwhelming attacks such as\u3010Lightning magic\u3011is unusable.</p><br/><p>While the battle continued-</p><br/><p>A ball of water flew from behind and hit the orc in the face.</p><br/><p>The hit made the orc flinched, I used that chance to slash at its defenseless belly and were able to deal a slightly deeper wound.</p><br/><p>It seems Elena used\u3010Water magic\u3011to support me from behind.</p><br/><p>Way to go Elena!</p><br/><p>Thanks to the wound I dealt to its stomach, I was able to press the battle forward.</p><br/><p>This time, a strange wind was blown on the face of the orc.</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m looking at things-</p><br/><p>Aya used\u3010Drying magic\u3011to attack?

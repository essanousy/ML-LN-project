Improve the food situation of\u300eShinju town\u300fby selling foodstuff.</p><br/><p>2. Visit the\u300eEarth temple\u300f(and the\u300eWind temple\u300ftoo, while we\u2019re at it.)</p><br/><p>3. Purchase equipment that amplifies magic. </p><br/><p>4. Check the situation of each town.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, why are we going to buy equipment that amplifies magic? For cosplay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, I\u2019m worried so I\u2019d like to have it as a countermeasure when something happens.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you worried about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe goblins and orcs are trying to incite a war between humans and demons.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are those fellows gonna do during the war?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! They\u2019re going to use the chance and attack!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s highly likely.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat does the equipment that amplifies magic have to do with it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe troublesome part about the goblins are their large numbers. Because, even the mere Prince commanded that number of troops, I think, the units that the King would lead will probably be a lot more than that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re going to catch the whole herd with one throw using magic!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI guess\u2026 but it\u2019s only for the time of emergency.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, as for checking the situation of each town\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe don\u2019t know where the goblins and orcs are aiming at. Furthermore, there will be a shortage of soldiers in all of the towns because they are taken to war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, we also need to be careful about the Slums in Shinju town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s also dangerous there\u2026\u2026 if they make a simultaneous attack, we\u2019re going to be short on hands.\u300d</p><br/><p>We put the strategy meeting on hold and decided to finish our other plans. We returned to\u300eShinju town\u300fand went to the merchants\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you have any foodstuff, we will buy it at three times the norm!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThree times!? Why do you want to buy it that high?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually\u2026\u2026 someone stole a significant amount of foodstuff which the aristocrats\u2019 army have brought. Together with all the military units, we ended up buying all the foodstuff in town\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>This is, a\u300eStarvation tactics\u300fcaused by someone?</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve brought a certain amount of flour. Is the orc\u2019s meat edible?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s very much appreciated. The orc\u2019s meat is also very popular amongst the soldiers. Where are the goods?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I brought them here with me, please tell me were to put the goods.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please put them in the warehouse at the back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I went around the warehouse at the back, a macho-man leisurely stood in front of the empty warehouse.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it? There\u2019s no food, the warehouse is empty.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve come to deliver foodstuff.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously!? Where are the goods?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m carrying it using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m no longer being chased by the King, I think it\u2019s fine for my ability to get exposed a little?</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, please keep what you\u2019re going to see here from other people as a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, of course.\u300d</p><br/><p>I took out the 25 kg\u3010Wheat flour\u3011x 10 and\u3010Orc\u3011x 100 from the inventory and put it inside the warehouse.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the hell\u2013!!\u300d</p><br/><p>In the end, the flours were sold for 7, 500A x 10 bags, totaled 75, 000A.</p><br/><p>While the orcs were sold for 6, 000A x 100, totaled 600, 000A.</p><br/><p>All in all, it was 675, 000A.</p><br/><p>When converted to Japanese yen, it was 67, 500, 000 yen.</p><br/><p>As expected, even the guild didn\u2019t have that amount of gold coins so they had to sell the foodstuff to each of the aristocrats\u2019 troops and the money will be paid at a later date. </p><br/><p>The merchant regained their liveliness by securing a huge amount of foodstuff, all the staff members became a\u300eTenya wanya1\u300fmess.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Wheat flour\u3011were greatly appreciated amongst the aristocrats who made a purchase. At any rate, it was\u300eS-Rank\u300f\u3010Wheat flour\u3011!</p><br/><p>For now, I put\u300eTracking beacon\u300fon one of the sold bags of\u3010Wheat flour\u3011. This was the first time I put a beacon on a non-human but it was functioning without problems.</p><br/><p>At that time, I noticed that the number of beacon I can use had been increased from 5 to 6. It seems, somehow or another, it had been increased during our fight with the Goblin Prince.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We went to the\u300eEarth temple\u300fnext.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe would like to visit the Mana crystal of Earth, what is the admission fee?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGeneral visits aren\u2019t permitted right now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight now, the admission of the people who would participate in the war are being prioritized. If you want to visit at all cost, how about you participate? The Adventurers\u2019 guild are recruiting volunteers.\u300d</p><br/><p>Seriously!? This is troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, Elena, what are we going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll pass. I have to return on Sunday anyway.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? You don\u2019t want to participate, Aya?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I participate, I won\u2019t be able to act freely.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s come again after finishing all the other things.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUhm, excuse me.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we were about to leave, the receptionist suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause the\u300eMana crystal of Darkness\u300fis open normally, would you like to go? It\u2019s 10A per person.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, right. Well then, we\u2019d like to try.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to the receptionist of the\u300eMana crystal of Darkness\u300fand paid 30A. The three of us entered inside. </p><br/><p>There was a black mana crystal enshrined.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s black.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I haven\u2019t learned anything about darkness, will it be alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped, since I don\u2019t know what darkness magic is. Well, let\u2019s try.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we touched the\u300eMana crystal of Darkness\u300f, it shone faintly and the light went inside my body.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Darkness magic\u3011acquired.</p><br/><p>\u3010Darkness magic\u3011is now level 3.\u300f</p><br/><p>I got level 3, was it as expected? </p><br/><p>I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on Aya and Elena but there was no\u3010Darkness magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems Aya and Elena didn\u2019t acquire\u3010Darkness magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s regrettable.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI got level 3.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat kind of magic you could use?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s see.\u300d</p><br/><p>I appraised the details of darkness magic.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cDarkness magic\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Sleep\u3011(Rarity: \u2605)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u30fbPut yourself or the target to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Shadow control\u3011(Rarity: \u2605)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u30fbEnable to control shadows.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Night vision\u3011(Rarity: \u2605\u2605)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u30fbEnable to see even in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Night shade\u3011(Rarity: \u2605\u2605)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u30fbEnable to turn invisible but only at night.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Putrefaction\u3011(Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u30fbPutrefy the target.</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>I controlled my own shadow and displayed a shadow picture.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, oniichan\u2019s shadow is moving!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re amazing, Seiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s like this but what can I use it for?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about the others?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAfter that are\u3010Sleep\u3011,\u3010Night vision\u3011,\u3010Night shade\u3011and\u3010Putrefaction\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, are you going to attack a sleeping girl?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow would I do such a thing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI mean, sneaking in using\u3010Night shade\u3011, then using\u3010Night vision\u3011to see in the dark and\u3010Sleep\u3011to put her back to sleep when she is about to wake up. Isn\u2019t it virtually used to attack a girl?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not the case, Elena!\u300d</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to clear myself from the false accusation.

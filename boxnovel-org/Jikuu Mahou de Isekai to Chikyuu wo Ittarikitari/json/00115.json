The goblin general\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>would be able to climb up the ditch?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Since the goblin general has a huge body, it was trying climb up the ditch.</p><br/><p>\u300c*flustered* Wait, time out!\u300d</p><br/><p>I frantically pushed down the general who was trying to climb up.</p><br/><p>Aya was laughing in the back.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, you idiot. We\u2019re in the midst of the battle here! Help me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>I dealt with the general who was climbing and entrusted the expansion of the ditch to Aya at top speed.</p><br/><p>When the ditch expanded to 10 m in width and depth, the General could no longer climb up.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuu, we were able to do it somehow, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, the generals who didn\u2019t fall into the ditch, snuck around to the left and right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*Flustered* Wait, time out! time out!\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s impossible to increase the length of the ditch any further.</p><br/><p>There are a total of 25 generals who didn\u2019t fall into the ditch.</p><br/><p>10 of them are trying to go around to the right and 15 to the left.</p><br/><p>\u300cI leave the 10 monsters in the right to you, Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger!\u300d</p><br/><p>I blocked the 15 monsters, who went around to the left, with the magic rod in hand.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the 15 Generals are going to force their way through without intending to fight me.</p><br/><p>I sent the generals flying with the magic rod,</p><br/><p>they fell into the ditch one after another.</p><br/><p>When I tidied up the 15 monsters and was going to somehow support Aya\u2015</p><br/><p>She defeated 1 General and was battling with the 4 of them.</p><br/><p>Hm? 5 of them escaped?</p><br/><p>Anyway, I sent the 4, whom she was battling, flying into the ditch.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, oniichan. I\u2019ve let 5 of them get away.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I checked the map, the 5 monsters who escaped were moving towards the central plains.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, the guys over there would be able to cope if it\u2019s about 5 of them.\u300d</p><br/><p>After a while, I watched the 44 generals who fell into the ditch\u2015</p><br/><p>Some were trying to climb up riding the shoulders of others,</p><br/><p>some were trying to throw weapons,</p><br/><p>some were trying to hit the ditch\u2019s wall one way or another.</p><br/><p>I decided to dump water and ice from the surface in order to prevent them from getting away.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> After a while,</p><br/><p>the demon-adventurers mixed troop got out of the forest and arrived at the central plains.</p><br/><p>But, at the same time, the 5 goblin generals, who managed to escape from us, caught up to them,</p><br/><p>Directly at the entrance of the forest, it seems a battle has started.</p><br/><p>When I looked at the map, because the response from the goblin generals didn\u2019t vanish no matter what, they were probably having a hard fight.</p><br/><p>The joint military unit gradually retreated while fighting.</p><br/><p>However, after a while, reinforcements came from the main forces of the aristocracy union army and demon army, respectively.</p><br/><p>Since Elena is also mixed in in the reinforcements, it\u2019s probably Rondo\u2019s troops.</p><br/><p>Alright, it seems they will somehow manage with this.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, let\u2019s set a number of generals free again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, set them free little by little.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>Of the generals who were wandering about inside the ditch, I aimed at the group that has about 10 monsters huddled together\u2015</p><br/><p>I created stone walls toward their left and right, confining them.</p><br/><p>This time, I created a stairway on the temporary prison leading outside.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, come out.~\u300d</p><br/><p>While being wary of us, the 10 generals climbed up the stairway,</p><br/><p>and went toward the central plains.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it fine to set 10 of them free?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s completely fine since reinforcements appeared from Rondo\u2019s troops and the demon army. </p><br/><p>Elena is also included in the reinforcements as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen it\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I checked Elena\u2019s situation through\u3010Tracking\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>There were injured people appeared among the adventurers and demonkind,</p><br/><p>Elena went around, healing the injured people of both troops without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The reinforcement unit of Rondo and the demon army saw Elena\u2019s behavior\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, they\u2019re allies\u300fand seemed to instantly come to an understanding,</p><br/><p>both sides cooperated properly, forming a hope in the fight against the goblin generals.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the reinforcements of both militaries, the 5 generals were soon defeated.</p><br/><p>A relieved expression spread over both sides.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s more coming!!\u300d</p><br/><p>With someone\u2019s scream, everyone in the place turned their gazes toward the forest.</p><br/><p>Then, 10 goblin generals jumped out of the forest.</p><br/><p>They were caught off guard by the relief caused by defeating the 5 generals and weren\u2019t prepared to intercept,</p><br/><p>Did I release them a bit early!?</p><br/><p>While the nervousness ran through everyone!</p><br/><p>Countless spheres of ice poured down toward the 10 generals!</p><br/><p>It was Elena\u2019s\u3010Hailstorm\u3011.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t enough to bring the generals down,</p><br/><p>surprised at the damage of the\u3010Hailstorm\u3011magic, the generals\u2019 advance momentarily stopped.</p><br/><p>During which, the humans and demonkind were able to make preparations together.</p><br/><p>The 10 generals, who were weakened by the\u3010Hailstorm\u3011, were soon defeated before the human-demon allied forces.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cHoorayyyy!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300eHoorayyyy!\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, shall we try to release 15 next?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, you such an S\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Rondo, having received the information of another approximately 35 generals,</p><br/><p>requested more reinforcements from the aristocracy union HQ.</p><br/><p>Those of the demon army also seemed to call for reinforcement in the same way as well.</p><br/><p>When another 15 generals I released appeared in the central plains,</p><br/><p>they were routed by the overwhelming number of soldiers.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I, looking for the suitable time, released the remaining 19 monsters.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, all the generals have been released\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What would we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are the guest\u2019s\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbopponent.\u300d</p><br/><p>As I said so, in front of me who took a fighting stance\u2015</p><br/><p>the figure of the Goblin Prince has appeared.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Just in case someone didn\u2019t recognize that certain alchemist, it\u2019s referencing the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward

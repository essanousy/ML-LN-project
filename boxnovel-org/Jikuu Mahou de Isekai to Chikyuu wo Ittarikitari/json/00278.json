Did you bring a liquor again?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs liquor your favourite phrase\u2026\u2026.?</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ve brought one, though!\u300d</p><br/><p>I held out a 96% alcohol strength vodka that I brought.</p><br/><p>\u300cOu, thank you as always.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince this liquor is a strong one, please be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t say such a stupid thing!</p><br/><p>Liquor is something like a water for dwarves,</p><br/><p>don\u2019t lump me together with the humans.\u300d</p><br/><p>Is it really going to be alright\u2026\u2026?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine since the person himself said that it\u2019s alright.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, I\u2019ve come today because there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to consult you with for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cConsultation? What is it? Weapon? Armor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, It\u2019s a consultation about metal.\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked about a metal which can be used for accessories.</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, if it\u2019s that, then mithril might be good?</p><br/><p>Its strength is higher than silver and its affinity with magic power is good, too~.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s only going to be used as an accessory in Earth, so magic power won\u2019t be used, though~.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, may I have some mithril?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I\u2019ve always get amazing liquor from you, I\u2019d like to give you, but\u2026\u2026I wonder if there\u2019s some of it left.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san went inside to get mithril and returned immediately.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, there\u2019s only this.\u300d</p><br/><p>The one Gamudo-san brought was a scrap of mithril around the size of a 100 Yen coin.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere can I go to get mithril?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause of the war with the devil-kin, most of the materials have been taken and changed into weapons and armors.~</p><br/><p>You mightn\u2019t find it anywhere else unless you go to the Shinaga\u2019s mines.\u300d</p><br/><p>Shinaga, huh. It\u2019s where the Fire and Light Mana Crystal is located and Hilda\u2019s hometown, but I\u2019ve passed by it last time.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, I\u2019ll go there now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry that I am unable to help even though I got the liquor.</p><br/><p>Ah, that\u2019s right! I have to try this liquor.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san said so and downed the vodka with *kui*\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>*Batan!*</p><br/><p>and fell backward just like that.</p><br/><p>\u300cWai-! Gamudo-san!!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it like water for dwarves!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I carried Gamudo-san to bed and nursed him.</p><br/><p>\u300cShit!</p><br/><p>For me, a dwarf, to fall because of a liquor!!

It would be the Musasabi Slime's\u3010Wind magic\u3011.</p><br/><p> I dodged the wind gust with a jump and continued to launch a jump attack towards the Musasabi Slime.</p><br/><p> The Musasabi Slime jumped backward and dodged my attack.</p><br/><p> I jumped towards the same direction too and chased after it.</p><br/><p> The Musasabi Slime opened its gliders to stop in the air and dodged me who was chasing by gliding. A Musasabi indeed.</p><br/><p> My jump's momentum was too strong, taking me to the ceiling. I turned myself upside down and landed...on the ceiling.</p><br/><p> And then, I jumped down from the ceiling and charged at the gliding Musasabi Slime\u2015</p><br/><p>*Slash!*</p><br/><p> the Musasabi Slime was cut into two with a single stroke.</p><br/><p> When the Musasabi Slime split into two, I continued to fall as is.</p><br/><p> At that moment, when I sensed\u3010danger\u3011diagonally from below and looked\u2015</p><br/><p> the Flame Slime spat a flame towards me.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan the flame reach as far as this position?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I promptly hid behind the Musasabi Slime, the flame swallowed me together with the Musasabi Slime.</p><br/><p>\u300cHot!\u300d</p><br/><p> Since I hid behind the Musasabi Slime, I somehow managed to survive without problems but my hair got burnt a little.</p><br/><p> I landed safely and glared at the Flame Slime.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? Darkness Slime?\u300d</p><br/><p> At that moment, I sensed\u3010danger\u3011from behind\u2015</p><br/><p> as I was turning around, I counterattacked the Darkness Slime which made a surprise attack from behind.</p><br/><p> However, the immediate attack didn't go smoothly and blown the Darkness Slime away without cutting it.</p><br/><p> I ran after the Darkness Slime which got blown away to the depths of the room with a dash.</p><br/><p> I finally caught up with the Darkness Slime and when I was going to deliver the finishing blow, I sensed\u3010danger\u3011from behind. I canceled the attack and jumped to the side.</p><br/><p> A flame swoop down the place where I had been before from behind, setting the Darkness Slime ablaze.</p><br/><p> Or rather, the Flame Slime's attack just now was nothing but a friendly fire!</p><br/><p> I rolled over and finished off the Darkness Slime which was covered with fire. Finally, it became 1-on-1 with the Flame Slime.</p><br/><p> I have various experience when it comes to 1-on-1.</p><br/><p> I've defeated the Flame Slime easily,</p><br/><p> and the underground's first floor's boss has been cleared!</p><br/><p> The loots were</p><br/><p> \u3010Musasabi Slime's nucleus\u3011,</p><br/><p> \u3010magic stone of gentle wind\u3011,</p><br/><p> \u3010Darkness Slime's nucleus\u3011,</p><br/><p> \u3010Darkness reinforcement magic stone +1\u3011,</p><br/><p> \u3010Flame Slime's nucleus\u3011,</p><br/><p> and\u3010Magic stone of oil\u3011.</p><br/><p> What's a\u3010magic stone of oil\u3011!?</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Magic stone of oil\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A magic stone which oozes out flammable oil.</p><br/><p>\u2502The amount increases when magic power is poured in.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> Isn't this amazing!?</p><br/><p>[1] Japanese flying squirrel</p><br/>\n</div>"}

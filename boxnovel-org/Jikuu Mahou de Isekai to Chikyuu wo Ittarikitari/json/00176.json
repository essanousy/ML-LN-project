Demonkind's town's ojii-san</p><br/><p> We were exploring the demonkind's town.</p><br/><p> While we are restlessly looking around the town curiously,</p><br/><p> the demonkind is also staring at us,</p><br/><p> it seems humans are rare in here.</p><br/><p> People come and go, children play, the shops are filled with goods.</p><br/><p> The townscape and the people look ominous but the scenery of the town is pretty decent.</p><br/><p> There were many southern-country-like goods.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's try to eat that~.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya was pointing at a bright red soup that contained various ingredients.</p><br/><p> It seems to be spicy.</p><br/><p>\u300cI abstain.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena and Hilda also shook their heads in disapproval.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, it's just me, huh. Buy it, oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p> As usual, the rude imouto of ani manipulation.</p><br/><p> Aurum is the currency of the human country but since it can't be used in this town, I asked Bunmi-san and had him exchange the money.</p><br/><p> The currency of this country seems to be called\u300eSilva\u300f, at 1 Aurum = 10 Silva, I have about 10, 000 Silva in hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, how much is one serving?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's 12 Silva.\u300d</p><br/><p> By paying 12 Silva, I have received a bright red soup served in a nutshell the size of a squash from the obaa-chan(?) of the stall.</p><br/><p> The soup comes with two wooden sticks, they will probably be used as chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, Aya. I bought it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya has begun to eat the bright red soup in front of the stall.</p><br/><p>\u300cSpicyy!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don't say.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, it's delicious!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's delicious!?\u300d</p><br/><p> When Aya is eating the bright red soup\u2015</p><br/><p> The obaa-chan(?) of the stall talked.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can use chopsticks in spite of being a human, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cObaa-chan, are you knowledgeable with the humans?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop calling me obaa-chan, even if I look like this, I'm still 100 years old.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c100 years old!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya was surprised.</p><br/><p> Well, it was expected, the average life span will surely be different.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that's right. The humans can only live until around 50 years old, huh. How sad.\u300d</p><br/><p> Is the life span of the humans in this world 50 years?</p><br/><p> But there's a recovery magic in this world, I wonder if the Earth's medicines can save the people's lives.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow long does the demonkind lives?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cInvestigating, huh~. It's around 200 years or so.\u300d</p><br/><p> About 4 times or so, huh.</p><br/><p> That means a 100-year-old demonkind is equal to a 25-year-old human?</p><br/><p> Mai-san is too young after all, it seems to be the influence of being descended from the demonkind.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We parted with the obaa-san... onee-san of the stall\u2015</p><br/><p> and came over to a certain shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cMay I come in?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHou, it's rare for humans to enter this town.</p><br/><p> That reminds me, someone had said that a human merchant came here.\u300d</p><br/><p> The one in the shop is an ojii-san dwarf.</p><br/><p> \u300eGamudo\u300f-san of Nippo town is also an ojii-san with a bearded face but\u2015</p><br/><p> this person seems to be older many times over.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have a letter of introduction from the Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? Demon Lord's letter of introduction!?\u300d</p><br/><p> I handed the letter of introduction which I got after the audience to the ojii-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cMake a katana for the human!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Yes, I intimida-... asked the Demon Lord and had him introduced the blacksmith who made the Demon Lord's katana.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere's also a letter of introduction, can you please make me one?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c......\u300d</p><br/><p> The ojii-san went into the depths of the store in silence.</p><br/><p> As I thought so, he suddenly reappears and beckons.</p><br/><p> When I follow the ojii-san with everyone\u2015</p><br/><p> we appeared in the backyard.</p><br/><p> What a sense of deja vu......</p><br/><p>\u300cTry to hold this.\u300d</p><br/><p> The ojii-san drew a somewhat larger sword which he held in his hands out of its sheath and handed it to me.</p><br/><p> When I received it, it was so heavy.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026You have this much power, like a certain someone.\u300d</p><br/><p> You're testing me after all, huh.</p><br/><p> Ohhh, let's do it!</p><br/><p> This time, he brought a straw post.</p><br/><p>\u300cTry to slash this with the sword.</p><br/><p> I said slice it off not knock it down, okay?</p><br/><p> Generally, when it comes to human sword\u2015</p><br/><p> if you ask me, it's only an ordinary sharp iron stick!\u300d</p><br/><p> He mumbles some complaint......</p><br/><p> it seems he doesn't like human swords very much.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome on, try it if you can.\u300d</p><br/><p> Ok, ok, I'll do it.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, can you also lend me the sheath?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? The sheath? Well, alright but......\u300d</p><br/><p> When I received the sheath, I put the sword into the sheath.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you intending to do?\u300d</p><br/><p> I held the sheathed sword in my left hand and approached the straw post.</p><br/><p> I stooped down and placed my right hand on the sword's handle\u2015</p><br/><p> concentrating on the straw post.</p><br/><p> Body reinforcement, strengthening myself with Space-time magic.</p><br/><p> Firmly rooting my feet with Earth magic.</p><br/><p> Tearing up the wind with Wind magic.</p><br/><p>*Sa!*</p><br/><p> Instantly, a soft breeze dances around me.</p><br/><p> I turned back, approached the ojii-san and returned the sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, why are you giving up?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? That's not the case though.\u300d</p><br/><p> When Elena is making a strange expression\u2015</p><br/><p> Aya approached the straw post and poked it with *tsun tsun*.</p><br/><p> Then, the straw post slid off diagonally with *zu zu* and its upper half fell down with *koron*.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has already been sliced off!</p><br/><p> I didn't see it at all.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda and ojii-san's eyes turned into dots.</p><br/><p> Ojii-san had his eyes turned into dots for a while but\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwahahahaha! This is pleasant!\u300d</p><br/><p> he suddenly began to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince that youngster handed a letter of introduction, I was wondering what kind of a guy you are.</p><br/><p> An inconceivable human!\u300d</p><br/><p> Apparently, he seemed to be happy with my performance.</p><br/><p> However, this ojii-san who called the Demon Lord a youngster, who on earth could he be?</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough I was told to make a sword equal to the sword of the Demon Lord, such a\u300etoy sword\u300fis unworthy of you.</p><br/><p> I'll make you a sword that is equal to the one I had made for the previous Demon Lord.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is a\u300etoy sword\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCalling himself as the Demon Lord, he's at best a brat compared to the previous Demon Lord. A\u300etoy sword\u300fis enough for such a guy.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems that this ojii-san is like an official of the\u300eprevious Demon Lord\u300f.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yesterday, I saw the figure of Princess Elena healing the townspeople's injuries and was convinced.</p><br/><p> My recovery magic is nowhere near Princess Elena's level.</p><br/><p> I couldn't help but be ashamed that I hold this staff.</p><br/><p> To offer the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011to Princess Elena is the consensus of all the healers who are here.</p><br/><p> So please accept it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, I'm travelling.</p><br/><p> If I accept this staff, the staff will be separated from this town.</p><br/><p> Is it still fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, we are well aware of it.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems they're quite strong-willed.</p><br/><p> Butte-sama stares straight at Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, I will take care of it.\u300d</p><br/><p> When Elena said so, Butte-sama bloomed with a smile.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> The location was the dome-shaped room where the mana crystal was enshrined inside the temple of recovery.</p><br/><p> While the sisters stood in line and watched,</p><br/><p> from Butte-sama to Elena, the transfer ceremony of the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011was held.</p><br/><p> Elena changes clothes into a ceremonial dress and is totally like an angel.</p><br/><p> A solemn ceremony-like something was performed,</p><br/><p> and the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011was slowly handed over to Elena.</p><br/><p> And then, the staff which Elena received floated a little\u2015</p><br/><p> at that moment-!</p><br/><p> the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011began to slowly shine.</p><br/><p> N? Does Elena used some kind of magic?</p><br/><p> That's not it. Elena is also surprised at the light.</p><br/><p> After a while, the light has disappeared,</p><br/><p> and Elena is in a peculiar state for some reason.</p><br/><p> She is following the nothingness in the air with her eyes,</p><br/><p> and when I looked closely, Butte-sama and the sisters are also following something with their eyes in the same way.</p><br/><p> What is it? Is something in there?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's probably that light.\u300d</p><br/><p> Mai-san who is watching at the side sees something too.</p><br/><p> Aya and Hilda can't see it.</p><br/><p> Aya, Elena and I can't see it,</p><br/><p> Elena, Butte-sama, the sisters and Mai-san can see it......</p><br/><p> Is it something magic-ish?</p><br/><p>Pikon!</p><br/><p> I see!</p><br/><p> It's the Recovery magic spirit!</p><br/><p> Elena has a conversation with something invisible somehow or other for a while.</p><br/><p> Butte-sama seems to hear it too.</p><br/><p> It seems to be the spirit as expected.</p><br/><p> Dangerous, isn't that mean that she is going to fight against the spirit for the contract?</p><br/><p> After a while, Elena was trying to accept something with open arms.</p><br/><p> And then, when I'm thinking what she was trying to do, she made a gesture like tightly hugging something!</p><br/><p> Elena's body began to shine.</p><br/><p> Huh?</p><br/><p> Is the contract with the spirit by any chance completed?</p><br/><p> No fighting??</p><br/><p> Perhaps, there's no fighting particularly because it's the Recovery magic spirit?</p><br/><p> Although she was in the middle of the ceremony, I rushed toward Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, did you by any chance make a contract with the Recovery magic spirit?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, Seiji-sama.</p><br/><p> I've become friends with Spirit-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p> It was good, she didn't have to fight.</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess Elena......</p><br/><p> as expected, you......</p><br/><p> have mastered the recovery magic, huh......\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama trembles with *wana wana*,</p><br/><p> she immediately knelt and began to pay respect to Elena.</p><br/><p> Well, I perfectly understand the feeling of wanting to worship Elena who looks like an angel!</p><br/><p>\u300cButte-sama, may I use one magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, by all means!\u300d</p><br/><p> You don't know what magic Elena is going to use,</p><br/><p> but have you begun to worship Elena, Butte-sama?</p><br/><p> Elena raises the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011and begun to pour magic power.</p><br/><p> The staff has begun to shine,</p><br/><p> then a pink, gentle light spreads out into a spherical shape.</p><br/><p> The light swallows us and fills the entire room, and spreads out further to the outside.</p><br/><p> I felt power gushing forth from my body the next moment.</p><br/><p> What on earth is this!?</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on myself\u2015</p><br/><p> it had become\u300eCondition: Divine protection of the Recovery Spirit\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what in the world is this......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI asked Spirit-sama and had her wrapped the entire town with her divine protection.</p><br/><p> When inside this town, strength, magic power, wounds, and etc. will gradually recover.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena, how long does the effect lasts?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to last for about a week.\u300d</p><br/><p> A-, Amazhing......</p><br/><p> I seem to have wet myself......</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, may I use\u3010Appraisal\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on Elena\u2015</p><br/><p> Eh? Is it a mistake?</p><br/><p> Let's check it again......</p><br/><p> Strange......</p><br/><p> No matter how many times I try......</p><br/><p> The level of Elena's recovery magic is...</p><br/><p> \u300e7\u300f......</p><br/><p> I-, It becomes......</p><br/><p> \u300e7\u300f, whaaaaaaaat!!!!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The few wil-o\u2019-the-wisps that survived were repelled using Aya and Hilda\u2019s fire-engine\u2019s hosing-down-like water attack.</p><br/><p>I, too, sliced several of them that attacked from right behind us into two with the White Belt Sword and we gained a complete shutout victory.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, they were weaker than some in the lower floors.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, all of us can use Water Magic</p><br/><p>and due to us joining together, it will be such a thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>Other than such a thing,</p><br/><p>the White Belt Sword\u2019s\u300eFire attributed monster subjugation\u300ftrial had been cleared with 10/10 during the fight just now. The remaining trials were Wind and Earth with 5 each.</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s do the trials slowly.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, we were able to find the stairs towards the seventeenth floor without difficulty.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When we went to the seventeenth floor, the sea of clouds spread out again.</p><br/><p>However, the area is dark this time.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere seems to be similar to the moment when the sun sets.</p><br/><p>When I checked the current time using my smartphone, it\u2019s still morning.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably this floor\u2019s special phenomenon.</p><br/><p>When we advance through the dark\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Thunderhead!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Thunderhead that appeared three floors below\u2013in the fourteenth floor\u2013appeared again.</p><br/><p>However, its appearance seems to be different from the fourteenth floor\u2019s Thunderhead.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis Thunderhead is black, isn\u2019t it?\u300d</p><br/><p>At first, I thought that the area is dark, but it\u2019s different after all.</p><br/><p>The fourteenth floor\u2019s Thunderhead was white,</p><br/><p>the Thunderhead here was black like a rain cloud.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it seems to be called\u300eDark Thunderhead\u300f.</p><br/><p>What a simple name.</p><br/><p>When we wait and see,</p><br/><p>the Thunderheads slowly began to gather around us.</p><br/><p>And then, we had been encircled by the Dark Thunderhead.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, it\u2019s dark.\u300d</p><br/><p>The Dark Thunderheads that surrounded us blocked the light, making the area even darker.</p><br/><p>And then, finally, it became pitch dark.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will light a fire.\u300d</p><br/><p>Thanks to Hilda lighting a fire using magic, we\u2019re somehow able to see,</p><br/><p>but because of the Dark Thunderhead, we can\u2019t see anything at all from about 20 m ahead.</p><br/><p>Then, a Predicted Attack Area aimed at Hilda suddenly appeared,</p><br/><p>I promptly wedge myself in between and erected a barrier.</p><br/><p>*Gakin.*</p><br/><p>Something like black tentacles stretched out from the Dark Thunderheads crowding around the vicinity.</p><br/><p>Black tentacles\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Uhg, it\u2019s an unpleasant trauma\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>We\u2019ll get nowhere as it is.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda. Since I will take charge of the light, take charge of the offensive.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>I lit up the area with Incandescent Light Bulb Magic</p><br/><p>while Hilda began attacking the surrounding Dark Thunderhead.</p><br/><p>Like the Thunderhead, fire seemed to be the weakness of the Dark Thunderhead; a hole opened in the encirclement.</p><br/><p>After that, while Elena and I were defending, Hilda was attacking at the same time</p><br/><p>and we somehow managed to annihilate the Dark Thunderheads.</p><br/><p>N? What was Aya doing, you ask?</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t able to use\u3010Downburst\u3011with the Dark Thunderheads blocking above,</p><br/><p>so she was going to do something with a normal Wind Gust, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if it\u2019s possible to push the Dark Thunderheads away with Wind, it can\u2019t inflict damage, so they are immediately restored back to before.</p><br/><p>So Aya gave up attacking and just helped lighting up the area using Light Magic.</p><br/><p>She\u2019s frustrated because she can\u2019t play an active role, but there\u2019s such a thing sometimes, too.</p><br/><p>We defeated all the Dark Thunderheads, but they didn\u2019t drop any magic stones.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When we climbed up to the eighteenth floor, there was a snow country.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps I should say, it was a snowy mountain.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s snow this time, huh~. It\u2019s cold~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Why can Aya only say an impression at the same level as a primary school kid all the time?</p><br/><p>Aya and the others took out ski wear from the\u3010Magic Stone of Storage\u3011for their own use and began to change clothes.</p><br/><p>Although I say changing clothes, is it particularly alright since they only wore it over the clothes they were wearing just now?</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda\u2019s ski wears are only hand-me-down clothes that Aya used to wear in the olden days.</p><br/><p>We controlled the snow under our feet with\u3010Ice Magic\u3011so that our feet wouldn\u2019t sink into the snow, making our advance faster.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-chan, there\u2019s something!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed, it seems to be a monster that has hidden itself,</p><br/><p>be careful everyone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>And then, what came out from within the lumpy snow\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>was a small snowman.</p><br/><p>And then, the snowman lightly floats into the air.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it seems to be a monster called\u300eSnow Child\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that!? It\u2019s cute~.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Aya tried to approach it carelessly\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>the Snow Child began to attack!</p><br/><p>Well, although I say attack, it only throws a snowball, though.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t painful even if it hit</p><br/><p>and since we are wearing ski wear, we neither get wet nor feel cold.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, it\u2019s no skin off our noses.</p><br/><p>It became pitiful to kill the Snow Child who does only something like that,</p><br/><p>we decided to hurry ahead while dodging the snowballs that it threw.</p><br/><p>When we were advancing for a while, the Snow Child who was throwing snowball at us began to gradually increase.</p><br/><p>Umu, what to do.</p><br/><p>And then, when we advanced further, we had been surrounded by Snow Children.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s unfavorable as expected, huh?</p><br/><p>More than 100 Snow Children surrounds us.</p><br/><p>And then, the Snow Children began dancing a dance of some kind around us.</p><br/><p>Then, the weather of the silent snowy mountain suddenly changed and became a blizzard.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe should\u2019ve killed them as expected, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYeah.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and Elena became Hilda\u2019s protection from the wind.</p><br/><p>Hilda attacked the Snow Children with flame.</p><br/><p>The Snow Child was just slightly hit by the flame and simply melted.</p><br/><p>Hilda defeated all the Snow Children completely</p><br/><p>and at the same time, the blizzard calmed down, too.</p><br/><p>\u300cAll of them melted, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda looks a little sad.</p><br/><p>Well, there\u2019s no helping it since the opponent is a monster.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya notices something and utters a cry.</p><br/><p>When we turn towards there, too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>From the remains of the Snow Child who melted a short while ago, a new Snow Child was born again.</p><br/><p>And then, they throw snowballs again incorrigibly.</p><br/><p>\u300cThey\u2019re persistent fellows, huh~.\u300d</p><br/><p>We began to look for the next floor\u2019s stairs while dodging the snowballs again.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]Yukinko\u3093.</p><br/><p>P.S Please support the author by buying his work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

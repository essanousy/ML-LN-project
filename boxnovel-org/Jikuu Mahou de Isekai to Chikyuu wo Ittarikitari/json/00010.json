Seiji-sama, the coin pouch!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena began to chase after the person bumped into me just now, but as she picked up speed\u2026 she slipped and fell down.</p><br/><p> Promptly using \u3010Quick\u3011 magic, I was able to catch Elena before she hit the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Seiji-sama! Thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p> Being embraced like this, Elena\u2019s face turned bright red. S-so cwute~</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, the criminal got away because of me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s okay. I stored all gold and silver coins in Inventory. I only left 10 Aurums in the pouch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo that\u2019s how it is. You already did that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, 99 gold coins is pretty heavy. Moreover, I already cast \u3010Tracking\u3011 on that pouch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, Seiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p> And so we began to track the thief.</p><br/><p> Using a function of \u3010Tracking\u3011 to see the criminal\u2026 hiding in a back alley, they were checking the contents of the pouch.</p><br/><p> Find 10 Aurums inside the bag, the criminal wagged their tails in delight.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis way!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena, is it that fun? She had a big grin on her face.</p><br/><p> I monitored what the thief was doing again\u2026 and they seemed to be buying bread from the bakery.</p><br/><p>\u300cApparently the thief seems to have bought 5 loaves of bread.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFive loaves? Were they really hungry??\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmm, they seem to be carrying the bread somewhere without eating.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt really is a mystery.\u300d</p><br/><p> We continued to chase the criminal.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this the criminal\u2019s hideout?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, he ran in here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, isn\u2019t this a church?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLooks like it. Let\u2019s enter.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> We set foot into the church the thief went into.</p><br/><p> The inside of the church was completely devoid of people.</p><br/><p>\u300cI can hear someone\u2019s voice over there.\u300d</p><br/><p> We moved to the inner room Elena pointed at.</p><br/><p> Inside the inner room, we encountered the criminal.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re the person from before!\u300d</p><br/><p> The criminal pounced at me.</p><br/><p> I caught both of the criminal\u2019s hands and lifted her off the ground. Unable to move with her feet, she stopped struggling.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me go!\u300d</p><br/><p> The criminal I caught became completely like a cat\u2026</p><br/><p> Well, they are actually a cat.</p><br/><p> The criminal was a girl that looked about 10 years old with cat ears and a cat tail.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, please come here.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena called me from an even further inner room.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t go there!\u300d</p><br/><p> I moved to the inner room ignoring the criminal girl\u2019s frantic warning\u2026</p><br/><p> A woman about 24 or 25 dressed as a sister was painfully sleeping in the crude bed. She was probably in bed due to illness. The criminal girl seemed to have wanted the sick sister to eat the bread.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis person\u2019s illness, is it serious?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt is considerably painful. I will try to cure it with magic.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena put a hand on the Sister\u2019s forehead and began chanting magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cMa-magic!\u300d</p><br/><p> The criminal girl I caught by both hands was surprised by Elena\u2019s magic while hanging.</p><br/><p> Elena\u2019s magic was invoked and the sister\u2019s body was bathed in light. Her pain seemed to have considerably lessened and she was able to calmly sleep.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs-is she healed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGiven time. I have cast heal on her a couple of times, she should get better.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-thank you!\u300d</p><br/><p> The criminal girl thanked Elena.</p><br/><p> Then 3 children came out from somewhere. Perhaps they were hiding somewhere.</p><br/><p> The 3 of them looked around 5~8 years old and were a bit skinny.</p><br/><p>\u300cSister, she won\u2019t die?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will be all right since the magic should ease the illness.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnee-chan, thank you!\u300d</p><br/><p> The children thanked us unanimously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

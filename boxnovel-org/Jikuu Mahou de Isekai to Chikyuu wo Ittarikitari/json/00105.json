Raising her rapier, she shouted!</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, retreat!\u300d</p><br/><p>The adventurers and soldiers, who were waiting, began to retreat without looking back.</p><br/><p>Well, it can\u2019t be helped. They did their best up to this point, we\u2019re going to take care of the rest\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Lela, who ordered the retreat, stayed in place despite her legs trembling.</p><br/><p>Contrary to expectations, she was too frightened to run away.</p><br/><p>Lela turned towards the Prince. She readied her shield and rapier once again.</p><br/><p>Although her legs were trembling, she did well.</p><br/><p>Elena and I held our weapons and joined Lela.</p><br/><p>I put\u3010Slow\u3011on the Prince and\u3010Quick\u3011on the 3 of us.</p><br/><p>The Prince swung down its ax towards Lela.</p><br/><p>I set up a\u3010Barrier\u3011when the ax was about to hit Lela\u2019s shield, suppressing its power. From Lela\u2019s whole body, *creak creak* unpleasant sounds can be heard.</p><br/><p>Lela grimaced in pain.</p><br/><p>Elena quickly recovered Lela\u2019s wounds and strength using\u3010Recovery magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>Some of the soldiers heard the sound of collision of the Prince\u2019s ax and Lela\u2019s shied, they looked back to see what happened.</p><br/><p>Then, the soldiers seeing the others stopped, one after another stood in place.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times the ax lunged forwards, Lela blocked it with the shield. And, Elena healed the damage quickly.</p><br/><p>During that interval, I snuck around behind the Prince and hacked its back.</p><br/><p>The Prince\u2019s body obstructed the view of my position from soldiers and adventurers.</p><br/><p>Due to the Prince being attacked in the back, its attacks became weak.</p><br/><p>Lela was able to gradually receive its attacks even without\u3010Barrier\u3011.</p><br/><p>The Prince, who was attacked from the back, got furious and finally became enraged. It turned around and attacked with all its might.</p><br/><p>However, I wasn\u2019t there anymore. It\u2019s movements were too slow.</p><br/><p>Due to the Prince turning around, its back was exposed to Lela and became defenseless.</p><br/><p>Making the opportunity count, Lela attacked continuously, piercing the Prince\u2019s back many times.</p><br/><p>The Prince couldn\u2019t withstand Lela\u2019s accumulated attacks and collapsed.</p><br/><p>The Prince fell, like a collapsing building, it produced a tremendous sound.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cUooooo!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Cheers broke out from behind and I looked behind to see what it was.</p><br/><p>The soldiers, who stood still in a remote position approximately 50 steps away, cheered towards Lela.</p><br/><p>The adventurers looked this way at a further distance approximately 100 steps away.</p><br/><p>Lela gasped for breath.</p><br/><p>And, pleasantly smiled towards me.</p><br/><p>I still faced towards the Prince, holding my weapon. Lela glanced towards the Prince as well.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwoooooo!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The fallen Prince stood up and raised a battle cry. It madly glared towards Lela with anger in its eyes.</p><br/><p>Lela undauntedly glared back at the Prince.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cGuoo!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>When the Prince raised a battle cry once again, it poured power into the axe it held and the axe began to emit a strange light.</p><br/><p>Does it plan to use some technique!?</p><br/><p>The\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic informed me of\u300eDanger\u300f. This is bad.</p><br/><p>I dashed towards the Prince, so that it would chase after me instead of Lela.</p><br/><p>However, as if the Prince was carefully aiming at Lela, it approached her and swung down its ax which shone in strange light.</p><br/><p>I threw\u3010Lightning fist\u3011at once, trying to stop the Prince\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Based on the ax\u2019s inertia, as it is, it will hit Lela.</p><br/><p>I set up a\u3010Barrier\u3011but even so, it was also penetrated\u2015</p><br/><p>It slammed into the mithril shield Lela poised and an earth-shattering sonic boom resounded throughout the area. </p><br/><p>Lela fell on her knees but she completely blocked the Prince\u2019s ax with nothing but her shield.</p><br/><p>If you look closely, Lela\u2019s shield was also wrapped in some kind of light. I wonder if she used some kind of shield technique.</p><br/><p>Still, Lela\u2019s body received an impact, blood flowed from all over. It was clear that her strength greatly diminished.</p><br/><p>Elena restored Lela\u2019s strength immediately.</p><br/><p>The Prince finally recovered itself from\u3010Lightning fist\u3011\u2019s numbness and tried to pursue. </p><br/><p>Whether it reached its strength limit, it couldn\u2019t move its foot forwards.</p><br/><p>The Prince also fell on its knees.</p><br/><p>Then, Lela, who had her strength recovered by Elena, stood up straight.</p><br/><p>Towards the Prince who could only scowl without being able to stand up, Lela poised her rapier and poured power into it.</p><br/><p>Lela\u2019s rapier was wrapped in faint light.</p><br/><p>In the next instant!</p><br/><p>Lela\u2019s rapier pierced deeply through the Prince\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>The Prince slowly fell down on its back, completely dead.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cUooooooooooooooooo!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The soldiers, who were watching around from the distance, raised a loud shout.</p><br/><p>They swarmed towards Lela\u2019s position.</p><br/><p>Lela, towards the gathered soldiers,</p><br/><p>\u300cWithdraw!\u300d</p><br/><p>shouted.</p><br/><p>And, she lost consciousness and fell forward.</p><br/><p>I immediately caught her, preventing her from falling onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Repeated damage and recovery many times, she was probably quite exhausted mentally.</p><br/><p>She overdid herself a little too much\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When I held Lela in princess carry, the soldiers briefly opened up a path.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, I walked towards the town while holding Lela.</p><br/><p>When we entered the town, the townspeople lined up on both sides and gave a grateful applause toward the soldiers, adventurers and the unconscious Lela.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Lela has been remembered as a hero who defended the Ikebu town from the attack of the Goblin Prince\u2019s army and survived with only 150 people. It was handed down from generation to generation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

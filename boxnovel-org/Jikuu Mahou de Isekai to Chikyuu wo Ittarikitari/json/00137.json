The children had also went to sleep.</p><br/><p>I set a barrier up on the tent where Nancy is sleeping,</p><br/><p>and returned to Japan with Aya and Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy did we return to Japan and leave Nancy behind, oniichan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy, Aya, </p><br/><p>because today is weekday, you need to go to junior college.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>In Japan time, it\u2019s 7:00 in the morning while in Egypt time, it\u2019s 0:00 at night.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is this what they call jet lag?\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya was confused.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Not sure but I\u2019ve read in some article before about someone conning people by squirting tomato ketchup at the victim\u2019s handbag and then snatch it while she attempts to clean it off.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Inazumaky\u016b() which lit. means lightning bulb where as Denky\u016b() means light bulb, probably a wordplay\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Rice cookers come with a 1 g\u014d (180ml) measuring cup used to indicate the serving size for one person.

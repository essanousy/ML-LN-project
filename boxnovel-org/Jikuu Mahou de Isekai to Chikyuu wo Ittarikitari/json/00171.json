Dangerous!\u300d</p><br/><p> This time, she performs a foot sweep kick.</p><br/><p> Afterwards, fists and kicks fly unceasingly.</p><br/><p> As expected of Mai-san, her continuous attack has a tremendous speed.</p><br/><p> Her attack's sharpness and speed, it's probably above the demonkind's king?</p><br/><p> Though her reach is too short, her attacks reach far for some reason. What's happening?</p><br/><p> I kept dodging Mai-san's attacks for a while when she temporarily took a distance and\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of Aya-kun's oniisan.</p><br/><p> That blow also didn't hit......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMai-san, let's stop this already.</p><br/><p> How about calling it a draw?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don't want to stop such an interesting fight midway!\u300d</p><br/><p> When Mai-san said so\u2015</p><br/><p> she disappeared!?</p><br/><p> The next moment, I sensed\u300eDanger\u300ffrom behind.

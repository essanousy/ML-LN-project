The townspeople were robbed off of food too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's troublesome,huh......\u300d</p><br/><p> The sisters in the back hang their heads down when they heard it too.</p><br/><p>\u300cButte-sama, what is that staff?\u300d</p><br/><p> Staff?</p><br/><p> When I looked closely, Butte-sama held a shabby staff.</p><br/><p> It's a staff that can really be called hastily made, a cloth adequately wrapped around a tree branch which has fallen somewhere.</p><br/><p> No, no. I mustn't judge it by its appearance.</p><br/><p> Ah, it may not look like it but it's probably a really great staff.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo hold such a hastily made staff or something......\u300d</p><br/><p> It was a hastily made staff according to its appearance......</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u3010Staff of Asclepius\u3011......</p><br/><p> was stolen by the thieves......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!!?\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems to be a name of some great staff.</p><br/><p> It will certainly be a great staff.</p><br/><p> When I was thinking such a thing\u2015</p><br/><p> Butte-sama suddenly looked over here,</p><br/><p> and called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cOya, you're Princess Elena's escort......</p><br/><p> if I'm not mistaken, Seiji-san.\u300d</p><br/><p> N? How does she know my name?</p><br/><p> Ah! If I'm not mistaken, this person was probably also there when the aristocrats gathered in the war.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-, Hello......\u300d</p><br/><p> Umu, I'm not very good at dealing with aristocrats.</p><br/><p> When I give a poor response, they may suddenly get angry.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou being here means, has Princess Elena also come?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, she is treating the injured people in the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? Elena-sama!</p><br/><p> Let's also go to the town quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p> We went back to the town with Butte-sama.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cHow terrible......\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama and the sisters were dumbfounded when they saw the condition of the destroyed town.</p><br/><p> However, we didn't even see a single injured person whom we had seen a lot earlier.</p><br/><p> Perhaps, all of them went to where Elena is.</p><br/><p> When I checked the map and went to where Elena is,</p><br/><p> in a place that seemed to be the assembly hall of the town, Elena was performing treatment amidst of many injured people.</p><br/><p> Hilda was moving about busily, giving the injured people water to drink.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama...and, Butte-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama walked over to Elena and knelt.</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess Elena who treated the injured people of my town, how should I thank you......\u300d</p><br/><p> When Butte-sama appeared, the surrounding people were also surprised,</p><br/><p> and when they saw Butte-sama kneeling toward Elena, they were further surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cButte-sama is kneeling down......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c......P-, Princess...that young woman is!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI though that she is a wonderful healer but......</p><br/><p> to unexpectedly be Princess-sama......\u300d</p><br/><p> When they found out that the person who was casting recovery magic on them is the Princess,</p><br/><p> a commotion broke out in the assembly hall.</p><br/><p>\u300cButte-sama, please wait because I will heal the injury this person.\u300d</p><br/><p> As Elena said so, she cast recovery magic to the injured person.</p><br/><p> The injured person lying in front of Elena had his wound steadily healed under the effect of recovery magic and his painful expression gradually loosened.</p><br/><p>\u300cP-, Princess Elena......</p><br/><p> since when were you able to learn recovery magic up to here!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's thanks to Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama looked back and stared at me.</p><br/><p> I trained Elena. How's thattt?</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess Elena is joking again.\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama seemed to have taken it as Elena's joke!</p><br/><p> Well, Elena's recovery magic is the result of her own hard work, there's no need to thank me.</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess-sama, since we will do the rest, please take a break.\u300d</p><br/><p> When Butte-sama says so......</p><br/><p> the sisters in the back look gloomy.</p><br/><p> The oba-san[1] sister who seems to be the oldest among the sisters steps forward and whispers into Butte-sama's ear.</p><br/><p> I pricked my ears up a little and listen.</p><br/><p>\u300cButte-sama, we are also exhausted with the fight against the thieves and everyone's magic power has run out.</p><br/><p> Without food and if we overuse our magic power in this situation too, we might also collapse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat did you say!?</p><br/><p> For all that the Princess-sama have done so far, we can't just stand by and do nothing.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems that they are barely\u300escraping by\u300fsomehow or other.</p><br/><p> Then, it's our turn.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda! Come over here for a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p> I called Hilda.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-onii-chan, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince those sisters seem to be in trouble of running out magic power, give them candy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Understood!\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda rushed out vigorously,</p><br/><p> and kept on giving the sisters candies.</p><br/><p> Cheers broke out from the sisters who got candies, saying\u300cIt's swee~t\u300d.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, Mai-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat?\u300d\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince we are going to hand out food, please look for a metal that can be used to create a pot and something that can be used as a firewood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoooger!\u300d\u300cLeave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya and Mai-san rushed out of the assembly hall.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I cleared up an open space in front of the assembly hall\u2015</p><br/><p> Aya came back with a huge bell.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, I've found this!</p><br/><p> Can you make a pot with this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere did you find this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has fallen.\u300d</p><br/><p> Is this bell not something important in the town?</p><br/><p> I'm having trouble deciding whether it's fine to use it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat on earth are you going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p> Someone called out from behind and when I looked back\u2015</p><br/><p> it was Butte-sama.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou're just in time, Butte-sama.</p><br/><p> I'm planning to distribute food with the food we brought,</p><br/><p> so can I make this bell into a pot?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis bell is......\u300d</p><br/><p> It seemed to be an important bell after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can't be helped.</p><br/><p> To alleviate the people's hunger is our bigger priority than the bell right now.</p><br/><p> But, how are you going to make a pot out of that bell?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'l do it like this.\u300d</p><br/><p> I re-shaped the bell into a pot with\u3010Earth magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?</p><br/><p> So you are a\u3010Earth magic\u3011user, huh.</p><br/><p> Besides, such a big thing......</p><br/><p> maybe what Princess Elena said wasn't wholly a joke.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems she understood my greatness somehow or other.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, where is the food?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I've been carrying it using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a large leisure sheet and spread it on the ground.</p><br/><p> I took out all the food in the inventory and placed it on top of that, creating a huge pile.</p><br/><p>\u300cWh-, What!!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama looked at the large amount of food and nearly jumped out of her skin.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, what soup should I make~.\u300d</p><br/><p>[1] Aunty</p><br/>\n</div>"}

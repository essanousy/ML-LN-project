Is either the white or black one trying to help the girl?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m confused on what to do.</p><br/><p>Elena used\u3010Cloudburst\u3011magic on both orcs without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The white and black orcs were surprised at the\u3010Cloudburst\u3011and became confused, the orc unconsciously let go of the girl.</p><br/><p>The girl was thrown down on the ground, she was trembling and petrified with fear.</p><br/><p>I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011and appeared beside the girl, I held her and used\u3010Teleportation\u3011immediately to return.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Thank you\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Then the girl fainted on the spot.</p><br/><p>I took out a bath towel from the inventory and wrapped it around the girl.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are there two kinds of orc?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not seen much around here but the black one is called\u300eBlack orc\u300f. Because\u300eBlack orcs\u300fare on bad terms with common orcs, they often fight whenever they encounter each other.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd because of that, either one of them was trying to help this girl?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s different, they both attack human beings.\u300d</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s something like snatching each other\u2019s prey.</p><br/><p>While having such talk, the orcs recovered themselves from confusion and began to fight.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do we do? Do we subjugate them both?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, let\u2019s finish them off.\u300d\u300cI think so too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, since I have to look out for this girl, are the two of you gonna be fine fighting by yourselves?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, start fighting after I cast\u3010Quick\u3011on you two.\u300d</p><br/><p>I cast\u3010Quick\u3011on the two, Elena used\u3010Cloudburst\u3011to attack the orcs once again.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Aya also rushed out, she swirled around the 4 orcs and slashed them using the Japanese-made knife.</p><br/><p>After a while, Aya\u2019s fast movements created a\u3010Tornado\u3011, combining itself together with the\u3010Cloudburst\u3011.</p><br/><p>The water stream spun almost like a\u300eBlender\u300f.</p><br/><p>When the orcs tried to escape outside the water stream, they were slashed by Aya\u2019s knife and were pushed back inside the water stream.</p><br/><p>The orcs continued to spin for a while and after confirming that the orcs no longer moved did Aya stopped the\u300eBlender\u300f\u2019s rotation.</p><br/><p>What remained there were the 3 common orcs that could no longer move and the barely alive black orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s still alive!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, so persistent!\u300d</p><br/><p>This time, Elena sent down\u3010Snow\u3011. It\u2019s probably a strategy that freezes the wet body and takes away the stamina.</p><br/><p>Aya combined it with an\u3010Ice ball\u3011and attacked the orc.</p><br/><p>After a while, the black orc had been completely encased in ice.</p><br/><p>\u300cYehey!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and Elena high-fived and praised each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou two were amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>It came from the bottom of my heart.</p><br/><p>However, with a dryer, electric fan and blender, Aya\u2019s magics all seem like household appliances.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s return and bring this girl to the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOkay.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>I put away the 3 common orcs and the frozen black orc in the inventory and used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to Suga town, slightly away from the town\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, we protected this girl that had been kidnapped by orcs inside the forest, what should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>As I explained the situation to the town\u2019s gatekeeper, we were shown to the guardroom.</p><br/><p>We laid the the girl on the bed in the guardroom, the girl woke up after a while.</p><br/><p>After hearing the story, it turns out that\u300eMeg-chan\u300fwas reported as missing, the soldier brought in Meg\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u300cMeg! It\u2019s good that you are safe!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkaasan!!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we heard the story, Meg-chan who had been playing in the town suddenly disappeared and they were searching ever since.</p><br/><p>She should\u2019ve been in the town, how did the orc performed the kidnapping?</p><br/><p>Because I sometimes come across with suspicious criminals that shows\u300eDanger\u300fall over the town, I wonder if those fellows are related?</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much. What should I give to express my gratitude\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Meg was taken by her mother and went home.</p><br/><p>Thank goodness, it was good.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you guys adventurers?\u300d</p><br/><p>One of the soldiers called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, we are registered in the adventurers\u2019 guild.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, will you please report about the orcs to the adventurers\u2019 guild?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, also, please take this to the adventurers\u2019 guild.\u300d</p><br/><p>He handed to us a document.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPublic order\u2019s maintenance, it was originally us soldiers\u2019 job but you helped with the work.

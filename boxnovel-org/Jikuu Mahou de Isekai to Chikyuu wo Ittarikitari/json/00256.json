Onii-chan, help me~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Idiot\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I jumped into the water at once and tried to help Aya.</p><br/><p>Due to the reaction that followed when Aya clung onto me, we almost sunk into the water.</p><br/><p>We somehow managed to return to the foothold using\u3010Water magic\u3011, though not until I nearly drowned.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not alright, jinu[1].\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, who had returned to the foothold, had a runny nose.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough you can use\u3010Water magic\u3011, why did you nearly drown?</p><br/><p>Thanks to you, even I is soaking wet.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was *sniff*~ sudden, t-, *sniff* that\u2019s why\u2026\u2026[2]\u300d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand what you are saying.</p><br/><p>I took out a bath towel from the inventory,</p><br/><p>and when I wipe Aya up\u2015</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda were warming us up with dryer magic.</p><br/><p>Alright, let\u2019s try to use a warming magic too.</p><br/><p>I made a sphere, which irradiated far infrared rays[3], appear from a slightly remote position.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this is warm!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the Far Infrared Ray magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is it an electric heater?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, it is.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s good, it\u2019s pleasantly warm~.\u300d</p><br/><p>While being irradiated by the far infrared rays, we took a break and drank hot cocoa for awhile, but I discovered an enemy approaching on the map.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe break is over.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s an enemy approaching.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, who has her clothes and hair half-dry, stands up and looks around restlessly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a\u3010predicted attack area\u3011appeared in front of me.</p><br/><p>That area was long and thin, drawing an arc.</p><br/><p>When I had Aya and the others to withdraw and watched the area closely\u2015</p><br/><p>*Schwan!*</p><br/><p>When I heard a sound of something shooting with great force,</p><br/><p>a largish\u300eflying fish\u300fpassed through the\u3010predicted attack area\u3011.</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s the enemy on this floor!</p><br/><p>After a short time, the\u3010predicted attack area\u3011was displayed where Hilda\u2019s head was positioned right now!</p><br/><p>I moved in front of Hilda using\u3010teleportation\u3011at once and put the white belt sword over where\u3010predicated attack area\u3011was located.</p><br/><p>*Schwan!*</p><br/><p>The moment when the\u300eflying fish\u300fflew out with great force and hit the white belt sword\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>it split vertically into two equal parts.</p><br/><p>The\u300eflying fish\u300f, which has been cut up into two, falls down on the foothold with *botori* and twitches.</p><br/><p>Is a\u300eflying fish\u300fdelicious?</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-onii-chan, thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda seems to be a little scared.</p><br/><p>If that attack hit a strange place, she might have suffered a serious injury.</p><br/><p>We decided to advance through this floor carefully.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When we advanced for a while whilst cutting\u300eflying fishes\u300finto two several times\u2015</p><br/><p>There was a reaction of an unidentified enemy rapidly approaching from far away.</p><br/><p>\u300cBe careful, something\u2019s coming!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and the others took their stances at once.</p><br/><p>This time, the\u3010predicted attack area\u3011was displayed, but it was aiming toward the middle of my forehead.</p><br/><p>When I promptly prepared the white belt sword\u2015</p><br/><p>*Swish!!*</p><br/><p>I-, I can\u2019t see it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Almost at the same time as I prepared the white belt sword, from out of nowhere,</p><br/><p>that fellow flew in.</p><br/><p>And, it was split into two by the white belt sword and fell down on the foothold with a *plop*.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010appraisal\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>it seemed to be a\u300eswift flying fish\u300f.</p><br/><p>Unlike the\u300eflying fish\u300f, which has two wings on each of its sides, there are as much as a total of four wings on each of its sides.</p><br/><p>This fellow seems to be a wind attribute,</p><br/><p>the\u300ewind attribute monsters subjugation\u300fcounted one.</p><br/><p>\u300cScary~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is scared at its excessive speed,</p><br/><p>but its attack damage shouldn\u2019t be too high.</p><br/><p>Preparing for a little damage, it\u2019ll be a monster who can be defeated easily if I counterattack right after getting hit once.</p><br/><p>But, I can\u2019t afford to have the girls take a damage,</p><br/><p>let\u2019s defeat all of them.</p><br/><p>In the end, there wasn\u2019t a boss on this floor,</p><br/><p>after defeating eighteen\u300eflying fishes\u300f,</p><br/><p>and five\u300eswift flying fishes\u300f,</p><br/><p>we found the stairway towards the top.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The atmosphere didn\u2019t completely change until now,</p><br/><p>the eighth floor was filled with terrible\u300eheat\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s so hot~!!\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hot and the humidity is terrible.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s totally like we\u2019re inside a sauna.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, it\u2019s hot!</p><br/><p>Can I take my clothes off?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t do such a vulgar thing!</p><br/><p>What are you going to do if there are other adventurers?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere isn\u2019t any other adventurer here!</p><br/><p>Hot~hot~!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya doesn\u2019t have an awareness as an adventurer\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>well, she\u2019s not an adventurer, huh.</p><br/><p>We decided to go home immediately to change into a much cooler clothes.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s

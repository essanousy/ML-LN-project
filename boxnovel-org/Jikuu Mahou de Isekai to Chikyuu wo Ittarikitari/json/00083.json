Elena, who finished changing clothes earlier than me, was glued on the flyer.</p><br/><p>When I looked at the flyer, there was a picture of a woman dressed as a magical girl that struck her signature pose printed on it.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, do you want to go?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN?

It would be very fun!\u300d</p><br/><p>Damn! If Elena is happy, I have no choice but to do it!! Well, it\u2019s particularly good since that character seems to be an important character too.</p><br/><p>Elena and Aya went to their room afterwards. They said the they will be having a cosplay strategy meeting.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I went back to my room and decided to play with the magic stone that I\u2019ve gotten.</p><br/><p>First,\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011but nothing happened when I used it.</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Magic stone of Biribiri\u3011, it makes *biribiri*.</p><br/><p>When I applied magic power, the *biribiri* becomes stronger and lasts longer. The duration varies with the applied magic power.</p><br/><p>Because the magic stone emits a strong *birbiri*, I decided to wear a rubber gloves to hold it. </p><br/><p>I tried to test the\u3010Magic stone\u3011using\u3010Tester\u3011. When I put the tester rods on the black and yellow part of the magic stone, electricity flowed. What! It displayed an AC of 50~60Hz. But the voltage varied, ranging from 10~220V depending on the magic stone. </p><br/><p>I tested it further in various ways. When I put 2 magic stones side-by-side, the original voltage of the magic stones were added together and turned into a new voltage. When I put 30V and 70V together, it has become 100V. This is an interesting trait.</p><br/><p>I removed the electric wires connected to the plug from the outlet portion of the extension cord and mount a 100V magic stone with a solder. Because I have a\u300eSecond class Electrician\u300fqualification, those who don\u2019t have, please don\u2019t imitate too much. </p><br/><p>The\u3010Outlet Magic stone\u3011was finished. I tried to plug in an electric kettle and put in water. </p><br/><p>The electric kettle worked perfectly, it boiled hot water as per normal.</p><br/><p>\u300cHooray!\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve taken a guts pose unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Thank God! The me in the other world who could not eat meal due to using outlet magic will be gone!</p><br/><p>In my later tests, it rose up to 1 kW but when I add any more than that, the breaker came off and electricity didn\u2019t flow from the magic stone for a while. Well, when it used a lot of electricity, it took some time to restore back to its original. When I applied magic power, I found out that it can be used up to 2kW.</p><br/><p>I was pleased because it was more than what I thought the outcome would be\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When suddenly, I noticed that Aya and Elena had been peeping in from the gap of my door\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t peep without permission!\u300d</p><br/><p>The two people were scolded by me and hurriedly went back to their rooms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

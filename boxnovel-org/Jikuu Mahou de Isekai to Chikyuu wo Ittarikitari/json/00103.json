I wonder what could the both of them be doing at this hour?</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, come in.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse us for disturbing you.\u300d\u300cPardon the intrusion.\u300d</p><br/><p>What business could these two have?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are the two of you doing here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s been a while since I slept alone, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u300d</p><br/><p>It has been always the case since Elena had been abducted by me.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd, Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Uhm\u2026\u2026 i-, if the goblins suddenly attack\u2026\u2026 since it\u2019s da-, dangerous, it\u2019s best if we gathered together\u2026\u2026 I think\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Rather than calling Lela a dere, she seems scared. Well, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t particularly mind but what are we going to do about the bed?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m fine even if I\u2019m together with Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? T-, Then, me too\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Whatever.~</p><br/><p>Elena is adoringly glad.</p><br/><p>While Lela probably feels something like a suspension bridge effect.</p><br/><p>I was turned into a sandwich ingredient of a blonde beauty.</p><br/><p>Whether Lela was able to feel relieved, she immediately fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Elena found it easy to fall asleep as always.</p><br/><p>But, what would Aya say if she saw this scene?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m sure she would do a flying body press.</p><br/><p>I will also sleep now. Just when I thought so\u2015</p><br/><p>Lela embraced my left arm.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be having a nightmare. With a stiffed face, she was repeatedly trembling over a short interval.</p><br/><p>When I pat Lela\u2019s head with my right hand, she finally calmed down and quieted with a happy expression.</p><br/><p>I can finally sleep. When I returned my right hand and thought so\u2015</p><br/><p>This time, Elena embraced the right arm.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I could no longer move it.</p><br/><p>Well, since it\u2019s Elena, I permitted it.</p><br/><p>Though I couldn\u2019t move, I could finally sleep.</p><br/><p>*Shudder* When Lela trembled again.</p><br/><p>Muu, enough already.</p><br/><p>When I looked towards Lela\u2015</p><br/><p>Lela and my eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong? Aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cErrr\u2026\u2026 that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI need to go to the restroom\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Isn\u2019t it fine without saying it to me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Errr\u2026\u2026 if-, if you\u2019d like to go to the restroom as well, it\u2019s fine to go toge-, together.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s because, there\u2019s a story in which the goblins attacks from the toilet hole\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry because there aren\u2019t any goblins nearby.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPossibly, there\u2019s also something called worst case scenario.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGive me a break, I\u2019m already sleepy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cP-, Please. I-, I will listen to everything you say\u2026\u2026 i-, it will leak out\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped.~</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to take out the right hand which Elena embraced. After patting the head of sleeping Elena, I crawled out of the bed with Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cLight!\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela illuminated the pitch-black corridor using\u3010Light magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>That reminds me, Lela could use\u3010Light magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>Lela hesitantly goes down the corridor. How far is the restroom?</p><br/><p>It seems Lela is lacking concentration and *waver* her\u3010Light magic\u3011is flickering, reflecting a strange atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Lela\u2019s steps *fidget fidget* even further and it seems she can no longer maintain her concentration, making the\u3010Light magic\u3011finally disappear.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaa!\u300d</p><br/><p>Surprised by the sudden disappearance of the\u3010Light magic\u3011, Lela, while grasping my arm with all her strength, sat down on the spot. Ouch, ouch!</p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, I illuminated the corridor using\u3010Incandescent light bulb\u3011magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It illuminated the corridor like daytime, unlike Lela\u2019s\u3010Light magic\u3011. Lela also regained her composure.</p><br/><p>With halting steps, we finally arrived in front of the restroom.</p><br/><p>But, Lela tries to drag me inside the ladies\u2019 restroom.</p><br/><p>\u300cWa-, it. I\u2019m going to wait here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, In front of the stall\u2019s door. Since it\u2019s fine in front of the door, please wait there. Please.\u300d</p><br/><p>Are you the\u300efemale ghost dragging girls down the toilet1\u300f!? Such a ghost doesn\u2019t exist!</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease, i-, it would leak\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela tries to drag me with watery eyes.</p><br/><p>What should I do if I\u2019m seen at such a place by someone?</p><br/><p>But, I\u2019ve been dragged inside by the ghost.</p><br/><p>\u300cStay here, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped so I stood here.</p><br/><p>I heard a sound coming from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u300cD-, Don\u2019t listen! Cover your ears!\u300d</p><br/><p>I ignored it and decided to wait with a stunned expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Seiji-sama! What are you doing in a place like this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Uh oh, I\u2019ve been caught by Elena. W-, What to do?</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, over there is Lela. Because she said that goblins might attack while in the restroom, she asked me to stand guard.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my request\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Nice follow up, Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, Truly, I thought\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eI thought\u300fwhat!?</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I\u2019d like to use it as well, will that be alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019m going to go out.\u300d</p><br/><p>In front of the ladies\u2019 restroom, I waited for the two people to finish their excretion.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> The next morning, we were having breakfast inside Lela\u2019s room\u2015</p><br/><p>A soldier entered in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u300cReporting. The reconnaissance unit have discovered a horde of goblins! If we infer from their current speed, they\u2019re expected to reach this town by noon.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand. Notify the soldiers and adventurers of the situation and start the preparation for the defense.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, understood.\u300d</p><br/><p>The soldier went out hurriedly. Lela tried to eat breakfast but midway, her hand trembled and dropped the knife. </p><br/><p>Lela tried to pick the fallen knife up but dropped it again.</p><br/><p>Are you so scared?</p><br/><p>Elena, unable to remain indifferent to such appearance, approached Lela and tightly hugged Lela\u2019s frightened face in her chest.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s alright because Seiji-sama and I will come with you.\u300d</p><br/><p>As she said so, she stroked Lela\u2019s head while hugging her.</p><br/><p>Lela, you sly. Unforgivable!</p><br/><p>Together with Lela, who regained her composure, we finished our preparation and left the inn.</p><br/><p>Upon exiting the inn, the townspeople crowded around the inn anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Lela. Say something to the townspeople to reassure them.\u300d</p><br/><p>I whispered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Lela braced herself, stood in front of everyone and loudly declared.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am\u300eIron wall Lela\u300f, daughter of the Aristocracy union knight leader, Lyle Gewalt! I will defend this town on my name\u300eIron wall\u300f! People of this town, take refuge and wait with peace of mind!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOooooo!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIron wall Lela-sama will defend our town!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela-sama annihilated the orcs, the goblins will meet a similar fate and gain easy victory!\u300d</p><br/><p>The townspeople cheered and praised Lela unanimously.</p><br/><p>Along with Lela, who has a blank expression, we boldly advanced forward through the cheering crowd.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Probably, the Hanako-san bathroom ghost story.

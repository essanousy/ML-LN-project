But, Elena is a guest.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I\u2019m Ringo-san\u2019s [maid] today.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMaid?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. I heard that it\u2019s also your examination period, and yet, you\u2019re also doing your part at Nancy Jewelry, so it must be hard, right? Since I will do all the housework until the exams is over, Ringo-san, please study hard.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you, Elena-chan. I will study hard.\u300d</p><br/><p>Thus, Ringo studies hard while Elena prepares tea in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Alright! The two people are inside the perfectly secured apartment, it\u2019s currently safe.</p><br/><p>Even though I said that, let me peep a little bit more~.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t particularly mean that peeping is my hobby, okay!?</p><br/><p>\u300cRingo-san, I\u2019ve prepared the tea.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you, Elena-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena poured Ringo, who has begun to study, tea.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s delicious. Elena-chan is good at making tea, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I always help in the kitchen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHelping in the kitchen\u2026it\u2019s enviable\u2026 with Seiji-san\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs something wrong, Ringo-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s nothing\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Enviable? Is Ringo-san interested in tea ceremony?</p><br/><p>Elena, leaving behind the studying Ringo, went out to the supermarket to shop.</p><br/><p>Even so, there isn\u2019t any suspicious person that appeared~.</p><br/><p>Did we jump ahead a little too far?</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s better than to be forestalled, right?</p><br/><p>After that, the people, who recovered from injuries and diseases, suddenly appeared around Elena one after another too and she finished shopping and went back to Ringo\u2019s apartment without any problem in particular.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m back!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome back, Elena-chan. Thank you, you\u2019re even doing the shopping. What are you going to prepare for today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cToday\u2019s menu is ginger pork~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWow, I like ginger pork very much~!\u300d</p><br/><p>It looks somewhat fun~.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like to eat ginger pork, too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After dinner, I went out to fetch up the two people and the first day of the escort strategy ended without a hitch.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>Even from the next day, I continued the schedule of sending the two to escort in the morning and fetching them up in the evening and a week passed with nothing happening.</p><br/><p>Umu, on the contrary, it\u2019s ominous when they continue to do nothing.</p><br/><p>It was on Friday when the trouble occurred.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey! Megumi, we were waiting for you.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two people, Megumi-chan and Hilda, had been surrounded by some people while they were on the way to Megumi-chan\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>This is bad!</p><br/><p>I was in the middle of work, but I left my seat and pretended to go to the restroom, transform myself into ninja form, put on [Invisibility1] magic and then, rushed toward the two people\u2019s position using [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat! You guys.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hm?</p><br/><p>[Vigilance] magic isn\u2019t reacting.</p><br/><p>What is happening?</p><br/><p>When I looked at them properly, surrounding the two people were young men, who were about the same age as Megumi-chan.</p><br/><p>Are they classmates at school?</p><br/><p>And then, a person soon steps forward.</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi, please stop playing your half-baked idol make-believe game and go out with me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMake-believe game, you said!? Who would do something like going out with you?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hey, is he wooing her?</p><br/><p>The other party was a guy, who seemed to be weak-headed, under misconception.</p><br/><p>\u300cWho would want to go out with me, you said? The fact is that there\u2019s a lot of girls, who makes advances at me, you know? Because it\u2019s considered an honor.\u300d</p><br/><p>This fellow is hopeless, he doesn\u2019t comply with human conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you stupid?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust come!\u300d</p><br/><p>That person was going to grab Megumi-chan\u2019s hand, at the moment-</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease don\u2019t be rude to Megumi-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda stood in the way in front of that fellow.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, it\u2019s no use, that fellow is a dangerous guy, so step back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re called Hilda, huh. Cheeky brat!\u300d</p><br/><p>That boy, who seems to be weak-headed, is going to push Hilda.</p><br/><p>However, Hilda quickly stopped that fellow slooow attack and grabbed it.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou sanovabitch, you want to fight back, huh!\u300d</p><br/><p>The boy tries to take back the hand that is grabbed by Hilda, but the hand doesn\u2019t budge an inch.</p><br/><p>\u300cDamn it, this fellow has enormous strength despite her appearance! Let, me, go!\u300d</p><br/><p>The boy finally broke free from Hilda\u2019s hand, taking many steps backwards.</p><br/><p>Are you scared by Hilda?</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, beat that pipsqueak.\u300d</p><br/><p>The boy gives an order to a tall man, who is standing at the side.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s an underling as expected, huh.</p><br/><p>The tall man, about 2m tall, steps forward in front of Hilda.</p><br/><p>The height difference between him and Hilda is tremendous; they look like a dwarf and a giant.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, it\u2019s no use, that person is a black belter in karate! Run away.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked at them carefully, Megumi-chan has been caught by the other men.</p><br/><p>Well, because the men, who seized her, are those guys, who seems to be timid, I think they aren\u2019t exercising violence, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Should quietly step in and help?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m going to save her.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda answered so as if responding to the voice in my mind.</p><br/><p>Hilda has probably noticed that I\u2019m nearby.</p><br/><p>Thus, she is saying those words towards me.</p><br/><p>1.

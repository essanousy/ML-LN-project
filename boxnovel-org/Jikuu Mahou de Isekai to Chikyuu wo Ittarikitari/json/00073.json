I wish I could look around a bit before leaving.</p><br/><p>That night, I brewed 23\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011using the\u3010Mandrake root\u3011I bought, totaling 29. Setting aside the ones for the director, since there\u2019s too many, let\u2019s sell some of it this time. </p><br/><p>After that, the\u3010Strength recovery potion\u3011has been used as ingredients for\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011as well as the\u3010Medicinal herbs\u3011, all the materials has been used up. I should replenish my stock. </p><br/><p>There\u2019s only 7\u3010Strength recovery potion +3\u3011left in my hand, since these may become useful for something, I\u2019ll keep them.</p><br/><p>The next day, when I went to the company, I received a lunch invitation from the director. It seems like he wants to discuss about the you-know-what.</p><br/><p>While smacking his lips over the delicious eel at the luxurious eel shop, the director began to talk happily.</p><br/><p>\u300cI intended to use the you-know-what on the day you gave it to me but my wife went out on a trip without notice. I finally had the chance to use it on Friday when she came back from the trip. I\u2019ve only had a sip of that and was overwhelmed. It was only about a full sake cup.\u300d</p><br/><p>The director was beaming with a smile that he never showed. The awkward relationship of the couple had improved. He told me that he consumed the you-know-what on the weekend.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m also happy that it was able to make you glad.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! I found out that it\u2019s not good to depend on the example too much, I\u2019d like to have some bottles of the example. Can you give me?\u300d</p><br/><p>I pretended to be reluctant to take it out.</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m worried that it will have a side effect on the director\u2019s body if he drink too much, I\u2019m not thinking of raising its scarcity value, not at all!</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry Director but I can only prepare one of them right now.\u300d</p><br/><p>I said and put only one\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011on the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? only one\u2026 that\u2019s right, one can\u2019t get these things so easily.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTherefore, it\u2019s better to only drink a little bit between uses.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Because the Director seemed to be convinced, I\u2019ll slow down the crafting pace in the future.</p><br/><p>\u300cDirector, there\u2019s also a different matter\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>While saying so, I took out 1 of the\u3010Strength recovery potion +3\u3011and placed it next to the\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a drink that recover strength. If you get tired from intense exercise1, drink this.\u300d</p><br/><p>Because strenuous exercise when you get old seemed to be dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that right? Is this also a good thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause this one is easier to obtain than those examples, it may not be much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, is it fine to take it after the other one?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, there\u2019s no problem.\u300d</p><br/><p>The Director and I cracked a smile.</p><br/><p>But the Director seemed to be worried about the potions on the table and was fidgeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, With that\u2026\u2026 I prepared something as thanks for the second item, will you receive it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Ah, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>The Director looked left and right, he then took out a brown envelope from his breast pocket and presented it.</p><br/><p>I received the envelope and put it in my breast pocket. The Director wrapped the small vials of\u3010Strength recovery potion +3\u3011and\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011in a handkerchief protectively and placed them in a bag.</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha! Iya, I\u2019m so happy to have a good subordinate like you. Come on, let\u2019s eat the eel and work hard for today!\u300d</p><br/><p>Director, are you talking about working hard for the afternoon work? Or is it about the night work? Let\u2019s not think about it too much. After that, the Director and I finished the afternoon work with the power of the high-class eel energetically.</p><br/><p>After returning home, I checked the contents of the brown envelope and there were 10 Yukichi-san2. Director, this is too much\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the evening, the 3 of us are drinking tea after dinner when the chime of the intercom reverberated. Who could it be at such an hour? Somehow, I have a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I opened the door, it was innocent faced of the shopping district the other day.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I remember correctly, you\u2019re from the shopping district\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Ah, yes. E-, Ehm, uh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Calmed down young man.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, I\u2019ve only seen him from the\u3010Tracking\u3011magic so it\u2019s our first meeting.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou escorted Elena here before. I\u2019ve heard it from her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes. I-, Is Elena inside?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShe is but do you have business with her?\u300d</p><br/><p>But, why is this fellow so nervous?</p><br/><p>Does he thought that Elena is living alone and with that in mind, he came to attack!?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell you see, i-, it\u2019s because, ba-, babaa-chan said that she would like to me-, meet Elena at her final mo-, moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt this hour? N? Final moments??\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That\u2019s because\u2026 babaa-chan\u2019s physical condition suddenly worsened\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that why!? Also, last moments!? You mean, her condition is that dangerous?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou should\u2019ve said it earlier! Elena! Get ready, we need to go out.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I went inside the house and shouted, Elena appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, what happened?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis fellow\u2019s obaa-chan\u2019s physical condition has worsened and wants Elena to come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll get ready immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>We were ready to go out after a while, the 3 of us, including Aya, went to the Japanese sweets shop at the shopping district led by innocent faced.</p><br/><p>\u300cBabaa-chan, I\u2019ve brought Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you really bring her? I said that it was fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBe-, because, babaa-chan\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The Obaa-san lay on the futon and weakly turned her head this way.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan, I\u2019m sorry. This child must have said something unreasonable\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena rushed towards obaa-san and took her hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll cure you immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan, it\u2019s already good that\u2026you came\u2026in my last moments\u2026\u2026 in a short period of time\u2026you showed kindness to this obaa-san, thank you\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Obaa-san said so and slowly closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s no good! I will heal you!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena began to use\u3010Recovery magic\u3011to the fullest.</p><br/><p>This can\u2019t be covered up with\u300eGood luck charm\u300fanymore.</p><br/><p>But, I can\u2019t stop Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cListen Elena. Don\u2019t act recklessly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Seiji-sama, please take a look at her strength\u2019s status.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood.\u300d</p><br/><p>I checked the status of obaa-san.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Name: Honda Umeko</p><br/><p>\u2502Occupation: Wagashi shop owner</p><br/><p>\u2502Age: 80</p><br/><p>\u2502Condition: (Terminal malignant tumor)</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Level: 1</p><br/><p>\u2502HP: 5 / 60</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Power: 4 Endurance: 2</p><br/><p>\u2502Ability: 10</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u300cThe HP is in danger.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>With Elena\u2019s\u3010Strength transfer\u3011, obaa-san\u2019s HP began to recovery bit by bit.</p><br/><p>But, I\u2019m worried about the\u300eTerminal malignant tumor\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, young man, does obaa-san have a malignant tumor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, we suppressed the pain using medicines but it also became ineffective recently.\u300d</p><br/><p>In other words, it\u2019s what they called\u300ePalliative care\u300f3.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, it seems there\u2019s a\u300eMalignant tumor\u300finside the body of obaa-san, can you find it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMalignant tumor? I\u2019ll try to find it using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>While maintaining the HP of obaa-san, Elena began to perform various trial and error and examined the body of obaa-san using magic.</p><br/><p>Elena\u2019s MP also steadily decreased, though she\u2019s somehow holding up using candy, you can\u2019t fully recover using it.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, young man.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you get some stuff with lots of sugar?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>The young man returned with Japanese sweets.</p><br/><p>\u300cThese are the last Japanese sweets made by Babaa-chan,\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright Elena, eat these Japanese sweets.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll help you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena is busy using magic, so Aya got to feed her the Japanese sweets.</p><br/><p>Then, Elena\u2019s MP began to recover instantly. Yey! With this, Elena will be able to recover her MP somehow!</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I\u2019ve found it. I saw the malignant tumor.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I checked Elena\u2019s status, there\u2019s a newly added magic\u2013\u3010Lesion4 detector\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, good! Heal the malignant tumor.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya wiped Elena\u2019s sweat and fed her Japanese sweets. The sight is a bit surreal\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The young man without knowing the reason, continued to pray.</p><br/><p>Elena tried various ways to heal the malignant tumor of obaa-san, none of it work somehow. The struggle lasts for 2 hours and everyone began to show signs of fatigue.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, it\u2019s not going well. What should I do\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, what to do\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf it\u2019s a surgery you should remove the malignant tumor.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya said something good.</p><br/><p>\u300cRemove? Huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, if it\u2019s a Japanese operation, you have to do ablation5 at once and wait for it to recover afterwards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u300d</p><br/><p>After a while, Elena laughed and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, but only a little. The tumor has been reduced.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, keep going!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>After a while, Elena extracted her hand from obaa-san and stopped using magic. Her face cracked into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it, the malignant tumor has been cured.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell done.\u300d</p><br/><p>I immediately checked the status of obaa-san.</p><br/><p>But the condition of (Terminal malignant tumor) wasn\u2019t removed. Why!?</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, not yet. It\u2019s not yet cured.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? S-, Such.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena were astonished once again and used\u3010Lesion detector\u3011to obaa-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe same lesion as the one a little while ago, it\u2019s all over the body\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena lowered her head with the hopeless situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, do you give up?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-, No! I will not give up!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena was once again fired up and turned towards obaa-san.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Time passed after that and the night has begun to fade into cracks of dawn.</p><br/><p>Finally, we managed to remove all the malignant tumors of obaa-san, I confirmed obaa-san\u2019s status and the (Terminal malignant tumor) had also disappeared.</p><br/><p>More surprisingly, Elena\u2019s\u3010Recovery magic\u3011went up to level 5. Raising magic to level 5 by relying on herself\u2026\u2026 Elena is really amazing.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019ve done well, Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes, obaa-san\u2026\u2026was good\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena was finally exhausted and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>\u300cYoung man, it\u2019s already fine. Obaa-san needs to rely on you afterwards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes. Thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>The young man deeply bowed her head.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s all because of Elena, say that words to her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>I princess carry Elena with Aya who\u2019s about to fall asleep at any moment and returned home.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, So tired\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I laid Elena and Aya on the bed, whipped my tired body\u30fc</p><br/><p>and went to the company.6</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Referring to Fukuzawa Yukichi on the 10,000 yen bank note, it\u2019s the same as Americans calling $100 bill \u2018Benjamin\u2019.\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses.

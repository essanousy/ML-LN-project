The people in the distance listen to my voice, the people in the vicinity come closer and watch carefully. I am the well-known [Golden Armor], the feudal lord of Nippo town, named [Rondo Warstar]!1 You heinous Devils! Fight a duel with me without trying to avoid it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Outside the cave which serves as the exit/entrance of the Devil race\u2019s town, Rondo raises hell with a loud voice using the [Megaphone] I lent him.</p><br/><p>But, why the historical drama style?</p><br/><p>Also, the language that Rondo is speaking is [Devil Language].</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, the region around here seemed to have been recognized as the territory of the [Devil race], so he was able to acquire the [Devil Language] with [Temporary Language Acquisition Magic Stone +2].</p><br/><p>Surprised at the very loud volume of the [Megaphone], the Devils come out from the cave one after another.</p><br/><p>Alright, with this opportunity, I\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>I teleported towards Bunmi-san, who was concealing himself in the biggest slave POW camp, with [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300cBunmi-san, how\u2019s the situtation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s Seiji-dono, huh. There\u2019s no changes here at the moment. However, it\u2019s really hard to converse when you couldn\u2019t see the people talking to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>I had the 3 people, Bunmi-san, Cassandra-san and Hilda turned their bodies invisible with [Invisibility Magic Stone] and had them watch over the POW camp.</p><br/><p>That [Invisibility Magic Stone] was made beforehand.</p><br/><p>By the way, I had the three people hold hands in order for them to not lose each other.</p><br/><p>By the way of the by the way, Cassandra-san is the center.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, how long are we going to wait?\u300d</p><br/><p>Muu, it\u2019s Cassandra-san, huh, it\u2019s really hard to converse when you couldn\u2019t see the one talking to you.</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo is attracting the attention of the Devils right now. Please wait a little bit more.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while, the movements of the Devils became lively, of the 10 or so people standing guard, around half of them went outside the town.</p><br/><p>They are probably going towards the place where Rondo, who is raising hell outside the town, is as reinforcements.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, it seems good now. Everyone, split up and take on the remaining guards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOoh!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>There are 5 Devil guards in total; 1 of them is sitting in the guardroom while the rest are patrolling on the walls in pairs.</p><br/><p>Cassandra-san and Hilda will take on the fellow in the guardroom.</p><br/><p>As for the 2 pairs patrolling on the walls, Bunmi-san and I decided to take on a pair each.</p><br/><p>The first to move are Cassandra-san and Hilda.</p><br/><p>Hilda covered the one, who seemed to be taking a break, in the guardroom with a sack from behind and then surprisingly, Cassandra-san tied a rope around him using that opportunity, neutralizing him.</p><br/><p>Hilda uses a small [Fire Magic] in the POW camp\u2019s open space, signaling that their strategy has succeeded.</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san and I started to move simultaneously at the signal, while I put the 2 of them asleep with [Sleep] magic, Bunmi-san mowed the other 2 without hesitation.</p><br/><p>As expected of Bunmi-san.</p><br/><p>After annihilating the Devil guards, the 4 of us removed the [Invisibility] magic and appeared before the captured people.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, we came to help!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeriously!? I didn\u2019t think that help will come.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I called out to the captured people, the Humans shouted in delight.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m the Demon Bunmi! My fellows who fell into the enemy\u2019s hands, I came to help you!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eOoh! We\u2019re saved, it\u2019s Bunmi-dono!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Demons, too, seeing Bunmi-san\u2019s figure, shouted in delight.</p><br/><p>Is Bunmi-san perhaps a celebrity among the Demons?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, everyone, since I will take you to a safe place with magic, join hands in a circle, 20 people at a time.\u300d</p><br/><p>There are probably around 500 Humans and around 60 Demons?</p><br/><p>I start to shuttle them outside the Devil race\u2019s town with [Teleportation Magic], 20 people at a time.</p><br/><p>This number of people, even I may get a little tired\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>It was then when I\u2019ve transferred about half of them over\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Pi\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!</p><br/><p>A sound, which seems to have come from whistle of sort, resounded in the area.</p><br/><p>Hearing the sound of that whistle, Devils gathering at the POW camp can be seen.</p><br/><p>\u300cNot good, we\u2019ve been discovered. Bunmi-san, Cassandra-san and Hilda, please prevent them from approaching until I\u2019m done transporting them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCount on me!\u300d\u300cLeave it to me.\u300d\u300cI\u2019ll do my best!\u300d</p><br/><p>While the 3 people were holding back the Devils, I have to hurry shuttling the people out.</p><br/><p>\\Ironically, the tall walls that prevent the slaves from getting away were conversely blocking the Devils\u2019 assault.</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san stands imposingly in the middle of the entrance with a daunting pose while Cassandra-san and Hilda will cover him from the rear, is their battle formation.</p><br/><p>The enemies coming front the front were cut down by Bunmi-san while the enemies, who were trying to pass through the sides, were blown away by Cassandra-san and had their bodies covered in flames by Hilda.</p><br/><p>The Demons and some Humans that were captured made an offer to fight, but all of those who have fighting ability have [Slave Collar] attached on them, thus unable to fight.</p><br/><p>After shuttling repeatedly for a while, I somehow managed to transport all of them into a safe place.</p><br/><p>\u300cRescue, finished! Let\u2019s go to the next camp.\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking at the crowd of Devils that have been thinned out, I called out to Bunmi-san and the others and used [Teleportation] towards the next camp.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>\u300cMai-san, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI just tidied everything up\u2026\u2026or so I thought. It seems the next enemies have come, I\u2019m off for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>At the place, there were several knocked-out Devils scattered about.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Hilda and I will be going ahead first towards the place where Aya is, Bunmi-san, Cassandra-san, I\u2019ll leave this place to you guys.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger!\u300d\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>Entrusting the place to the 3 people, Hilda and I used [Teleportation] towards the place where Aya is.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>\u300eAh\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The moment we arrived at the place where Aya is, a coarse scream of a Devil echoed out.</p><br/><p>It was the moment that the Devil, which received Aya\u2019s vital strike, fell face down, holding his butt.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, are you alr\u2026it looks like you are, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-chan and Hilda-chan, were you worried about me and came to help? It\u2019s tiring as they are slightly numerous, but I\u2019m still alright~.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, though surrounded by numerous Devils, was going around performing Vital Attack at the Devils with stab, stab while avoiding their attacks with fast movements.</p><br/><p>Whenever a Devil\u2019s vital was stabbed, \u201chooray!\u201d, cheers erupted from the people, who were captured at the POW camp, watching at a distant location.</p><br/><p>Aya, while responding to such cheers with a smile, repeatedly \u2018danced wildly unmatched2\u2018.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, since I will get these people out of here, I leave assisting Aya to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, understood.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Hilda went up to help Aya, a huge flame tornado formed at the location where Aya was \u2018dancing wildly unmatched\u2019 and a magnificent applause erupted from the spectating people.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, everyone, I\u2019m going to get you guys out of here with magic~!\u300d</p><br/><p>I persuade the people, who were being impossible asking to spectate some more, and shuttle the 100 or so people there to a safe place.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaah, I\u2019m done rescuing everyone~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSigh, the audience has disappeared.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya lost her motivation as soon as the audience has disappeared, leaving the Devils alone, she ran away towards me with Hilda.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, quickly, let\u2019s escape. It\u2019s a bit exhausting.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince there\u2019s one more POW camp remaining, hold on for a bit more.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>I, along with Aya and Hilda, went towards the last POW camp, which were being defended by Bunmi-san and the others with [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>1.

I didn\u2019t fail though?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, being the only one that has learnt darkness, is the only one who can see my figure,</p><br/><p>I am not visible to the others who are here\u300d</p><br/><p>The darkness spirit explained.</p><br/><p>I see, come to think of it, this has happened before. (T/N:kind of improvised the last bit, tell me if it makes more sense with or without it.) </p><br/><p>The fact that spirit of the darkness is properly called was explained to everyone, but</p><br/><p>Only Aya was looking at me with doubtful eyes. </p><br/><p>Okay, I\u2019ll master the super cool \u3010Darkness Magic\u3011, and make you bark. </p><br/><p>\u300cNow, darkness spirit,</p><br/><p>I want to make a contract, what should I do?</p><br/><p>Is it fighting after all?\u300d </p><br/><p>As I say so, I started preparing for a battle, but\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t be absurd. If it is Seiji-san, I would happily make a contract.</p><br/><p>Forever, please treat me well\u300d </p><br/><p>Are? No fight?? </p><br/><p>The darkness spirit sat straight, and there was it by making a respectful bow with three fingers of each hand on the floor.</p><br/><p>What is this? Have you set a flag, or something? </p><br/><p>\u300cBe, Best regards\u300d</p><br/><p>When I said as such, the darkness spirit jumps into my chest with a full smile (T/N: Some MTLs translated it as jumped into my heart, not too sure here.)</p><br/><p>When I try to catch it,</p><br/><p>The darkness spirit went straight into my body. </p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Darkness Magic\u3011 has reached Level 6\u300f </p><br/><p>Yoshi, the contract was successful.</p><br/><p>Even so, it was mentally tiring\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014- </p><br/><p>However, there are still many spirits to make contracts with. </p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, what shall we do next\u2026?</p><br/><p>Yoshi! I\u2019ve decided on you!</p><br/><p>\u3010Summon Wind Spirit\u3011!\u300d </p><br/><p>When I shouted that,</p><br/><p>A figure of an Ojou-sama appeared from vertically rolling wind. </p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you there!</p><br/><p>What are you calling me for?</p><br/><p>It is impertinent!\u300d </p><br/><p>The next spirit appears to have a bad personality. </p><br/><p>While thinking that,</p><br/><p>The wind spirit suddenly attacked without saying anything. </p><br/><p>\u300cD, Dangerous!\u300d </p><br/><p>The attack was avoided thanks to \u3010Expected Attack Range\u3011, however</p><br/><p>A-re, are you perhaps, \u3010Kamaitachi\u3011, that kind of fellow.</p><br/><p>If you hit, you will be spared! </p><br/><p>Yoshi, I feel like it will be alright to seriously try! </p><br/><p>I move to the back of the wind spirit using \u3010Teleportation\u3011, and let it experience some newly learned magic. </p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic Power Plunder\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaaa!!\u300d </p><br/><p>The magic that I remembered was a spell from the 5th level of darkness magic.</p><br/><p>Direct contact is required, but this is required to better take the opponents MP. </p><br/><p>\u300cStop it!!</p><br/><p>Magical power is\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc!!!\u300d </p><br/><p>I understood from the affair with the darkness spirit,</p><br/><p>Spirits are weak to magical power depletion.</p><br/><p>So, this \u3010Magical Power Plunder\u3011, can come into play. </p><br/><p>\u300cI was defeated.</p><br/><p>I surrender So, I will make a contract \u300d </p><br/><p>The wind spirit, obediently, formed a contract with me. </p><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Wind Magic\u3011 has reached Level 6\u300f </p><br/><p>Yay, Wind spirit contract get! </p><br/><p>\u300cSuch treatment to a spirit!\u300d </p><br/><p>The wind spirit was complaining\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>\u300cSo tired, this is bad,</p><br/><p>Will you fight my younger sister?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d </p><br/><p>The wind spirit fought with Aya, despite the magical power depletion. </p><br/><p>Aya sneaks up behind the spirit,</p><br/><p>As expected, as you can not attack a vital part, she chose to attack the back, but\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>Apparently being touched on the back has become a trauma for the wind spirit,</p><br/><p>she begins to convulse and surrenders. </p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u300cYatta! I can also make a contract too!!\u300d </p><br/><p>Aya is also able to make a contract with the wind spirit,</p><br/><p>for the first time her magic reached Level 6, she was overjoyed. </p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014- </p><br/><p>The next spirit to challenge is, the \u300eWater\u300fspirit. </p><br/><p>At first I tried summon it, but\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>a taciturn nude young girl appeared. </p><br/><p>Maa, even if I say naked, her body is made of water and is transparent. </p><br/><p>Suddenly I became trapped in a goldfish bowl, of which was filled with water. </p><br/><p>\u300cGubobobo\u2026\u2026\u300d </p><br/><p>It seems to be enduring the flooding somehow.</p><br/><p>This is bad, I can\u2019t breath\u2026\u2026. </p><br/><p>I use \u3010Electrolysis\u3011 , and create \u3010Oxygen\u3011,</p><br/><p>I took out \u3010Carbon Dioxide\u3011 from my lungs and traded it with \u3010Oxygen\u3011, and I continued breathing somehow. </p><br/><p>Incidentally, the extra \u3010Carbon Dioxide\u3011 and \u3010Hydrogen\u3011, is \u300eCarbonated Water\u300f, which is healthy for the body. </p><br/><p>For around 10 minutes, I continued enduring this state,</p><br/><p>At last I had gotten out and had decided to make a contract. </p><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Water Magic\u3011 has reached Level 6\u300f </p><br/><p>Fuu\u30fc, that was quite \u300ebothersome\u300f. </p><br/><p>I though of it\u2026\u2026,</p><br/><p>Elena, without fighting, made a contract.</p><br/><p>How sly! Do not place women above men!! </p><br/><p>Incidentally, the magic that became available was \u3010Summon Spirit\u3011. </p><br/><p>For \u300eDarkness\u300f, something called \u3010Garments of Darkness\u3011, (T/N: Unsure about this, \u300e\u300f\u304c\u3001\u3010\u306e\u3011\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001)</p><br/><p>It is a magic that creates clothing that can completely nullify a certain amount of all magic, aside from \u3010Light Magic\u3011. </p><br/><p>For \u300eWind\u300f, Oh, it is a dangerous magic that allows creation of huge hurricanes.</p><br/><p>Because it is dangerous, I guess I shouldn\u2019t use it too much? </p><br/><p>For\u300eWater\u300f, Only \u3010Goldfish Bowl\u3011 ,which I was I was trapped in earlier was available.</p><br/><p>It allows you to trap enemies in an inescapable aquarium, as long as you are supply magical power, it is impossible to escape.</p><br/><p>If it is anything other than an aquatic organism, it would definitely die from drowning, in the case that the enemy has a large body, MP consumption increases accordingly. </p><br/><p>After that, Ice and Fire,</p><br/><p>This is fairly difficult\u2026\u2026. </p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

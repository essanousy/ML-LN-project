There are many Devils, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh! Seiji-sama, people are forced to work.\u300d</p><br/><p>After seeing people being lashed by Devils with a whip and forced to work, Elena had a sad-like expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, are we not going to help them right now?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya looked a little angry.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, I understand what you feel, but if we attack recklessly, it would be troublesome if the people, who were turned into slaves, are held hostage. Let\u2019s come up with a plan properly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Un.\u300d</p><br/><p>After that, we talked about it thoroughly with Lella and decided to start the attack with the elite few on Saturday.</p><br/><p>\u300cI can gather soldiers if it\u2019s around 3, 000 people, but do you really not want it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, the Devil race\u2019s town is far, it\u2019s better to reduce the number of people to a certain extent in order to teleport them with my [Teleportation], besides\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a hindrance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019ll leave the selection of personnel, who will participate in the Devil raid on Saturday, to Lella.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, what kind of preparation should we make?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right~, prepare by raising your levels or something?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll go, too!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was Mai-san, who first showed great interest on leveling up.</p><br/><p>Certainly, since Mai-san wasn\u2019t acting together with us, there was a little gap between our levels.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a little uneasy to let the girls grind levels alone, but it\u2019s fine if I rush over quickly in case something happens, right?</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>That week, for three days\u2013Wed, Thu and Fri\u2013the schedule was repeated with me sending the 4 people\u2013Aya, Elena, Hilda, and Mai-san\u2013to the [Tower of Sunrise] in the morning before going to work, the four of them raising their level on their own during noon and me fetching them up in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>On Friday night, at the time when they finished grinding levels, their levels rose considerable like this:</p><br/><p>Elena, level 50.</p><br/><p>Aya, level 41.</p><br/><p>Hilda, level 47.</p><br/><p>Mai-san, level 38.</p><br/><p>And then, Aya\u2019s [Wind Magic], Elena\u2019s [Staff Technique] and Mai-san\u2019s [Body Reinforcement Magic] rose to level 5 respectively.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019ve become strong to this point, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of anymore with the fight against the Devils.</p><br/><p>We prepared for defeating the Devils tomorrow and fell sound asleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

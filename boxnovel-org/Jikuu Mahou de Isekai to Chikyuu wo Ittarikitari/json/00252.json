It will kill my fellow toki to get that.\u300f</p><br/><p>I have no choice but to give up the\u300edivination\u300fafter all, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhy do you want a\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011?\u300f</p><br/><p>I explained the circumstances to Toki.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011is a magic stone which raises the power of the\u3010space-time magic\u3011temporarily.</p><br/><p>It probably means that that person\u2019s ability is just not enough if he can\u2019t use\u3010divination\u3011without using\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011.</p><br/><p>Therefore, if he can increase the power of his\u3010space-time magic\u3011, he will probably be able to use\u3010divination\u3011without using\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011.\u300f</p><br/><p>Increase the power of the\u3010space-time magic\u3011, huh~.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s possible to strengthen the\u3010space-time magic\u3011in the same way as an attribute reinforcement magic stone, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>if I remember correctly, I tried to make a reinforcement magic stone of the\u3010space-time magic\u3011before, but I wasn\u2019t able to do it~.</p><br/><p>Well, I became quite stronger than those days,</p><br/><p>let\u2019s try it again.</p><br/><p>I took out a\u3010magic stone of nullpo\u3011,</p><br/><p>held it between my right and left hand, and tried to channel\u3010magic power reinforcement\u3011to my left hand and\u3010space-time magic\u3011to my right hand.</p><br/><p>I was able to do it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>and it was even a\u3010space-time reinforcement magic stone +5\u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>the magic stone was colorless, transparent and very beautiful.</p><br/><p>How!?</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to make it before!</p><br/><p>\u300eSo, this is a magic stone.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s that, there\u2019s no need for a\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011anymore.\u300f</p><br/><p>When Toki saw the magic stone, it heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t have to worry about its fellow getting killed anymore.</p><br/><p>However, how did I suddenly become able make it?</p><br/><p>The three kinds of reinforcement magic stones which I wasn\u2019t able to make before were\u3010body reinforcement magic\u3011,\u3010information magic\u3011, and\u3010space-time magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>As a test once again, I tried to make magic stones of\u3010body reinforcement magic\u3011and\u3010information magic\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to make these two as before.</p><br/><p>I can somehow understand that a reinforcement magic stone of\u3010body reinforcement magic\u3011can\u2019t be made.</p><br/><p>The magic I channel to the magic stone overlaps since one of the magic power I channel when making a magic stone is\u3010body reinforcement magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>Then, it\u2019s only these two,\u3010information magic\u3011and\u3010space-time magic\u3011. What condition I wasn\u2019t able to satisfy when I tried it before?</p><br/><p>And this time, only the\u3010space-time magic\u3011was able to satisfy the condition.</p><br/><p>What has changed from the past to now?</p><br/><p>Is it because my level rose from those days?</p><br/><p>Is it because the\u3010space-time magic\u3011\u2019s level rose from 5 to 6?</p><br/><p>Is it because I\u2019ve made a contract with a spirit?</p><br/><p>I feel that all of them are wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, what is it?</p><br/><p>*Pikon!*</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the visit to the mana crystal!</p><br/><p>The\u3010information magic\u3011and\u3010space-time magic\u3011are the only two magics I acquired without visiting a mana crystal.</p><br/><p>And I went to visit the\u3010space-time mana crystal\u3011this time.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, that must be the condition!</p><br/><p>Then, if I visit the\u3010information magic\u3011\u2019s mana crystal too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>By the way, is there\u3010information mana crystal\u3011somewhere?</p><br/><p>When I was thinking such a thing\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eSeiji of the humans, do you have no more questions?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes, it\u2019s already fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, let\u2019s meet again.\u300f</p><br/><p>When Toki said so, it was gone somewhere using\u3010teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s go back to the town too.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve kept you waiting, everyone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-chan.</p><br/><p>Are you done talking with the toki?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya was carrying a lot of food with both hands.</p><br/><p>Even though I said don\u2019t squander the gold like that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, nevermind.</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.</p><br/><p>Thanks to it, we can now have him to perform a\u300edivination\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that true, Seiji-sama!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, leave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to Exeter\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama,</p><br/><p>what order do you have to this poor man who can\u2019t perform a divination anymore?\u300d</p><br/><p>Exeter\u2019s eyes are dead.</p><br/><p>Was he that much shocked?</p><br/><p>\u300cExeter-san,</p><br/><p>you don\u2019t need to be depressed that much.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because I brought something which can serve as a substitute for the\u3010magic stone of toki\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that true!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Exeter\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up and approached.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not glad at all being approached by a man.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s this.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I took out the\u3010space-time magic stone +5\u3011,</p><br/><p>Exeter snatched the magic stone away from my hand to take it.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan I use this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince the magic stone isn\u2019t disposable, it\u2019s fine for you to try and use it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When Exeter stood up from the chair,</p><br/><p>he wrapped the magic stone up with his both hands protectively,</p><br/><p>and started to chant a some kind of incantation.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u25cb\u25b3\u25c7\u00d7\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Show me the future of Delaidos Kingdom!\u300d</p><br/><p>When Exeter shouted so, he was wrapped up in light.</p><br/><p>The light immediately faded away</p><br/><p>and Exeter immediately fell on his knee.</p><br/><p>\u300cExeter-sama, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena rushes up to Exeter.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just that my magic power has been exhausted.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I appraised Exeter,</p><br/><p>his MP became 2 / 302.</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems he spent as much as 300 MP using\u300edivination\u300f.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also a good thing that it\u2019s not to the very limit.</p><br/><p>This time, it\u2019s Hilda who rushes up and gave Exeter a candy.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a food that restores magic power.</p><br/><p>Please melt it in your mouth without swallowing it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood.</p><br/><p>Hmm, this is amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>Exeter recovered his energy in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd, did the\u300edivination\u300fgo well?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I succeeded.</p><br/><p>The result of the divination is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300e6 stone statues with 2 horns should be destroyed.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was the content.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>\u300eStone statue with 2 horns!\u300f</p><br/><p>There\u2019s something like that near the dragon-kin village!</p><br/><p>Since I haven\u2019t seen it directly, I don\u2019t know whether or not it\u2019s just a stone statue with 2 horns, but surely, it must be that.</p><br/><p>Or rather, I completely forgot about it.</p><br/><p>The devil-kin appeared from the place where there was a stone statue.</p><br/><p>However, there are even 6 of that?</p><br/><p>\u300cExeter-san, I\u2019ve heard that a stone statue was seen near Nippo town.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it necessary to contact Lela and have them search around the vicinity of each town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>Understood, I will contact Lela-dono.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Since Exeter will send a message to Lela,</p><br/><p>they will probably look for a stone statue in each town and destroy it.</p><br/><p>In that case, the devil-kin won\u2019t be able to attack using those.</p><br/><p>Well, about the stone statue near Nippo town,</p><br/><p>I will go there personally and destroy it.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like to examine it before breaking it.</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s the linkbucks link.

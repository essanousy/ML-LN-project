Even though you told me that I mustn\u2019t use magic in public\u2026\u2026\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSince there were injured people in front of you, it can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>However, since [Nancy Jewelry] and [Arc\u30fbGold] were on bad terms, it went this far, huh?</p><br/><p>The mafia, too, what are they trying to do? </p><br/><p>Did they get money from [Arc\u30fbGold] enough to do something like this?</p><br/><p>I peeked into the mastermind, [Gold]\u2019s situation using [Tracking Beacon], but\u2026\u2026 he was restlessly walking back and forth inside his office; he seemed to be waiting for a message from someone.</p><br/><p>Hmmm, there seems to be something more to this matter.</p><br/><p>When I was thinking about such a thing\u2013</p><br/><p>The [Vigilance] magic noisily notified me of the [danger] again.</p><br/><p>Who is it this time?</p><br/><p>It was Hilda and Megumi-chan this time.</p><br/><p>The two people wore sailor suits. (Ehh?) </p><br/><p>And then, they are surrounded by baseball club members. (Ehh??)</p><br/><p>It seems the place is the high school where Megumi-chan goes to.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation is this??</p><br/><p>As soon as I thought that, [guys wearing black from head to toe] with rifle in hand surrounded the baseball club members.</p><br/><p>The members of the baseball club are trying to protect Hilda and Megumi-chan, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, it seems Hilda is under attack this time. Since I\u2019ll go out for a bit, I\u2019ll leave the house to you.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAlright! Be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>I left Elena, put the [Invisibility] magic back on and while still in ninja form, I went to where Hilda and Magumi-chan were.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you guys!?\u300d</p><br/><p>At the location, the [baseball club members] and the guys wearing black from head to toe were glaring at each other in the baseball ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi, Hilda-chan, it\u2019s our fault since you\u2019ve come to cheer for us on our high-school baseball debut, sorry for having you involved into something like this.\u300d</p><br/><p>Among the baseball club members, a cool-looking boy, who is standing at the very front, apologizes. </p><br/><p>He\u2019s probably the captain.</p><br/><p>But, with those guys carrying guns in front, he\u2019s a guy with courage~.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you, it\u2019s no use to threaten us with that sort of toy guns!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, does he think that it\u2019s a toy?\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eFire.\u300f</p><br/><p>Ratatatat!</p><br/><p>The warning shot of a guy wearing black from head to toe explodes a step away from the captain.</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa-! I-, It\u2019s the real thing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The captain moved backward and withdrew to where the other members were.</p><br/><p>\u300cCa-, Captain, w-, w-, w-, what are we going to do?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cF-, F-, F-, For now, l-, l-, l-, let\u2019s call the police.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cU-, U-, U-, Understood. What\u2019s the number again \u2026\u2026\u201ddial one-one-zero right away.1\u201c\u300d</p><br/><p>The other members panicked as they understood that the guns are the real thing, too. </p><br/><p>However, the mafia guys fired a gun at the high school students without batting an eyelid\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to be seen in this form as much as possible, but it's impossible to talk about such a thing either. </p><br/><p>I released the [Invisibility] magic and appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, a ninja!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300eAh, a ninja!\u300f</p><br/><p>Both of them were surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cN-, Ninja!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan, too, is surprised at my appearance, she forces her way through the baseball club members and tries to move in front to see my form.</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi, hide in the back because it\u2019s dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>The captain stopped Megumi-chan, who was trying to move in front.</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, Because, the ninja\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi, do you know that ninja?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cUn, when I was kidnapped before by mafia, he\u2019s the person, who helped me\u2026I think.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, then he\u2019s an ally!\u300d</p><br/><p>The baseball club members regained their composure a little with my appearance.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat ninja might be the one in the report. Let\u2019s finish off that fellow first.\u300f</p><br/><p>Those guys wearing black from head to toe seems to have changed their target to me. </p><br/><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, too!</p><br/><p>\u300eFire!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ah, it\u2019s bad, the baseball club members will be hit by stray bullets if I dodge!</p><br/><p>Ratatatat!</p><br/><p>I cast [Quick] on myself and took out the [Brown Belt Sword] quickly, and the bullets they fired were all cut.</p><br/><p>Drop drop!</p><br/><p>Bullets cut in half were scattered around me.</p><br/><p>Well, I didn\u2019t simply cut them with a sword, using also the [Earth Magic] and [Barrier] at the same time, I killed the momentum of the bullets. </p><br/><p>To the people watching, it would seem that I cut them all with a sword.</p><br/><p>\u300eM-, Monster! Cutting bullets with a sword!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cThe ninja is amaziiing!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The guys wearing black from head to toe tremble with fear. </p><br/><p>The baseball club members are very excited. </p><br/><p>Wait, let\u2019s give them a service~. </p><br/><p>After moving a little to a spot where I can also be seen by the baseball club members, I performed a seemingly real [hand seal] with my both hands meaningfully.</p><br/><p>I made [Fire Pillars] appear around the guys wearing black from head to toe using [Fire Magic].</p><br/><p>\u300eUwaa!! It\u2019s a ninja\u2019s magic!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cAmaziiing!!!! It\u2019s a ninjutsu!!!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The baseball club members are too excited! </p><br/><p>Ah,</p><br/><p>Did he hear the uproar? </p><br/><p>At a slightly remote location, a school teacher can be seen making a call to somewhere.</p><br/><p>Now is the right time, huh. </p><br/><p>I performed a [hand seal] that seemed to be even more difficult than just now,</p><br/><p>\u300eCrap, here comes the ninja\u2019s magic again!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cNinja, keep at it!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Toward the guys wearing black from head to toe that were trying to escape,</p><br/><p>Crackle crackle!!</p><br/><p>I made them eat an extra-large lightning attack.</p><br/><p>Well, only its appearance is showy, but since the voltage is lowered, they won\u2019t die. </p><br/><p>When the intense lightning attack (only in appearance) stopped, the guys wearing black from head to toe received an electric shock and all of them fell down.</p><br/><p>\u300cHooray!! The ninja is strong!!\u300d</p><br/><p>While the baseball club members were delighted,</p><br/><p>I disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe ninja disappeared!!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cCool!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, putting aside the praises of the baseball club members, it\u2019s bad if I don\u2019t bring Hilda. </p><br/><p>I moved to a slightly remote position and made a call to Hilda.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, you\u2019re not injured?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Seiji-onii-chan, I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t have any injuries.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, listen carefully, since it would be bad if you stay in that place, get way from that there one way or another.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand!\u300d</p><br/><p>Now, will she be able to do it?</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, the phone call, was it from Maruyama?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cUm, that\u2019s right. Since it\u2019s bad for me to be here, get away, he said.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy any chance, did Maruyama know the event that happened just now?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cErrr\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe police would come soon, what would be bad for Hilda?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmmm, did Megumi-chan notice in various ways?</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll do something.\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seemed Megumi-chan had guessed in various ways.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, captain-san. We\u2019d like to leave here before the police arrives.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cHm? I see, since Megumi is an idol, it wouldn\u2019t be good if you\u2019re involved in a trouble. I understand, we\u2019ll do something. Everyone! Megumi wasn\u2019t here. Say it!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOooh!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems the baseball club members are going to keep it a secret, too. </p><br/><p>Hilda and Megumi-chan were seen off by the baseball club members and succeeded in leaving the place. </p><br/><p>Both of them, Hilda and Megumi-chan, who took each other\u2019s hand and ran away, seemed to be a little happy for some reason.</p><br/><p>In Japan, at every local police or post office, you will likely see posters that read, \u300c \u3053\u306e\u3092\u305f\u3089\u3059\u3050 110 \uff01 \u300d(If you see this face, dial 110 right away!)

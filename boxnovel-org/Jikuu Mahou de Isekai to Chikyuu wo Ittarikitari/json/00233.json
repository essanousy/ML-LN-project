Something happened, let\u2019s talk quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it!? Is something wrong, Seiji?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA horde of monsters whom the devil-kin controls are heading towards this town.</p><br/><p> You have to make preparations to intercept fast.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Upon arriving at Nippo town, the reaction of a horde of monsters that seemed to be under the control of the devil-kin has appeared on the map.</p><br/><p>The monster types are\u300eGreat rat\u300fand\u300eWolf\u300f, but their number is quite large.</p><br/><p>Someone may die if it isn\u2019t handled properly.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, understood.\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo seemed to have assumed such a situation and quickly began to give instructions to his subordinates.</p><br/><p>He was quite an excellent fellow.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it\u2019s Seiji and Hilda!\u300d</p><br/><p>Misha-san spotted us and called out.</p><br/><p>She probably came to Rondo\u2019s place to prepare for the battle.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you by any chance come here to help with the\u300edevil-kin interception battle\u300f, Seiji?\u300d</p><br/><p>The\u300eDevil-kin interception battle\u300f, huh~.</p><br/><p>Since when did the battle that will be starting right now has such a name?</p><br/><p>\u300cUnfortunately, we only came here to inform you guys about the approaching devil-kin.</p><br/><p> We have to go and see the situation of the other towns after this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? That situation of the other towns??\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes,</p><br/><p> the devil-kin\u2019s attack isn\u2019t only happening in this town, but to other towns as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt became such a serious matter, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>Misha-san\u2019s expression stiffened for an instant, and seeing Hilda\u2019s worried face\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, no need to worry since I will finish every devil-kin that comes with water magic!\u300d</p><br/><p>she pretended to be tough.</p><br/><p>However, the closing in 1000 devil-kin has a scale clearly larger than the one at that time in the demon town\u2026\u2026 will it be alright?</p><br/><p>When I was worrying, Hilda tugged at my clothes.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs something wrong, Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-onii-chan,</p><br/><p> I\u2019d like to remain in this town, and be Misha-san\u2019s helper.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s no good! It\u2019s dangerous!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut\u2026...\u300d</p><br/><p>Certainly, Hilda has conspicuously improved her skill in magic.</p><br/><p>However\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u300cThen onii-chan, I will stay too, and protect Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, you-!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, if it\u2019s Elena, it will become two rear guards, and if it\u2019s Mai-san, it will become two children (appearance wise), there\u2019s no choice but to go with the process of elimination, huh\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, I\u2019ll leave her to you, Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhoopee!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut Aya, you are Hilda\u2019s bodyguard this time!</p><br/><p> Don\u2019t charge into the enemy alone, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand already!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I have no choice here but to place my trust in Aya, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, Misha-san,</p><br/><p> I will leave Aya and Hilda to you guys, I\u2019m counting on you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san!?\u300d</p><br/><p>What are you getting excited for, Rondo?</p><br/><p>\u300cI will protect Aya-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s particularly good to be considerate,</p><br/><p> look after her so that she won\u2019t act rashly.\u300d</p><br/><p>With Rondo\u2019s direction, she will find it difficult to act rashly\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda will stay?</p><br/><p> Although I\u2019m glad, but is it alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>Misha-san is worrying about Hilda, huh.</p><br/><p>But Misha-san, Hilda has become considerably strong, you know?</p><br/><p>Please don\u2019t be surprised, and wet yourself, okay?</p><br/><p>That reminds me, I\u2019ll have Elena put a divine protection here too.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, can you use the Divine protection of Recovery spirit soon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, since I\u2019ve eaten a lot of Japanese sweets, I\u2019m already fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena raised the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011and put up a\u3010Divine protection of Recovery spirit\u3011on Nippo town.</p><br/><p>When the light of the\u3010Divine protection of the Recovery spirit\u3011wrapped around the surroundings, Rondo and Misha-san were considerably astonished.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama, what\u2019s this magic!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena received the\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011from Butte-sama, and acquired new magic.</p><br/><p> It\u2019s an amazing magic that recovers strength, magic power, and wounds as long as one is inside the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA-, Amazing!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo looks at Elena as if looking at a god.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor your sake, Elena-sama, I will protect this town by all means and show it to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo knelt toward Elena.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s one more additional believer of Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I will entrust this town to you guys, Aya, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left Aya and Hilda and went to the next town using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>We came to Cassandra-san\u2019s[1] pioneer village.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow\u2019s it going, Cassandra-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji, what\u2019s the matter?\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, the devil-kin doesn\u2019t seem to be approaching toward this village.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe devil-kin is going to attack the Nippo town.</p><br/><p> It seems to be fine here, but please be careful just in case.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?</p><br/><p> Are Rondo and Misha alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I left behind Hilda and my imouto there, they will be able to manage somehow or another.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou left behind Hilda!?</p><br/><p> Why did you do such a thing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRachel-san, Hilda has recently improved her skill.</p><br/><p> She will play an active role for sure.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I will come to help if it becomes dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, that\u2019s for sure, okay?</p><br/><p> If there\u2019s anything happened to Hilda, I will absolutely not forgive you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood.</p><br/><p>By the way, is the defense of this village alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAs you\u2019ve said, we made a wall and moat around the village, and have the soldier guards from Nippo town patrol around, they won\u2019t be able to get us easily.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s probably alright since I can\u2019t see any enemy on the map.</p><br/><p>I put a tracking beacon on Rachel-san for the time being, and went to the next town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>We went to Suga town, Ebisu town, and Shinaga town\u2015</p><br/><p>and I wasn\u2019t able to see the enemy anywhere of those.</p><br/><p>For the time being, I put a tracking beacon on Butte-sama, and on each entrances of Suga and Shinaga town.</p><br/><p>Since the number of tracking beacon had reached the upper limit, I removed the beacons attached on the cursed golden mask, on nose-pierced-stalker man who was still bedridden at the hospital, and on myself and used them here.</p><br/><p>But the only one I wasn\u2019t able to check up on was\u300eToki town\u300f......</p><br/><p>It\u2019s impossible since I haven\u2019t been to Toki town.</p><br/><p>I haven\u2019t been there since there\u2019s no mana crystal, but if I have a free time, I\u2019ll be sure to go there once.</p><br/><p>[1] It was supposed to be Rachel-san who is in charge of the pioneer village.

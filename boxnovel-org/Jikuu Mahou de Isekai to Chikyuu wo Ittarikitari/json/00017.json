Don\u2019t hug someone like Onii-chan, hug me instead~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s called a car, it\u2019s something like a carriage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCarriage? B-but there is no horse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt moves with an engine, so horses aren\u2019t needed.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEngine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, so take a good look. There are people riding inside, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, there really are people riding inside. Kyaa! This one is much bigger this time!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a bus. You see the people riding on it don\u2019t you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes. B-but, it\u2019s really scary.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJeez, Elena-chan! Come and hug me~!\u300d</p><br/><p> I feel somewhat tired.</p><br/><p> At long last, after crossing the street in front of the station, we arrived at the shopping district.</p><br/><p>\u300cWow, there\u2019s so many people. Everyone has the same hair and eye colour as Seiji-sama and Aya-sama. Are they all your relatives!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMost Japanese have black hair and eyes, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re relatives.\u300d</p><br/><p> Although Elena is sneaking looks at everyone around her\u2026 at the same time she is looking, everyone else is sneaking a look at her as well.</p><br/><p> Though Elena has blonde hair and blue eyes, she can speak Japanese fluently because of the \u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011. It ended up being really conspicuous and attracted a lot of attention from all over.</p><br/><p> As for Elena, whenever she meets the eyes of the people she passes by, she greets them with a smile and a nod.</p><br/><p> As we walked around like that for a while, the sea of people on the street parted before us as if we were Moses. It ended up like a parade celebrating our triumphant return.</p><br/><p> Aya is doing her own thing, acting like she was some sort of celebrity, waving her hands at the people around her happily. The one they\u2019re paying attention to isn\u2019t you, you know!</p><br/><p> We arrived at our first destination, the 100 Yen Shop.</p><br/><p>\u300c100 Yen Shop? Not the supermarket?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll also go to the supermarket, we\u2019ll be here for just a little bit before that..\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena almost fainted from seeing the amount of goods around, throwing a storm of \u300c What is this? \u300d questions at me.</p><br/><p> We bought a lot of thing things like a \u3010Lighter\u3011,\u3010Ball-point pen\u3011 , \u3010Writing Paper\u3011,\u3010Cup\u3011,\u3010Plate\u3011,\u3010Sponge\u3011and a \u3010Plastic Container\u3011.</p><br/><p> Having finished sopping at the 100 Yen Shop, we went to the supermarket next.</p><br/><p> Elena\u2019s eyes glittered at the sight of the supermarket\u2019s large amount of goods while she gave another typhoon of questions. I somehow made it through.</p><br/><p> I chose to stock up on some \u3010Fresh Potatoes\u3011,\u3010Fresh Onion\u3011, \u3010Carrot\u3011, \u3010Pork\u3011, \u3010Chicken\u3011, \u3010Sausage\u3011, \u3010Ham\u3011, \u3010Curry Powder\u3011, \u3010Wheat Flour\u3011, \u3010Tube of Garlic\u3011, \u3010Tube of Ginger\u3011, \u3010Lettuce\u3011, \u3010Egg\u3011, \u3010Milk\u3011, \u3010Butter\u3011, \u3010Yogurt\u3011, \u3010Cereal\u3011, \u3010Candy\u3011 and so on.</p><br/><p> Little sister\u2026 don\u2019t just secretly put \u3010Chocolate\u3011 in the basket! Well, we\u2019ll still buy it.</p><br/><p> Having finished shopping at the supermarket, as I was quickly putting away everything in my inventory while people aren\u2019t looking, my little sister said something strange.</p><br/><p>\u300c I want to eat\u3010Sushi\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHa? Why are you suddenly saying you want sushi?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCause, since Elena-chan has come to Japan, she absolutely has to eat sushi!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnd the truth is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I want to eat it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2013!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Sushi\u3011, what is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee\u2013! Elena-chan says she wants to eat it too!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, alright.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYay~!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-is it okay to go turn back?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, there\u2019s no helping it~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u300d</p><br/><p> Why are you apologizing to me?</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWelcome\u2013!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena was a little startled from the energetic welcome, although Elena garnered a lot of attention again.</p><br/><p> We sat in a family-size seat at the innermost area.When Elena looked at the sushi passing by on the conveyor belt, her eyes stared in amazement.</p><br/><p>\u300cT-this is, how\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe food passes by like this, so you can take what you like and eat it.\u300d</p><br/><p> As I was saying that, my little sister had already devoured 3 dishes. Wh-When did she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cW-which one should I take?\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena was overwhelmed and confused.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell just wait Elena, I\u2019ll order something for you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-okay.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, could we get you to make this girl some sushi without wasabi?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSure thing!\u300d</p><br/><p> At that moment, my little sister was using her chopsticks to bring her fifth dish of sea urchin battleship sushi up to her mouth. Th-that\u2019s the most expensive dish in this shop! Because you know I\u2019m paying, you\u2019re ordering all the most expensive things in the shop! Some day I\u2019m gonna put a \u3010Slave Collar\u3011 on you!</p><br/><p> Hm? Chopsticks?</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that reminds me! Elena, do you know how to use\u3010Chopsticks\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Chopsticks\u3011? I don\u2019t know.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen I\u2019ll ask.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Aya, what do you mean by ask?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me~! Please give this girl a knife and fork.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot! There\u2019s no way a sushi shop would have knives and forks!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe do!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c Eh? \u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe do have knives and forks.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-thanks!\u300d</p><br/><p> A sushi shop also has knives and forks\u2013</p><br/><p> I didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\uff1c\u203b Honestly, I don\u2019t actually know if they do or not.\uff1e</p><br/><p> After a while, Elena\u2019s sushi that I left to them to make came out together with a knife and fork.</p><br/><p> Wow!</p><br/><p> They went out of their way to make small bite-sized sushi to eat it easily with a knife and fork.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing! It\u2019s so small and cute, it\u2019s very beautiful. So much that I would want to look at it forever.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena was very excited by her specially-made sushi.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome on, since they went out of their way to make it just for you, you should stop saying such things and eat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay!\u300d</p><br/><p> The size of the sushi fit exactly on the fork. Elena smoothly picked it up with her knife and fork, bringing it to her cute mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cIy\u2019s derifious!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Seeing Elena eating her mini sushi with great joy, me and Aya felt a warm and fluffy feeling, but\u2026\u2026 before I knew it, the shop\u2019s cooks, all of them had a warm smile as they looked at Elena eating.</p><br/><p> At first I wondered how it would turn out, but it seems it was the right choice to bring her here. As for my little sister\u2019s selfishness, I might listen to her once in a while~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

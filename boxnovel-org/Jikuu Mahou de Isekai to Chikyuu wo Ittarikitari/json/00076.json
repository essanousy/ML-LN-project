This much is completely fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m going to fetch Aya now, please wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I confirmed Aya\u2019s location, the distance she covered was about 1 day by carriage. As expected of Aya.</p><br/><p>When I looked at the video, Aya was clad in wind and rushed through with break neck speed.</p><br/><p>\u300cTeleportation!\u300d</p><br/><p>As I appeared next to Aya, she suddenly halted her advance. She turned around this way and lowered herself into a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s me!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat, it\u2019s just onii-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow was it? Was there any monster appeared?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere were some who appeared but I ignored them and kept running.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou didn\u2019t defeat them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if I defeat them, I\u2019m not onii-chan so I can\u2019t carry them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCome to think of it, you\u2019re right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve returned to the room at the inn with Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, welcome back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m back, Elena-chan. Onii-chan didn\u2019t do anything strange to you, did he?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama slept through the day.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhaaat! Worthless.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease don\u2019t say such stupid things. Since I\u2019m going to run now, you two behave yourselves.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKay~\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>I left the two people and arrived at the location where Aya had reached a little while ago using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, let\u2019s run.\u300d</p><br/><p>I started running with\u3010Movement speed reinforcement\u3011and\u3010Quick\u3011.</p><br/><p>The wind feels so good. The scenery of the forest from the left and right passed and vanished behind me. I didn\u2019t get tired no matter how much I run.</p><br/><p>The only problem is that it\u2019s hard to run because of the uneven ground. Can I somehow take care of this with magic?</p><br/><p>I tried to generate a carpet of ice just slightly ahead of my feet. If only I have Earth magic, I could probably level the ground but the only magic I can use right now to make a flat foothold is Ice magic.</p><br/><p>With the my running momentum, I get on the carpet of ice. I quickly slid aboard the ice and stopped just by sliding a little. If I\u2019m wearing ice skates, I could probably go a little further. But, it was slippery so I couldn\u2019t move from there. </p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, I break away from the carpet of Ice using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, there\u2019s\u3010Teleportation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>Though it\u2019s too late, I tried to advance using\u3010Teleportation\u3011to where I could see ahead.</p><br/><p>The result was no good.</p><br/><p>The\u300eThe transfer scope for visible area\u300fthat I could teleport to is at most 500 m. When transferring to long distances, I couldn\u2019t use\u3010Teleportation\u3011continuously. I could teleport about 10 m in succession but when I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011while running, my running momentum after the teleport will be gone.</p><br/><p>If I use 10 m\u3010Teleportation\u3011continuously, it would be quicker if I run.</p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, I continued to run using only\u3010Movement speed reinforcement\u3011and\u3010Quick\u3011.</p><br/><p>I also need\u3010Wind magic\u3011as expected, when running this way, the wind resistance can\u2019t be ignored. When there\u2019s an obstacle that suddenly appeared in the middle of the road, I could correct my trajectory using wind gust and avoid it. </p><br/><p>Speaking of which, I could pass through the enemy\u2019s body using\u3010Lightning flash\u3011. If it\u2019s a trifling obstacle, can I use it to pass through? I decided to try.</p><br/><p>While running for a while, a tree fell down on the road.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow!\u3010Lightning flash\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Lightning flash\u3011, my body turned into lightning and passed through the fallen tree.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it! Success!\u300d</p><br/><p>N? Wait a sec? Can I run faster if I use\u3010Lightning flash\u3011continuously?</p><br/><p>I gave it a try.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s really faster.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat was the trial and error until now for!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I kept on running using\u3010Lightning flash\u3011continuously. Faster faster! Without wind resistance, I passed through the obstacle in straight line. </p><br/><p>When I got carried away and intensely used\u3010Lightning flash\u3011to advance, I suddenly felt tired.</p><br/><p>I stopped using\u3010Lightning flash\u3011and tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on myself, my MP almost hit the bottom.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, it\u2019s my first time seeing my MP decreased to this extent.\u300d</p><br/><p>While running normally, I took out a Japanese sweet from the inventory and gobbled it. The Japanese sweets recover a huge amount of MP as expected, my MP recovers rapidly. The recovery amount of sugar candy in particular is absurd.</p><br/><p>I kept eating Japanese sweets since a little while ago but my stomach didn\u2019t feel full no matter how much I ate. Why!? Perhaps, it was usurp from the stomach when I\u2019m recovering MP.</p><br/><p>While eating Japanese sweets and running using lighting flash,\u300eCaution\u300fsuddenly appeared on the map. Besides, their number is huge! They far exceeded 100.</p><br/><p>I timidly approached and tried to check the situation. Inside the human village, a horde of goblins are gathered.</p><br/><p>It seems that the goblins somehow took over the Scab village. Wasn\u2019t it destroyed by the demon lord\u2019s army!?</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1It says ohayo, not sure, I thought it was afternoon?\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

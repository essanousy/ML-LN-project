Your imouto!?\u300f</p><br/><p>During this and that, Bunmi-san and Aya\u2019s fight against the Goblin King had begun.</p><br/><p>In order to not get in the way of their King\u2019s battle, the goblin minions had also taken a distance.</p><br/><p>On the outer part, the human-demon soldiers and the adventurers intercept the goblin minions.</p><br/><p>On the inner part, the tandem of Bunmi-san and Aya are fighting against the Goblin King.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the Demon Lord\u2019s opening, I\u3010Teleported\u3011near Aya.</p><br/><p>I put\u3010Slow\u3011magic on the Goblin King and\u3010Quick\u3011magic on Aya,</p><br/><p>and quickly returned to my original position where the Demon lord-sama is.</p><br/><p>During which, approximately 2 seconds passed.</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, it seemed the Demon lord-sama didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>Under the effect of slow, the Goblin King became slightly slower. It vigorously swung its enormous club the size of a road roller in its right hand downward!</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san blocked it with a shield.</p><br/><p>Along with a big *thud*, it formed a crater under the feet of Bunmi-san.</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san grimaced and got down on one knee.</p><br/><p>That was closee! Close to death!</p><br/><p>During that interval, Aya snuck around behind the King\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Not that attack again!</p><br/><p>After Aya snuck around behind the King\u2019s back, she tried to attack its vital spot\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>With the excessive difference in physique, her hand couldn\u2019t reach the vital spot\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>*Pyon Pyon* Even when Aya jumped up and down, she still couldn\u2019t reach it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And at the same time, the magician unit\u2019s magic attacks had exploded on the King\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>But, the magic attacks did almost no damage as well, only blocking its vision for a moment.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, the King\u2019s face distorted in pain.</p><br/><p>Huge lumps of ice pierced the King\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>That ice was probably Elena\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>The King slightly staggered in pain.</p><br/><p>And, on the back of the staggered leg\u2019s knee\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Aya\u2019s knife was pierced.</p><br/><p>The King noticed Aya, who was at its feet, and flung up a hind foot, trying to attack her.</p><br/><p>Aya quickly dodged the attack.</p><br/><p>The King desperately stomped its foot repeatedly to trample Aya underfoot.</p><br/><p>When the King was distracted by Aya\u2015</p><br/><p>This time, Elena rushed out.</p><br/><p>Rondo was stunned by Elena\u2019s sudden movement.</p><br/><p>Elena rushed over to Bunmi-san, healing his wounds quickly with recovery magic. She turned on her heels and returned to where the magician unit is.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, that chivalrous female has excellent movements.</p><br/><p>Is that how the humans fight?</p><br/><p>But, are women stronger amongst the humans?</p><br/><p>The ones who have been fighting are only women.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s not true.\u300f</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Bunmi and the women\u2019s cooperation became fierce.</p><br/><p>(Rondo\u2019s atmosphere\u2026\u2026)</p><br/><p>The Goblin King\u2019s physical strength was gradually being diminished.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf we leave it to Bunmi as is, they might be able to win, mightn\u2019t they?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300ePerhaps.\u300f</p><br/><p>While having such talk with the Demon lord\u2015</p><br/><p>The Goblin King lost its temper from being played around.</p><br/><p>It started to stomp its feet in frustration.</p><br/><p>As one would expect with the Goblin King\u2019s physique, even stomping its feet in frustration,</p><br/><p>it shook the ground like an earthquake. Everyone, who was fighting in the frontline, lost their balance.</p><br/><p>*Evil grin*</p><br/><p>Having witnessed it, the Goblin King broke into a faint smile.</p><br/><p>The Goblin King brandished its enormous club and began to put power into it.</p><br/><p>At the same time, my\u3010Vigilance\u3011went off, informing me of the\u300eDanger\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300eBunmi-san! Watch out! Dodge it!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san, who was going to block the attack, heard my shout and immediately dodged the club which the Goblin King swung downward.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s as though a local earthquake had occurred.</p><br/><p>Although Bunmi-san avoided the full-force of the downward swing attack of the Goblin King,</p><br/><p>it crashed into the ground, causing an earthquake to occur.</p><br/><p>Even the humans and demonkind, and goblin minions who were battling from afar couldn\u2019t withstand the tremor. They stopped fighting and sat down on the spot.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Cassandra-san the Nekomimi magician, lost her balance by the sudden tremor and fell down.</p><br/><p>My\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic went off, informing of\u300eDanger\u300fonce again.</p><br/><p>I promptly moved toward Cassandra-san using\u3010Teleportation\u3011but\u2015</p><br/><p>In the next moment, in front of Cassandra-san and I, was a huge rock approaching.</p><br/><p>The Goblin King\u2015</p><br/><p>hurled the huge rock at its feet, aiming at Cassandra-san who fell over.</p><br/><p>Mou, there\u2019s not enough time!</p><br/><p>I set up a barrier at once and took a defensive stance with the Mithril sword in hand.</p><br/><p>But, the rock didn\u2019t reach the barrier.</p><br/><p>In front of the barrier, Bunmi-san blocked the huge rock\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>and together with huge rock he blocked, he tumbled down right there and then.</p><br/><p>Bunmi-san\u2019s both arms fell senseless at the impact when he blocked the huge rock, bending in a strange direction.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena! Come here!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>I stood before the Goblin King, blocking its way to protect Elena, who was treating Bunmi-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eYare yare, didn\u2019t I say it\u2019s not necessary to interfere that much?</p><br/><p>Oh, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u300f</p><br/><p>When I turned towards the side\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eDemon lord-sama\u300fwas walking toward the Goblin King\u2015</p><br/><p>holding a pitch-black\u300eJapanese sword\u300f.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

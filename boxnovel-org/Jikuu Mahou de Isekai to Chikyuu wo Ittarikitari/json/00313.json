Welcome.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya heard our conversation and came out of her room.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, well then, try using the magic stone very carefully.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena focused her mind and poured Magic Power into the magic stone.</p><br/><p>The magic stone worked without a problem and Elena acquired the level 5 Japanese language.</p><br/><p>When I tried to appraise her, the MP consumption was 2, 000.</p><br/><p>The MP consumption has become twice of the amount when I used it.</p><br/><p>Is this because the level of Elena\u2019s Information Magic is low?</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it, Elena? Aren\u2019t there any changes?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, Seiji-sama, what kind of magic stone is this in particular?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, I forgot to tell you what kind of magic stone it is! This is a [Language Acquisition Magic Stone]. Aptly named, the level of your Japanese should\u2019ve become 5.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena opened the books about science and the like that she has always been studying and started reading them.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I can also read the complicated kanji characters smoothly!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see! It\u2019s a success. Well then, what about writing the characters?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll give it a try.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena took out a notebook and started writing.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see\u2026\u2026 about that, I can write the characters very skillfully!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, somehow, it reached the point where you can tell what character is which!\u300d</p><br/><p>There was also an ability to write characters skillfully in Language Acquisition, huh!</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t know that.</p><br/><p>Hm? Wait.</p><br/><p>I also wrote characters on the notebook as a test.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-chan, was your handwriting this good before?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it became good just now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat do you mean?\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems that the previous level of my Japanese didn\u2019t reach level 5.</p><br/><p>Even though I\u2019m a Japanese\u2026\u2026 oh well, it can\u2019t be help since it\u2019s a complicated language!</p><br/><p>When I explained it to Aya,</p><br/><p>\u300cMe, too!!\u300d</p><br/><p>and then, she selfishly snatched the magic stone from Elena and poured magic power into it.</p><br/><p>\u300cUgh, my head\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the overuse of magic power.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I tried appraising her, Aya\u2019s MP had been decreased by around 1, 700.</p><br/><p>Since the level of Aya\u2019s Information Magic was level 2, it seemed that the MP consumption adjusted according to the skill\u2019s level, becoming lesser than when Elena used it.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, I had Hilda use it, too and the four of us succeeded in raising the level of our Japanese to level 5.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, onii-chan. Make a Language Acquisition Magic Stone for English, too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGo study!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That~.\u300d</p><br/><p>1.

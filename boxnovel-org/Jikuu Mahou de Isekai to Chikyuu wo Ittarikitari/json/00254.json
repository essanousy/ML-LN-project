Sunrise\u2019s aquarium</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>On that day, I took out all of Aya, Elena, and Hilda\u2019s belongings from my inventory</p><br/><p>and they stored it into their respective\u3010Storage Bracelet\u3011.</p><br/><p>Aya who got caught up in the moment stored away the things inside her room and had it emptied.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>The next day, after eating breakfast and dressing up neatly and orderly,</p><br/><p>we went to Ikebu town\u2019s\u300etower of sunrise\u300f.</p><br/><p>The destination point where I moved using teleportation</p><br/><p>was the\u300etower of sunrise\u300f\u2019s surface\u2019s fourth floor.</p><br/><p>It was the place where we were flower viewing before and got attacked by bees,</p><br/><p>but there wasn\u2019t any bees this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it\u2019s the flower viewing spot.</p><br/><p> It sure is nice when we can continue from where we left off, don\u2019t you think?\u300d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>While it may be true that we don\u2019t need to carry our baggage anymore,</p><br/><p>for onii-chan to be useful like this, don\u2019t say such things like\u300eI don\u2019t need it\u300f, okay?</p><br/><p>\u300cCan we climb up to the top by the end of day?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s indeed impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya underestimated it too much.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, since it\u2019s for Yurie-san,</p><br/><p>we have to do our best~.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s look for the stairs while looking at the map\u2015</p><br/><p>As I thought of that , the map to the stairs is displayed!!?</p><br/><p>How come?</p><br/><p>After checking the map further, the fifth floor is also displayed to some extent.</p><br/><p>Did someone with a beacon climb up?</p><br/><p>When I checked the tracking beacons\u2015</p><br/><p>in order for me to check up on the situation of the Ikebu town during the surprise attack of the devil-kin last week, I put a tracking beacon on an adventurer who was at that place.</p><br/><p>That adventurer seems to be clearing the\u300etower of sunrise\u300f.</p><br/><p>That person was exploring the fifth floor right now.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt looks like the stairs toward the fifth floor is over there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to the fifth floor without encountering any monsters.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the hell is this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>In the fifth floor, the atmosphere completely changed into something maze-like.</p><br/><p>However, what one should pay attention to is the\u300ewall\u300f!</p><br/><p>The wall\u2019s whole surface is\u300ewater\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt looks like an aquarium.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Aya said,</p><br/><p>both sides are filled with water like a water tank,</p><br/><p>and there are also small fishes swimming.</p><br/><p>However\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, this, there\u2019s no glass!\u300d</p><br/><p>The hand of Aya, who tried to touch the water tank, entered deeply into the water with *zubo*.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is this water not falling even though there\u2019s no glass??\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is thrusting her hand into the water with\u300ebacha bacha\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no way to explain it, but\u2026the power of magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>We advanced through the aquarium maze.</p><br/><p>\u300cSomething\u2019s coming.\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a reaction on the map and I promptly exclaim so.</p><br/><p>Everyone takes a fighting stance\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>but the enemy\u2019s figure is nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Where is it?</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, in the wall!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I saw the one Elena pointed at,</p><br/><p>in the wall\u2019s water\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>a catfish was swimming.</p><br/><p>Then, from the wall\u2019s water,</p><br/><p>the catfish jumped out with *pyon* and blocked our way ahead.</p><br/><p>It comes out of the water!?</p><br/><p>\u300cA catfish!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A dot on the map indicates this catfish.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably a monster.</p><br/><p>The catfish, which is floating a little above the floor, is swimming in the air.</p><br/><p>When we waited for the catfish\u2019s move\u2015</p><br/><p>the catfish abruptly launched a\u300emud\u300fat us.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, dirty.\u300d</p><br/><p>All four of us dodged the mud.</p><br/><p>And then, the catfish charged in at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u300cTeya!\u300d</p><br/><p>The catfish was stabbed at the back of its head by Aya\u2019s knife.</p><br/><p>\u300cWeak!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s only the fifth floor</p><br/><p> and we also became strong.\u300d</p><br/><p>The catfish didn\u2019t particularly drop any magic stones.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When we advanced for awhile, this time\u2015</p><br/><p>a\u300eslime\u300fjumped out from the wall\u2019s water.</p><br/><p>The slime, which seemed to be weaker than the one in the underground,</p><br/><p>threatened us while jiggling.</p><br/><p>However-!</p><br/><p>With Elena\u2019s Ice magic, it had been frozen and couldn\u2019t move anymore.</p><br/><p>A\u3010Water reinforcement magic stone\u3011was taken from the slime.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena.</p><br/><p> If a slime appears next time, let me defeat it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the sword of trial!</p><br/><p> Understood.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>While looking for the stairs,</p><br/><p>I gave priority in killing the slimes and undiscovered monsters nearby.</p><br/><p>The monsters I was able to defeat were</p><br/><p>slimes x 2 and big catfish x 5.</p><br/><p>The white belt sword of trial had also made progress</p><br/><p>\u30fbWater attribute monster subjugation 2 / 10</p><br/><p>\u30fbEarth attribute monster subjugation 5 / 10</p><br/><p>and the result was such.</p><br/><p>By the way, the\u300eBig catfish\u300fwas a monster one size bigger than the catfish we encountered at the beginning, but it wasn\u2019t that much strong as well.</p><br/><p>And then, we discovered the stairs toward the sixth floor.</p><br/><p>In the end, we didn\u2019t encounter the adventurer who wore a beacon.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>The sixth floor, with water as far as the eye could see,</p><br/><p>seemed as if on the sea.</p><br/><p>The blue sky above and the water continued all the way up to the point where the horizon could be seen, but this must be an illusion~</p><br/><p>A foothold made with logs is floating on the water</p><br/><p>and it seemed to have become like a maze.</p><br/><p>Are we supposed to advance through this foothold maze?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems like we\u2019ll drown if we fall down.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya is carefree, huh.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ll get attacked by the monsters underwater if you fall down.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>When we were advancing for a while, a red dot on the map was approaching.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, over there!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I saw the one Aya pointed at\u2015</p><br/><p>a black, triangular\u300efin\u300fwas approaching with great momentum.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is!?\u300d</p><br/><p>That fellow jumped out from the surface of the water and attacked before we could take a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a shark!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Sharp teeth were lined up in a row in its gaping mouth.</p><br/><p>When I blocked the shark teeth with the white belt sword, it made a *gachin* sound.</p><br/><p>\u300cUriya!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I swung the white belt sword sideways,</p><br/><p>the shark was blown off to the side</p><br/><p>and fell into the water with *bashan*.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will take it out from the water.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Elena said so, a water column rose from the water\u2019s surface</p><br/><p>and the shark was thrown into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u300cTeyaa.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda launched a flame this time,</p><br/><p>covering the shark with fire.</p><br/><p>The shark which was covered with fire fell onto the log foothold with\u300ebitan\u300f</p><br/><p>and writhed with *bichi bichi*.</p><br/><p>\u300cTake the finishing blow!\u300d</p><br/><p>I used\u3010teleportation\u3011on top of the shark and dealt the finishing blow, stabbing the\u3010White belt sword\u3011in the crown of its head.</p><br/><p>As for the\u3010Sharkfin\u3011,</p><br/><p>how should I cook it?</p><br/><p>Here\u2019s the linkbucks\u2019 link. Thanks~!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

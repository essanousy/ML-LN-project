Why am I\u2026 who are you people?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, please don\u2019t get up yet. The magic has only eased the illness, it hasn\u2019t been cured yet.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you perhaps magicians? I am really sorry, but we do not have the money to pay you\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry about it, since it was Elena\u2019s and my own whim. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m really sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p> Sister-san kept on apologising.</p><br/><p>\u300cAria, I bought this bread, eat it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you, Miinya.\u300d</p><br/><p> The Sister name is seems to be \u300eAria\u300f and the cat-eared girl seems to be called \u300eMiinya\u300f.</p><br/><p> Aria-san tried to eat the bread Miinya brought, but ended up violently coughing after biting on the bread.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out a small plastic bottle of mineral water from my Inventory, opened the cap and had Aria-san drink it.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much. Huh? This bottle is very light.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it\u2019s something from my hometown.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAria, sorry. Was the bread too hard?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry. My throat stills hurts a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems like since Aria-san\u2019s throat still hurts, she\u2019s unable to eat the hard bread.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment. I\u2019ll go make something more suitable. Where\u2019s the kitchen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOji-san can cook?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, hey! I\u2019m at a sensitive age, so please don\u2019t call me \u300eOji-san\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Onii-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell that\u2019s fine. Something like soup should be fine if her throat still hurts. Miinya right? Could you show me to the kitchen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen I\u2019ll go cook something for a bit, please look after Aria-san, Elena. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> Guided by Miinya, I arrived at the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere it is. So what are you making?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s see~\u300d</p><br/><p> Looking around the kitchen, there didn\u2019t seem to be any food stocked up. Well, to get to point where she had to steal to buy bread, they probably had a hard time.</p><br/><p> I checked the inside of my Inventory for any ingredient that can be used to make soup.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s go with \u3010Turnip\u3011 soup\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTurnip?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s delicious~\u300d</p><br/><p> Since \u3010Turnip\u3011 was on sale at the supermarket, I went ahead and bought it. Since I also put all my cooking utensils in my Inventory, everything I needed was here.</p><br/><p> Taking out the turnip, consomm\u00e9, bacon, salt, pepper, vegetable oil, pan, chopping board and knife from my Inventory, I arranged them on the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this \u300eTurnip\u300f\uff1fThis is my first time seeing it.\u300d</p><br/><p> Minya didn\u2019t know about it, is there no \u3010Turnip\u3011 in this world\uff1f</p><br/><p> Checking the stove, it seems you have to ignite the firewood. I took out a lighter from my Inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that~?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis? This is called a lighter, it\u2019s a tool to ignite a fire.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA magic tool?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic tool? I guess you could call it that.\u300d</p><br/><p> Are there tools that use magic in this world too?</p><br/><p> I ignited a twig with the lighter and the flame spread to the firewood.</p><br/><p> First I chop up the turnip and bacon, then fry the bacon on the pan with oil. Once the fire reaches a certain heat, I pour some water on the bacon, then toss in the consomm\u00e9 soup and turnip. While letting it simmer, the turnip turned tender and mixed in. Putting in some salt and pepper seasoning, it\u2019s finished. Because it\u2019s for an ill person, I kept the seasoning a bit thin.</p><br/><p> Carrying the pan to Aria-san\u2019s room, I placed a soup bowl on the table and poured in the soup which spread a nice consomm\u00e9 aroma around the room. The soup bowl is a wooden bowl that matched the church.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, such an appetising aroma!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you think you can get up?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I lent my shoulder to Aria-san and escorted her to the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat an appetising aroma! To show such kindness to us, I don\u2019t know how to thank you enough\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can leave that for later, eat it before it gets cold.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aria-san scooped the soup into her her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow delicious!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aria-san started to cry for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey now, there\u2019s nothing to cry about.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, this is just too delicious!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aria-san steadily ate the soup.</p><br/><p>Guu~</p><br/><p> When I thought I heard a noise, it was the sound of the children\u2019s stomachs.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you guys want some soup too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cCan we!?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s enough for everyone. Come on, go get your bowls.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYay!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The children lined up in front of me with their bowls. It felt like I was the lunch lady at the school cafeteria.</p><br/><p> I poured the soup into the children\u2019s bowls one by one.</p><br/><p> The children carefully brought their bowls to the table like it was valuable and began eating the soup.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cTasty~!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> My soup seems to be popular with the children.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, I noticed Elena was staring at me with sparkling eyes. Taking out the bowl I won from the Bread Festival from my Inventory, I poured the soup in it and put it on the table along with a spoon, calling Elena over.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, have some too Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much!\u300d</p><br/><p> I also took out another bowl and sat next to Elena to have the soup with everyone. Despite not going all out, it was actually pretty good.</p><br/><p> However, only having soup won\u2019t be enough to fill us up. Is there something else?</p><br/><p> Searching through my Inventory, I managed to find something good.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, how about trying some of this?\u300d</p><br/><p> I took out 2 loaves of sandwich breads with 8 slices each.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s bread.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSquare bread?\u300d</p><br/><p> I passed out 2 slices each to everyone. Since Aria-san couldn\u2019t eat the hard bread Miinya bought, the children got 1 slice each, me and Elena took half a slice each, 1 slice was left with Aria-san and the last slice was given to the 4 children to share.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis bread is super soft and delicious!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere, there. Eat it slowly now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cKaay!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> Everyone seemed to enjoy the appetising meal. Everyone ate all their soup and bread.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much, it was delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cDelicious~\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was really delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aria-san, the children and Elena seemed to be satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u300cAria-san, try drinking this after eating.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s called \u3010Medicine\u3011. While Elena\u2019s magic has eased your illness, it would be a good idea to drink this just in case.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, it\u2019s just cold medicine, but it would still be better to drink it than not.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

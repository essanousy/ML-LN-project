Then, please stop if it seems dangerous.\u300d</p><br/><p> As Kiseki-san said so, he set a new\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011up.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, here it goes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I hold out my hand to the\u3010Magic stone replication tool\u3011and started to pour magic power\u2015</p><br/><p> after feeling that a considerable amount of magic power had been consumed, the\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011has been completed.</p><br/><p> My MP has been decreased for about 1, 000 points?</p><br/><p> Kiseki-san shouldn't have that much MP.</p><br/><p> What does it mean?</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, are you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, there's no problem in particular.\u300d</p><br/><p> Though I think it's impossible for an average person to have 1, 000 MP......</p><br/><p> is the consumption differ from person to person?</p><br/><p> However, the\u3010magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011that I've made,</p><br/><p> somehow feels different from the original.</p><br/><p> When I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011, it wasn't a\u3010magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011.</p><br/><p> It was a\u3010magic stone of temporary language acquisition +2\u3011!</p><br/><p> What's a\u300e+2\u300f!?</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition +2\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbWhen one hold it in one's hand,</p><br/><p>\u2502 it enabled him to speak the language of the location.</p><br/><p>\u2502 Reading and writing has now become possible.</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbIn addition, when magic power has been poured into it,</p><br/><p>\u2502 up to level 2 of the location's language</p><br/><p>\u2502 can be acquired.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> It resulted in reading and writing of the characters to become possible,</p><br/><p> furthermore, it can do so far as acquisition!</p><br/><p> It's very convenient.....</p><br/><p> How did this happen!?</p><br/><p>\u300cTo say that it can't be appraised with\u3010magic stone of appraisal\u3011......</p><br/><p> no way, is this\u300e+2\u300f!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems so but is there such a thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cImpossible!</p><br/><p> If it were magic stones of Wind, Water, Earth and the like, I've heard that there were times that it become\u300e+1\u300fwhen the user of that attribute was the one doing the replicating but......</p><br/><p> \u3010Magic stone of temporary language\u3011weren't under the category with those, to say nothing of\u300e+2\u300f!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Ah, I've understood what happened.</p><br/><p> It's because the level of my\u3010information magic\u3011 is level 5!</p><br/><p> However, if it can be replicated so easily, I should've used the\u3010Magic stone replication tool\u3011I've got before sooner.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Kiseki-san,</p><br/><p> may I also try to replicate the\u3010magic stone of appraisal\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt the replication process of this\u3010Magic stone of appraisal\u3011, it consumes almost the same amount of magic power as that of\u3010Magic stone of temporary language acquisition\u3011, is it alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's fine, leave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p> After replicating the\u3010magic stone of appraisal\u3011triumphantly,</p><br/><p> I felt that my MP had been decreased

a person's information can also be appraised, huh.</p><br/><p> I wonder if the Rarity doesn't depend on the quality?</p><br/><p>\u300cI have a favor to ask, Kiseki-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes,

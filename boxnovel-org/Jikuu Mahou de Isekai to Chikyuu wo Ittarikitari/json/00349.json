Okay, no one can catch it with their eyes.</p><p class=\"fDWoLanxklFTYqrGWCtz\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bLercLnEeNKWlodUNUiw\">Because no one of the judges could see it clearly, it was decided to confirm it with \"video judgment\". It seems to be a recently introduced system.</p><p class=\"NZHbcCPWKlBlTMtzFwBo\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"uiShCsMZTaExKxwRodai\">As a result of the video judgment, it was confirmed that Aya's attack was barely caught in one scene and Aya's victory was confirmed.</p><p class=\"ojRMFIaJJjPGmGCkJlcJ\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"jKIPnTyyWiqlZJUBTJMP\">----------</p><p class=\"CSGmMigvVVZhRqFwbqxR\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ECYUivWzTOXzglgljlDN\">Mai-san who was full of spirits appeared in Heavyweight class.</p><p class=\"sLoERANcdBZALneecTbm\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"TWmharjUtvKWuxXpBsER\">Sure enough, the venue started becoming agitated.</p><p class=\"dTEARTckyTgLMTjwYIaz\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"xKaqUwoDxNlVKgZgERUa\">One of the audiences said, \"Child abuse!\" There was a scene that needed the staff to come out.</p><p class=\"uCoBBugtognawPdSRBGS\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ALZpOSgpyZCpDCHNLQiA\">To clear up the confusion, an unusual broadcast was made in the venue.</p><p class=\"cSvFAjqqrQToHxBrxlnh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"VqMsRdPdqXBaBnwpdLEw\">\"Japan's Mai Kawai who fights next is officially confirmed to be 19 years old.

You devils! Surrender obediently~.</p><br/><p>Aya called out to the Devils from behind.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a [hornless] female2! The [hornless] female is speaking our language!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Devils, who were traveling northwards, stopped and turned around, wondering what it was.</p><br/><p>By the way, the [hornless] that the Devils are referring to is the Human race.</p><br/><p>\u300cI was wondering what it was, turns out to be four hornless female. For them to be speaking our language despite being [hornless], they\u2019re audacious. Let\u2019s use this opportunity to catch these fellows, too, and turn them into slaves.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOhh!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>When the most-important-looking guy gave the order, instead of being vigilant, the Devils approached Aya and the others nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if you bring along such a [kid], she\u2019s very unlikely to be of any help.\u300d</p><br/><p>Ah, if you call that person a [kid] or something like that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWho\u2019s a kid!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Mai-san, who had been called a [kid], struck that devil with all her might and the struck devil was blown away, slamming into a slightly far-off, large tree and fainted.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy gawd! T-, This fellow is strong!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Devils took three steps backwards and took a vigilant stance.</p><br/><p>I mean, they underestimated them too much.</p><br/><p>There are probably some people, too, who are wondering how Aya and the others can speak the Devil language.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because I made a [Language Acquisition Magic Stone] from which a level 2 [Devil Language] can be acquired and had everyone to acquire it.</p><br/><p>And then, as for me\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Turning myself invisible, I lurk.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m a ninja!</p><br/><p>\u300cYou heinous Devils! You were frightened by this pretty Aya-sama, huh! You cowards!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRiled up, hornless female, you get cocky when I let you say whatever you want, huh!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, the Devils has fallen into the provocation.</p><br/><p>With this chance, I\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYou cowardly Devils! You there, if you\u2019re scared, get lost!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShit, since things turn out like this, use those hornless slaves as a shield!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It\u2019s not good!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat happened!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe hornless slaves\u2026are gone!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What!!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, I rescued them while those fellows had their guards up against only Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, I rescued them so that\u2019s enough.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger~.\u300d</p><br/><p>I hid the people I\u2019ve rescued in the forest and joined Aya and the others.</p><br/><p>\u300cCrap, a hornless male3 has appeared! That fellow looks strong, he\u2019s dressed in head-to-toe black.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m certainly the strongest among us here~, but is their standard of whether one looks strong or not whether one is black or not?4</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t understand the Devil race\u2019s commonsense.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys, don\u2019t get scared! Attack that fellow with an all-out attack!\u300d</p><br/><p>When the leader-like guy ordered so, the devils attacked simultaneously.</p><br/><p>30 seconds later\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>All the 20 or so Devils except for the leader were beaten by us and were knocked out.</p><br/><p>\u300cHii! You monsters5!\u300d</p><br/><p>The Devil leader escaped at full speed.</p><br/><p>\u300cAhh, he escaped~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine since I\u2019ve quickly put a [Tracking Beacon] on him.\u300d</p><br/><p>With this, we will be able to find the Devil race\u2019s town in a while\u2026supposedly.</p><br/><p>That fellow must\u2019ve gotten exhausted while running away, right?</p><br/><p>Now, what should we do about the beaten Devils and the rescued hostages~?</p><br/><p>At first, the rescued hostages had soulless-looking eyes and didn\u2019t talk at all, but when we took the [Slave\u2019s Collar] off with [Curse-removing medicine], they immediately became energetic and began to talk.</p><br/><p>Since all of them seem to be from Shinju town, I escorted them to Shinju town.</p><br/><p>While I\u2019m at it, I should hand over the Devils to Lella.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>\u300cLella, sorry to bother you this late at night.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSe-, Seiji! What\u2019s the matter? At such an hour, perhaps, to me\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLella, what are you going to do to onii-chan?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya shows up from behind me.</p><br/><p>\u300cEck! Aya, so you\u2019re here, too, huh!\u300d</p><br/><p>Good grief, no matter how much time passes, Lella and Aya just won\u2019t get along with each other, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe caught Devils today, so we came here to hand them over to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDevils\u2026you say! They\u2019ve been quiet these days!\u300d</p><br/><p>I explained the situation to Lella.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I will also let the other towns know, but Seiji, do you really plan to attack the Devil race\u2019s town with only you guys?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to attack, but the possibility for us to end up doing so is high.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I answered so, Lella had been lost in her thoughts.</p><br/><p>And then,</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, when you attack the Devil race\u2019s town\u2026\u2026I\u2019m coming, too!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? Lella, what are you saying? You\u2019re entrusted to be the feudal lord of Shinju town, right? What about going to the front line?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-, But\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Even though she was afraid and trembling during the war against the Goblin Prince\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lella has grown up, too, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, let\u2019s talk about it after the Devil race\u2019s town is found.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>We entrusted the Devils that we caught to Lella and returned to Japan.</p><br/><p>1. She\u2019s imitating how Satania from Gabriel dropout introduce herself.</p><br/><p>2. commonly used for animals to mean female.</p><br/><p>3. commonly used for animals to mean male.</p><br/><p>4.

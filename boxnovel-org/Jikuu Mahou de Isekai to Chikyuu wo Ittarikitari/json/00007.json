There wasn\u2019t anything wrong a while ago, but then I looked away for a little and this happened!</p><br/><p> I put on my denim jacket and jean for a little protection then rushed to the foyer to put on my sneakers. Prepared, I immediately used \u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cSob sob\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, Princess.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena curled in the corner of the prison room crying. Hearing my voice, she turned around in disbelief. Her eyes were overflowing with tears that ran down her cheers.</p><br/><p>\u300cH-Hero!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Seiji, remember?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes! Seiji-sama! Didn\u2019t you go home?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI did go home, but I came back because I felt you were in trouble.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena suddenly ran up and hugged me.</p><br/><p> I wanted to hug Elena back, but that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea so I held back.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, how did this happen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2026\u2026 O-Otou-sama\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena tried her best to tell me, however she couldn\u2019t put together her words past her tears.</p><br/><p> I clutched my right hand and held it out in front of Elena. I then opened my palm while retrieving a\u3010Handkerchief\u3011 from Inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is the best I can do right now.\u300f I told myself and give the handkerchief to Elena. By the way, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to do a magic trick here.</p><br/><p>\u300cTh-thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p> Wiping her tears with my handkerchief, Elena finally calmed down and smiled at me.</p><br/><p>\u300cHave you calmed down yet?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, thank you Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen could you tell me what happened?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. I went around and asked various people around the castle about the\u3010Demon Lord\u3011 but I was not able to learn anything new. When I gave up and returned to my room, Otou-sama came with many soldiers.\u300d</p><br/><p> So it was the king.</p><br/><p>\u300cI told Otou-sama that the matter of the destroyed village might not have been the work of the \u3010Demon Army\u3011. But then Otou-sama suddenly got angry, telling the soldiers to imprison me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that why you are being imprisoned?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> What a guy! This is supposed to be his daughter!</p><br/><p>\u300cThen Otou-sama said, until the war with the \u3010Demon Army\u3011 is over, I won\u2019t let you leave here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s awful\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know what I should do anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI know, let me kid-nap you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHave Seiji-sama kidnap me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYep, rescuing the captive princess is the a hero\u2019s duty!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut Otou-sama\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Oh, right! I\u2019ll leave behind a crime de-cla-ra-tion saying \u300eI kidnapped the Princess\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p> I pull out a notepad and a ball-point pen from my Inventory. As I tried to write the crime declaration, I stopped my hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that I think of it, I don\u2019t know the characters of this country.\u300d</p><br/><p>PIKON!</p><br/><p> A light bulb lit up above my head again!</p><br/><p> Come to think of it, I have \u3010Language Acquisition\u3011 from \u3010Information Magic\u3011. If I remember correctly, it was written in the description that the extent you acquire changes depending on MP consumed. By using a large amount MP, wouldn\u2019t I be able to write, too?</p><br/><p> I immediately tried to use \u3010Language Acquisition\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cLanguage Acquisition\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502You will acquire \u3010Delaidos Common Language\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502 Please select an acquisition level</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u2022 Level 1 (MP Cost: 50)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can converse with a few words</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u2022 Level 2 (MP Cost: 100)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can converse enough for an ordinary conversation.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u2022 Level 3 (MP Cost: 200)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can fluently converse.</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can read simple words.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u2022 Level 4 (MP Cost: 500)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can fluently converse.</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can read and write enough for ordinary use.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u2022 Level 5 (MP Cost: 1000)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can converse with any words.</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can read and write any word.</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> So it\u2019s a choice between level 4 and 5. Level 5 costs 1000 MP to use. Well, even if my MP decreased a little I would still have 2000 MP left. I guess I\u2019ll go with it.</p><br/><p> I consumed 1000 MP and acquired Level 5 \u3010Delaidos Common Language\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u250f\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><br/><p>\u2503Dear King</p><br/><p>\u2503</p><br/><p>\u2503 I have kidnapped Princess Elena</p><br/><p>\u2503 I cannot guarantee the life of anyone pursuing me</p><br/><p>\u2503 Of course, your life included</p><br/><p>\u2503 Well then, farewell</p><br/><p>\u2503</p><br/><p>\u2503 From Hero</p><br/><p>\u2517\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><br/><p> I write my crime declaration and tape it to the prison wall. Taking Princess Elena\u2019s hand, we escaped the prison using \u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

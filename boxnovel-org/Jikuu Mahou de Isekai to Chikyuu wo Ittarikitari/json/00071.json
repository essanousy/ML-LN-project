I-, Is this a magic that can see to distant places!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Azide-san is being protected by several adventurers but they\u2019re completely outnumbered and on the verge of losing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, Elena, we\u2019re going to help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, how are you going to go there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAria-san, please keep this as a secret after this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTeleportation!\u300d</p><br/><p>I brought Aya and Elena, and teleported to where Azide-san is.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwaa!\u300d</p><br/><p>When we arrived, the last of the adventurers received a wound and fell down.</p><br/><p>\u300cBarrier!\u300d</p><br/><p>I promptly set a barrier up between the thieves and the adventurers, it blocked the thieves\u2019 advance.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, please examine the adventurers\u2019 injuries. Aya, take care of the people in the right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I go around the left side of the barrier and confronted the thieves.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s still someone remaining!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The three people attacked at the same time but I attacked the three people\u2019s hands and knocked away their weapons. </p><br/><p>The thieves who saw that were stubborn and plunged in blindly without pausing.</p><br/><p>I looked towards Aya\u30fc</p><br/><p>Aya was near Elena for some reason, she took a fighting stance but didn\u2019t move. What are you doing Aya!?</p><br/><p>Finally, the thieves moved around the right-side of the barrier and surrounded Aya and Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cShit!\u300d</p><br/><p>I moved using\u3010Lightning flash\u3011and hurled myself at the back of one of the thieves\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u300cGuwa!\u300d</p><br/><p>My being which turned into lightning passed through the thief\u2019s body. The thief uttered a short scream and fainted from the electric shock.</p><br/><p>I cast electric shock on the thieves who were surprised when I suddenly appeared, neutralizing about half on the spot, the remaining thieves promptly took a distance.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, what happened!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, err\u2026 oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, are you trembling?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya looked strange. Well, no wonder since there are suddenly people killing each other. Actually, even I\u2019m more nervous than usual.</p><br/><p>But, there\u2019s no time to relax, I sensed\u3010Danger\u3011from the distance and when I looked over\u30fc</p><br/><p>a thief with a bow is aiming at here.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>I cast\u3010Lightning strike\u3011towards that person.</p><br/><p>It also affected the people around him and several thieves were charred and fell down.</p><br/><p>\u300cDangerous, escape!\u300d</p><br/><p>When the leader-like thief shouted, the thieves ran away at full speed.</p><br/><p>Approximately 20 thieves managed to ran away and the other 10 people died at the place.</p><br/><p>Despite being thieves, I had killed people. There was no time to go easy in a desperate situation. It\u2019s the same feeling when I first came to this world and cut off the hand of the aristocracy knight leader. Though I\u2019m not sure yet, back then, it had a feeling of a game.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena looked at my face worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the first time I had killed people. I\u2019m a bit shaken.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTruly!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I lowered my head and\u30fc</p><br/><p>Elena pulled my head into an embrace.</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, what on Earth\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>but when I heard Elena\u2019s heartbeat, I gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, I\u2019m fine now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>I freed myself from Elena\u2019s comfortable arms and went to Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, are you okay?\u300d\u300cAya-san, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019m sorry. I-, I couldn\u2019t move at all\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya bursts into tears in my chest.</p><br/><p>Like what Elena did to me a little while ago, I calmed Aya down.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, I\u2019m fine already.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya freed herself out of my chest and wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry oniichan, I couldn\u2019t move at the critical moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it can\u2019t be helped, even I got scared.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I pat Aya\u2019s head, Aya seemed frustrated by it.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san! Why are you here!? What happened to the thieves?\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, I\u2019ve completely forgotten about Azide-san.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Azide-san covered himself with cloth and hid inside the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u300cIyaa, Azide-san, what a coincidence. It seems the party we saved was unexpectedly Azide-san\u2019s.\u300d</p><br/><p>My little bit of acting became awkward.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about the other adventurers?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThey\u2019re all unconscious but we were able to treat their wounds somehow.\u300d</p><br/><p>With Elena\u2019s recovery magic, the 5 adventurers were completely healed and regain consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, Elena-san and Aya-san, we offer to you our sincere gratitude.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>We received an intense gratitude from Azide-san and the adventurers.</p><br/><p>All the thieves\u2019 corpses were buried by us and the adventurers at the place.There isn\u2019t any bounty for an underling thief, the bounty is on the boss\u2019 head, we have to literally bring the head and exchange it for gold.</p><br/><p>When we finished disposing the bodies, we traveled a little and set up a camp.</p><br/><p>But, it became awkward.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-san, did you have any equipment for sleeping?\u300d</p><br/><p>What should I do, I don\u2019t have such a thing!</p><br/><p>\u300cActually.~ We have taken the luggage of the thieves from a while ago\u30fc\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, please use my tent. I\u2018ll sleep on the carriage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for the trouble and thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re my benefactor, this is only natural.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hmm.. it\u2019s good to have an equipment for sleeping in the mean time.</p><br/><p>Thus, we decided to sleep in the tent. The adventurers seemed to be working as lookout.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, it\u2019s so narrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>Inside the narrow tent, we became like the character .</p><br/><p>I used Azide-san\u2019s piece of cloth as a futon, Elena is in my sleeping bag and Aya is wrapped in a blanket. </p><br/><p>And for some reason, I\u2019m located in the middle of the character , why am I always in the middle? It always somehow becomes this formation. Why is that?</p><br/><p>Elena was tired after using a lot of recovery magic. She immediately started snoring1.</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, are you awake?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEarlier, I\u2019m sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to fight properly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was sudden this time so it can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, when something like this happened again next time and I can\u2019t fight once again\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right.~ Though you were able to move during the fighting competition, I wonder why you couldn\u2019t move today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI got scared when I saw the thief\u2019s face.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen you struck iron wall Lela, weren\u2019t you fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThose people weren\u2019t something to be afraid of.\u300d</p><br/><p>We had various conversations but apparently, when Aya had hostility directed to her from a man, her body become stiff. After the incident in Shinjuku, it had become a trauma.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, there\u2019s a better way to fight with a man.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKick his crotch.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan you ecchi!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m serious with what I said!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve decided! I\u2019ll join the karate club and learn self-defense.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, that may be good.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya made up her mind, she finally calmed down and after awhile she began to snore.</p><br/><p>While listening to the snoring of Aya and Elena which like a stereo2, I finally went to sleep.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Seiji is ruining Elena\u2019s image.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2LOL.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

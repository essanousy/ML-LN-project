Rondo. I got it back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, then, where\u2019s the recovered food?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m carrying it using magic, where should I put it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic!? I see, I\u2019ll guide you to the food storage tent.\u300d</p><br/><p>Led by Rondo, we came over to a huge tent.</p><br/><p>Inside the tent, there was a heap of orc\u2019s meat.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s only an orc\u2019s meat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFor some reason, the orc\u2019s meat was not stolen. I understood then when I heard yesterday\u2019s story. If the orcs were the thieves, they won\u2019t steal orcs\u2019 the meat as one would expect.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, I see. Was that why inside the Slums\u2019 warehouse, there wasn\u2019t any orc\u2019s meat? Well, if you think about it, it was only natural.</p><br/><p>\u300cI think the food of other troops were also mixed in the recovered food, should I put them all here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will handle the ones for the other troops. So, it\u2019s fine to put all of them here.\u300d</p><br/><p>This man called Rondo didn\u2019t speak too much in the fighting competition, he might be a pretty excellent guy.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s leave all the necessary arrangements and contacting the other aristocrats to him.</p><br/><p>When I took the recovered food out of the inventory and stored them all in the tent, Rondo was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you get back so much food? But, it\u2019s an amazing magic. If you have this kind of magic, the campaign will become much easier. How about you become my subordinate, Seiji?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have my own work, please find someone else.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat work is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s to guard and assist Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can understand the guard part but help her to what?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama and I are going to stop the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStop the war!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I explained circumstances so far to Rondo\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, the orcs are disguising themselves using\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011and sneak in, huh. But, if that is the case, the\u300eAzos Family\u300fwho governs this town is completely guilty.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s highly likely.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there\u2019s no evidence.\u300d</p><br/><p>While having such talk,\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic suddenly informed me of\u300eDanger\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment, it seemed something has happened.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I checked it, it was the beacon attached to the Slums\u2019 food warehouse\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>I projected the video so that it can also be seen by Elena and Rondo\u2015</p><br/><p>The orcs realized something unusual inside the food warehouse and was trying to break the door open by ramming against it.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI tinkered the door so it won\u2019t get noticed immediately that I got the food back.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see.\u300d</p><br/><p>The orcs managed to somehow break the door open. When they saw the empty warehouse, they began to panic.</p><br/><p>A High orc came over and started giving order to the orcs. It seemed to be the boss.</p><br/><p>After looking for a while, the high orc took out a\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011and disguised itself as a human.</p><br/><p>When Rondo saw it, he suddenly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I\u2019ve seen this guy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019ve seen the high orc who disguised itself as a human?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that fellow was the one who testified that Scab village has been destroyed by the demon lord\u2019s army, the\u300eMerchant of the Slums\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, I think it was only natural for it to be an orc since the Slums was full of orcs. It was a high orc, huh.</p><br/><p>When watching the situation for awhile\u2015</p><br/><p>Another person, a human appeared.</p><br/><p>\u300cA-, Azos!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I turned on the sound\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eAzos-sama, it\u2019s, as you see.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMoron! Didn\u2019t I tell you to put someone and guard it properly!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI, guarded, properly. But, it was stolen.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cDoes it mean, Azos-dono was the one who gave the order directly\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo looked at Azos, disgusted.</p><br/><p>\u300cShall we go there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGo there? But, wouldn\u2019t he ran away by then?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, just leave it to me. Elena will go as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat on earth are you going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>I had Rondo wear his armor and hold his weapon.</p><br/><p>We teleported to where Azos is using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Azos-san. What are you doing in a place such as this with nothing but orcs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFa!? Y-, You guys are!? Where on earth did you come from!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAzos-dono, you still won\u2019t be able to talk your way out of here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, you!1 A mere greenhorn dare to oppose me! Oy, you guys, kill them!\u300d</p><br/><p>Just like an evil magistrate\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like we are inside a scene of some retired crepe wholesaler.</p><br/><p>The cast are, Rondo and me as Suke-san and Kaku-san, while Elena is Komon-sama.1</p><br/><p>I would like to see Elena as Komon-sama.~ Hn? Why am I saying something strange? Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>We were surrounded by Azos and lots of orcs.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, Seiji. What should we do in this situation!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? This much isn\u2019t a big deal, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m talking about Elena-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena can protect herself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat kind of stupid thing\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Bakon!</p><br/><p>When we looked towards Elena, an orc drew near unnoticed. It was knocked off of its feet.</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO, Ou\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you doing!? Aren\u2019t they just 3 people!? Get rid of them quickly!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Azos clamored at the back.</p><br/><p>When I looked at Azos this way, he seemed to resemble an orc. I couldn\u2019t tell the difference when he was lined up with the orcs.</p><br/><p>Rondo and I break into a run simultaneously and plunged into the orc horde. </p><br/><p>Me on the right, Rondo the left and *flail flail* we chopped up the orcs.</p><br/><p>The orc horde\u2019s midsection, fortunately, projects towards Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Hail\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>But, the projecting orc horde fell one after another with Elena\u2019s\u3010Hail\u3011attack.</p><br/><p>The orcs and Rondo were surprised at the raging hail and were confused. I dealt with the orcs during that interval.</p><br/><p>Finally, the midsection had become exhibition of frozen orcs.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Elena skillfully avoided Rondo and me, and dropped huge blocks of ice one after another aimed at the orcs.</p><br/><p>Before anyone noticed it, the high orc merchant and Azos were surrounded by walls of ice, they have nowhere to escape.</p><br/><p>So this is what Elena had been aiming for!</p><br/><p>We cleaned up the survivors and approached the High orc merchant and Azos\u2015</p><br/><p>One human and one monster, both were flustered.</p><br/><p>\u300cAzos, obediently let me tie you with a rope.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, you!\u300d</p><br/><p>While Rondo seized Azos, the high orc merchant fainted.</p><br/><p>With Azos and the High orc, who were tied up with a rope, we returned to Rondo\u2019s military camp and confined them in a cage.</p><br/><p>Then, we returned to Rondo\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, you have my gratitude.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Elena who played the most active role.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIndeed. Elena-sama, thank you very much for your cooperation.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s fine. More importantly, what should we do about those people?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think we should discuss this with the leaders of the campaigning aristocrats gathered in this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much for your help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf possible, I want the two of you to participate in the meeting as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t mind, how about you Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI ask you to keep me inconspicuous as much as possible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll do something.\u300d</p><br/><p>While we are having such a talk\u2015</p><br/><p>The troops led by Lyle Gewalt had finally arrived in Shinju town.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Onore(\u304a\u306e\u308c). Not sure if it\u2019s like omae in meaning here, or some swear word I don\u2019t know about.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Reference to Mito K\u014dmon (?), a Japanese jidaigeki or period drama that has been on prime-time television since 1969. In the guise of Mitsuemon, a retired cr\u00eape merchant from Echigo, he roams the realm with two samurai retainers, fun-loving Sasaki Sukesabur\u014d (Suke-san) and studious Atsumi Kakunoshin (Kaku-san). An episode typically starts with some injustice perpetrated by a corrupt official, wealthy merchant or gangster; the travelers arrive incognito, discover the injustice and quietly investigate it; and the episode concludes with a brawl in which the unarmed, disguised protagonists better a crowd of samurai and gangsters, culminating with the presentation of the inr\u014d that reveals the hero\u2019s identity. \u2013 Wikipedia\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

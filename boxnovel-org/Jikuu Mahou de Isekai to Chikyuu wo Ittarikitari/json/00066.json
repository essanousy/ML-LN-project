Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat were you doing during the day?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, I went to the shopping district.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, Elena got various things from the people at the shopping district.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHou hou, That\u2019s amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oblivious to my worries, Aya and Elena began to appraise the gifts. </p><br/><p>Sweets, pork cutlet, melon bread, taiyaki, pot, sandals, umbrella, rice, salt, sugar, soy sauce, miso, Japanese rice crackers, toilet paper, electric massager, rose bouquet, cooking oil, aromatic candle, cosmetics and so on\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>There was also a strange one in the middle, though the people with pure heart wouldn\u2019t able to see it as strange.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, why did everybody at the shopping district give you various things?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was thanks for treating their illness and injuries using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? You used magic Elena-chan!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWas it bad?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, everybody at the shopping district seemed to be good people and safe.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, well.~ If there\u2019s something happen to Elena-chan, me and anchan will just protect you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBoth of you, thank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it would be impossible even if I told her to stop using magic to treat injuries and illness before her eyes, we\u2019ll be able to manage somehow.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about you Aya, how was the first day of the junior college?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI made 3 friends, the club invitations stuff, we look around the campus together and chatted at a fast food restaurant afterwards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you join any club?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI intend to join the combat sports club, I\u2019m thinking of karate department.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJoin a more girly club.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that? It\u2019s particularly good because I\u2019m selfish.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, if you say so. If you join the karate department, don\u2019t use magic in a match, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI know.\u300d</p><br/><p>While having such conversation, we finished dinner and decided to resume \u300ePotioncraft\u300f-ing.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, do you want to try\u300ePotioncraft\u300fa little bit more? Don\u2019t you want to get the bonus stats when you raise the skill?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally? Might as well try a little bit more.\u300d</p><br/><p>We began to\u300ePotioncraft\u300fbut, Aya got bored and stopped after brewing 3\u3010Illness mitigation potion\u3011and reached level 2.</p><br/><p>\u300cA little bit more, hang in there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI dislike science experiments.~ I\u2019ll depend on Elena later on.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya said so and returned to her room. Why have you grown to such a child, oniisan is sad.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are we going to brew?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a\u300ePotioncraft\u300flevel 3,\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>The recipe is this.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cPotioncraft\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Ingredients:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Medicinal herb\u301150g</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Purple grass\u2019 root\u301120g</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Magic water\u3011200ml</p><br/><p>\u2502Skills required:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Potioncraft\u3011Level 3</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u300cHow are we going to make\u3010Magic water\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAccording to the recipe, you can make it by using\u3010Recovery magic\u3011on\u3010Purified water\u3011. This would only be possible with Elena.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I\u2019ll try.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena holds the\u3010purified water\u3011in hand and tried putting\u3010recovery magic\u3011on it using trial and error, I prepared the\u3010purified water\u3011using\u3010water magic\u3011in the meantime.</p><br/><p>Finally, Elena succeeded in making\u3010magic water\u3011, since a sufficient amount of\u3010magic water\u3011has been made, I had Elena rest at once and began to brew\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011first.</p><br/><p>To start with, I severe the\u3010root\u3011from the\u3010purple grass\u3011and segregate it, I dried it and used the same procedure we did on the other potions afterwards.</p><br/><p>Although the crafting of the\u3010wound healing potion\u3011had gone well, it didn\u2019t raise the level of\u3010Potioncraft\u3011at all. I brewed 30\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011and the level went up from 3 to 4 at last.</p><br/><p>Apparently, you have to succeed once to level it from level 0 \u2192 1, three times from 1 \u2192 2, 10 times from 2 \u2192 3 and 30 times from 3 \u2192 4. I wonder if it\u2019s required to succeed 100 times to raise it to level 5?</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, next is Elena\u2019s turn, do your best.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena also crafted 30 vials of\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011and her\u3010Potioncraft\u3011has risen to level 4.</p><br/><p>\u300cThough the next recipe is\u3010Curse healing potion\u3011, we have insufficient ingredients, let\u2019s make it next time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat ingredients do it needs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see, the recipe is.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cPotioncraft\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Curse healing potion\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Ingredients:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Purple nettle\u301150g</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Salt\u301110g \u203b</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Holy water\u3011200ml</p><br/><p>\u2502Skills required:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Potioncraft\u3011Level 4</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u203bThe\u3010Salt\u3011to be used should be above A rank.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis, since there\u2019s\u3010salt\u3011, we have to look for\u3010purple nettle\u3011and\u3010holy water\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan we make\u3010holy water\u3011with magic like\u3010magic water\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s like\u3010magic water\u3011but it seems you have to use\u3010light magic\u3011to make\u3010holy water\u3011so we couldn\u2019t make it currently.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, it\u2019s regrettable.\u300d</p><br/><p>The potions we brewed today were as follows.</p><br/><p>\u3010Illness mitigation potion +1\u3011x 2,\u3010Illness mitigation potion +2\u3011x 1,</p><br/><p>\u3010Wound healing potion +1\u3011x 29,\u3010Wound healing potion\u3011x 30 and</p><br/><p>\u3010Wound healing potion +3\u3011x 1.</p><br/><p>With this, our\u300ePotioncraft\u300f-ing ended for today\u2026\u2026but, I started again after getting back to my room.</p><br/><p>The potion I\u2019m going to craft alone is this!</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cPotioncraft\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Ingredients:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Mandrake root\u301150g</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Strength recovery potion\u3011200ml</p><br/><p>\u2502Skills required:</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u3010Potioncraft\u3011Level 3</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>I bought the expensive\u3010Mandrake root\u3011for this.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s only 7\u3010Mandrake root\u3011, I need 7\u3010Strength recovery potions\u3011to go with it. Then, I used the expensive\u3010mandrake root\u3011luxuriously and tried to brew a\u3010Stimulant potion\u3011\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe its\u2019 because my\u3010Potioncraft\u3011raised to level 4 but the quality became\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I tried to take a sip to test it.</p><br/><p>\u300c!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>This was exactly what\u300eit\u2019s no use in crying over a spilled milk\u300fbe like. That night, I became like a hungry wolf, I suppressed the lust to attack lamb-chan which was sleeping peacefully in the next room by counting the prime numbersunable to sleep, I prayed to the yellow morning sun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

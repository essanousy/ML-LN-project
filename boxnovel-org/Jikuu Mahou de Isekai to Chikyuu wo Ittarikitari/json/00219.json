Then, it has been decided!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDon't arbitrarily decide!\u300d</p><br/><p> Since there are a lot of orcs, the meat of an orc would be fine for the meat.</p><br/><p> If I did that, it's going to be a pork miso soup containing orc meat.</p><br/><p> Since it's an orc meat, it's not going to be\u300ePork miso soup\u300fbut\u300eOrc soup\u300f......</p><br/><p> since it sounds strange,\u300ePork soup\u300fis fine.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> I will have Hilda help me make a fire.</p><br/><p> When I went to the assembly hall, Elena and Hilda were able to take a break since the healers' magic power had recovered.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry to ask you during your break but since I'm going to cook outside, can you help me, Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda is full of energy.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I will also help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou healed a lot of injuries, aren't you tired, Elena?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm fine!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena seems to be full of spirit too.</p><br/><p> When we went out of the assembly hall,</p><br/><p> the townspeople who were healed from their injuries followed in succession from behind.</p><br/><p> I wonder if they heard that we are going to cook.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please wait a moment since I'm now going to make a kamado[1].\u300d</p><br/><p> I make everyone fall back and try to make a kamado near the large pot.</p><br/><p> However, the townspeople are gathering one after another and it has become the center of attention.</p><br/><p> It's hard to do it......</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, do your best!\u300d</p><br/><p> Shit, I'm already burning.</p><br/><p> But on second thought, I think\u300eit's good to attract attention\u300f!</p><br/><p>\u300cHere I go!!\u300d</p><br/><p> I fired myself up and exclaimed,</p><br/><p> with my mind focused like some warrior race[2], I put all my power into my whole body.</p><br/><p> As a bonus, I make my hair stand up using static electricity,</p><br/><p> and also imitate the generation of electric discharge phenomenon on purpose.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d\u300cWhat on earth is happening!?\u300d</p><br/><p> The onlookers have started to become noisy.</p><br/><p> I vigorously slam both of my hands on the ground,</p><br/><p> along with an earth tremor, the kamado is being constructed with\u3010Earth magic\u3011.</p><br/><p> Of course, the earth tremor is also a staging.</p><br/><p> and, a somewhat exaggerated kamado was completed.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOooooo!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cNext, water. Will you please, Elena?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>*Joro joro*</p><br/><p> Elena gets on top of the stand I've made in order to put things inside the pot and has poured water with *joro joro*.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, can you do it a little bit more energetically?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Somehow or other, it seems she is embarrassed doing *joro joro* with everyone watching.</p><br/><p> It can't be helped, I will look at Elena firmly too.</p><br/><p> Finally, Elena finished doing *joro joro*,</p><br/><p> her body was shivering for some reason.</p><br/><p> It's just really an ordinary water, right? Right?</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cNext, fire.</p><br/><p> The situation is good, I leave it to you, Hilda!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe situation is good?</p><br/><p> I understand!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya, Mai-san and I put firewoods into the kamado,</p><br/><p> and sent a signal to Hilda.</p><br/><p> Hilda raised the magic stone of oil's rod and poured her magic power into it.</p><br/><p> At the same time as Hilda opened her eyes widely\u2015</p><br/><p> a\u300eFlame tornado\u300fburst forth.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cWa!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> The onlookers who were a little scared and moved back</p><br/><p> found out that it was safe and burst into applause.</p><br/><p>\u300cIncredible, I haven't seen such a great Fire magic before.\u300d</p><br/><p> That's right, that's right,</p><br/><p> I trained Hilda. How's thattt!?</p><br/><p> Hilda's magic didn't end with that,</p><br/><p> three firebirds jumped out from the flame tornado.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's that!!?\u300d</p><br/><p> A commotion arose from the onlookers.</p><br/><p> And then, the firebirds,</p><br/><p> entered into the kamado as if they were returning to their nest\u2015</p><br/><p> The firewood in the kamado flared up vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cUwaaaaa!!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> A loud cheering arose from the onlookers,</p><br/><p> Hilda had been embarrassed.</p><br/><p> Well, what she did was merely lighting up the firewood of the kamado, right?</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> Why are we doing this kind of exaggerated performance you say\u2015</p><br/><p> it is to make the heart of the townspeople calm down even a little.</p><br/><p> Attacked by the devil-kin, it has led to a large number of victims.</p><br/><p> However, the people who survived......</p><br/><p> have to rebuild this town after this.</p><br/><p> Food is what the people here now worried about the most.</p><br/><p> Most of the town's food has been robbed off by the devil-kin, even if they ask the other town for support,</p><br/><p> the round-trip will take four days and the food preparation and the likes will take a day, they can't rely on food support for at least 5 days.</p><br/><p> That's why I showed a large quantity of food and there needs to be an exaggerated cooking in a huge pot.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> With that said, I prepare the pot,</p><br/><p> I finely cut the vegetables and throws it in,</p><br/><p> I have Hilda to dismantle an orc and throws it in,</p><br/><p> and finally-!</p><br/><p> it's the 10 kg\u300eMiso with soup stocks for professional's use\u300fwhich I bought from the supermarket for business purposes.</p><br/><p> The 10kg miso with soup stock has been thrown into the pot.</p><br/><p> Then, a nice aroma of miso wafts through the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u300cSomehow, it's a savory aroma!\u300d</p><br/><p> Each of townspeople searched for the one which will likely be the container and began to line up in a row.</p><br/><p> I created a\u300eladdle\u300fwith a wooden stick and a suitable metal,</p><br/><p> and served the people who lined up a pork miso soup.</p><br/><p>\u300cDelicioussss!!\u300d</p><br/><p> It seemed that they liked it somehow or other, everyone unanimously said 'delicious, delicious' as they ate.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, the distribution of food has also been completed, should I go to Lela's place?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, what are you going to do by going to Lela's place? A tryst?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy did it become so.</p><br/><p> I'm going to report that the Ebisu town was attacked.</p><br/><p> And, I will ask for support too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it's that, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p> There is only that.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I will leave the rest to you for a while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>[1] A kamado () is a traditional Japanese wood or charcoal fueled cook stove.</p><br/><p>[2] If I\u2019m not mistaken, this is a reference to DBZ\u2019s Saiyan race</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As expected, not only the prince\u2019s speed was fast, its sword streak was also sharp.</p><br/><p>Somehow, I want to have an intense fight with this fellow.</p><br/><p> Because its skill with the sword surpassed mine, I observed carefully and saw through the sword streak. Instead of dodging it, I blocked it with the shield.</p><br/><p>When I blocked the sword several times, the prince gradually became irritated and made a large sweeping stroke. Though the skill was good, it didn\u2019t have spirit. It\u2019s really regrettable.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems the other side have been cleared up, Aya and Elena had come to help.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis fellow is strong to some extent.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I talked, the prince flew into a rage and attacked recklessly. Are you a girl who is sharp when I look away!?</p><br/><p>When I took the all out attack of the prince with the shield, my body floated a little.</p><br/><p>When the prince saw that, it broke into a grin. Putting all its strength to the sword and then it hurled the sword to my body while still in the air.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama!\u300d</p><br/><p>I was blown away and almost crashed into a tree. I landed to its side by neutralizing the momentum and avoided the collision.</p><br/><p>\u300cBad bad, I was a little careless.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, is that fellow so strong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo a certain extent.\u300d</p><br/><p>The prince seemed to be irritated when we talked in a language it couldn\u2019t understand\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300eMe, don\u2019t, ignore.\u300f</p><br/><p> Really, what a selfish fellow. It surely grew up spoiled. Finally, the prince\u2019s sword streak had become unsystematic.</p><br/><p>Aya and Elena withdrew a little. I dodged the prince\u2019s sword like a jump rope and attracted its attention.</p><br/><p>\u300cCurse you! Don\u2019t move!\u300f</p><br/><p> The chance came when its attention was directed to me, Aya and Elena attack with water and ice from the rear. The armor that the prince wore seemed to be good to some extent, magic attacks weren\u2019t too effective on it.</p><br/><p>Aya who became irritated, plunged forward while holding a knife.</p><br/><p>Even with knife attacks, it only managed to make scratches on the prince\u2019s armor and didn\u2019t do any damage. When Aya still persistently attacked\u2015</p><br/><p>The prince suddenly turned towards Aya and swung down its sword!</p><br/><p>Dangerous!</p><br/><p> Aya threw away the knife and tried a \u300elive blade catching\u300f. The timing was late, she would receive a direct hit at this rate.</p><br/><p>\u300cBarrier!\u300d</p><br/><p>Barin!</p><br/><p> The sword was blocked by the barrier I put on Aya and the sword\u2019s speed was delayed for a moment. It was enough for Aya\u2019s \u300elive blade catching\u300f. Aya barely caught the prince\u2019s sword in\u300ebare-handed sword block1\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo close! I thought I was dead!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re too reckless, idiot!\u300d</p><br/><p> But, the prince didn\u2019t give up and put power into the sword. While in bare-handed sword block state, *slip slide* the sword was being pushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Electric shock\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eGueee!\u300f</p><br/><p> When my electric shock penetrated the prince\u2019s armor, the prince\u2019s body became numb and stiffened. Using that chance, Aya picked up the knife and withdrew to the back.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou, what, magic!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI can\u2019t tell such a secret to a goblin.\u300f</p><br/><p> The prince and I glared at each other again, Elena charged this time. Elena! What on earth are you thinking!?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the prince tried to aim at Elena and took a huge back swing.</p><br/><p>Bashan!</p><br/><p> During that instant, Aya hit the face part of the prince\u2019s helmet with water magic! The prince faltered embarrassingly to the sudden attack.</p><br/><p>Gakin!</p><br/><p> Elena took advantage of the opportunity and performed a rain of strikes upon the prince\u2019s shin with all her might using\u3010Magic rod\u3011!</p><br/><p>\u300eGyaaa!!\u300f</p><br/><p> Elena\u2019s attacks left a huge dent mark on the prince\u2019s shinguard. The prince tumbled and collapsed while holding its shin and screaming. Elena quickly took a distance where she couldn\u2019t be attacked by chance. What a nice combo attack. They worked together well.</p><br/><p>Although the prince managed to stand up somehow, it received Aya\u2019s water attack continuously which deprived it of its sight. Elena decided to attack the shin again. The shinguard broke and peeled off. </p><br/><p>Aya who saw that took the chance and charged. Elena took the role of depriving the prince\u2019s sight with water attacks and Aya cleanly cut the prince\u2019s shin.</p><br/><p>\u300eGuwaaa!\u300f</p><br/><p> The prince fell forward with a roar and crashed to the ground face first.</p><br/><p>Elena followed with the final blow on the back of the prince\u2019s head which crashed into the ground\u2015</p><br/><p>She swung down the magic rod with all her might.</p><br/><p> It gave off a dull sound like something broke. The goblin prince remained completely silent\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYou two did really well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHehe.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya raised an unusual laugh while Elena broke into a smile. They were trying to fix their breathing and couldn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p> When I checked our statuses, I\u2019m level 29. Aya is level 20 while her body techniques and short blade techniques became level 4. And Elena is level 19 while her staff techniques became level 3.</p><br/><p> While putting the goblins away into the inventory, we went towards the village.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Shirahadori or bare-handed blade block is stopping a sword stroke between one\u2019s bare hand like this.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

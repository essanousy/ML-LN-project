The goblins had been alerted, it seems they will all come over if I make a move, even a little.\u300d</p><br/><p>After defeating a hobgoblin, Aya couldn\u2019t lure out the enemy and had to give up.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, there\u2019s no helping it. Wait a moment you guys, let\u2019s go and see the situation.\u300d</p><br/><p>Helplessly, the 3 of us went to see the situation at the village. The number of goblins were reduced to about 50. We didn\u2019t find any individual who seemed to be the Goblin Prince. There were 4 hobgoblins left and they were being strictly alert with the surroundings. What to do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can\u2019t be helped, we\u2019ll take care of the rest in one fell swoop.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, that number is still\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya will also participate in the attack. And me as well. Is it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger!\u300d\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we revealed ourselves, the goblins flew into a rage and came at us all at once. Since we couldn\u2019t fight in the village, we lie in wait in a forest clearing.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, look at that.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I looked towards where Elena was pointing to, there was a goblin who wore an armor, it was larger than a hobgoblin and was positioned at the back.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that a Goblin prince?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I appraised it, it was much stronger than an orc and black orc. So that\u2019s reason why the orc was obedient and did what it was told. </p><br/><p>The goblins stopped at a little distance away from us, the situation had turned into us glaring at each other. The goblins\u2019 battle formation had common goblins in the front and the Goblin prince in the back while the hobgoblins were protecting the prince. </p><br/><p>The goblin prince issued a command but I didn\u2019t understand what it had said. Should I try to use Language Acquisition? It consumes a considerable amount of MP but it\u2019s fine since there are Japanese sweets.</p><br/><p>I used\u3010Language Acquisition\u3011decisively.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cLanguage Acquisition\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Goblin\u2019s language\u3011acquisition.</p><br/><p>\u2502 Please choose the acquisition level:</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbLevel 1 (Consumption: 50 MP)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can speak by babbling</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbLevel 2 (Consumption: 100 MP)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can speak at an everyday conversational level</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbLevel 3 (Consumption: 200 MP)</p><br/><p>\u2502 You can speak fluently</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>Huh? It\u2019s only up to level 3. That\u2019s it! There are no\u300eletters\u300fin goblin language, huh?</p><br/><p>The 200 MP was consumed and I have mastered the\u3010Goblin\u2019s language\u3011level 3.</p><br/><p>\u300eThose fellows, don\u2019t let them escape! Who ever lets them get away, Death penalty!\u300f1</p><br/><p>\u300cFugo!\u300d</p><br/><p>They aren\u2019t talking about strategy?\u2026\u2026 and, it\u2019s only the goblin prince who is capable of speaking goblin\u2019s language, even if the other goblins understand the goblin\u2019s language, they couldn\u2019t speak it, it seems.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, Elena, I\u2019ll keep the goblin prince away from the group. Since I\u2019ll constrain it, you have to defeat the common goblins by yourselves.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu!\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s go! \u3010Teleportation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>I moved behind the goblin prince and set up a barrier which blocks physical attacks, light and sound between the common goblins and the goblin prince and divided them.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m here!\u300f</p><br/><p>The goblin prince and the hobgoblin were surprised that a human appeared behind them and spoke with their own language.</p><br/><p>When I checked the other side of the barrier using\u3010Tracking\u3011magic, the goblins had fallen into panic with the tornado that Aya had created.</p><br/><p>\u300eAll of you, why are you abducting human beings?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou, Human, how, speak?\u300f</p><br/><p>For the time being, I converse with goblin\u2019s language\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a prince but it\u2019s still babbling?</p><br/><p>\u300eI learned it just now. That aside, answer my question.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHuman, secret, not talking.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll let you have a bitter experience if you don\u2019t talk.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHuman, weak, you, kill.\u300f</p><br/><p>It\u2019s no good, it seems I couldn\u2019t get any more information.</p><br/><p>\u300eAll of you, Human, kill!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cUgotsu!\u300d</p><br/><p>When the prince issued the command, the 4 hobgoblins attacked simultaneously. I took out a sword and shield from the inventory and engage.</p><br/><p>The 4 hobgoblins held a different weapon each. Axe, hammer, mace and spear, they were huge weapons and heavy. </p><br/><p>I\u2019m surrounded by the 4 monsters and have been attacked from the 4 directions. Only, the attacks were slow due to the weapons being heavy and can be easily dodged.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a tornado and hailstorm rage on the other side of the barrier. The weather has become rough and the goblins are collapsing one after another.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it about time?\u300d</p><br/><p>I grabbed the hand of the hobgoblin who swung down an ax with my left hand then I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to move to the other side of the barrier. I dropped the hobgoblin and immediately returned to the original location. About 1 second passed during that time.</p><br/><p>\u300e1, disappeared, what did you do?\u300f</p><br/><p>It seemed that even the prince didn\u2019t understand what happened. It was an instant, the other side of the barrier wasn\u2019t visible and the sound wasn\u2019t audible.</p><br/><p>I waited for the timing for a while and took the guy with a hammer next. I felt like the speed in which the hobgoblins were being defeated on the other side of the barrier were gradually getting faster. </p><br/><p>Followed by the hobgoblin with a mace and lastly, I sent the hobgoblin with the spear\u2015</p><br/><p>Me and the prince were left alone.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, you\u2019re the only one left. Tell me, what were you scheming?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIf I say, by the King, kill.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, you\u2019re going to be killed by me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI, you, kill.\u300f</p><br/><p>It\u2019s useless after all, the prince drew its great sword and attacked me.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1It should be babbling here but I don\u2019t know how. lol\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

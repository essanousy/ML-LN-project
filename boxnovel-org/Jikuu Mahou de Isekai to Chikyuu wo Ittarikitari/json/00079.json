Although it\u2019s a little too many, I think this much is fine somehow?</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, Aya, take care of them you two.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cRoger.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena invoked\u3010Cloudburst\u3011and Aya pushed back the goblins who tried to get away. There are too many goblins who are trying to get away from the\u3010Cloudburst\u3011and they can\u2019t be suppressed by Aya alone.</p><br/><p>Finally, there\u2019s a monster which Aya didn\u2019t manage to handle, attacked Elena. </p><br/><p>I\u2019d like to run and help but I bear with it and continue to watch. While Elena sends down rain using Cloudburst with\u3010Water rod\u3011in her left hand, she send the rushing goblin flying with\u3010Magic rod\u3011in her right hand. The goblin flew to where the Cloudburst is heavily raining. Even if Elena didn\u2019t do such a thing, the goblin ceased to breathe when it was hit. </p><br/><p>Even as the Cloudburst started to stop raining, there are still several goblins who are still breathing. Elena started to send down snow. It\u2019s a magic combo of snow and cloudburst.</p><br/><p>When the snow stopped falling, the goblins were buried under the snow and could no longer move. They became a huge mound of snow.</p><br/><p>\u300cI did it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAgain, even if there are 10 of them, it is an easy victory.\u300d</p><br/><p>While Elena eat Japanese sweets to recover her lost MP, we are waiting for the next batch of goblins and then 30\u300eCaution\u300fmark appeared on the map.</p><br/><p>I moved to Aya\u2019s side using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, no matter how you look at it, there\u2019s too many.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry oniichan. It seems that the goblins started to become alert.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and I started to make strategy while escaping from the goblins.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, take these guys and run away for a while. I will\u300ecut off\u300fthese guys little by little and take them to where Elena is.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRoger!\u300d</p><br/><p>I hide behind a tree using\u3010Teleportation\u3011and set up a barrier in front of the the seven monsters at the rear of the group of goblins that\u2019s chasing Aya. The 7 goblins crashed against the barrier that suddenly appeared and were cut off from the leading group. I threw a pebble to those fellows silently. When they noticed me, I ran back to where Elena is with those fellows in tow. </p><br/><p>I suddenly halted my steps, turned around and took a fighting stance. The goblins and I glared each other. As I stepped back, a Cloudburst struck the goblins. The rain quickly changed into snow, not even one monster was left out, all of them were covered in ice.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll bring the next one.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>After giving Japanese sweets to Elena, I went to get the next batch of goblins. When the following 7 were defeated in the same way, Aya returned with the remaining 16 monsters in tow to where Elena is. This number will be the deciding factor if we should proceed. </p><br/><p>While the 16 goblins confronted Aya, the Cloudburst struck the goblins. The cloudburst quickly turned into snow, even the weather turned into hailstorm. The goblins were struck by the hailstorm and were deprived of physical strength. They were easily wiped out.</p><br/><p>When I checked Elena\u2019s status, her level rose as well as the level of her water magic and ice magic. </p><br/><p>\u300cWe were able to manage somehow. I feel that we can proceed with large numbers now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOkay.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The 3 of us coordinated with each other well and the goblins in the village were reduced to about half.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, something huge is in the mix.\u300d</p><br/><p>During the umpteenth time, in the 10 goblins that chasing after Aya, there\u2019s a huge goblin with a great sword mixed in. Isn\u2019t that the hobgoblin!?</p><br/><p>I cast slow on the hobgoblin while Aya is dodging its attacks and attacking it. Elena brought down a hailstorm and killed the rest of the goblin instantaneously. With Elena\u2019s level up, instead of rain, she can bring down hailstorm immediately.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, only the hobgoblin is left.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena created a water ball and launched it towards the hobgoblin. I also coordinated my attack with it.</p><br/><p>Basha!</p><br/><p>The power of water ball is completely\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Since Elena has been using only Cloudburst and Snow, she wasn\u2019t accustomed to single target attack\u2026..</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the water ball attack caused it to notice Elena. The hobgoblin turned around towards Elena and swung his great sword.</p><br/><p>\u300cBarrier!\u300d</p><br/><p>I set up a barrier towards Elena at once but the hobgoblin\u2019s attack broke through the barrier and attacked Elena!</p><br/><p>Gakin!</p><br/><p>With a dull sound, the hobgoblin\u2019s sword was\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was blocked by Elena with magic rod.</p><br/><p>Its momentum was neutralized by the barrier, with Elena\u2019s level up, she managed to defend somehow.</p><br/><p>\u300cTei!\u300d</p><br/><p>With a shout, Elena deflected the hobgoblin\u2019s sword using the\u3010Magic rod\u3011and strike its defenseless body.</p><br/><p>\u300cGubatsu!\u300d</p><br/><p>As if it was carefully aimed at, Elena\u2019s attack landed on the hobgoblin\u2019s lower head. The hobgoblin was unable to endure the blow and fell to its knees while holding his family jewels.</p><br/><p>Zudon!</p><br/><p>The hobgoblin leaned forward and fell down, producing a loud sound.</p><br/><p>*Haa haa* Elena was panting for breath, she turned around here and broke into a smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

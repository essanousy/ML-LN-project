It\u2019s probably it judging from the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cLastly, is there a person here who knows something about this village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe were only abducted from the other towns. The only thing we know is that this village had been destroyed by the demon lord\u2019s army\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>We\u2019ve come this far and there\u2019s still no clue?\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAh!

One day, when approximately a month had passed, it seemed that survivors of this village unexpectedly appeared in Shinju town.\u300d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s organize the story up to this point.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThe goblins were making\u3010Magic stone of Human Transformation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThere\u2019s a possibility that there are orcs and goblins with\u3010Magic stone of Human Transformation\u3011lurking inside the town.</p><br/><p>\u30fbThere are survivors of Scab village in Shinju town.</p><br/><p>First, what are the goblins plotting with\u3010Magic stone of Human Transformation\u3011? There should be another reason than just merely increase the number of people to create a\u3010Magic stone of Human Transformation\u3011.</p><br/><p>If there are orcs and goblins with\u3010Magic stone of Human Transformation\u3011inside the town, it\u2019s necessary to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on suspicious individuals one by one. There were\u300edanger\u300fmarks that appeared in the town occasionally, instead of criminals, they must have been\u300eHuman transformed\u300forcs and goblins. I didn\u2019t use\u3010Appraisal\u3011thoughtlessly in consideration to privacy but it benefited the enemy instead.</p><br/><p>First, we should go to Suga town and Ikebu town, and look for human transformed orcs and goblins. Eliminate them if necessary.</p><br/><p>Next, go to Shinju town and look for the survivors of the Scab village.</p><br/><p>We transported the people who had been abducted to each of the towns using\u3010Teleportation\u3011. Of course, I reminded them to keep it a secret from other people.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Because the craftsman-like man wanted to thank us on behalf of the people who were captured, we decided to stop by the Magic Stone Specialty Shop in the Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s here, please come inside.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we walked into the suspicious shop, there was an elderly woman and a young woman inside who were sitting in a chair with gloomy look.</p><br/><p>When we entered, the two people suddenly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u300cHoney!\u300d\u300cOtousan!\u300d</p><br/><p>They rushed towards the craftsman-like man in delight and embraced each other.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for worrying the two of you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousan, where have you been!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI had been abducted by an orc and was rescued by these people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that true?

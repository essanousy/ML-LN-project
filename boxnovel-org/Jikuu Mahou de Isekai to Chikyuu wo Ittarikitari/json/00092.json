The orcs aren\u2019t planning to attack this town, are they?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, perhaps so.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre we going to kill them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re not.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause the orcs moves in a wide scope, it would take too much time to defeat them all.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what are we going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe only thing we can do is to report it to the Adventurers\u2019 guild.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We went to the Adventurers\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to report.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>The female receptionist who seemed slightly bored, answered.</p><br/><p>Were you taking time off?</p><br/><p>\u300cUh\u2026 I saw a horde of orcs in the forest. I think it would be bad if the Adventurers\u2019 guild didn\u2019t make a countermeasure.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Is that true!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there\u2019s no mistake.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, please wait a moment as I report it to the Guild Master.\u300d</p><br/><p>The face of the female receptionist suddenly became tense, she went to the inner part of the Guild and came back after a short while.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Guild Master would like to meet you. I\u2019m sorry, would you please?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We were guided into the room at the inner part of the Guild and were greeted by an ojiisan with unkempt hair.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou were the ones who had seen the orcs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I somehow managed to describe the orcs I\u2019ve seen on the map.</p><br/><p>*Scratch scratch* Ojiisan scratched his unkempt hair.</p><br/><p>\u300cI give up.~ There\u2019s currently a few adventurers in this town.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHas everyone gone to participate in the war too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. By the way, what about you guys?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe are also planning to go to Shinju town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?~ Well, anyhow, we need to deal with this matter somehow or another, you guys have done well. Thank you for reporting it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*Sigh* Then, please excuse us.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left the Adventurers\u2019 guild after we made our report.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, was it fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf only I had two bodies, it would be okay.~ For the time being, I\u2019ll leave a tracking beacon somewhere in this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m relieved.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, where should I put the beacon, I wonder? Eh?\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a familiar face\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, You guys! Seiji and Aya! And Elena-sama too!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was\u300eIron wall Lela\u300f, Lela Lyle Gewalt.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you doing in a place like this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s my line!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy any chance\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>I checked the whereabouts of the Aristocracy Union Knight Leader through the beacon and that guy came here in this town too.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you come here to participate in the war with the Aristocracy Union Knight Leader?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right! That aside, state your purpose!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe saw a horde of orcs in the vicinity of this town so went to the Adventurers\u2019 guild to report it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? A horde of orcs is approaching this town!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa, it is so. But, most of the adventurers have gone to Shinju town to participate in the war so they\u2019re short on hands.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHmmm\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela heard that the orcs were approaching and has been lost in thought.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, what\u2019s the matter? You\u2019ve been lost in thought.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, come and see otousama for a while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it, suddenly?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-sama as well, can you please come together with us?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, it\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela brought us outside the town. There was a military camp established with about 500 soldiers resting.</p><br/><p>They probably traveled with haste that\u2019s why the soldiers were considerably tired.</p><br/><p>We were guided to the center of the camp where an elegant tent was built.</p><br/><p>\u300cOtousama, there\u2019s something you have to hear urgently.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it Lela- You, Maruyama Seiji! Why are you here!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you saying? I was brought here by Lela.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, why did you bring this fellow?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease listen, Otousama. According to this fellow, there\u2019s a horde of orcs approaching Ikebu town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOrcs? So what?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe town\u2019s soldiers and adventurers have gone to Shiju town in order to participate in the war, there are insufficient hands.As it is, if the orcs attacked this town, there would be casualties.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has nothing to do with me! The war has begun! It has to be prioritized above all else.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, Otousama!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cImportunate!\u300d</p><br/><p>Even if I told the knight leader that this war was instigated by the goblins and orcs, it won\u2019t change his opinion.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, stay here Otousama, I\u2019ll defend the town to death.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFine, suit yourself. I\u2019ll lend you about 100 soldiers.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>As one would expect of someone who holds the alias\u300eIron wall Lela\u300f, she\u2019s also good in defensive battle, huh.</p><br/><p>Just in case of emergency, I have the tracking beacon on Knight leader transferred to Lela.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf the business is done, we\u2019ll take our leave.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, what did you come here for?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ve come to stop the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTo stop the war!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, you should do your own work well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s my intention even if you didn\u2019t tell me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the Knight leader left 100 soldiers to Lela and headed towards Shinju town in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you really going to be okay, Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s my noblesse oblige to defend the country.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re also a pretty good fellow saying that you\u2019ll do your best to defend the people of this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWa? People? What the aristocrats should defend is the territory, not the commoners.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hopeless!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I wonder if we went a little overboard from touring around various places?</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, it\u2019s Seiji-ojii\u2026 an-chan!\u300d</p><br/><p>Hey! What\u2019s that you were about to say just now!?</p><br/><p>\u300cOh hey there, Seiji-san, Aya-san and Elena-san, please come in. It\u2019s good to see you guys again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAria-san too and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re doing well more than anything.\u300d</p><br/><p>After greeting, Elena hurriedly performed health checks on the children and see if they have any injuries and Aya began to play with the children using\u3010Wind magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>I borrowed Aria\u2019s kitchen and began preparing to cook.</p><br/><p>First, I mixed baking powder, sifted flour, a pinch of salt and sugar together.</p><br/><p>Then, I put milk and egg in a separate bowl and mixed them well while putting in the flour from a little while ago bit by bit, mixing a drop of cooking oil and vanilla essence and the batter was completed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, everyone. Clean up the top of the table.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cYe~s.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>While everyone observes, I put something in the middle of the table like a certain Dane.1</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this~!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagic tool?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAnchan, t-, this is!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a hot plate!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I said with a smug look.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnchan, what are you going to do taking out an electric hot plate, there\u2019s no outlet here?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya said so with a stunned look.</p><br/><p>\u300cFufufu! Clever Aya.</p><br/><p>You think I took this out without thinking?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What did you say!?\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Back to several days ago, I confined myself in my room after dinner and took out some things and began tinkering.</p><br/><p>\u300cTesterrr!\u300d</p><br/><p>I took out a machine like a certain robotic cat2 while my cry echoed inside the isolated room\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The description of the\u300eTester\u300fis a portable instrument for measuring electrical currents and voltage. Incidentally, my tester can also support AC and furthermore it can also measure frequency!</p><br/><p>I switched the tester to voltage measurement mode, I held the black and red tester rod with my left and right hand and activated the\u3010Lightning magic\u3011slowly.</p><br/><p>The number in the digital display gradually increased, when the volts reached 100V, I secure the magic power\u2019s strength and maintain it.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor now, I can maintain a 100V DC.\u300d</p><br/><p>Now, I switched the tester to AC frequency measurement mode and invoked the magic in the same way.</p><br/><p>But this time, the display didn\u2019t change. I tried to control the\u3010Lightning magic\u3011and exchange the positive and negative many times.</p><br/><p>Although the frequency\u2019s value increased little by little, it was far from reaching 50 Hz. I imagined a generator which rotates at 50 revolution every second and the frequency rose at once. </p><br/><p>Finally, I was able to successfully create a power supply of 100V AC 50Hz, I practiced repeatedly for awhile to be able to cast the magic stably.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cNowww then, lo and behold! This is my new magic,</p><br/><p>it\u2019s called\u300eOutlet magic3\u300f!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I picked up the hot plate\u2019s plug then touched the earthed exposed metal parts with my right hand\u2019s index finger and thumb and invoked magic, the hot plate\u2019s power indicator faintly shone.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026Anchan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s somewhat simple.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, well\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen Seiji-sama, what happens after this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhm, the plate will gradually become warm.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will become warm\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena cautiously touched the hot plate.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it\u2019s warm!\u300d</p><br/><p>When Elena reported so, all the children began to touch the plate together.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s warm.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOy! Don\u2019t touch it too much because it\u2019ll gradually become hot, it\u2019s dangerous!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and the children became quite and suddenly retracted their hands. Yoshi yoshi, good children.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll start cooking.~\u300d</p><br/><p>And, I noticed a serious mistake.</p><br/><p>Because I need to maintain the outlet magic with my right hand, I can only use my left hand. I somehow managed to take out the tools from the inventory with only my left hand but it\u2019s impossible to cook as expected.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, sorry but can you bake it in my place?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay but, are these hotcakes?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, if it\u2019s that then even I can do it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya just went with the flow, she scooped the batter with the ladle and tried to pour it on the hot plate.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait wait! Oil it first.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, is that so?\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not \u2018is that so?\u2019!</p><br/><p>Will it really be alright to leave it to Aya?</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, Aya-oneesan is going to bake some delicious hotcakes.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWow, oneechan daisuki.~\u300d</p><br/><p>Shit, if I could only use my right hand, I won\u2019t fall behind Aya. I grieved over my mistake.</p><br/><p>When Aya bakes an ill-formed hotcake, it caused an applause from all around. When you look closely, it\u2019s a little burnt!</p><br/><p>Aya divided the hotcakes into 8 equal portions and handed it to everyone\u2019s plate. But, my portion wasn\u2019t on my plate! When I look for my share\u2019s whereabouts for a minute, there are 2 pieces on Aya\u2019s plate!</p><br/><p>\u300cOi, Aya-san. Why\u2019s my share on Aya-san\u2019s plate?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut Anchan, you won\u2019t eat because you can\u2019t use your right hand, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Heartless, too heartless, this is too much!</p><br/><p>When I hang my head down low\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, okay, say ah.~\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya took a bite-size piece out of my share and brought it to my mouth with a fork. </p><br/><p>Aya, I\u2019m sorry that I doubted you.</p><br/><p>\u300cAaan.\u300d*munch*</p><br/><p>Oh, delicious. The hotcake I received from my imouto seemed somewhat different. How should I say it? It tasted a little bitter\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A bitter taste?</p><br/><p>\u300cOy Aya. Wasn\u2019t the hotcake you shared to me was the most burnt part?!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, since Anchan is the oldest, I think a little bitter taste had a better effect.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat bitterness, it\u2019s merely burnt!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCalm down, are you fine with this partition? If so, I\u2019ll put lots of honey. Here, Aaaaan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey hey, stop\u2026 *munch munch*\u300d</p><br/><p>Being force-fed with hotcake full of honey by Aya, it was indescribably bitter and sweet. And, the area around my mouth became sticky.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-oniichan, I\u2019ll also feed you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Minya the nekomimi girl also came and tried to feed me with hotcake, imitating Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, Aaan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAaan.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m done eating the served hotcake, other children also came to me one after another and began to launch\u300eAaan attack\u300f.</p><br/><p>When I somehow breakthrough the enemies\u2019 waves of attack, the unexpected last boss appeared at the end.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, Aaan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Was it no good?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I\u2019ll also receive Elena\u2019s. Aaan.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll finally receive Elena\u2019s\u300eAaan\u300f, I have no more regrets\u2026\u2026my face broke into a grin while thinking such a thing.</p><br/><p>It seems, I became careless this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks for the foo\u30fc!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A moment of carelessness, the fellow stole something unthinkable.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s Elena\u2019s hotcake.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re cruel, Aya-san. That one was for Seiji-sama. Why did you eat it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan\u2019s hotcake.~ Delicious.~\u300d</p><br/><p>On the spot, I dropped to my knee in defeat.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1I\u2019m not sure what this Dane is, but I found something while searching all over the net, which is Dane Cook.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2In case you didn\u2019t get it, it\u2019s referencing Doraemon.\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Any naming ideas? Should I call it Electrical outlet magic to be more specific?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

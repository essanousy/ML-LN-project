Aya was enthusiastically teaching her, I could even hear her squealing coming from the bathroom. I-it\u2019s not like I\u2019m envious or anything, I wasn\u2019t thinking about peeking one bit at all!</p><br/><p> While I was having my mental anguish, my job was to cook the rice which I repeatedly filled into plastic containers that I then stored away into my inventory.</p><br/><p> Both of them came out after a while, although Elena was wearing my \u3010Bathrobe\u3011 that I once bought on an impulse but never wore in the end. It was a bit too big on her and the sleeves too long. Quite erotic, what a great sight!</p><br/><p> Aya is wearing the T-shirt with the slogan \u300eIf you work, you lose\u300f written on it that I once bought on an impulse but never wore in the end. It was a bit too big on her that it ended up as a one-piece. Wearing my T-shirt without my permission! Just looking made me feel irritated.</p><br/><p> I also took a bath after Elena and Aya. However I definitely didn\u2019t think about the water in the bath being the same water that Elena, and I guess Aya too, took a bath in at all, not even a tiny bit!</p><br/><p> Entering the bath, it was so pleasant that I felt sleepy, therefore I decided we would go to sleep for the day, however\u2013</p><br/><p> We don\u2019t have enough futons!</p><br/><p> There was only the futon that I used for my bed.</p><br/><p> Because my little sister moved in I was going to have the moving company bring her futon over, however it seems that today was just a day trip and the actual moving in had been planned for next week. I was pretty happy I could save on the moving fee with my \u3010Teleportation\u3011 and \u3010Inventory\u3011.</p><br/><p> If I knew it was going to be like this, I guess I shouldn\u2019t have left Elena\u2019s bed at the church~</p><br/><p> In the end, Aya and Elena were sleeping in my bed while cuddling together, and I slept by my lonely self curled up in the sleeping bag I bought for emergency use.</p><br/><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><br/><p> The next morning, I woke up as the sun rose, the two of them seemed to still be fast asleep. I made breakfast being careful not to wake them up.</p><br/><p> Breakfast was bacon &amp; eggs with salad and miso soup. There was still the rice left from yesterday, so I recooked it for breakfast again.</p><br/><p> When the aroma of the rice enveloped the room, the two finally woke up and so the three of us decided to eat breakfast.</p><br/><p>\u300cI also want to try using \u3010Chopsticks\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena was the only one not using \u3010Chopsticks\u3011 so she had said that.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, let\u2019s have you try out \u3010Chopsticks\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p> She answered with enthusiasm and began trying, however it didn\u2019t go well and she gradually grew teary.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, that\u2019s enough for today!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cB-but.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou won\u2019t be able to get used to it immediately. You can try it as much as you want from now on, so it\u2019s fine to slowly learn it bit by bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay!\u300d</p><br/><p> We somehow managed to finish eating our breakfast, so we decided to get ready and go to the other world.</p><br/><p> I had my denim jacket and jeans on again, but Aya and Elena are were wearing the same clothes as yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou two aren\u2019t changing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u300d\u300cYes\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen let\u2019s buy new clothes on the other side.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYay!\u300d</p><br/><p> After confirming that there\u2019s nothing we forgot to bring, I held hands with Aya and Elena\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Teleportation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> We teleported to the different other world.</p><br/><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><br/><p> Our destination was the Fountain Square again. I\u2019m relieved that it\u2019s a place we\u2019ve teleported to before.</p><br/><p>\u300eWoah! So this is another world~ Ah, there\u2019s also people with cat ears!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? I can\u2019t understand Aya-san\u2019s words anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eHuh? I suddenly can\u2019t understand Elena-chan\u2019s words anymore.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, pass over the\u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011 to Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat is it, Elena-chan? You\u2019re giving me this?\u300f</p><br/><p> Elena handed over the \u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011 to Aya, Aya\u2019s body was then enveloped in the magic stone\u2019s light.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I\u2019m able to understand now. Could it be the power of this stone?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, this stone is called the \u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011, it\u2019s a \u3010Magic Stone\u3011 that lets you use the language of the region if you use it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let\u2019s go and buy clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOooh~!\u300d</p><br/><p> The shopping at the clothes store took about an hour. I wonder why women are so slow at shopping\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> Furthermore, they also used up 1000 Aurum on buying clothes.</p><br/><p> Since a loaf of bread costs 1 Aurum, I guess 1 Aurum should be about 100 yen? In other words, if we convert 1000 Aurum to yen, then\u2026 100,000 yen?! Exactly how many clothes did they buy!?</p><br/><p> Furthermore, the two came out changed into the clothes they bought. Although they were wearing the same clothes, they were different colours. They look a bit like sisters.</p><br/><p> While Elena and Aya were delighted with their new clothes, we headed to the \u3010Temple of Wind\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe admission fee to the \u3010Mana Crystal of Wind\u3011 is \u300e 4500 Aurum\u300f per person.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWha\u2013!? So they\u2019re charging money! And on top of that, it\u2019s so expensive!!\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Such eyes prove that you were playing with women.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlaying with women? I didn\u2019t do such a thing. I searched for the Goblin King for a whole night!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Goblin King!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, yeah. I found it but since I think it\u2019s not heading to this town, it\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so? That\u2019s good. You didn\u2019t play with a woman with big breasts?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela, knowing that there was no danger of the Goblin King, heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

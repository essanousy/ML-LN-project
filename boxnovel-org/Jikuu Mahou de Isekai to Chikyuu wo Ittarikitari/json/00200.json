With this, we'll win.\u300d</p><br/><p> and unanimously shout in delight.</p><br/><p> It seems they have been considerably pressured.</p><br/><p> Aya and Mai-san charged toward the front line in order to compete\u2015</p><br/><p> and Bunmi-san began to take the command of the troops.</p><br/><p> Leaving behind Hilda and Cassandra-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it's dangerous, please move back Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, Cassandra-sama.

I'm also going to the front line.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, be careful!\u300d</p><br/><p> While entrusting them the rear guard and to not be outdone by Aya and Mai-san\u2015</p><br/><p> I went to the front line.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> With magic attacks of Elena, Cassandra-san and Hilda coming from the back\u2015</p><br/><p> a lot of spaces had been created for the front line.</p><br/><p> Although the\u300egreat rats\u300fwere large in numbers, they were weak individually\u2015</p><br/><p> I killed them continuously with the\u3010sword of trial\u3011.</p><br/><p> After fighting for a while\u2015</p><br/><p> the\u3010sword of trial\u3011began to shine.</p><br/><p> When I'm thinking what it is\u2015</p><br/><p> apparently, the trial seems to be over.</p><br/><p> When I check the surrounding situation, it seems that we have been able to push forward considerably and a space has been created on the whole.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I went to where Aya is\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Onii-chan. Here's already fine.</p><br/><p> Or rather, the enemy was too weak, it was boring.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it's a great rat.\u300d</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I went to where Mai-san is\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cMai-san, how is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, onii-san. It was just right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSomething wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI've noticed it when I was fighting together with soldiers but\u2015</p><br/><p> they seem to be somehow moving whilst controlling the ground with magic, don't they?</p><br/><p> What is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that's to help them stand firm when stepping forward with\u3010Earth magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see...... can I also do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it's necessary to acquire\u3010earth magic\u3011, it may not be possible immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, its inner workings is quite profound, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p> Let's take everyone to go and visit the mana crystal next time.</p><br/><p> It seems Hilda's study also advanced considerably as well, it will be already alright soon.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> When I came back to where Elena, Hilda, and Cassandra-san are\u2015</p><br/><p> Elena was treating the injured.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you alright, Elena?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there aren't that much injured people either so it's alright.\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, I can have a peace of mind leaving the injured people to Elena.</p><br/><p> Hilda and Cassandra-san made a\u3010Flame tornado\u3011with the composite magic of fire and wind, burying a large amount of\u300egreat rats\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cYehey!\u300d</p><br/><p> The two were pleased with the success of their combined magic and did a high-five.</p><br/><p> The\u3010Flame tornado\u3011brightly illuminated the area of the battlefield which considerably became dark.</p><br/><p> The soldiers had begun to light up\u300eBonfires\u300fhere and there in preparation for the night battle.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> Finally, I went to where Bunmi-san is.</p><br/><p>\u300cBunmi-san, what's the war situation?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji-dono.</p><br/><p> This happened during the absence of the Demon Lord-sama, I thought it will only be temporary but\u2015</p><br/><p> thanks to everyone, it seems to be alright. Thanks.\u300d</p><br/><p> I see but I wonder why the demon lord is absent.</p><br/><p> After a break comes out of the war situation, an expression of relief can be seen on Bunmi-san.</p><br/><p> At that moment\u2015</p><br/><p> I noticed that there is a strange reaction on the map.</p><br/><p> What is it?</p><br/><p> Exactly on the opposite side of the town from the place where we were fighting, there was only one red dot\u2015</p><br/><p> that dot was about to enter the town.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's happening on the other side of the town, Bunmi-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? The other side?</p><br/><p> There seems to be no report coming from the guard there.\u300d</p><br/><p> I have a bad feeling for some reason......</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll have a look at the other side of the town for a bit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmu, since there's no problem here, it seems to be fine.\u300d</p><br/><p> I rushed toward the opposite side of the town.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It had a daring, open chest design.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, did you have something to discuss with me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that's right. We have something to discuss with you about Hilda,</p><br/><p> will you go to where Rachel is?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRachel-san is in the western village of Nippo town,</p><br/><p> is Hilda there with her?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I'm going then.\u300d</p><br/><p> We headed toward the western village of Nippo town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> It had become troublesome way,</p><br/><p> after running with\u3010Lightning flash\u3011alone,</p><br/><p> I returned to pick Aya and Elena up</p><br/><p> and headed toward the western village of Nippo town</p><br/><p> using\u3010Teleportation\u3011once again.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, I'm here to see Rachel. Where is she?\u300d</p><br/><p> This is the construction site? I asked a construction worker and since he said that she's in a temporary tent, I decided to go.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you here, Rachel-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh!? I thought who it is, if it isn't newbie...no, it's Seiji, isn't it? You've already come, you're fast, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, where's Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, she's working at the back.</p><br/><p> Hey! Hilda! Come here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> A voice can be heard from the inner part of the tent and Hilda appeared.</p><br/><p> When Hilda saw my face, a joyful expression flashed from her face for an instant.</p><br/><p>\u300cRachel-sama, did call me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, we're going to discuss something a little, stay here with us too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> When Hilda went beside Rachel, Rachel started to talk.</p><br/><p>\u300cTo be honest, there's a matter about Hilda which proved to be troubling. I need your help, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p> A troubling matter about Hilda? What could it be?</p><br/><p> Hilda has an apologetic expression.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe, the 3 people of the magician unit, had been assessed for playing an active role in the war and were rewarded.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReward?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I received a peerage of a lower class aristocrat while Misha and Cassandra received a peerage of quasi-aristocrat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCongratulations.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.</p><br/><p> Because of that, we can't stay as adventurers now that we became aristocrats.</p><br/><p> I, as the new village chief,</p><br/><p> Misha as a maid,</p><br/><p> and Cassandra as the\u300eSpecial envoy\u300fof the newly established trade with the demonkind.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThose are great responsibilities.\u300d</p><br/><p> Though Misha's job as a maid seemed to be carefree.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right.</p><br/><p> That's why I've been troubled about Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda's body jerked.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda is a slave bought by the money the 3 of us contributed. There's no problem as long as the three of us are acting together but now, we are acting separately.</p><br/><p> I'm taking care of her for the time being but,</p><br/><p> it's unfair for me to employ Hilda alone.</p><br/><p> We can just simply sell her to the slave traders and divide the gold into 3 parts but......</p><br/><p> apparently, it doesn't seem probable either.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda distributed the candy during the war, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe demonkind's soldiers wanted to thank her for that,</p><br/><p> if it become known to them that she has been sold to the slave traders, it may become problematic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what are you going to do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's where you come in, Seiji.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMe?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWill you take Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPardon!?\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

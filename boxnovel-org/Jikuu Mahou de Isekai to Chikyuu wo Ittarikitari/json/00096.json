Don\u2019t remember a person by his armor.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou had been wearing your armor and your face was hidden all the while at that time, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m a famous person so it can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, Rondo-sama is the heir of\u300eWarstar family\u300fwho governs the Nippo town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNippo town\u2026 where the fighting competition was held? You participated in the town\u2019s competition which your family governs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing doesn\u2019t matter, didn\u2019t you come here to report the food theft?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I told Rondo about the food theft.</p><br/><p>\u300cUnh, it\u2019s hard to suddenly believe that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Is it common for the people from the Slums to commit a crime?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe crime\u2019s modus operandi was too brilliant. Almost all of the troops of us aristocrats gathered in Shiju town were robbed of almost all the food simultaneously. That was despite our strict security.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, true, such a large-scale and systematic crime was difficult to do with only the people from the Slums.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not that I doubt you but do you have any evidence?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I\u2019ll show you evidence.\u300d</p><br/><p>I showed the video recordings of the\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011attached to the bag of wheat flour to Rondo.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease keep this a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-, Ou.\u300d</p><br/><p>I closed the video after the perpetrators reverted back to orc form\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cAn orc!? People turned into orcs!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s the opposite, the orc disguised themselves as people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I explained its connection with\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011, Rondo frowned\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand that the orcs are plotting something. But the problem is how was the information about the security leaked to the orcs? This crime was evidently poked at the gap of the security.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about the people who knew the information about the security?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe information about the security were discussed amongst the gathered aristocrats. If it was leaked then someone eavesdropped on the discussion.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOr, the participants spilled the information.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? Are you saying that there\u2019s a traitor amongst the aristocrats?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo, do you think there is none?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026There might be\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAmongst the aristocrats\u2019 troops, is there any unit whose food wasn\u2019t stolen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, all the campaigning aristocrats\u2019 troops have had their food stolen.\u300d</p><br/><p>N? Something feels wrong. What is it, I wonder?</p><br/><p>\u300cPutting the perpetrators aside. I know where the food is hidden, shall we take the food back for the time being?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShinju town is govern by\u300eAzos Family\u300f, even if we go and take it back, we need to get permission from the Azos family.\u300d</p><br/><p>An aristocrat is an aristocrat, quite troublesome.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We were taken to the Azos Family\u2019s mansion by Rondo.</p><br/><p>But, this mansion smelled something like\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Thanks to Rondo, we get through inside smoothly. We were able to meet the current head of the family.</p><br/><p>The Azos Family head was a fat old man with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems the rumor about you getting a hold of the information about the food theft is true, but are those the perpetrators?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, this person is the eye-witness. And this lady is Princess Elena Delaidos.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPrincess!? Please forgive my rudeness.\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, there was something strange about this old man\u2019s gaze at Elena.</p><br/><p>For the sake of Elena\u2019s security, I removed Aya\u2019s tracking beacon and put it on this old man.</p><br/><p>I explained the eye-witness report about the food theft and showed the video recordings of the beacon\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy can\u2019t you give the permission to search the Slums! Isn\u2019t it projected clearly that the perpetrators hid the food in the Slums\u2019 warehouse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not guaranteed that the video recording magic is true, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat Seiji-sama said was the truth. I vouch for it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s like this, Elena-sama. Even though Elena-sama is royalty, you have no formal authority. All the authority with regards to this town\u2019s politics was granted to me. Your wish to interfere is futile.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, you\u2019re being rude towards Elena-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s rude.\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo and Azos started to confront each other.</p><br/><p>In the end, we didn\u2019t manage to obtain permission to search the slums. We went back to Rondo\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>\u300cPerchance, Azos was the one who spilled the information?\u300d</p><br/><p>Probably, it surely is.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, the other campaigning aristocrats and my troops couldn\u2019t move without permission.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShall I take it back?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? But, the enemy is a horde of orcs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you forget who won the championship at the fighting competition?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see\u2026\u2026 but, can you get it back while avoiding as much commotion as possible?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah\u2026\u2026 it would probably be alright at night.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, you can easily sneak in at night, huh. Alright, I\u2019ll entrust this matter to you. Since I\u2019ll make necessary arrangements with other aristocrats, I\u2019ll leave it to you!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left Rondo\u2019s tent and booked a room at the inn.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, are you really going alone?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, because I\u2019ll only get the food back secretly without fighting this time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, please be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>Because there was still a little time before evening, I retrieved the completed equipment at the weapon shop in Suga town.</p><br/><p>\u30fbNecklace of Lightning +4 (Mithril)</p><br/><p>\u30fbRecovery staff +3 (Thousand years old Sakura)</p><br/><p>\u30fbNecklace of recovery +3 (Mithril)</p><br/><p>\u30fbHair ornaments of Wind +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbWind rod +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbHair ornaments of Water +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbWater rod +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbHair ornaments of Ice +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbIce rod +1</p><br/><p>\u30fbDarkness rod +1</p><br/><p>It has become a considerably luxurious collection.</p><br/><p>Then, after waiting for the sun to set and the sky to darken, I went to the slums.</p><br/><p>Although it would be effortless if I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011, </p><br/><p>when I checked the warehouse\u2019s surveillance video, I saw several orcs guarding it. There would be a possibility of being found out when I teleport.</p><br/><p>Inevitably, I had to use\u3010Night shade\u3011and went towards the slums on foot.</p><br/><p>But, this slum had an intense smell of a rotten fish. Its entrance was full of orcs.</p><br/><p>Well, I didn\u2019t get exposed so far.</p><br/><p>Although I\u2019m using\u3010Night shade\u3011, I was worried if I really won\u2019t get exposed. I moved sneakily as much as possible for me to not get caught. Finally, I arrived in front of the warehouse.</p><br/><p>But, the sizes of the lined up barracks-like buildings around this warehouse clearly looked out of place.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, the slums were possibly built around this warehouse.</p><br/><p>I checked the warehouse\u2019s surroundings but there wasn\u2019t something I can sneak into.</p><br/><p>Since it can\u2019t be helped, I waited for the guard to be changed and snuck in in that interval.</p><br/><p>About 3 orcs stood guard inside the warehouse but I caught them off guard.</p><br/><p>I put the 3 orcs to sleep using\u3010Sleep\u3011and beheaded them, and put them away in the inventory.</p><br/><p>I tinkered with the door of the warehouse in order for it to not be easily opened. I had the tracking beacon transferred to the warehouse\u2019s door from the bag of flour.</p><br/><p>After that, I slowly stored all the food inside the warehouse to the inventory and returned using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>When I returned to the inn, Elena was still awake while rubbing her sleepy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, welcome back. Are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re still awake, Elena? It\u2019s fine if you have gone to sleep first.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI won\u2019t go to sleep with such reasoning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it\u2019s already late, we\u2019ll deliver the food back tomorrow, let\u2019s now go to sleep.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and I slept soundly on the double bed.</p><br/><p>Huh? Somehow, aren\u2019t I becoming unusually too familiar with Elena by sleeping together?</p><br/><p>Well ,whatever\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m not mistaken, the title stands for Metal Gear Solid, an action-adventure stealth video game where the player needs to infiltrate some enemy base undetected by hiding or making use of objects like, in a sense, what Seiji did in this chapter.

Do you prefer a younger girl like that?\u300d</p><br/><p>Hearing the conversation of the director and me, the director\u2019s wife butts in.</p><br/><p>The director\u2019s wife looks quite young, particularly her chest that goes *bain bain*.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s probably the effect of the you-know-what potion.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou mustn\u2019t say such a stupid thing, you\u2019re always the number one.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDarling!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMy dear!\u300d</p><br/><p>The director and his wife forgot about me and began to flirt.</p><br/><p>Explode!</p><br/><p>When I escaped from the director and his wife,</p><br/><p>I was caught by the president and Megumi-chan this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama-kun, are you enjoying yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUm, I guess so.\u300d</p><br/><p>The president seems to be accustomed to such party.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Maruyama. Why are you here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Megumi, you\u2019re being rude to Maruyama-kun.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, Maruyama is just a rank and file employee, isn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>He\u2019s out of place in the party hosted by the world-famous Nancy\u30fbJewelry.\u300d</p><br/><p>The president keeps apologizing to me with glances.</p><br/><p>He also has a position as an ojii-chan.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama-kun is Nancy\u2019s acquaintance, you know?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, there\u2019s that connection, huh.</p><br/><p>But since you, sticking out like a sore thumb doesn\u2019t change, behave yourself.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cH-, Haa\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.What\u2019s this?</p><br/><p>If I\u2019m not mistaken, Megumi-chan is 15 years old?</p><br/><p>Her bad character is by no means inferior to Aya,</p><br/><p>but a\u300espoiled\u300fJC[2] is a cute one.</p><br/><p>Is it a reverse-reward for some fans[3]?</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat are you smirking at!? Gross!</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019d like to drink an orange juice, go get me one, Maruyama.\u300d</p><br/><p>What is this, a play?</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I will get you an orange juice, wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>Unable to remain indifferent, the president went to get an orange juice on his own initiative.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama. What are you doing, making the president work!?</p><br/><p>At a time like this, you, who is a rank and file employee, should move on your own initiative!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, You\u2019re quite right.\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an orange juice and the president went somewhere to get one.</p><br/><p>Wait, president. Don\u2019t leave me and this girl with just the two of us!</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan and I were left behind and an awkward atmosphere was flowing.</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan folds her arms, showing an angry appearance; and frequently looks at me.</p><br/><p>Do you have something you want to say?</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you a\u2026n-, ninja?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHa?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo-! I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019re a ninja!\u300d</p><br/><p>Umu, as expected, Megumi-chan seems to be suspicious if I was the ninja at that time.</p><br/><p>\u300cUhh, does Megumi-chan like ninjas?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has nothing to do with me liking them!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that right~, since there\u2019s a ninja museum in Mie Prefecture, you can probably ask the president to bring you there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNobody would ask such a thing!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, how about ninja animes?</p><br/><p>Ninja turtle or something like that~~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMou! I\u2019m not a child!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The president returned.</p><br/><p>\u300cMegumi, look, I\u2019ve got an orange juice.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEnough already! I don\u2019t want an orange juice!\u300d</p><br/><p>Megumi-chan sulked and went somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama-kun, sorry. With a spoiled girl\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll treat you to lunch next time.\u300d</p><br/><p>The president said so and ran after Megumi-chan.</p><br/><p>The president seems to have it hard, too.~</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>After a short time, *kui kui* Ringo tugged at my sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u300cUh\u2026Seiji-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI, uh\u2026\u2026could you introduce me to the president of the Nancy\u30fbJewelry?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, sure.\u300d</p><br/><p>I escorted Ringo and went over to where Nancy and Nancy\u2019s mom is.</p><br/><p>\u300cNancy, Ringo wants you to introduce her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, there was such a promise, huh.</p><br/><p>Mama, this is\u300eRingo\u300f, she\u2019s good at drawing.</p><br/><p>Ringo, this is my mama. Do you know my mama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes. I know! It\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s mom, who was accustomed to something like this, normally shook hands with Ringo, who was very tense.</p><br/><p>\u300cRingo-san, please get along well with Nancy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes!\u300d</p><br/><p>It was peaceful up to there, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>*Tsuka tsuka* Nancy\u2019s mom suddenly approaches Ringo and grabs her by the collar![4]</p><br/><p>\u300cMama, what are you doing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, uh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Ringo doesn\u2019t understand, too and is confused.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026this brooch. What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?? Brooch??</p><br/><p>Uhh, uhh\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems like Nancy\u2019s mom isn\u2019t grabbing Ringo\u2019s collar,</p><br/><p>but instead, she seems to be observing the brooch on her chest.</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s mom seemed to be strangely excited,</p><br/><p>while Ringo was flustered at the sudden event.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s no helping it, I explain it.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a hand-crafted accessory that Ringo designed.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHand-crafted? Did Ringo-san make it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, it\u2019s my design,</p><br/><p>but it\u2019s Seiji who made it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji! You-!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s mom grabbed me by the collar this time.</p><br/><p>This time, she\u2019s really grabbing me by the collar.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you know?</p><br/><p>It\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]Lit. mean Shichi-go-san.

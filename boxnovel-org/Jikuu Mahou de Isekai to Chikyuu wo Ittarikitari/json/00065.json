W-, What kind of situation is this?</p><br/><p>Elena was walking at the shopping district. And has been called out by the shopping district\u2019s store\u2019s occhan and obaa-chan one after another. It\u2019s totally similar to a local idol.</p><br/><p>Well, Elena\u2019s looks stand out in Japan, she also has good personality, there\u2019s also the aura of a genuine princess, so it can\u2019t be helped but to attract attention.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Elena-chan, thank goodness you\u2019re here.

I thought she was going shopping and buy various things, was it a gift?</p><br/><p>After that, Elena also treated a lot of illness and injuries using magic with the pretext of using\u300egood luck charm\u300fwhile getting various things in return as she went on in the shopping district.</p><br/><p>\u300cKya, ouch!\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems a little girl fell down and has a scraped knee.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood gracious, it\u2019s terrible.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena healed the injured girl with magic. When you look around, there were people who were surprised. It might be bad.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you oneechan.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re welcome.\u300d</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t sneak away from work but I\u2019m anxious-</p><br/><p>a bunch of obaachan from the shopping district surrounded Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cYour\u300egood luck charm\u300fis amazing~, it can also examine and apply to sprain injury.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you also examine my joint pain?\u300d</p><br/><p>It gradually became a little serious somehow.</p><br/><p>Elena used magic to everyone eventually and was given various things that she wasn\u2019t able to carry them anymore.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s so many, I won\u2019t be able to hold them anymore.\u300d, Elena refused and was escorted by an\u300eoniisan\u300fwith innocent face who works as a baggage carrier at the shopping district.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry to have you carry the baggage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-, No, I-, I\u2019m free anyway.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and innocent faced head towards our house while talking happily. However, why was the topic of these two be magical girl anime?</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena-san, do you c-, cosplay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s cosplay?\u300d</p><br/><p>This guy brought up such topic to Elena!</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Eto, it\u2019s to wear outfits the same as magical girl, a-, and take pictures.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s interesting.~\u300d</p><br/><p>This innocent faced, is he a dangerous guy!?</p><br/><p>Elena reached home eventually and bid goodbye to innocent faced.</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you for carrying the baggage.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN-, No.\u300d</p><br/><p>I look at the video while worrying. However, innocent faced bowed and went back quickly. It seems my worries were groundless. Well,\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic also didn\u2019t react, it may not be a strange thing to escort by the request of everyone at the shopping district.</p><br/><p>Elena put the gifts at the refrigerator and cabinets, she brewed her own tea and began to watch DVD.</p><br/><p>That was kinda worrisome, I wonder if it\u2019s alright for the time being?</p><br/><p>Since Elena is going to watch DVD for while, let\u2019s check up on Aya\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>Aya is going through the club invitations while chatting with several group of girls. Did you already made friends!? I can\u2019t completely grasp her communication skills.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, what club are you going to join?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI might join the combat sport2 club.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Is Aya-san one of those group of people?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya in combat sport!? There were times when I turn up, I did things i.e body press when I was a child, it was indeed surprising for her to be interested in that sort of thing. I wonder if she had awakened to some strange thing while fighting in the other world. </p><br/><p>In the end, Aya look around at the girls\u2019 group\u2019s club invitations, sneakily look inside the shops around the junior college and had a tea at a fast food restaurant.</p><br/><p>Is Aya really going to start combat sport?</p><br/><p>And I wonder if Elena won\u2019t experience an accident causing her magic to get exposed?</p><br/><p>While thinking such thing, I had completely neglected my work, I finished it by putting\u3010Quick\u3011magic on myself.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1\u304a\u307e\u3058\u306a\u3044 can be translated to good luck charm/spell, it this case it might be close to incantation of sort, just imagine someone uttering nonsense when trying easing the pain of a child when they fell down and had a scraped knee or something.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2 or Kakutogi.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

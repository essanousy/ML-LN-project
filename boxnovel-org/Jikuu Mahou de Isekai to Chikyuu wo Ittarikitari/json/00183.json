I wonder why I didn't notice?</p><br/><p> It's just that I panicked.</p><br/><p> It's behind the central\u300epillar\u300f.</p><br/><p> If it's this\u300epillar\u300f, it will surely not be destroyed.</p><br/><p> It will not be destroyed, right?</p><br/><p> I was relieved to find a proper safe zone, I took out sweets from the inventory and restored my MP.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, let's counterattack!\u300d</p><br/><p> I dodged the\u3010right straight\u3011and slashed at it as a counter.</p><br/><p> I moved toward its back with\u3010Teleportation\u3011when it used the\u3010Stone floor fling attack\u3011and slashed at its back when it had finished throwing.</p><br/><p> Once it entered the preparation of\u3010omnidirectional stone pellets\u3011, I slashed at its defenseless spot.</p><br/><p> At the end of it all, I slashed at it with the sword of trial imbued with all my magic power.</p><br/><p> And then, once the\u3010omnidirectional stone pellets\u3011starts, I will take a short break behind the central pillar.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's no good when I was panicking at first but it's quite an easy victory.</p><br/><p> I won't be afraid of anything anymore!\u300d</p><br/><p> However, it was then when the Golem's HP had been shaved off by 1/4.</p><br/><p> The Golem began to stomp its foot on the ground causing a frightful tremor.</p><br/><p> And then, the Golem attacked as its whole body became bright red.</p><br/><p> Its speed becomes faster!</p><br/><p> Its\u3010right straight\u3011becomes\u3010one-two punch\u3011!</p><br/><p> However, I've dodged it somehow and made a counter.</p><br/><p>*Slash!*</p><br/><p> Huh? Is the Golem's body somewhat a little soft?</p><br/><p> Does its speed rose while its defense dropped when it entered rage mode?</p><br/><p> The\u3010Stone floor fling attack\u3011has thrown a total of two rocks with its right and left hand having one each.</p><br/><p> However, there has been no problem since I've only moved behind it with\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p> Since it entered the preparation of\u3010omnidirectional stone pellets\u3011, I kept on slashing at it.</p><br/><p> *Slash slash* slashing at it felt good.</p><br/><p> Then, the Golem began to shook in the middle of its preparation of the\u3010omnidirectional stone pellets\u3011.</p><br/><p> Hm?</p><br/><p> Is a different attack going to come again!?</p><br/><p> When I took some distance and observed it......</p><br/><p> the golem's body began to collapse with *crumble crumble*.</p><br/><p> What on earth has happened!?</p><br/><p>\u300eLevel went up to 49.</p><br/><p> \u3010Earth magic\u3011is now level 5.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cEe!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Ah,so I've defeated it!!</p><br/><p>\u300cYay!!

I'm the\u300eEarth spirit\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p> That fellow is a ponytail girl that gives off an impression of a construction worker.</p><br/><p> Or rather, this fellow is an orekko[1], huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cBut I haven't used the summoning magic!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is a special case.\u300d</p><br/><p> When the\u300eEarth spirit\u300fsaid so, it kissed me on my forehead.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Earth magic\u3011is now level 6.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cEee~~~!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWith this, the contract has been established.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's going on!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause I helped out the Golem from earlier.</p><br/><p> In other words, it has been deemed as having the ability to win in the fight of spirit contract.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please take care of me from now on, 'kay!\u300d</p><br/><p> When the\u300eEarth spirit\u300fsaid so, it entered my body.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you serious!?\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> I've freaked out by the sudden appearance of the\u300eEarth spirit\u300fbut\u2015</p><br/><p> my whole body has been covered with wounds from the battle a little while ago.</p><br/><p> I'll quickly go back after checking the Golem's loot.</p><br/><p> When I removed the rock which formed the Golem, there was a magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Magic stone of earth\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502It makes the surrounding land fertile</p><br/><p>\u2502and accelerates the growth of the plants.</p><br/><p>\u2502The effect is enhanced when loaded with magic power</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> Maximum rarity!?</p><br/><p> Isn't this amazing!!?</p><br/><p> When I stared at the magic stone\u2015</p><br/><p>*Rattle rattle!*</p><br/><p> I've heard a sound of something from behind.</p><br/><p> There's still something?</p><br/><p> Looking back, a stone door appears in the central pillar and opens with *creak creak*.</p><br/><p> When I approach and peek inside\u2015</p><br/><p> the inside of the pillar has become hallow and there's a spiral staircase towards the top.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood. I can go to the top with this.\u300d</p><br/><p> When I looked around, the\u3010Spatial Combat Protective Barrier\u3011had also been released.</p><br/><p> Fatigue came on suddenly from feeling relieved of finding the stairs, I used\u3010teleportation\u3011where Elena and the others are waiting and returned to the inn.</p><br/><p>[1] Orekko or Ore-girl.

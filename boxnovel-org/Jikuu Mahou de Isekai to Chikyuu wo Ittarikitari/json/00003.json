I see I see~</p><br/><p> I decided to try using the \u3010Tracking\u3011 magic</p><br/><p> D-Don\u2019t misunderstand! It\u2019s not like I intend to use for anything weird!</p><br/><p> When I secretly use \u3010Tracking\u3011 on Elena-chan, a map was displayed and a flashing dot showing Elena-chan\u2019s position on the map appeared.</p><br/><p> When I tried to sense the location of the tracking, video and audio streamed into my head.</p><br/><p> A close-up of Elena-chan suddenly streamed in. I was surprised but I also heard the voices of the king\u2019s group whispering.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe failed the enslavement. At this rate, that guy will be a threat!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow should we deal with him?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLyle Gewalt, I\u2019ll give this job to you\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes my king, what kind of job is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll attract that guy\u2019s attention, you\u2019ll kill him with your sword from behind\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUnderstood, please leave it to me\u300d</p><br/><p> Seriously! Deciding to kill all of a sudden, what\u2019s with the people of this country!?</p><br/><p> I\u2019ll also use \u3010Appraisal\u3011 on that guy called Lyle Gewalt</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Name: Lyle Gewalt</p><br/><p>\u2502Occupation: Aristocracy Union Knight Leader</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Level: 20</p><br/><p>\u2502HP: 150</p><br/><p>\u2502MP: 20</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Power: 17</p><br/><p>\u2502Ability: 15</p><br/><p>\u2502Endurance: 14</p><br/><p>\u2502Magic Power: 2</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Skills</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Sword Techniques\u3011(Level: 2)</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u2022 Vertical Slash</p><br/><p>\u2502 \u2022 Double Slash</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> He seems strong, there\u2019s no way I could kill him if we fought normally, I don\u2019t have a weapon either. I guess I\u2019ll have to somehow use \u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011. I did put up a barrier but how much attacks can it defend against?</p><br/><p> Since I don\u2019t know the to what extent of an attack it can defend against, I can\u2019t really rely on it much.</p><br/><p> While thinking about that, a red dot appeared on the map showing Lyle Gewalt\u2019s position. Is this because I recognise him as an enemy?</p><br/><p> After a while, the king\u2019s group seemed to have finished whispering and the people who gathered returned to their original position.</p><br/><p> Lyle Gewalt moved towards right behind me under the cover of the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ve made you wait, thou must subdue the demon lord. To begin with, a demon lord is something that carries out atrocious acts\uff5e\u300d</p><br/><p> The king began a forced, bombastic speech.</p><br/><p> The king seemed to frequently look at Lyle Gewalt while making the speech.</p><br/><p> Then at that time.</p><br/><p>\u300cF-Father! This kind of things, please st\u300cElena!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena interrupted the king\u2019s speech, trying to say something, but the king stopped it by angrily shouting.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, I\u2019m talking about something important right now. Wait in another room until I\u2019m done!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut Father!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEnough! Take the princess to another room!\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena is surrounded by several soldiers and taken away by force.</p><br/><p> After checking the \u3010Tracking\u3011 video, the princess was taken out of the room while crying.</p><br/><p> Was Princess Elena trying to warn be about the danger?</p><br/><p> While the room was noisy, the king sent a wink towards my behind.</p><br/><p> I suddenly sensed \u3010Danger\u3011 from behind.</p><br/><p> I immediately warped with \u3010Teleportation\u3011 across from the king, a sword swung down from behind where I was at before and the metallic sound of the sword hitting the floor rang.</p><br/><p> It was Lyle Gewalt as I had expected.</p><br/><p> Just to make sure, I use the \u3010Slow\u3011 magic on Lyle Gewalt.</p><br/><p> Lyle Gewalt noticed I teleported and began to pursue. However, with \u3010Quick\u3011 on me and \u3010Slow\u3011 on Lyle Gewalt, his attacks were like they were in slow motion to me.</p><br/><p> I carefully observe Lyle Gewalt\u2019s actions and just before the moment his left foot stepped on the floor, I managed a leg sweep.</p><br/><p> Breaking Lyle Gewalt\u2019s posture he used his left hand to stop his fall on the floor, but I kicked that left hand.</p><br/><p> Without the support of his left hand, Lyle Gewalt crashed into the floor with his face.</p><br/><p> In the interval, with \u3010Teleportation\u3011 I jumped to a common soldier who was dumbfounded and stole his sword.</p><br/><p> Lyle Gewalt stubbornly got up, charging towards me again. And then the moment he swung down his sword at me! With the sword I just stole, I finished up with a counter.</p><br/><p>CLANG CLANG</p><br/><p> In the room that fell silent, the sound of the sword falling down reverberated.</p><br/><p> Along with the sword, Lyle Gewalt\u2019s wrist also fell.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuoough!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Lyle Gewalt tumbled in agony.</p><br/><p> The people around held their breaths from the results of the event.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I want that katana!!</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s wrong, Seiji? It\u2019s dangerous for you to look away.\u300f</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right,</p><br/><p>I put\u3010Slow\u3011on the Goblin King and\u3010Quick\u3011on Aya, Demon lord-sama and me, and prepared the Mithril sword.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s this? It\u2019s similar to body reinforcement magic.</p><br/><p>Were you the one who put it on, Seiji?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, yes. The magic has similar effect to\u3010Movement speed reinfocement\u3011.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see, humans\u2019 magic is interesting.\u300f</p><br/><p>While having such a talk\u2015</p><br/><p>The Goblin King swung down its enormous club.</p><br/><p>I promptly took a distance.</p><br/><p>The Demon lord-sama took on the club with the pitch-black Japanese sword.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the ground shook.</p><br/><p>The Demon-lord-sama was as fit as a fiddle.</p><br/><p>\u300eHou, it has considerable offensive power,</p><br/><p>No wonder even Bunmi was injured.\u300f</p><br/><p>Huh? Something is strange.</p><br/><p>When Bunmi-san blocked the King\u2019s attack, the area under his feet became a crater.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t happen in the case of the Demon lord-sama.</p><br/><p>The Demon-lord took on the King\u2019s attack 2 times, 3 times. Each time, a wave-like ripples spread through the ground.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s it! Diffusing the impact using Earth magic!</p><br/><p>I immediately jump to test it out,</p><br/><p>as I land, I tried to diffuse the impact with Earth magic.</p><br/><p>Interesting! Although the ground\u2019s surface is soft, it feels like concrete when I jump.</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I tried to further increase the impact I absorb from the ground.</p><br/><p>This time, I can jump similar to a trampoline!</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, Seiji. What are you playing at?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Just, it seemed interesting.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve been scolded by the Demon lord-sama. The Demon lord-sama began to fight the King and isn\u2019t it somewhat difficult to make a move on?</p><br/><p>Aya was troubled and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u300cNee, oniichan. Who\u2019s that person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat man is the Demon lord-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEe, so that person is the Demon lord, huh.</p><br/><p>What were you doing a little while ago, oniichan?</p><br/><p>You made strange movements.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook at the Demon lord-sama\u2019s feet carefully.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, he\u2019s doing some kind of magic!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, I was imitating it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow do you do that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbsorb the impact on the ground with magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbsorb the impact?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou do it like this.\u300d</p><br/><p>I showed it by running and jumping.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, I\u2019m going to try it as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>As Aya said so, she began to run around the Goblin King quickly using the Earth magic\u2019s impact.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou guys have been annoying since a little while ago!</p><br/><p>Be quiet.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSorry.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, it seems it annoys the Demon lord-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t know.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, snuck around behind the King\u2019s back and began to attack its foot.</p><br/><p>The Goblin King seemed to be annoyed by Aya\u2019s attack and occasionally tried to stomp its foot.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s dangerous.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped, I\u2019m going to fight as well.</p><br/><p>I kicked the ground with Earth magic, increasing my speed, and charged toward the Goblin King.</p><br/><p>The single blow of the Mithril sword had been nearly warded off, dealing a 30 cm deep scratch.</p><br/><p>The Goblin King grimaced from the pain and scowled at me.</p><br/><p>That action caused it to take its eyes off of Demon lord-sama for an instant.</p><br/><p>Demon lord-sama didn\u2019t overlook the chance,</p><br/><p>with a single blow of the Demon lord-sama\u2019s Japanese sword,</p><br/><p>30 cm below the knee of the Goblin King\u2019s left leg had been completely severed.</p><br/><p>As one would expect, the Goblin King could not remain standing,</p><br/><p>and fell down on its knees\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the next instant!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Demon lord-sama landed and sheathed the Japanese sword\u2015</p><br/><p>Behind him,</p><br/><p>with a *goron*, the Goblin King\u2019s head rolled over to the ground.</p><br/><p>Fa!? When did Demon Lord-sama attack!?</p><br/><p>The Goblin King, who had been decapitated,</p><br/><p>keeled over just like that.</p><br/><p>The impact resounded throughout the surroundings.</p><br/><p>The Demon lord-sama held the freshly-severed head of the Goblin King,</p><br/><p>raising it up high.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u300e\u300eUooooo!!\u300f\u300f\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDemon lord-sama defeated the Goblin King!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The demonkind soldiers cheered.</p><br/><p>The surviving goblins, who saw the freshly-severed head of the Goblin King, escaped at full speed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Huh? There are various colors\u2026\u2026 can I appraise it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay but\u2026\u2026 hm? Kiseri-san can use\u3010Appraisal\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, what I use is the thing called\u3010Magic stone of Appraisal\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo there\u2019s such a thing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please excuse me.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san began to appraise\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cFa!? What\u2019s this magic stone!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san appraised Elena\u2019s pink magic stone and stared at it.</p><br/><p>*Fidgets*Elena was embarrassed for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it fine without staring at it too much?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It was unintentional.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san\u2019s face suddenly became serious\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cMost are\u300e+1\u300fin quality and to put it bluntly, it\u2019s admirable. But, with respect to these 2, they can\u2019t be\u3010Appraised\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san points at the pink and violet magic stone.</p><br/><p>Oops! I also had taken out the Lightning reinforcement magic stone!</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic stone of Appraisal\u3011can only appraise up to\u300e+1\u300f, they should be\u300e+2\u300for above. The pink magic stone is probably a\u3010Recovery reinforcement magic stone\u3011. But, the violet one\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t know. What is this?\u300d</p><br/><p>What to do, being asked seriously, it would be embarrassing to lie.</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease absolutely keep this a secret. Okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is\u2026\u2026 a\u3010Lightning reinforcement magic stone\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!!!? No! Because! Such\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san froze.</p><br/><p>\u300cOy, Kiseri-san. Are you okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFa!? I\u2019m sorry. Tsu! What kind of thing is Lightning? There was only one person who managed to acquire it so far! Was Seiji-san that person?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, it\u2019s probably another person.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Such\u2026\u2026 No, I haven\u2019t heard such a story!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, because I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I talked about being able to use Lightning magic, was it going to be this kind of reaction? I\u2019ll be careful from now on.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt any rate, please keep it a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, there\u2019s no problem if I want to put these magic stones on equipment at the weapon shop in Suga town, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, but\u2026\u2026 if there are any excess magic stones, by all means, please sell it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left the shop and went to the weapon shop in Suga town.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome! tsu!

They are\u300e+3\u300fand\u300e+4\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWere you surprised?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, without exaggeration, I was surprised. Moreover, Lightning\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease craft equipment with these.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, \u300e+1\u300fis good for normal equipment but for\u300e+3\u300fand\u300e+4\u300f, you need to prepare highest foundation, would that be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYea, are you going to make them yourself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, since I have a\u300eStaff\u300fmade of a thousand year old sakura tree, the\u3010Recovery reinforcement magic stone +3\u3011will be mounted on it. And the\u3010Recovery reinforcement magic stone +3\u3011and\u3010Lightning magic stone +4\u3011to each of the 2\u300eNecklaces\u300fmade of Mithril, would that be okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, then please. How long will it take and how much?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAfter a long time, I\u2019m itching to put my skills to use.~ Since I\u2019ll only mount the magic stones on those things, they\u2019ll be ready tomorrow. Please wait a moment, I\u2019ll just calculate the price.\u300d</p><br/><p>Including the mounting fee, the prices were as follows.</p><br/><p>A thousand year old Sakura Staff: 10, 200A</p><br/><p>Mithril necklaces: 5, 200A x 2</p><br/><p>Hair ornaments (brass): 1, 200A x 3 (Wind, Water and Ice +1)</p><br/><p>Rod (brass): 1, 200A x 4 (Wind, Water, Ice and Darkness + 1)</p><br/><p>Totaled 29, 000A.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019ll come to pick them up tomorrow, thank you very much for your help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLeave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>We left the weapon shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, are the preparations complete with this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right.~ Since there\u2019s a bit of extra time, shall we go and hunt the orcs around the Ikebu town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOkay.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>That day, we continued to hunt orcs until sunset. Since the orcs were scattered about, we were able to hunt about 50 of them in the end. There were still about 200 orcs in the forest roaming about. </p><br/><p>Will Lela be alright?</p><br/><p>We were going to have dinner back in Japan, but because we were worried about the orcs, we ate dinner at Ikebu town and continued to watch out for the orcs for a while.</p><br/><p>Since there was no signs of movements yet, we returned to Japan. While we weren\u2019t here, we prayed for the orcs to not attack.</p><br/><p>But.</p><br/><p>After a while when we returned to Japan.</p><br/><p>Until the date changes, we weren\u2019t able to return to the other world during which,\u2015</p><br/><p>the tracking beacon issued forth a\u300eCaution\u300f.</p><br/><p>I was able to only watch the situation\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

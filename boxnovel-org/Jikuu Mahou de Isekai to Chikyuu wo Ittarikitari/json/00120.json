A dragon doesn\u2019t harm humans in general, but hates to have its \u201cgekirin\u201d (scale) touched. It is said that if a \u201cgekirin\u201d were touched, the dragon would become furious and kill the person responsible immediately. Therefore, \u201cGekirin ni fureru\u201d means, \u201cto incur the wrath of the Emperor; to provoke the Emperor\u2019s wrath; to step on the toes of a man in power\u201d.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How was it?\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena greets me.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya and the others are being interrogated by the police. Well, they'll take the last train home.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, that means, the incident was resolved?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, no one should be getting attacked anymore.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m so glad!\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, it doesn\u2019t mean that the problem is completely solved, though.</p><br/><p>That's right, the mastermind, that fellow [Gold], is still free to do whatever he wants.</p><br/><p>When I looked into the [Tracking Beacon]\u2019s video that I attached to [Gold], he's still only walking back and forth restlessly, waiting for a message. </p><br/><p>Haven\u2019t you received a message that the terrorism failed?</p><br/><p>When I was looking at [Gold]\u2019s situation like this, [Hiyama Ai] entered into the room [Gold] was in in a big hurry.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s wrong, Ai, did something happen?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI-, It\u2019s a disaster. Please look at the news.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eHm? The news?\u300f</p><br/><p>[Gold] turned on the TV in the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt has become a disaster. After continuously modifying the program\u2019s contents, I give you the news flash of Tokyo\u2019s synchronized, multiple terrorism incident.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300eTerrorism incident\u2026wha-?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s not only that, the Nancy\u30fbJewelry staffs seemed to be involved with this terrorism.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat did you say!?\u300f</p><br/><p>Huh? That fellow, Gold, is really surprised. </p><br/><p>Although he should be the one who requested them, why is he surprised?</p><br/><p>Was the mafias action different from what Gold requested?</p><br/><p>Hmmm, I don\u2019t really get it.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I made tea.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>While drinking the tea that Elena made, I decided to look at the others\u2019 situation with Elena.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300eAs I've said! The three of us--mama, Elena and me went to worship!\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eThat person called Elena, where is she?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u2026s-, she disappeared.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems Nancy is being asked about the situation by the police.</p><br/><p>\u300eAccording to the other people, there was..an angel who healed wounds using magic; you\u2019re testifying\u2026\u2026that the one called Elena is that angel\u2026is that correct?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eT-, That\u2019s right\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou don\u2019t believe me!? It\u2019s true!!\u300f</p><br/><p>The policeman looked troubled.</p><br/><p>\u300eI think that would be all, Nancy-san, you had a very scary experience today. Excessive stress causes our proper judgement to get out of order. Such a thing is a common topic.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eB-, But\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eLet\u2019s think sensibly. On this Earth, a magic that heals wounds, does it exists?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eNo\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, a person suddenly disappearing, is there something like that?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u2026no\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, she seems to be unable to make him believe about Elena and is perplexed. </p><br/><p>I\u2019m sorry, Nancy.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut still-! Elena was there!!!\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u2026I see, Nancy seems to be quite tired. Let\u2019s hear about the story again another day.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eOkay\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Nancy hang her head low and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I feel a little sorry for Nancy-san.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>Mama-san was asked about the story in another room.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, don\u2019t you have any idea that you were going to be attacked?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s impossible!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBut, the fact is that, not only you and your daughter, Nancy, but the high school where your exclusive model, Megumi-san, goes to and even your exclusive designer, Ringo-san, too had encountered terrorist attack at the same time, you see? I can\u2019t think of any reason but you guys, being targeted\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMegumi and Ringo are being targeted, too, you said?!! Are they both safe!?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eYes, the two of them are safe. Megumi-san wasn\u2019t in the high school, which was attacked, and Ringo-san seemed to have been helped by her friends.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m glad\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, the police seems to have noticed that the Nancy Jewelry is being targeted, too. </p><br/><p>Hmm, what to do?</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, my fist thrust explodes!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026 about the fight\u2019s content, leave it out for the time being. The attack\u2019s details among other things\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThose sort of things, I don\u2019t know.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that right\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems Aya is being asked about the situation, too, but the policewoman listening to her story is cringing at Aya\u2019s wildness. </p><br/><p>Aya, don\u2019t cause trouble for the police!</p><br/><p>\u300cThe other party had guns, right? Weren't you scared?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cIn that case, \u2018nii-cha\u2026\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cNii-cha?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was nothing. Some of the guns seemed to be broken and accidentally discharged, so they threw their guns away midfight.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSo that's what happened, huh. But, the other party had bladed tools, too, right?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cDealing with bladed tools is a piece of cake for me!1\u300d </p><br/><p>If you were going to say that, it\u2019s [saisai]!</p><br/><p>Are you planning to make a tea-cake with [sichuan pickles2] or something?! </p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see, as for that person\u2019s side\u2026\u2026 19 years old!? It\u2019s a lie, right?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cOh well, never mind since I\u2019ve grown accustomed to everyone being surprised about it.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAh, forgive my rudeness.\u300d</p><br/><p>This time, it seems she\u2019s going to hear the story from Mai-san, who\u2019s in the side.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet me see, your strong point is karate among other things.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, that\u2019s right. I may not look like it, but I\u2019ve won the championship at the national athletic meet.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cA-, Amazing\u2026\u2026\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t it fine for us to claim \u201cself-defense\u201d for this time\u2019s event?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, the other party are terrorists with weapons and on the contrary, you might get awarded.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAwarded!? Perhaps, we\u2019re going to receive the [Superintendent General Award] or something like that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya interrupted from the side.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, there\u2019s a possibility.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhoopee!! Captain, the [Superintendent General Award], she said.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, for the time being, it seems Aya and the others haven\u2019t become suspicious, so it doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem. </p><br/><p>Yurie-san and Ringo were being examined at a hospital. </p><br/><p>They shouldn\u2019t have any injury, but just in case. </p><br/><p>Hilda and Megumi-chan were eating dinner happily.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>Phew, the issue is settled with this.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t have anything to be afraid of anymore with this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hm? Did I say something strange? </p><br/><p>At that moment-! </p><br/><p>The [Vigilance] magic notified me of the danger once again.</p><br/><p>Eh? What\u2019s going on? </p><br/><p>I should\u2019ve already helped everyone\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Who on earth fell into danger!?</p><br/><p>The author used \u304a\u306e\u3056\u30fc\u3055\u3044\u3088\uff01(ochanokoz\u0101sai) instead of \u304a\u3061\u3083\u306e\u3053\u3055\u3044\u3055\u3044(ochanokosaisai) which means \u201cit\u2019s a piece of cake/a simple task.\u201d I think it\u2019s said like this to add a boasting tone or something. \u21a9</p><br/><p>z\u0101sai\u30b6\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4 \u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

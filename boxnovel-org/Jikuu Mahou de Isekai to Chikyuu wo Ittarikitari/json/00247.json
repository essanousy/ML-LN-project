Listen to me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The two people look dejected.</p><br/><p>It seems they think that I will get angry.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you take more

clothes,</p><br/><p>at various places,</p><br/><p>with various poses.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes, understood!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda understood.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m looking forward to what kind of photos they will take.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next day, since I had a little spare time at work, I looked at Elena and Hilda\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026How did this happen!?</p><br/><p>Elena and Hilda</p><br/><p>were dressed in pretty clothes\u2015</p><br/><p>and were having a photo shoot with a pro cameraman!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a person who has a reflector board too,</p><br/><p>and make-up-san, and costume-san,</p><br/><p>and a person who prepares chairs, and a person who prepares drinks, and a reasonably large number of people.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this!?</p><br/><p>Ah, the guy who has this reflector board</p><br/><p>is innocent-faced of Japanese sweets shop!</p><br/><p>When I looked carefully, the cameraman is the oji-san of the camera shop,</p><br/><p>and the other people are all from the shopping district too.</p><br/><p>I pretended that I\u2019m going to the toilet, and called Elena outside.</p><br/><p>\u300eHello, Elena.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, this is Elena.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong, Seiji-sama?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eElena, are you with everyone from the shopping district right now?</p><br/><p>How did such a thing happen?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eO~h, that, when I was talking about photos to everyone from the shopping district, they said that they will cooperate with the photo shoot.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI-, Is that so\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWe\u2019ll do our best to take the photos you\u2019ve asked for.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eU-, Un, do your best\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>W-, What to do.</p><br/><p>Well, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Again, on the night of the next day, when I returned home\u2015</p><br/><p>there were 2 cardboard boxes in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what are these cardboard boxes?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI received them from the people of the shopping district.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat in the world are they?</p><br/><p>May I open it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I opened it\u2015</p><br/><p>there were a hundred copies of the gorgeous, hardcover, full colored\u300eElena\u2019s photo album\u300f.</p><br/><p>N-, No way!</p><br/><p>The other box was\u300eHilda\u2019s photo album\u300f.</p><br/><p>What the hell!</p><br/><p>According to what I heard afterwards,</p><br/><p>the shopping district wrestled to make the photo album in full force.</p><br/><p>They threatened\u2026asked earnestly the manager-san of the printing factory located at the opposite side of the shopping district.</p><br/><p>They persevered\u2026did their best from printing to bookbinding in just one day.</p><br/><p>Poor manager-san of the printing factory\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When I checked the contents of the photo album\u2015</p><br/><p>Although there were a lot of neighboring places at the location of the photo shoot,</p><br/><p>as one would expect, the result was wonderful, it was worthwhile that it was a pro who took the photos.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, Elena and Hilda are beautiful!!</p><br/><p>I should\u2019ve ask them to make me a photo album too~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho would want your photo album, Aya?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere may be a person who wants my photo album!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUmm, if it\u2019s Rondo, he may want it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho is Rondo?\u300d</p><br/><p>Poor Rondo\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, as for Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo album,</p><br/><p>apart from the one hundred copies which arrived at our house,</p><br/><p>ten copies each were distributed to each shop in the shopping district\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Properly speaking, I\u2019m angry at the selfish action of the people of the shopping district,</p><br/><p>but I will allow it only this time out of consideration for the splendid Elena and Hilda\u2019s photo albums.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]Elena said \u2018\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u305f(purin-ta)\u2019 while printer is \u2018\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc(pu-rin-tah).\u2019 Uh, they sounded the same for me though. Also, \u2018\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3(purin)\u2019 means pudding.</p><br/><p>[2]Often regarded as the bodhisattva of hell-beings, as well as the guardian of children and patron deity of deceased children and aborted fetuses in Japanese culture, where he is known as Jiz\u014d or Ojiz\u014d-sama. \u2013 Wikipedia</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Please come in.</p><br/><p> What kind of business do you have today?\u300d</p><br/><p> The receptionist onee-san greeted us.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's about the request of collecting magic stone that I've requested before.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry but we haven't found suitable adventurers. Please wait a little more.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I've brought these people because they will be receiving the request.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.</p><br/><p> Well then, please present your\u3010Guild Identification\u3011for validation.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya, Elena and I presented our\u3010Guild Identification\u3011as instructed by the receptionist onee-san,</p><br/><p> Hilda didn't try to present hers.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don't have a\u3010Guild Identification\u3011, Hilda?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda had not been registered as an adventurer, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, could you register this child while you're at it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm very sorry but this child seems to be a slave......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN?</p><br/><p> Does it mean that a slave can't register in the guild?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p> It can't be helped if it's the rules.</p><br/><p> After a while, the receptionist onee-san came back apologetically.</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm very sorry, since your adventurer's guild rank is\u300eD\u300f, you can't take on this job.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Is there a problem if Seiji's guild rank is\u300eD\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf your rank is\u300eD\u300f, you will not be permitted to enter the tower of sunrise. You must at least be\u300eC\u300frank.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's fine if it's Seiji, I can vouch for him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry but it's the rule.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hm, we've got a problem. If it's like this I would've raised our ranks seriously.</p><br/><p> If I remember correctly, our ranks should rise if we turn in orc tusks\u2015</p><br/><p> I forgot, I sold them as meats without taking the tusks.~</p><br/><p> Though it's a long-awaited dungeon, I hate not being able to get in.</p><br/><p> I have to do something!</p><br/><p> Let's try to consult with the receptionist onee-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow can I raise my rank quickly?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if you say quick,</p><br/><p> in order to rise into C rank, you need to accumulate 300 guild points.</p><br/><p> If there's a subjugation proof of a strong monster, I think that it may earn you a lot of points in its own way but......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, if that's the case, I have a\u300eGoblin Prince\u300fhere.</p><br/><p> How about it? \u300eGoblin Prince\u300f.</p><br/><p> How many guild points will I get?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHaa?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think that the Goblin Prince is a strong monster in its own way, is the guild points insufficient?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so!?</p><br/><p> If you say it to that extent, please turn in the subjugation proof!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Hm? What are you getting angry about?</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, where should I turn it in?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, right now!!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I'll take it out......\u300d</p><br/><p> If I'm not mistaken, the Prince at the time of Scab village was put inside the inventory in its entirety,</p><br/><p> while only the\u300efreshly severed head\u300fof the prince at the time of Suga town was put inside.</p><br/><p> It would be unwise to take out the whole one, wouldn't it?</p><br/><p> Then, for the time being, the\u300efreshly severed head\u300fone\u2015</p><br/><p> I took the freshly severed head of the prince out from the inventory and gave it to the receptionist onee-san\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa!!!\u300d</p><br/><p> The receptionist onee-san collapsed on her back with a scream</p><br/><p> and got crushed under the freshly severed head of about dozen kg of weight.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> It was a very stereotypical development but we had come to the guild leader's room.</p><br/><p>\u300cLela-sama, I apologize for the inconvenience our staff caused you this time.\u300d</p><br/><p> A seemingly timid, short ossan humbly apologized to Lela.</p><br/><p> This ossan seems to be the guild leader somehow or another.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, how did the matter of Seiji's rank turn out?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes,</p><br/><p> It was made\u300eB rank\u300fspecially as an apology for this time. I'm kindly asking for your forgiveness.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to be\u300eB rank\u300f, Seiji. It was good.\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela seemed to be delighted but\u2015</p><br/><p> I wasn't.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuild leader-san, I would like to ask you one thing, would that be okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs the guild rank something that can be freely raised at the guild leader's own discretion?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, there's no such thing normally but,</p><br/><p> this time is special.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNormally, a certain number of guild points has to be accumulated when raising the guild rank,</p><br/><p> what has happened this time?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis time is special......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn other words, guild leader-san.</p><br/><p> In order to sell a favor to Lela,</p><br/><p> does it mean that the guild leader himself will personally conduct a\u300eFraud\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Such a thing!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I don't accept that\u300especial\u300f, thank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it that you don't like, Seiji?</p><br/><p> Isn't it good that your rank has been raised?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if my rank rises by\u300efraud\u300f, I'm not happy.</p><br/><p> The rule must be followed by everyone,</p><br/><p> a top organization breaking its own rules can't be trusted.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so, if Seiji hates that\u300especial\u300fthen it's not alright.</p><br/><p> You understand, guild leader.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> In the end, I turned in the Goblin princes at the time of Scab village and Suga town which were inside the inventory,</p><br/><p> receiving 10, 000 Aurum reward for each, totaled 20, 000 Aurum.</p><br/><p> The guild points were 1, 000 points for each monster, totaled 2, 000 points.</p><br/><p> Since there were three people who subjugated the one in Scab village, each person got 333 points.</p><br/><p> And since it was only me who subjugated the one in Suga town, only me received 1, 000 points.</p><br/><p> All three of us will become C rank with 300 points,</p><br/><p> but I had 1, 000 points more and the points had been accumulated up to B rank.</p><br/><p> However, to become a B rank, there seems to be a\u300eBattle test\u300fand I will rank up after passing it.</p><br/><p> \u300eBattle test\u300f, huh. It seems to be troublesome.</p><br/><p> I wonder if I should've received that\u300eSpecial\u300fcontentedly.~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

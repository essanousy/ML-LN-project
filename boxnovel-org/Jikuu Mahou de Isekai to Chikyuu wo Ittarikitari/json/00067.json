Besides, it\u2019s a private room.</p><br/><p>As soon as we sat down, the director began to talk with serious face.</p><br/><p>\u300cMaruyama-kun, your recent success has been astonishing. I\u2019m to blame for not being able to provide a job that can display your talent sufficiently. That is to say, it\u2019s not necessarily mean that you need to become independent at once\u2026\u2026won\u2019t you somehow wait a little bit more?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhm, Director? What are you talking about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince you want to talk about being independent\u2026..that\u2019s not it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It\u2019s different!? What, don\u2019t surprise me. Well then, what do you want to talk about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDuring the nomikai not long ago, you talked about having no energy at night, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWa? S-, S-, S-, Such a thing, what are you talking about?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou did.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo what if I said it. It can\u2019t be helped because I\u2019m old!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause of that, huh?~ In fact, I got a hold of something amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>A vial-like bottle which I bought at a 100 yen shop that contains the\u3010Stimulant potion +3\u3011I brewed yesterday, was placed on top of the desk with a *kotori* sound.</p><br/><p>*Gulp*</p><br/><p>The director with look of expectation and anxiety, stared at the vial.</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, I tried it too. It has a great efficacy that it almost cause a large accident.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That much!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, how much does it costs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry but, I obtained this from a slightly special way, so you can\u2019t price this stuff. But, since I\u2019m usually under the care of director, I\u2019ll give this version one to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300eVersion one\u300fyou say, there\u2019s going to be different ones after that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, because it\u2019s costly, that\u2019s why it will be divided out\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, then it\u2019s possible to improve that at that time, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>The secret conversation of two suspicious men ended and the two people happily ate high quality delicious sushi (Director\u2019s treat) and returned to the company. Throughout that day, the director was restless and immediately went home as soon as the closing hour came, though he usually stay late.</p><br/><p>My work will also end soon, when I left the company and tried to go home, a suspicious person was wandering around.</p><br/><p>Shouldering a large backpack, was a blonde beauty who restlessly looked around with a map in one hand. When our eyes met, she called out to me all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u300eExcuse me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYes, what is it?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThank goodness.~ A person who can speak English.\u300f</p><br/><p>Huh? English? Oh, yeah! I learned\u300eEnglish\u300fusing\u3010Language Acquisition\u3011magic because I want to read English articles. (\u203b From\u300eChapter 34 \u2013 Attendance\u300freference.)</p><br/><p>\u300eActually, I don\u2019t know where the hotel is.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eWhich hotel?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u25cb\u25cb hotel.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u25cb\u25cb hotel? I haven\u2019t heard of such hotel. Please show me the map for awhile.</p><br/><p>Uh-huh, oh, it\u2019s here\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Since it was a little difficult to explain by mouth, I decided to guide her to the hotel.</p><br/><p>I heard the story along the way, this person is called\u300eNancy\u300fand she is a citizen of California, while on a vacation, she\u2019s touring around the world, she came to Japan as the first country and got lost.</p><br/><p>Pikon!</p><br/><p>Somehow, I received a revelation from God and came up with a good idea, I put\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011on Nancy.</p><br/><p>U~shishi, I would be able to travel freely around the world with this!</p><br/><p>When I guided Nancy to the hotel, I received\u300cThank you\u300dwith a hug, *Poyon* they were big and soft.</p><br/><p>In exchange for the\u3010tracking beacon\u3011I put on you, I\u2019ll help you anytime there\u2019s an imminent danger. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m thinking of getting another hug, you know!</p><br/><p>The 5th\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011, though it was attached to the lightning spirit, it seems the moment the lightning spirit was called off, the\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011also wore off. Does it mean that the spirit world where spirits resides can\u2019t be seen? It\u2019s a little disappointing.</p><br/><p>Since the 5\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011had become messy, I arranged it.</p><br/><p>1. Elena</p><br/><p>Was now watching magic girl DVD at home.</p><br/><p>2. Azide</p><br/><p>Since some people might have forgotten, he\u2019s the merchant-san who travels to each towns of Delaidos kingdom, he\u2019s still doing business at\u300eSuga town\u300fcurrently.</p><br/><p>3. Aristocracy Union Knight Leader, Lyle Gewalt</p><br/><p>There\u2019s still no conspicuous movement, nothing but paperwork and body training.</p><br/><p>4. Aya</p><br/><p>The Junior College seems to be still in orientation period, she\u2019s chatting with friends from Junior College at a fast food restaurant currently.</p><br/><p>5. Nancy</p><br/><p>The blonde beauty who would tour around the world and the one I put a\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011onto a little while ago, I wonder how long her schedule would take for her to tour around the world? I wish I asked her earlier.</p><br/><p>Because the 5\u3010Tracking beacon\u3011had been used up, I\u2019d like the 6th to be usable soon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

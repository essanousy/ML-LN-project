Then suddenly the light of the stone grew stronger, that light enveloped my body.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero, do you understand my words?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh, um, yes, I can\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood, please keep holding onto that stone\u300d</p><br/><p> I suddenly became able to understand him somehow. Is this stone some kind of translating machine? However, rather than something science-like, it felt more magic-like.</p><br/><p> Also referring to me as a hero? What\u2019s that about?</p><br/><p> Have I come to another world?</p><br/><p> I don\u2019t understand the situation at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe \u3010Magic Stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011 seems to function without a problem\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, well done\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems this stone is a \u3010Magic Stone\u3011. I temporarily acquired the language of these people? Is it really magic after all?</p><br/><p> I still don\u2019t grasp the situation well, so I decided to observe the situation.</p><br/><p>\u300cI am King Adelaidos. Hero, I welcome you\u300d \u2691</p><br/><p> The king began talking to me. He seemed somewhat arrogant, it\u2019s probably natural since he\u2019s king.</p><br/><p> Next to the king was a cute girl staring at me with a nervous expression. I wonder if she\u2019s the \u3010Princess\u3011?</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s begin checking his status\u300d</p><br/><p> The king ignored me and ordered his subordinates.</p><br/><p> The magician-like man from before had begun chanting an incantation towards me.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u25cb\u25b3\u25c7\u00d7\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u3010Appraisal\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> As the magician-like man finishes chanting the spell, he approaches the king, whispering something to him.</p><br/><p>\u300cHero, this may be sudden, but what kind of occupation is \u300eEs Ii\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p> Es Ii? Es Ii\u2026 occupation?</p><br/><p> Oh! He\u2019s talking about \u3010SE\u3011!</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010SE\u3011 means \u3010System Engineer\u3011\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSystem En\u2026whatever, is that \u3010System\u3011 thing you speak of strong?\u300d \u2691</p><br/><p>\u300cStrong? It isn\u2019t particularly strong nor weak but\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGetting to the point, I\u2019m asking if this \u3010System\u3011 is useful\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, of course it\u2019s useful! Just the other day, the system I made was used by some thousands of people\u300d</p><br/><p>\uff08I wasn\u2019t the only one that made it though\uff09</p><br/><p>\u300cI see! So that \u300eSystem\u300f thing you built and spoke of is a strong weapon that can be equipped by some thousands of people\u300d</p><br/><p> The king seemed to have misunderstood something.</p><br/><p> While thinking about how to clear up the misunderstanding, the king advanced the conversation by himself.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, then prepare to perform the \u3010Ritual of Skill Acceptance\u3011\u300d</p><br/><p> The magician-like man from before placed something on an extravagant tray, bringing it in front of me.</p><br/><p> Taking off the cloth covering the tray, there was a transparent blue gem and a leather collar on it.</p><br/><p> The gem had an atmosphere similar to the first stone handed over, but unlike the first stone, the gem felt much more transparent.</p><br/><p> The leather collar felt rather large compared to a dog\u2019s.</p><br/><p> When I looked, the girl from before was surprised for some reason when she saw the collar, but the king didn\u2019t really seem to mind and hurried a little to advance the conversation.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat is called a \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011. It a stone that grants you power related to your profession. Next is the \u3010Choker of Sealed Magic\u3011 which is a protective gear that defends oneself from an enemy\u2019s magic\u300d</p><br/><p> The king rapidly explained. Why was he in such a hurry?</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst you\u2019ll receive power from touching the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011, then put on the\u3010Choker of Sealed Magic\u3011, okay?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hearing the king\u2019s explanation, the girl from before was surprised once again and had an expression like she wanted to say something to the king, however the king ignored her behaviour.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome, what are you doing. Let\u2019s quickly perform the ritual\u300d</p><br/><p> He rushed me to do it.</p><br/><p> Although I was bothered by the girl\u2019s behaviour, I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011 and reach my hand towards it.</p><br/><p> When I touch the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011 the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011 began to shine. The light entered my body through my hand.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011 acquired.</p><br/><p> \u3010Space-Time Magic\u3011 is now level 5.</p><br/><p> \u3010Information Magic\u3011 acquired.</p><br/><p> \u3010Information Magic\u3011 is now level 5\u300f</p><br/><p> A mechanical voice resounded in my head.</p><br/><p> And for some reason, regarding the magic the magician like man used on me, the \u3010Appraisal\u3011 magic, I somehow understood that I could also use the \u3010Appraisal\u3011 magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cCome, what are you doing. Quickly put on that sla\u2026 Choker of Sealed Magic\u300d</p><br/><p> Looking at the choker, for some reason in regards to wearing the choker, I felt an indescribable dangerous feeling.</p><br/><p> Then, looking towards the girl inadvertently, the girl was extremely disturbed and averted her eyes away from me.</p><br/><p> There must be something to this.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Appraisal\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p> I tried using \u3010Appraisal\u3011 on the choker.</p><br/><p> A transparent window then appeared in front of me, displaying the results of the appraisal.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Slave\u2019s Choker\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Choker that makes the person equipped with it a \u3010Slave\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> \u300eMakes the person equipped with it a \u3010Slave\u3011\u300f!!</p><br/><p>\u300cW-What are you doing!\u300d</p><br/><p> The king was extremely upset.</p><br/><p> I ignored the king and also tried to appraise \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A stone that grants the person who touches it skills based on their occupation</p><br/><p>\u2502\u203b Not effective on \u3010Slaves\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> I see, \u300eNot effective on \u3010Slaves\u3011\u300f. So that\u2019s why you use the \u3010Mana Crystal Fragment\u3011 beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u300cApparently this collar is a \u3010Slave\u2019s Choker\u3011 rather than a \u3010Choker of Sealed Magic\u3011. What is the reason for this?\u300d</p><br/><p> The king was extremely upset I pointed it out and remained silent.</p><br/><p> The people around began talking after seeing the situation.</p><br/><p> In the girl\u2019s case, she had a relieved expression.</p><br/><p> I would have been a \u3010Slave\u3011 if it went on a little longer, I was saved thanks to the girl\u2019s behaviour.</p><br/><p> The girl knew about the choker, was she not able to say it?</p><br/><p>\u300cSince there seems to have been a mistake, you can go without the choker\u300d</p><br/><p> How shameless, he knew about it and yet he tried getting me to equip it!</p><br/><p> I decided to not trust the people of this country.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

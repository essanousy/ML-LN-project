Oniichan, yobai1 this early morning?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, good morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood morning, Elena. Aya, it\u2019s called yobai if it\u2019s evening.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, asa hai2?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, there\u2019s no such thing. I\u2019ve found the Scab village that\u2019s why I returned quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? You\u2019ve already found it? You\u2019re so fast oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p>When she said\u300cfast\u300dwith a stunned look, she seemed to be unsatisfied or something\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s a horde of goblins gathered inside the Scab village.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Goblins!? Why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I didn\u2019t investigate properly, I can\u2019t say it clearly yet. The goblins probably found the village uninhabited and settled in.\u300d</p><br/><p>For some reason, I\u2019m interested about the current situation inside the Scab village.~</p><br/><p>\u300cHow many goblins in there?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere should be around 100 or more. If we\u2019re unlucky, there might be 200.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat many!? Then, there might be a high rank goblin present. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHigh rank? You mean, Goblin king?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf the horde is around 200, I think there\u2019s a Goblin Prince nearby.\u300d</p><br/><p>A Goblin prince, huh?</p><br/><p>\u300cUh.~ Seiji-sama, I have a request.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA request from Elena? How rare. What is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe goblin subjugation, will you let me do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? Elena!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Scab village\u2019s problem is Delaidos Kingdom\u2019s problem, if possible, I want to solve it with my power.\u300d</p><br/><p>Somehow, Elena is unusually aggressive.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, since Elena shows so much determination, let\u2019s cooperate.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, Aya-san, thank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, we need it after all.\u300d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>We went to Nippo town.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, they\u2019re all finished.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, Gamudo-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san showed me the finished armor sets.</p><br/><p>\u300cC-, Cool!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, I put all my skills to meet your expectations.\u300d</p><br/><p>My cool armor is a half-armor with kote that covered the fingers up to the elbow and boots that covered my toes up to the shin. In addition, they are all light.3</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? It\u2019s light, right? It has a gem with weight reduction magic and defense reinforcement magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat amazing!?\u300d</p><br/><p>As for Aya\u2019s armor, it\u2019s a breastplate with elbow and knee armor pieces. It\u2019s just right for Aya who focused on speed.</p><br/><p>\u300cIsn\u2019t this armor somewhat erotic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, you also need to wear normal clothes underneath the armor, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, yeah. For a moment there, I thought it\u2019s a bikini armor.\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, things like bikini armor only exists in two-dimension.</p><br/><p>Elena\u2019s armor is a shining pure white breastplate and boots.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-jouchan, it has magic defense and a magic that repels arrows and the like.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow is it? Do the three of you like them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300cYes.\u300d\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, how much is today\u2019s equipment?.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*smack* What are you saying! These are the compensation for the whiskey last time. I\u2019m not going to accept anything, even 1 Aurum in return for that.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, it\u2019s shame.~ I\u2019ve brought a whiskey again with so much effort\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I took out a whiskey and placed it on the table. It\u2019s not a luxury good like last time but it\u2019s what I usually bought at the supermarket.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you don\u2019t want to accept this whiskey then I wonder if I should just drink it?~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat I said earlier was a lie! I accept this whiskey!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking at the wistful face of ossan, it\u2019s unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a joke. Because I brought this with so much trouble as a souvenir. Ah, but, it\u2019s not like the expensive liquor last time so, please don\u2019t expect too much.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? But, even so, it\u2019s also a whiskey. Let\u2019s drink it quickly!\u300d</p><br/><p>When Gamudo-san snatched the whiskey from me, he began to pour it into the glass I gave him last time and drunk it.</p><br/><p>\u300cKaaa! Splendid! Indeed, whiskey is the best!!\u300d</p><br/><p>If some of the words are different, it\u2019ll become dangerous line but let\u2019s leave it alone.4</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, we\u2019re going to return.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, please come again. When you have a whiskey souvenir, you\u2019re welcome at anytime!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes yes, I\u2019ll come again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBye bye.\u300d\u300cExcuse us to have disturbed you.\u300d</p><br/><p>We, dressed in our new armors made by Gamudo-san, headed to the Scab village.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cIs this the Scab village?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere really is a horde of goblins.~\u300d</p><br/><p>We crouched down on top of a small hill, overlooking the Scab village.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, do you really need to go?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWa, yes\u2026\u2026 even if I\u2019ll likely die, I\u2019ll do my best!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don\u2019t need to exhaust yourself that much. Because, we\u2019ll also help.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, if Elena is going to be our main attacker, we need to think of a proper strategy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStrategy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter how you look at it, fighting all of them at the same time with that number is too reckless.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, how are we going to go about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn this case, divide and conquer is the basic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBeating the kakko?\u300d5</p><br/><p>This fellow Aya doesn\u2019t seem to understand. orz</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, Aya will lure out the goblins.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I understand now! I\u2019m going to pull the mobs.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, Elena will finish them off using AOE skills?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf there\u2019s a large number of enemies, she has to use AOE skills but if it\u2019s otherwise small, it might be better to use magic rod.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is an AOE skill?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a magic with a wide scope offensive. With Elena\u2019s channeling spells\u3010Cloudburst\u3011and\u3010Snowfall\u3011which takes away body temperature, they are easy prey. Can you do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I\u2019ll try.\u300d</p><br/><p>After deciding the strategy, we began to implement the operation goblin subjugation.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Creeping at night into a woman\u2019s bedroom.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2She tried to make a morning version of yobai.\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Half-armor is an armor protecting only a part of the body while kote is a gauntlet or gloves similar to this. \u21a9</p><br/><p>4Reference to Ro-kyu-bu! anime when Subaru said elementary school kids are the best. Thanks ReaderBot and Fein.\u21a9</p><br/><p>5What Seiji said was divide and conquer/rule(/Kakko Gekiha) while what Aya said was Kakko Gekiha(\u304b\u3063\u3053). Kakko is a Japanese hourglass drum.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Where is it going?</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Seiji-sama, good morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji, you\u2019re finally up. Good morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, good morning.\u300d</p><br/><p>Setting aside the question of why are they in my room.</p><br/><p>I explained the Goblin King\u2019s movement to the two people.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026That said.</p><br/><p>The Goblin King, is moving southwards from the western forest of Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>What do the two of you think of this movement?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy any chance, do they intend to attack the Ikebu town from the west!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, that\u2019s unlikely.</p><br/><p>They had already passed the Ikebu town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, is the Goblin King perhaps aiming for the Demon town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDemon town?</p><br/><p>Indeed, if I\u2019m not mistaken, it is situated to the west of Shinju town?</p><br/><p>I see, that\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>So, their strategy is to let the humans and demons battle and occupy both towns in that interval.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, if we tell this to the demons, we might be able to prevent the war.\u300d</p><br/><p>Although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be successful, I nodded to Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. Well then, shall we go and stop the war?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>I took Elena\u2019s hand and was about to use\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Wait for me. Please bring me along as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>Lela said so with serious look.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s no good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Why? Is it because I\u2019m weak?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, you\u2019ve become sufficiently strong.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, you need to protect this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut, there are soldiers in this town as well.</p><br/><p>Even if I\u2019m not here, they are enough to protect this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLela.</p><br/><p>Protecting the town isn\u2019t only about suppressing the monsters.</p><br/><p>You being here and defending the town, is the moral support of the townspeople.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe townspeople doesn\u2019t matter, I want you\u2026.</p><br/><p>I want to protect you, Elena-sama and otousama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cLook, listen carefully.</p><br/><p>When we go and battle against the demons and the Goblin King, what everyone is really worried about is\u300eThe town which one can return to, might be already occupied\u300fand can\u2019t move with a peace of mind.</p><br/><p>However, Lela will protect it.</p><br/><p>It will be the moral support of all the people who are participating in this war.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI am, moral support\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, not just the townspeople, your otousama and other aristocrats, soldiers, adventurers and, even Elena and I.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena also nodded to my speech.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven Seiji and Elena-sama\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right. Will you protect it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026I understand, I, will protect this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>I firmly shook hands with Lela.</p><br/><p>Together with Elena, I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to Shinju town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> When we arrived at Shinju town, the whole town had become tense.</p><br/><p>The war will start soon and the soldiers can feel it on their skins.</p><br/><p>We went to Rondo\u2019s place to report the movements of the Goblin King.</p><br/><p>When we arrived at Rondo\u2019s camp, they let us through upon seeing our faces and guided us to Rondo\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Even here, the soldiers were busily preparing.</p><br/><p>\u300cRondo-sama, Princess Elena-sama and Seiji-dono have come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? It\u2019s good that they\u2019ve come, take them inside.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Rondo, it seems you\u2019re quite busy. Is the war starting soon?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, we\u2019re preparing to depart to the frontline soon. We\u2019ll probably set off tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo that\u2019s the current situation, huh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, what were you doing lately?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe went and defended the Suga and Ikebu town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDefended? W-, What happened?\u300d</p><br/><p>I explained the situation of Suga and Ikebu town to Rondo.</p><br/><p>\u300cLela, as in, Iron wall Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, she\u2019s now completely the hero of Ikebu town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, if Iron wall Lela protects the town, I can be relieved.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, shall we talk about the main issue?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMain issue? The talk just now wasn\u2019t the main issue?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe main issue is, I\u2019ve found the Goblin King and have information on it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? You\u2019ve found the Goblin King!? Lyle Gewalt-dono must hear the information as well!\u300d</p><br/><p>While making me hurry, Rondo guided us to Lyle Gewalt\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Lyle Gewalt seized Azos\u2019 mansion and set up a temporary military headquarters.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? Lela defended the Ikebu town!?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seemed Lyle Gewalt thought that Lela left the town and escaped.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not the main issue but the movements of the Goblin King.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat!? Goblin King!?\u300d</p><br/><p>They were surprised many times already.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Goblin King is moving southwards from the western forest of Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>According to Elena, it might be headed towards the Demon town. It seems to be so.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. If they are to attack, the Demons will retreat and defend the town at once. It will cut down a considerable amount of fighting force.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOy oy, are you really intending to go to war against the Demons?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWho would let such an opportunity slip by?\u300d</p><br/><p>This old bird seems to think only about the war.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s not guaranteed that the Goblin King will attack the Demon town. </p><br/><p>What will you do if the Demons and the Goblin King formed an alliance?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It\u2019s bad.\u300d</p><br/><p>We decided to leave the decision to Lyle Gewalt and left the military headquarters.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, Seiji. What will you do after this?\u300d</p><br/><p>After leaving the military headquarters, Rondo spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m going to the Adventurers\u2019 Guild and become a volunteer.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat? Why bother becoming a volunteer?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI wanted to visit the Mana crystal of Earth but I heard that it\u2019s not allowed if one is not a volunteer.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I can make arrangements to visit the mana crystal, why don\u2019t you join my troops?\u300d</p><br/><p>Being tempted by a man is slightly unpleasant but\u2026</p><br/><p>When I thought for a moment\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cDepending on the situation, I might work without permission. Would that still be fine?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright. Well then, please treat me well.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Rondo and I shook hands, Elena suddenly interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease, let me participate as well!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!?</p><br/><p>Elena-sama participating in the war, that\u2019s ridiculous!</p><br/><p>Elena-sama, please wait in this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>Well, that\u2019s normally right.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo!</p><br/><p>The Royal Family is responsible for causing this war.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t just observe in a safe place!\u300d</p><br/><p>Rondo was taken aback by Elena\u2019s seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026I understand, Elena-sama will stay by my side.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat about me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji will participate in the magician unit. </p><br/><p>You may move freely there to some extent.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMagician unit!?\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

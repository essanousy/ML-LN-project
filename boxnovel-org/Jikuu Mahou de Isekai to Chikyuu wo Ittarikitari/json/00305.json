I only have her massage my shoulders.\u300d</p><br/><p> \u300eComing up next is the follow-up report of the synchronized, multiple terrorism incident.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? You\u2019re watching the news?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, today\u2019s event is being broadcast on the special news program the entire time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow did today\u2019s anime recording turn out?\u300d</p><br/><p>The first thing you worry about is that, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince the news is being broadcast all day today, it has probably taken off.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Such a thing~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s better than wearing an L-shaped obi, right?1\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s event was reported on the news program repeatedly.</p><br/><p>The news\u2019 content is as follows:</p><br/><p>The terrorism happened in 3 places at the same time.</p><br/><p>Some of the criminals were only injured and as for the common people, there wasn\u2019t anyone injured.2</p><br/><p>All criminals were arrested.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, on the news, the [mystery] of this time\u2019s event was reported repeatedly.</p><br/><p>The existence of the girl called [Angel], who appeared in the church.</p><br/><p>The existence of the [ninja], who appeared in the high school.</p><br/><p>The existence of the two karate girls, who fought against the terrorist group in front of the station.</p><br/><p>What the, aren't those only us\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Since Elena healed the injured people at the church, it seems they\u2019ve decided to say that there\u2019s no injured people.</p><br/><p>\u300eTo begin with, things like injury being healed by magic is impossible!\u300f</p><br/><p>The expert, who went on the news program, raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u300ePerhaps, their strong fear towards the terrorist group becomes stress and they must\u2019ve seen a hallucination similar to mass hypnotism.\u300f</p><br/><p>He\u2019s performing considerably well, huh~. </p><br/><p>Well, since it\u2019s only natural for things like magic to be unbelievable, it can\u2019t be helped if they put it in this way.</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, what about the ninja?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eAs for the ninja, I think it\u2019s probably a hallucination of mass hypnotism, too.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThe possibility of the terrorist group in the church, too, being defeated by this ninja has been pointed out, but\u2026\u2026\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eYou shouldn\u2019t say such an absurdity, those 2 places are considerably far from each other. Are you even saying that he used teleportation?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI-, I know, right~. It\u2019s impossible.\u300f</p><br/><p>Well, in fact, that\u2019s what happened, though~.</p><br/><p>\u300eW-, Well, what about the two karate girls, who fought against the terrorist group in front of the station?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWith regards to that, since there\u2019s a video as a proof, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a hallucination.\u300f</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a video as a proof, huh. </p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be a strange video, though.</p><br/><p>\u300eUhh, according to the eyewitness report, the two karate girls, who appeared in front of the station\u2026\u2026one was a college student, the other one\u2026 was seemingly at least a grade school student.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hmm, it seems Mai-san will be angry.</p><br/><p>\u300eThinking about it logically, since there\u2019s no way a grade school girl can fight against the terrorists, the college student probably fought alone substantially, but it's impossible for me to suddenly believe it.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWith regards to this, I\u2019ll notify you about the follow-up report as soon as the video is available.\u300f</p><br/><p>I\u2019m worried\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, what to do, I might become a celebrity!\u300d</p><br/><p>What [what to do]! </p><br/><p>Don\u2019t pretend to be troubled while looking glad.</p><br/><p>\u300cEven though you told me not to stand out\u2026\u2026aren\u2019t you standing out too much!?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m fine!\u300d</p><br/><p>This fellow is hopeless, I have to do something fast\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On that day, since I was considerably tired, I went to bed early.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>When I was going to the company the next day, I was called by Nancy.</p><br/><p>I sent the director a notification and went to Nancy\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>For sure, she\u2019ll ask about Elena~. </p><br/><p>I wonder what should I say as an excuse.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, Seiji, you came.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ve come, it was terrible yesterday, wasn\u2019t it?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIt was terrible, alright\u2026that\u2019s not it! What on Earth is Elena!?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eEven if you say that, what do you mean what is she\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou managed to somehow trick the police, but are you going to keep it a secret even to us? Seiji, there\u2019s no way you don\u2019t know.\u300f</p><br/><p>Um, as expected, I can\u2019t trick her\u2026\u2026 it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>\u300eUhm, Elena can use magic.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eMagic\u2026\u2026 magic, huh~. If it\u2019s true, it\u2019s a laughable story, but it seems I have no choice but to believe it, huh.\u300f</p><br/><p>It was finally exposed.</p><br/><p>However, Mama-san nods with uh-huh.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no way, but did she perhaps know?</p><br/><p>\u300eWhy aren\u2019t you Mama-san surprised, Mama-san ? It\u2019s magic, you know? Magic!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBecause the accessories that Seiji made weren\u2019t ordinary. I was convinced about the existence of some strange power.\u300f</p><br/><p>I see, she was able to guess to some extent, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut Seiji, why are you keeping Elena\u2019s magic a secret? If there\u2019s that power, it\u2019s even possible to become very rich.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI don\u2019t like such a thing, but if Elena personally says she would like to do so, I will help her.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThen, I will persuade Elena\u2026\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300ePlease stop it, Nancy.\u300f</p><br/><p>Mama-san stopped Nancy, who was in high spirits.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s wrong, Mama!? Why did you stop me?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHave you already forgotten about yesterday\u2019s event? To become a wealthy socialite3, it means she needs to take on that much risk. Whether or not she has the resolution to fight against such risk, it\u2019s not something for other people to decide, don\u2019t you agree?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI understand\u2026\u2026 but if mama and I were to get hurt, you\u2019ll help us at a cheap price, right?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you talking about?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eEh? It\u2019s no good?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eDuring that time when you went to Egypt and collapsed, Elena saved you using magic, you know? There\u2019s no reason to take money from a friend.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eEh!? Is that so? Come to think of it, that time\u2026\u2026I suddenly became well.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSomehow or other, it seemed I\u2019ve been saved by Elena before. Thank you.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eSay your thanks to Elena.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWhen I meet her next time, I\u2019ll thank her again.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBy the way, mama-san. About this time\u2019s matter, was Nancy\u30fbJewelry being targeted? Is it Gold\u2019s unjustified resentment through misunderstanding after all?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAs one would expect of Seiji, you even know about Gold, huh. But I think that Gold isn\u2019t the mastermind.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eEh?\u300f</p><br/><p>Gold isn\u2019t the mastermind? </p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><br/><p>\u300eGold merely gave money, it seems there\u2019s a different mastermind. Since it\u2019s an information from the diplomat, who rushed to the police station, it\u2019s certainly reliable.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eA diplomat?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eAmericans have been involved in a terrorism in foreign country, you know? Naturally, the American government will move, too.\u300f</p><br/><p>What the, it becomes a serious matter, huh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The criminals are Chinese mafia and it seems to have developed into a diplomatic dispute involving Japan, America and China\u2026..</p><br/><p>What a bad premonition; a bead of sweat flowed down my forehead.</p><br/><p>This doesn't make any sense for me at all. \uff2c\u306e\u304c\u308b\u3088\u308a\u3044\u3044\u3060\u308d?. \u21a9</p><br/><p>Cuz Elena healed all of them. What a lucky bunch! \u21a9</p><br/><p>\u30bb\u30ec\u30d6(Celebrity)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

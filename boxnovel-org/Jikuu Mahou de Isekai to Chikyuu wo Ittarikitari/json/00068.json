What should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe 3 places where we can go currently are the Royal capital, Nippo and Suga?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere can we go in this world, to Tokyo and Sapporo only?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, I can go to Beijing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Beijing? How??\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSome time ago, I met a person named Nancy who came to Japan for her tour around the world, I put a tracking beacon on that person.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I checked the map, Beijing and the great wall of China were displayed. I wonder what would be the sightseeing scope of Nancy? Right now, she\u2019s in Beijing Airport. It seems like she\u2019s about to leave China.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ll suspend our trip to the other world today and go to China?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, just for a short while.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I\u2019d also like to see many places.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s go and take a look at the great wall of China.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKay~\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we flew to the great wall of China using\u3010Teleportation\u3011, suddenly, our surroundings turned white.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, excellent view. But, it\u2019s a little smoggy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNice view.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Elena-chan? Your way of talking suddenly became strange.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u3010Magic stone of Temporary Language Acquisition\u3011probably had to correspond with Chinese.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnly\u2026a little bit\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s amazing enough that you can speak like that in a short period of time.\u300d</p><br/><p>While having such talk, Elena began coughing all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u300c*Gohon gohon*\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are you alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a little\u2026difficult (to breath).\u300d</p><br/><p>Umu, The PM2.5 is soaring a lot more these days, huh?1</p><br/><p>\u300cLet\u2019s leave China, we could still go and see\u300eSapporo\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn, let\u2019s do that.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then,\u3010Teleportation\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to Sapporo using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is Sapporo. The air is so good.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we arrived at Sapporo, Elena\u2019s coughing seemed to have stopped.</p><br/><p>Also, her Japanese had also returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe atmosphere is a little bit different from Tokyo but it looks as amazing as Tokyo.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, because Sapporo is one of the 5 major cities of Japan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rest of the 5 cities are, Osaka, Fukuoka and Nagoya, remember?\u300d2</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like to be able to go to the 5 major cities in the future. Maybe if there\u2019s someone in the company who would go on a business trip, I would attach a tracking beacon on him.</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, let\u2019s go and eat Sapporo ramen immediately!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019re not going!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhyyy!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNoon is a bit too early to have ramen.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?~ That reminds me, I\u2019m not hungry yet.\u300d</p><br/><p>Are you a child!? *kusuksu* Even Elena is giggling too.</p><br/><p>It might be necessary to re-educate Aya, some God-like person feels like saying it too. What to do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, where should we go?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, to the\u300eFlour mill factory\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c\u300eFlour mill factory\u300f?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to a\u300eFlour mill factory\u300fa short distance away from Sapporo.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a huge building.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, Wheat flour is being made here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWheat flour, that wheat flour!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is great, I bet there\u2019s a lot of millstone inside.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, how about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>I inquired at the factory\u2019s reception if we could tour the factory.</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, factory tour, is it? You can visit at anytime.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cA factory tour, it\u2019s been a while since Elementary school.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m looking forward to see what it looks like.\u300d</p><br/><p>An oniisan who was brimming with cleanliness became our guide.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst, please wear these work clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We were made to wear a pure white worker clothing and hair net for complete protection.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, Why do we have to wear this!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause hygiene management is essential inside the factory.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena seems to be surprised at the strictness in hygiene management.</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst is this\u300eRoller machine\u300f, it finely grinds the wheat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s no millstone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMillstones grind the wheat with stones on the top and bottom, it became a principle of roller machine to grind with two rollers.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe roller is not move by people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, this whole factory is operating using electric power.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElectricity\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena was astonished and dazed off a little. The oniisan guide also smiles wryly.</p><br/><p>\u300cNext are the\u300eSifter\u300fand\u300ePurifier\u300f, they sift the wheat flour.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is the difference between the two?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u300eSifter\u300fis a machine that sift the flour while the\u300ePurifier\u300fis a machine that blows the part called\u300eWheat bran\u300fusing wind power.\u300d</p><br/><p>The oniisan brought a real wheat and taught us the\u300eWheat bran\u300fpart.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Japanese wheat flour is so white because the\u300eWheat bran\u300fis removed.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think the other countries also remove it but\u2026\u2026 if the\u300eWheat bran\u300fis not removed, the quality will deteriorate.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s also delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p>The oniisan guide explained it happily when he saw Elena was really into it.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, we also visited the bag filling machine, Elena was surprised that there\u2019s almost no people at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe factory is amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena is unusually excited. It was good to have brought her along.</p><br/><p>\u300cParticularly, the\u300ePurifier\u300f, it can use wind magic, perhaps, I might be able to do it too.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, will the quality of wheat be increased by magic? Elena, you must study more about wind then acquire\u3010Wind magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I\u2019ll study hard about wind.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena was fired up to study. I want Aya to also learn from you.</p><br/><p>After the tour was over, I learned from the reception that a 25 kg bag of hard flour can be purchased for 5,000 yen for business purposes. I decisively bought 4 bags. Since the 25 kg bag I purchased disappeared all of a sudden, the people at the factory were surprised. I\u2019ve managed to cover it up somehow.</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, why\u2019d you buy so much flour?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe Delaidos Kingdom has a shortage of wheat due to the influence of war, right? I think this can be of some help even a little.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, thank you very much in behalf of Delaidos kingdom.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I heard such line, Elena is also a princess as expected, is what comes to mind.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Not sure, here\u2019s the raw: \u3046\u30fc\u3080\u3001\u306f\uff30\uff2d\uff12\uff0e\uff15\u304c\u304f\u3093\u3067\u308b\u306a\u306e\u304b\u306a\uff1fPM 2.5 is short for \u201cParticulate Matter, 2.5 micrometers or less\u201d, basically these \u201cPM2.5 particles\u201d are known to produce respiratory and cardiovascular illness. \u2013 Liberty \u21a9</p><br/><p>2Not sure if this \u2018major\u2019 meant largest though, since Fukuoka is 8th largest city in Japan and Yokohama should be here if it is.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

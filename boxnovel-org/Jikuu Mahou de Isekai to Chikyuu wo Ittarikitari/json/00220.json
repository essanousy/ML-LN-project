Were you able to flirt with Lela?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn't!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cReally?\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya sniffed my smell with *kun kun*.</p><br/><p> Are you a wife who is suspecting an affair!?</p><br/><p>\u300cI will go out again,</p><br/><p> I will leave the town to you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere are you going?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm going to look for the whereabouts of the devil-kin.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I will also be going.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's no good.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will be searching using\u3010lightning flash\u3011.</p><br/><p> Are you able to keep up?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGununu.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you don't act violently, you can hunt monsters around the town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere are monsters?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, to some degree.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I will go\u300eHuman-hunting[1]\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you are going, go exactly with four people.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p> Ah, my imouto has become a hunter......</p><br/><p> I shouldn't have brought her to a different world, huh~.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> Now, the problem is which way did the devil-kin go towards.</p><br/><p> I'm thinking this 4.</p><br/><p>1. Northwards of\u300eShinju town\u300f.</p><br/><p>2. Westwards of\u300eDemon-kind town\u300f.</p><br/><p>3. Eastwards of\u300eShinaga town\u300f.</p><br/><p>4. If they didn't stop by anywhere, then they have returned to the stronghold of the devil-kin.</p><br/><p> If we assume that it's one these four, they are going to be difficult to track, but it won't cause additional damage.</p><br/><p> If it's number one, since Lela is in Shinju town, she can do something about it somehow or another.</p><br/><p> For the same reason, the demon-kind should be able to deal with it in the case of number 2.</p><br/><p> If that's the case then, we can assume that the possibility of\u300e3\u300fcausing damage is high, let's try to search eastwards.</p><br/><p> I went eastwards with\u3010Lightning flash\u3011.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p> I continued running eastwards for awhile, when the sun went down and the surroundings gradually became dark,</p><br/><p> I found those fellows.</p><br/><p> The devil-kin.</p><br/><p> I confirmed that there were about 100 devil-kin on the map.</p><br/><p> I concealed myself using\u3010Night shade\u3011magic,</p><br/><p> and carefully approached.</p><br/><p> The devil-kin are there.</p><br/><p> About 100 devil-kin were camping out.</p><br/><p> And, there is an important-looking guy in the center.</p><br/><p> He's probably the leader of these guys.</p><br/><p> If can use\u3010appraisal\u3011, I can see it in detail,</p><br/><p> but then I will be noticed.</p><br/><p> When I look closely, the important-looking guy is holding a amazing-looking staff of something.</p><br/><p> Could it be that it was the something staff stolen from Butte-sama?</p><br/><p> I have to take it back and return it to Butte-sama.</p><br/><p> Dangerous, there are also human hostages.</p><br/><p> About 30 people and every one of them have slave collars on.</p><br/><p> There are 10 sisters, and there are 20 adult men and women.</p><br/><p> I feel regretful for the hostages, but I will return and call Aya and the others at once.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p> I returned to Ebisu town, but Aya and the other were not here.</p><br/><p> They really went to\u300ehuman-hunting\u300f......</p><br/><p> When I check the map, I found them in the nearby forest so I went to meet them with\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cO-, Onii-chan!</p><br/><p> Hooray! The main baggage carrier has come, victory is mine!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya was walking while lifting a huge bear overhead.</p><br/><p> Mai-san had a giant wild boar while Elena and Hilda had a great rat each in both of their hands.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's a decent harvest.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, not at all, we had hunted even more,</p><br/><p> but it couldn't be carried around so we left it behind and come back for it later.\u300d</p><br/><p>I asked the place where they had left it behind, and went toward its location\u2015</p><br/><p> Orc, and bear, and wild boar,</p><br/><p> and such monsters had been piled up.</p><br/><p> Did nobody notice that it needs to be carried!?</p><br/><p> Collecting the monsters that Aya and the others had piled up, we returned to the town.</p><br/><p>----------</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, the devil-kun went towards\u300eShinaga town\u300f, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat's right.\u300d</p><br/><p> We who have returned to Ebisu town reported the situation to Butte-sama.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, the guy who seems to be the leader of the devil-kin held a great-looking staff.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, that is......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPerhaps, it was the one stolen from here...staff of something? I think.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe\u3010Staff of Aesculapius\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat one.\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena followed up.</p><br/><p>\u300cI have to get back that staff no matter what it takes......\u300d</p><br/><p> Butte-sama had a desperate expression while saying so.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that staff so amazing?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat staff......</p><br/><p> has the power to forcibly raised the recovery magic of the person who held by one level.\u300d</p><br/><p> To raise one level......</p><br/><p> in other words, if Elena who has level 5 recovery magic use it,</p><br/><p> her recovery magic will level up by 1 and will become level 6......</p><br/><p> that's amazing.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, we will naturally get it back, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu, of course!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou guys will also join us in recapturing strategy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, that's not it.</p><br/><p> We are the only ones who will go.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?</p><br/><p> S-, Such recklessness!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, please leave it to us.\u300d</p><br/><p>[1] \u3072\u3068\u308a No idea if this is what it actually meant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

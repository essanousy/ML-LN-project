Well, it can\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>I transformed into\u300eJapanese ninja man\u300fin the park\u2019s toilet, used\u3010teleportation\u3011towards the mafia\u2019s hideout after going invisible using\u3010Night Shade\u3011and infiltrated it in secret.</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the room where the aforementioned mafias got tortured\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>there was a person.</p><br/><p>Who is it!?</p><br/><p>I was surprised for an instant, but I couldn\u2019t be noticed since I went invisible using\u3010Night Shade\u3011.</p><br/><p>When I calm down and looked at the person again\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>It was a girl.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she is tied to a chair in the center of the room and is even gagged.</p><br/><p>And, there\u2019s no one other than the girl.</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s this!?</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010appraisal\u3011just in case, she seems to be an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Is it a person who has been kidnapped in a separate case?</p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s set her free later.</p><br/><p>I left the girl and look for the room\u2019s exit.</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, this room seems to be a basement, there are stairs to go up and a massive, iron door on top of the flight of stairs.</p><br/><p>The iron door seems to be locked from the outside, and it seems that it can\u2019t be opened easily.</p><br/><p>Well, anyhow, it looks like a mafia\u2019s hideout, so it\u2019s fine to wreck the door open, right?</p><br/><p>I used\u3010Metal Control\u3011of\u3010Earth Magic\u3011, deformed the door\u2019s lock part and succeeded in opening it.</p><br/><p>Now then, where\u2019s the director?</p><br/><p>The other side of the door seemed to be the first floor and there were about 30 mafia combatants(?) on the lookout.</p><br/><p>And then, from the window, a garden can be seen.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no two chickens and the likes in the garden[2].</p><br/><p>A sturdy-looking wall surrounds every direction. Is this a fortress!?</p><br/><p>And, about 10 combatants are on the lookout in the garden.</p><br/><p>I tried to search in order to not be noticed by all of the combatants, but the director wasn\u2019t on the first floor.</p><br/><p>However, I found the stairs to the second floor. I wonder if he\u2019s above or beyond this?</p><br/><p>When I went up to the second floor\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>there was the boss.</p><br/><p>And, the director, too!</p><br/><p>The boss seems to be considerably irritated and vents his anger on his subordinates.</p><br/><p>The director\u2019s hands are tied up behind his back, he is blindfolded and his face is swollen up where he was hit.</p><br/><p>Now then, let\u2019s rampage!</p><br/><p>I, who was still invisible, gave a dropkick towards the combatant who was guarding the director.</p><br/><p>*Bagon!*</p><br/><p>The combatant somersaults and rolls over the floor.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300c!?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>When the boss, and the surrounding combatants were preoccupied with that person, I put a hand on the director\u2019s shoulder and moved to the basement using\u3010teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa!? What the!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Since the director is blindfolded, he didn\u2019t understand what happened at all.</p><br/><p>The girl seemed to have noticed us, too, because of the director making a noise.</p><br/><p>\u300cUuuu.\u300d</p><br/><p>The girl, who is still gagged, is groaning *Uu, Uu*.</p><br/><p>Sorry, I will come back to rescue you later.</p><br/><p>I left the director and the girl and went up to the first floor.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat the heck!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere\u2019s the enemy!?\u300d</p><br/><p>In the first floor, the combatants were getting ready for battle.</p><br/><p>\u300cJapanese ninja man\u30fbhave arrived!!\u300d</p><br/><p>I took the\u3010Night Shade\u3011off, showed my appearance and introduced myself.</p><br/><p>\u300cHaa? What the hell are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>D-, Damn. The combatants got creeped out.</p><br/><p>Even though I chose a cool line and pose with great effort\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I\u2019ve arrived\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you on medication?\u300d</p><br/><p>The bald, fat combatant is worrying about me and approaches.</p><br/><p>Shit, making a fool of me is a heavy sin!</p><br/><p>I hit the bald, fat combatant on the stomach, sending him flying.</p><br/><p>\u300c*Guge!*\u300d</p><br/><p>The bald, fat combatant vanished, he went rolling on the floor, broke through the windowpane, and tumbled down in the garden.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, come! Come! It\u2019s a suspicious person!!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is this a historical drama!?</p><br/><p>Well, anyhow, this person wanted to surround me!!</p><br/><p>You should\u2019ve done so properly from the beginning!</p><br/><p>I was completely surrounded by the combatants.</p><br/><p>\u300cWe don\u2019t know who you are, but don\u2019t think you can come back alive!\u300d</p><br/><p>Ooh, scary, scary.</p><br/><p>That is to say, you have the resolution to be killed, too?</p><br/><p>Well, I\u2019m not going to kill you since I\u2019m kind.</p><br/><p>One of the combatants surrounding me made a kamikaze attack with a knife.</p><br/><p>They probably intended to gauge my strength using the lowest underling.</p><br/><p>*Gashi!*</p><br/><p>When I held the knife which had been struck out between my fingers, the guy wasn\u2019t able to move the knife anymore.</p><br/><p>I kicked the guy away.</p><br/><p>\u300c*Gugo!*\u300d</p><br/><p>The guy, who has been kicked, vanishes and crashes into the wall, but he still tries to stand up.</p><br/><p>Did I went a little too easy on you? It\u2019s difficult to adjust, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou left this thing behind.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I threw the knife, it grazed over the guy\u2019s ear then pierced into the wall.</p><br/><p>\u300cHii-!!\u300d</p><br/><p>The guy looked ghastly pale and sank down to the floor.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>*Pan!*</p><br/><p>With a dry sound, red blood filled the floor.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s notes:</p><br/><p>[1]Lit. means \u2018rabbit hutch\u2019, but it also makes a derogatory reference to cramped housing in Japan.</p><br/><p>[2]A joke(probably) about the Japanese tongue-twister: \u306b\u306f\u304c\u3044\u308b (niwa ni wa niwa niwatori ga iru) which means \u201cThere are two chickens in the garden.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It has become insufficient.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre the magic stones taken from the mines and dungeons?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe magic stones produced in a mine will be able to manage somehow or another but,</p><br/><p> the magic stones that can only be taken in a dungeon are completely insufficient.</p><br/><p> I'm now looking for adventurers to go to the dungeon and get magic stones in this town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs the dungeon, the\u300etower of sunrise\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that's right.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'll also try to go tomorrow.</p><br/><p> Would Aya, Elena and Hilda like to go as well?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cGood.\u300d\u300cI'll go with you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that so, you're going to go there, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, today is already late,</p><br/><p> shall we stay at Aria-san's place?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!?

After all, isn't that child a slave?\u300d</p><br/><p> That sort of treatment, huh......</p><br/><p>\u300cShould I have gone to Aria-san's place after all~?\u300d</p><br/><p> When I muttered so casually\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cN! Wait a moment!\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela, with amazing energy, prepared Hilda's seat.</p><br/><p> Was Lela this obliging?</p><br/><p> The dinner was over and a room was assigned to each of us.</p><br/><p> The room assignment was, Aya and Hilda shared a room,</p><br/><p> except them, everyone had been assigned a room each.</p><br/><p> Well, to flirt with a slave girl,</p><br/><p> didn't particularly come to mind at all, okay?</p><br/><p> I felt a little worried that something might happened and visited Aya and Hilda's room.</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry for bothering you guys.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya let Hilda sat on the carpet and combed her hair.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's the matter, oniichan? Creeping at night into a woman's bedroom?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn what world will you find an oniichan creeping at night into his imouto's bedroom?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, what did you come here to do?\u300d</p><br/><p> What kind of treatment is this I am getting on Aya?</p><br/><p> Oh well.</p><br/><p>\u300cDidn't you eat so little a while ago, Hilda?</p><br/><p> Then, are you not hungry?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUh, that, I was nervous......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it's only natural to get nervous if it's that kind of atmosphere, isn't that right?\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya patted Hilda's head.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I'm sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou don't need to apologize. Aya and I are both commoners like you, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? Even though you're the Hero, you're a commoner?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm not a Hero, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I'm sorry.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda keeps apologizing.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat means, let's eat a cup of noodles.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that's good~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat's a\u300ecup noodles\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena has been called as well and we held a 4-man cup noodles party.</p><br/><p> I took the multicolored cup noodles and kettle out from the inventory.</p><br/><p> I put water into the kettle using\u3010Water magic\u3011and boiled the water with\u3010Heating element\u3011magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, Is that Fire magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's different, this is Lightning magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cL-, Lightning!?\u300d</p><br/><p> Hilda is a friend and must be informed of our secrets.</p><br/><p> We each chose a cup noodle we would like to eat and poured hot water.</p><br/><p> Hilda didn't seem to know which was which but chose the smallest one.</p><br/><p> Hilda, the smallest one is the world famous, best-selling product throughout the world. By the way, I like it very much too.</p><br/><p> After waiting for 3 minutes, I handed fork to Hilda while Aya, Elena and I used chopsticks. The four of us ate peacefully.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It's delicious!!\u300d</p><br/><p> That's right, that's right.</p><br/><p> It's the best-selling cup noodles throughout the world after all.</p><br/><p> When the four of us were eating peacefully, Lela came to visit.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, are you here?

We prefer meals that matched adventurers more than such dinner since we are adventurers.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, adventurer, huh......\u300d</p><br/><p> Lela had been lost in thought for some reason.</p><br/><p> What did you really come here to do?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

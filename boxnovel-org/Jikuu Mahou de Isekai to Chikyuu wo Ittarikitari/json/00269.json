The underling sank down to the floor.</p><br/><p>The shot underling didn\u2019t move anymore in the pool of blood.</p><br/><p>\u300cOur \u25cb\u25cbsociety[1] doesn\u2019t need a weakling like you.\u300d</p><br/><p>Basically, the combatants\u2019 morale have almost fallen, so he intends to stop it using fear.</p><br/><p>But, that strategy has a fatal flaw.</p><br/><p>I kicked the floor and spanned the distance between us in one go, then I kicked the scary-looking guy, who shot the underling, flying.</p><br/><p>That guy uttered a cry like that of a squashed frog and crashed into the wall.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it means, the fall of the morale accelerates in reverse if you do this to the person who was doing the threatening!</p><br/><p>The combatants were surprised at my strength and simultaneously moved backward for about three steps.</p><br/><p>I approached the shot underling slowly.</p><br/><p>Umu, he doesn\u2019t seem to be dead yet.</p><br/><p>For the time being, I gently stopped the bleeding using\u3010Recovery magic\u3011and made him recover to the extent that he won\u2019t die even if he was left alone.</p><br/><p>You should live and make up for your crimes.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s about time, let\u2019s start the great scuffle!</p><br/><p>When I moved one step forward, these guys moved one step backward, too.</p><br/><p>When I moved two steps forward, these guys moved two steps backward, too.</p><br/><p>Oy! You don\u2019t have to be scared!</p><br/><p>I saw the guy, who was located farthest to the rear, moved stealthily in order to escape from the entryway.</p><br/><p>As if I would let you go!</p><br/><p>I set a\u3010barrier\u3011up in order to block the entryway.</p><br/><p>*Thud.*</p><br/><p>The guy, who was going to escape, is blocked by the barrier and hits his head.</p><br/><p>He desperately touches the invisible barrier while getting flustered.</p><br/><p>Several people, who noticed, also rush up to look at the situation and frantically strike the barrier, but it\u2019s not going to be destroyed like that, you know?</p><br/><p>The other combatants seem to have also understood the situation and run about in confusion like baby spiders.</p><br/><p>This place is the lobby of the hideout.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a\u300ewindow towards the garden\u300f, a\u300edoor leading inside\u300f,\u300estairs towards the second floor\u300f,\u300eiron door towards the basement\u300fand et cetera, the combatants are trying to escape in pieces.</p><br/><p>Since it will be troublesome if they were to escape to the basement, all except the\u300estairs towards the second floor\u300fwere blocked with\u3010Barrier\u3011.</p><br/><p>The combatants, who were robbed off of their escape route by the invisible wall, cause a group panic and rush on the\u300estairs towards the second floor\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cMove asidee!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, too, don\u2019t block my way!\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh no, you mustn\u2019t panic when evacuating.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t you know the\u300eokashimo[2]\u300fof evacuation?</p><br/><p>Is it\u300eOsanai\u300f,\u300eKakenai\u300f,\u300eShaberenai\u300f,\u300eModorenai\u300f?</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cGyaa!\u300d\u300d\u300cGuee!\u300d</p><br/><p>As I am worrying, the combatants create a stampede on the stairs.</p><br/><p>I told you so.</p><br/><p>Everyone should properly follow the\u300eokashimo\u300f, too!</p><br/><p>I hit the ones, who luckily escaped from the stampede, on the solar plexus and made them faint one by one, then I tied them together with the ones, who were exhausted, at the bottom of the stairs with vinyl cord and made sure they couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>The first floor has mostly been cleared up,</p><br/><p>the next is the second floor!</p><br/><p>I went up to the second floor triumphantly.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>Because the\u3010Predicted Attack Area\u3011suddenly appeared when I opened the door of the second floor, I quickly shifted my body to the side.</p><br/><p>*Pan!*</p><br/><p>A handgun\u2019s bullet passed by at the place where I was just a while ago.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t suddenly shoot, what would you do if it\u2019s your subordinate?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bastard, what kind of person are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>The boss asked with a dreadful voice.</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough it\u2019s presumptuous to ask someone his name,</p><br/><p>Japanese ninja man\u30fbhas now arrived!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Slipped\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cIt looks like you\u2019re insane.</p><br/><p>Oy, you guys, play with him.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cOu!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>As the boss snaps his finger, the people from his left and right step forward.</p><br/><p>One is a tall lanky person with swept back hair. He\u2019s holding a knife in his hand.</p><br/><p>The other one is a giant, orc-like man with crew cut. This fellow is swinging an iron pipe around.</p><br/><p>They look like\u300eSuke-san and Kaku-san\u300f.</p><br/><p>The first to strike was Kaku-san with his iron pipe.</p><br/><p>\u300cUriya!\u300d</p><br/><p>*Pashi!*</p><br/><p>\u300cEh!?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seems to be unbelievable that the iron pipe was caught by me, Kaku-san\u2019s eyes turned into dots.</p><br/><p>*Baki!*</p><br/><p>And then, Suke-san, who was going to stab me stealthily from behind with a knife, was blown away by my roundhouse kick.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, I did a one-armed shoulder throw on Kaku-san and hurled him away to bumped against Suke-san, who was trying to get up.</p><br/><p>Suke-san and Kaku-san, who were exhausted, had their face buried with each other\u2019s crotch in a 69 position.</p><br/><p>Well, a normal human being is like this even if they are called mafia.</p><br/><p>\u300cHou, I thought you\u2019re just a stupid, hentai cosplayer, but you\u2019re not half bad yourself.\u300d</p><br/><p>Who\u2019s the stupid, hentai cosplayer!?</p><br/><p>The boss leveled the handgun towards me.</p><br/><p>\u300cNo matter how strong you idiot is, you\u2019re no match against this.\u300d</p><br/><p>And then, the boss pulled the trigger without hesitation.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any indications and the like, because it was a sudden attack, the\u300ePredicted Attack Area\u300fwas displayed at the last minute, too.</p><br/><p>Well, an attack like this can be easily dodge\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I hurriedly cancelled dodging and set up a barrier.</p><br/><p>*Parin!*</p><br/><p>As one would expect, the barrier doesn\u2019t seem to be able to defend against the handgun\u2019s bullet either and shatters.</p><br/><p>I slashed the handgun\u2019s bullet, which had its speed decreased a little, with the\u3010white belt sword\u3011that I took out from inventory.</p><br/><p>D-, Dangerous\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cYou! Where did you aim at!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I was trembling with anger.</p><br/><p>Behind me were the exhausted Suke-san and Kaku-san.</p><br/><p>If I dodged the handgun\u2019s bullet, it would hit the two people behind.</p><br/><p>This guy knew it and shot.</p><br/><p>\u300cGuhahaha!\u300d</p><br/><p>The boss started to burst with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s funny!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, are you a Japanese?\u300d</p><br/><p>Eh?

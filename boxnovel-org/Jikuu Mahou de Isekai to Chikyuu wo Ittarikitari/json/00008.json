Since there is a once-a-day limit for transferring to another world, we can\u2019t return to Japan until tomorrow. The only places we could teleport to in this world are the \u300eAudience Hall\u300f and \u300ePrincess Elena\u2019s Room\u300f. Given that I kidnapped the princess, the \u300eAudience Hall\u300f is out of the question, therefore I decided to move to \u300ePrincess Elena\u2019s Room\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? This is my room.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I\u2019m kidnapping you, I think you should change into better clothing\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis magic is amazing, I\u2019ve never heard of magic like this before. Ah, right, I need to change. Please wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYour clothes stands out right now so I hope you have some plain looking clothes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p> While Princess Elena was preparing, I started erecting barriers for the room. For now, I\u2019ve raised a \u3010Physical Barrier\u3011to prevent anyone coming in and a \u3010Sound Barrier\u3011 to make sure no one outside can hear us.</p><br/><p> When I finished erecting the barriers and turned around\u2014</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaaa!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena was in the middle of changing.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-sorry!\u300d</p><br/><p> I suppressed my desire to keep my eyes on the princess and turned away.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-It\u2019s fine, could you please wait for a little longer?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-sure.\u300d</p><br/><p> Behind me, I can hear the seductive sound of her changing. \u300eTurn around\u300f, the devil inside whispered in my mind, but I held my ground and stayed still.</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologise for the wait, I\u2019m done. You can turn around now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, so you\u2019ve finished.\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena\u2019s clothes don\u2019t look too princess-y anymore, this should be okay.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you have any other clothes besides this one you can change into?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is the most inconspicuous clothes I have.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, we\u2019ll take all your clothes for now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEhh? Everything? That\u2019s impossible, there\u2019s no way it could fit in my bag.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, just leave it to me.\u300d</p><br/><p> Guided by the princess, I stepped into her walk-in closet and was amazed by the ridiculous amount of clothes she had.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat an amazing amount.\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena cast me an apologetic gaze. I rapidly tossed all her clothes into my Inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cM-my clothes are all quickly disappearing. Is this magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYep. Don\u2019t worry since I can retrieve anything I want afterwards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-that\u2019s amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p> Princess Elena\u2019s voice of admiration became strangely excited. I finally finished putting away all the clothes into my Inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing, you really took everything!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you have anything else you want to bring?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it okay if I take some books?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYep.\u300d</p><br/><p> Going to the bookshelf, she also had a fair amount of books.</p><br/><p> Accustomed to it, I was able to easily put away the books.</p><br/><p> Since it started to get a bit bothersome, I decide to toss everything in the room into my Inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cPhew, did I put away everything in the room?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou even put in the bed, this is really amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p> The room had become completely empty.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow that we\u2019ve finished here, we have to think about where we can escape to now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI would like to go to Seiji-sama\u2019s residence.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSorry, I can only teleport to other worlds once a day. We\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow to move to my room.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo that\u2019s how it is. We\u2019ll have to spend the night at an inn then.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, then we\u2019ll need to go to town first.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBut how do we escape the castle?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry. Is there somewhere I can see the outside from this castle?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. This window overlooks the castle town.\u300d</p><br/><p> I gaze outside the window pointed out by Princess Elena,</p><br/><p> There was a large plaza with a fountain in the center that intersected all the main streets of the castle town.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat plaza should be fine for now. Elena, your hand please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took Elena\u2019s hand and used \u3010Teleportation\u3011 to transfer us to the Fountain Plaza.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

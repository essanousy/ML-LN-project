Men is one of the five strikes in kendo (along with tsuki, d\u014d, hidari kote and migi kote). It is a long slashing stroke that falls on the centre-line of the head. Men also designates the movement, the target, and the part of the kendo armour that covers the whole head. The kiai for this strike, as for all strikes in kendo, is the name of the target area. Basically, Seiji used hidari kote (strike to the left forearm) here since Riche used his left fist\u2015Wikipedia\u21a9</p><br/><p>3I think it\u2019s referring to the katana\u2019s habaki? Basically, the blade\u2019s base.\u21a9</p><br/><p>4(Toujutsu) basically means art of wielding sword while (Kenjutsu) means art of sword fighting which was translated in the past chapters as [Sword Techniques], if you have any naming ideas, please let me know on the comment section.\u21a9</p><br/><p>5Tsubazeriai means hand-guard fight.

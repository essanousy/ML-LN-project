S-sorry!\u300d</p><br/><p> I bolted out of the toilet.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll be on this side, if there is anything you don\u2019t know, yell out okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> Soon afterward, the sound of holy water came from\u2026</p><br/><p> Wah! This is bad!! AAH, I\u2019M NOT LISTENING! I\u2019M NOT LISTENING AT ALL!</p><br/><p> I smacked both my ears to destroy my eardrums. I have to quickly destroy them.</p><br/><p> As I was trying to destroy my eardrums, I suddenly noticed something.</p><br/><p> Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t told her how to use the lock! Then that means\u2026\u2026 right now, this door, isn\u2019t locked!?</p><br/><p> IF, in the rare chance that this door opened\u2026\u2026 then inside Elena is\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> AH!!!! AAH, I don\u2019t know!! I really don\u2019t know!!</p><br/><p> I banged my head against the wall to erase the memories of my earlier thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u300cE-excuse me\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p> I failed to destroy my eardrums and erase my memories. As I tried to regulate my disordered breathing, Elena called out to me from inside.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-is there something for me to wipe myself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cS-something to wipe?\u300d</p><br/><p> Shoot, I forgot I haven\u2019t explained how to use the toilet paper either!</p><br/><p>\u300cTo the side, there should be a roll of paper, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes, there is. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTake some of it, and fold it up to use it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-take this? U-understood.\u300d</p><br/><p> I heard a clacking sound, it seems she was able to figure out how to use it.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat should I do with the paper after I finished wiping?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust throw it away in the water.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThrow it away!? Understood.\u300d</p><br/><p> After a while, I heard the sound of the door opening and Elena came out.</p><br/><p>\u300cI apologise for the trouble I have given you.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hmm? Something\u2019s not right. What is this strange feeling stuck in the back of my mind?</p><br/><p>PIKON!</p><br/><p> That\u2019s it! I didn\u2019t hear the sound of the water flushing! T-that means\u2026 it\u2019s still not flushed!!</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, wait!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere should be a metal lever, right? Go and quickly twist it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, yes, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Flush</p><br/><p> At last I heard the sound of the toilet flush, that\u2019s a relief.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaa! T-the water is!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena was taken back by the water that suddenly flushed away.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s okay,since the water is just flushing everything.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, the water is settling.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSee.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat really surprised me.\u300d</p><br/><p> Having survived today\u2019s greatest pinch, I led Elena to the washroom.</p><br/><p>\u300cWash your hands here.\u300d</p><br/><p> I twisted the faucet and water gushed out, Elena was surprised again.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy don\u2019t you try using\u3010Hand Soap\u3011 while we\u2019re at it too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Hand Soap\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p> I moved Elena\u2019s hands underneath the pump of the \u3010Hand Soap\u3011 dispenser and pushed the pump.</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaa! Something white squirted out.\u300d</p><br/><p> Why did you have to say it like that! Oh well.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you scrub your hands, it will foaming up and clean your hands.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I will try.\u300d</p><br/><p>Scrub Scrub</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is amazing! It\u2019s foaming!\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena\u2019s eyes were shining like a child in delight.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, you can\u2019t play forever so rinse it already.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> After Elena washed away the foam, I handed her a towel.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere, wipe your hands.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much. This cloth is also soft and fluffy\u300d</p><br/><p> Elena who had finished washing, gazed at her own hand absentmindedly.</p><br/><p>\u300cMy hands are so smooth now. This is amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p> If she\u2019s this happy after washing her hands, I\u2019m a bit worried about the future. As I thought about things like that, I felt a warm and fluffy feeling withing my heart for some reason.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

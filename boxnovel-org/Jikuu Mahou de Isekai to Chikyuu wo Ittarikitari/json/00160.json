of sunrise\u2019s second floor</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>We started the exploration of the second floor.</p><br/><p> Aya is in the lead,</p><br/><p> followed by Lela, Elena, Hilda and me.</p><br/><p> We moved forward through the passage, entered the first room</p><br/><p> and were attacked by two foxes.</p><br/><p> Both of them sprung to Aya,</p><br/><p> one of the monsters was killed by Aya instantaneously</p><br/><p> while the other one was repelled by Lela's shield and was thrown off balance.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere it goes!\u300d</p><br/><p> Then, Elena's Ice magic burst,</p><br/><p> the fox, which had been thrown off balance, was pierced through in the belly by the Ice magic and could no longer move.</p><br/><p>\u300cInstant killing, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, they are weak, aren't they?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, it's still the second floor.\u300d</p><br/><p> Actually, as much as they don't come with an overwhelming number, it's an easier win than the great rats.</p><br/><p> We waited for Hilda to cut the fox's tail off and moved to the next room.</p><br/><p> In the next room, three foxes appeared.</p><br/><p> While Aya keeps dodging the attacks of the three foxes,</p><br/><p> Lela hits them with her shield, blowing them off one at a time</p><br/><p> and Elena's Ice magic finishes them off.</p><br/><p> At the same time as Elena's magic finished off two of them, Aya also killed the last one as well,</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's attack head on!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya is in high tension.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We didn't see any enemies in the third room.</p><br/><p>\u300cTsk, end, huh.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya was going to go back but</p><br/><p> I knew that there was an enemy.</p><br/><p>\u300cIdiot, it's there!\u300d</p><br/><p> Faster than Aya looking back, the enemy sprung at Aya.</p><br/><p>Don!</p><br/><p> Producing a dull sound,</p><br/><p> the enemy's attack</p><br/><p> was blocked by Lela's shield.</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks, Lela.\u300d</p><br/><p> Being thanked by Aya, Lela bloomed with a smile.</p><br/><p> The mysterious enemy kicked Lela's shield,</p><br/><p> after rotating around in the air once, it landed.</p><br/><p> It quickly tried to flee into the darkness and was about to succeed\u2015</p><br/><p> it has been slashed by Aya from behind and died.</p><br/><p> The fallen enemy was a black fox.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince the black ones seems to be good at hiding, be careful, Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Un.\u300d</p><br/><p> It seems for Aya, enemies who hides is like a weak point.</p><br/><p> The magic stone that Hilda had retrieved by dismantling</p><br/><p> was a\u3010Darkness reinforcement magic stone\u3011.</p><br/><p>\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e\uff5e</p><br/><p> In the next room, with two common foxes,</p><br/><p> a dark brown fox with a body one size larger was there.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat one seems to be strong!\u300d</p><br/><p> While Lela and Elena killing 1 of the common ones,</p><br/><p> Aya had already managed to cut the other one off in the act of rapid slash</p><br/><p> and further attacked the dark brown fox as well using the same momentum.</p><br/><p> However, the dark brown fox withstands Aya's blow</p><br/><p> and has managed to somehow take an attack posture.</p><br/><p> Oh, not bad!</p><br/><p> Immediately after, it quickly sunk down at Aya's second attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt was a little strong.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya has an overjoyed expression.</p><br/><p> The magic stone that Hilda took out was the\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stone\u3011.</p><br/><p> Good ones doesn't appear easily, huh.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Then, we cleared some of the rooms</p><br/><p> and it was then when we entered the seventh room.</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, beautiful.\u300d</p><br/><p> When we turned toward the middle of the room at Aya's words,</p><br/><p> there was a fox shining in gold, intimidating us.</p><br/><p>\u300cBe careful, Aya.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI know.\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya approached it carelessly and attacked but\u2015</p><br/><p> the golden fox suddenly accelerated and dodged Aya's attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cUwa, this guy is quick!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya is trying to attack it many times but</p><br/><p> the golden fox suddenly accelerates each time and dodges the attack.</p><br/><p>\u300cAya, need help?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou must not interfere, oniichan.\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, it's still a weak enemy, it will be alright.</p><br/><p> As the golden fox's speed was fast, Lela and Elena wasn't able to participate in the fight.</p><br/><p> The one-on-one tag of Aya and the golden fox continued for a while,</p><br/><p> the golden fox's breath was finally on the verge of giving out and the speed of its rapid acceleration also fell.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt's the chance!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya caught up with the golden fox's rapid acceleration, violently thrusting her knife from behind and killing it with a single blow.</p><br/><p>\u300cYay!!\u300d</p><br/><p> Well, Aya doesn't seem to be using magic yet,</p><br/><p> she is just having a warm-up.</p><br/><p> Hilda finished the dismantling and brought the magic stone.</p><br/><p> The magic stone was\u3010magic stone of biribiri\u3011.</p><br/><p> It's a pity, I have this in large quantities.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Like that, when we continued to explore some of the rooms,</p><br/><p> we found a big room connected with several dozen of places.</p><br/><p> The stairs to the upper floor are visible at the depths of the room.</p><br/><p> However, at the depths of the room,</p><br/><p> a gigantic white fox was waiting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

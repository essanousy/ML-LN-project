Where did it go?\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya, a girl should not say\u300eshit\u300f.</p><br/><p> The\u300eboss\u300f's movements were also fast but</p><br/><p> its black color had become a camouflage and occasionally disappeared from sight.</p><br/><p> Though I plan to not intervene as much as possible but there's no helping it.</p><br/><p>\u300cLela! Use\u3010Light magic\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes!\u300d</p><br/><p> When Lela shone a light with magic,</p><br/><p> the inside of the gloomy dungeon was brightly illuminated.</p><br/><p> Lela's magic had also become stronger than before.</p><br/><p> The\u300eboss\u300f, who had become completely exposed being illuminated by Lela's Light magic, was daunted.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow!\u300d</p><br/><p> Aya quickly struck at the daunted\u300eboss\u300f, with a knife thrust,</p><br/><p> the\u300eboss\u300fdisappointingly collapsed and could no longer move.</p><br/><p>\u300cYay! Thanks, Lela!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cO-, Oh.\u300d</p><br/><p> The relationship between Aya and Lela had become awkward for a long time since the fighting competition but</p><br/><p> it seems they were opening up a bit by fighting together.</p><br/><p> When the battle was over,</p><br/><p> Hilda rushed up to the fallen enemies,</p><br/><p> the common great rats had their\u3010tails\u3011cut off,</p><br/><p> while the\u300emid-bosses\u300fand\u300eboss\u300fwere handled well and had their\u3010magic stones\u3011taken out.</p><br/><p> Hilda, who couldn't participate in the fight,</p><br/><p> seemed to be full of vigor in dismantling.</p><br/><p> When Hilda finished the dismantling quickly, she brought it to me.</p><br/><p> The\u3010Tail of great rat\u3011seemed to be a subjugation proof.</p><br/><p> And the magic stones that were taken out of the mid-bosses and the boss</p><br/><p> were\u3010Earth reinforcement magic stones\u3011and\u3010Darkness reinforcement magic stone +1\u3011.</p><br/><p> What a pity! Both magic stones can be easily made.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We climbed the stairs and reached the second floor.</p><br/><p> When we go up to the second floor, the smell of mold has suddenly disappeared</p><br/><p> and the air is somewhat chilly.</p><br/><p> When we arrived at the second floor,</p><br/><p> \u300efox\u300f-like monsters were there!</p><br/><p> The foxes preyed on the great rats which had escaped to the stairs a little while ago.</p><br/><p> When the foxes noticed us, they fled with great rats held in their mouths.</p><br/><p> Apparently, the enemies on the second floor were the\u300efox\u300f-like monsters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

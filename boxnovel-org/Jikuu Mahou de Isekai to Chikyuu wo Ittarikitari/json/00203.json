That means......</p><br/><p> Elena will torture the female devil-kin spy.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300eWhich means, it's now or never if you want to spill out the scheme.</p><br/><p> If you don't want to talk no matter what, you will be subjected to a torture.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHumph, I'm not going to talk even if you torture me.\u300f</p><br/><p> Un, that's right.</p><br/><p> I suspected as much......it can't be helped, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems she won't talk no matter what.</p><br/><p> Elena-sensei, please.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!

Giyahahahaha!!!!\u300f</p><br/><p> Although Elena is touching the female spy,</p><br/><p> she's not tickling her in particular.</p><br/><p> The reason why the female spy is laughing\u2015</p><br/><p> seems to be because the recovery magic is being cast on her.</p><br/><p> Why does it tickle with recovery magic?</p><br/><p> There seems to be a problem with how the recovery magic is cast.</p><br/><p> It just feels itchy when healing normal wounds but......</p><br/><p> when recovery magic is excessively cast on healthy part,</p><br/><p> it becomes intensely ticklish like this.</p><br/><p>\u300eHaa haa, please stop it already......\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you going to talk now?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, go!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGyaa-!!!!</p><br/><p> Guhahahaha!!!</p><br/><p> Hii---!!\u300f</p><br/><p> The screams and laughs of the woman resounded in the prison.</p><br/><p> After a while, the woman was completely exhausted from laughing.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow is it? Are you ready to talk?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eIf I talk...I'll be killed......\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSo, the fact that you had a poisoned knife means that you probably intended to kill the demonkind, right?</p><br/><p> Although you were trying to kill the demonkind and me, you want yourself to live?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHumph, no matter how many single horned or hornless die means nothing to me!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p> As expected, Elena seems to be embarrassed too.</p><br/><p> It's understandable.</p><br/><p> The woman blacked out many times from laughing too much.</p><br/><p> I splashed water on her each time and continued the torture.</p><br/><p> Then, the torture was repeated for quite some time......</p><br/><p> the woman wasn't going to talk at all.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, as expected, any more that this......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI give up, to be stubborn up to here......</p><br/><p> What will you do, Bunmi-san?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf there's no way to make her talk\u2015</p><br/><p> let's kill the woman.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cN!?\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems to have happened before when we caught several devil-kin,</p><br/><p> even if we give them something, they will not eat then die.</p><br/><p> We can't let them go either so it's quicker to kill them.\u300d</p><br/><p> Seriously!?</p><br/><p>\u300cP-, Please wait.</p><br/><p> Please let me continue to torture her a little bit more.\u300d</p><br/><p> Hearing that the woman will be killed, Elena started to get flustered.</p><br/><p> Well, it will be hard to wake her up with this......</p><br/><p>\u300cBut what will you do, Elena?</p><br/><p> There are no sign of her confessing at all even if you tickled her.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI will use my trump card......\u300d</p><br/><p> Trump card?</p><br/><p> It seems even Elena herself doesn't want to do it too much either.</p><br/><p> Just what kind of torture will it be?</p><br/><p>\u300cI'm sorry but Bunmi-san and Hilda, please go outside.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause it's something that can't be shown to a man and a minor......\u300d</p><br/><p> Urged by Cassandra-san, Bunmi-san went outside and several female soldiers went in instead.</p><br/><p> Although Hilda didn't understand the circumstances well, she followed Elena's instructions.</p><br/><p>\u300cDon't I have to go out as well?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, I don't want to show it to Seiji-sama either but</p><br/><p> it will not go well if there's no interpreter......\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I see.\u300d</p><br/><p> In order to prevent the female spy from being killed,</p><br/><p> Elena began her final torture as a last resort.</p><br/><p>\u300eHigi--!!!</p><br/><p> Hiyaun!!!</p><br/><p> No--!!!\u300f</p><br/><p> Completely different from a little while ago, a terrible scream resounded......</p><br/><p> The woman let out drool, tears, and various different liquids. Her eyes turned upward and her body twitched many times.</p><br/><p> It's a terrible torture......</p><br/><p> If only I'm the one doing it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p> Uh-oh, bad, I must stay in my position......</p><br/><p> I kept watching the state of the terrible torture without looking away.</p><br/><p> The torture continued for a while\u2015</p><br/><p> the woman had her body twitched intensely and she became completely exhausted afterward.</p><br/><p> I decided to ask her again.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow is it?

What do you mean!?\u300f</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s mom is surprised this time.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s a difference between Japanese and American culture.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a custom in Japan that you have to apologize first in this kind of situation.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eOh! It\u2019s unbelievable.\u300f</p><br/><p>Seeing that Nancy\u2019s mom making an exaggerated surprised gesture, the director is surprised this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cWait, Maruyama-kun.

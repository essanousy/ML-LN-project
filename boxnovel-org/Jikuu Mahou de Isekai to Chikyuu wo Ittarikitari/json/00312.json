They were already dead when I got here.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not clear, but it seems there\u2019s something that killed the ten orcs, huh.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince it seems somewhat dangerous, let\u2019s regroup. Let\u2019s go meet Elena and Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>I took Aya\u2019s hand and meet the two.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, are we going to move together now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah, it\u2019s for safety. The monsters are becoming strong as we advance towards the north.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, everyone, depart!\u300d</p><br/><p>That is to say, in order to move together, the need to adjust to the slowest person arises.</p><br/><p>Among the four of us, the slowest is Hilda, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hilda\u2019s speed is faster than I thought.</p><br/><p>Why\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>When I appraised Hilda, the level of her [Body Reinforcement] magic rose from 2 to 3.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, the level of [Body Reinforcement] rose thanks to her running about in the forest the last few days.</p><br/><p>And Hilda, in order to catch up to us, doesn\u2019t neglect to make an effort and makes full use of all her magics.</p><br/><p>We pushed the search in forest forward at a moderate speed.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>While pushing the search forward for a while,</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone, stop!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s wrong, onii-chan? Is there something up ahead?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYeah.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we stealthily approached towards where the reaction is, there were two monsters of different type fighting.</p><br/><p>It was a [normal orc] and a [black orc].</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, it seems to be a situation where the black orc attacked the base of the normal orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, what should we do? Should we attack them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe search will fall behind schedule, but\u2026\u2026they may also attack a person somewhere if left alone. Let\u2019s attack them.\u300d</p><br/><p>The white and black orcs, receiving a surprise attack from the side while fighting, were quickly annihilated as easy as twisting a baby\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Were the orcs so weak like this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe became strong since our level rose considerably with the capture of the Tower of Sunrise~.\u300d</p><br/><p>While putting the defeated orcs into the inventory, we headed towards the north once more.</p><br/><p>\u300cHmmm, there are only black orcs in this area.\u300d</p><br/><p>We encountered black orcs many times as we advance towards the north.</p><br/><p>By sun set, nearly 100 black orcs were defeated, but our objective, the Devil race\u2019s town, wasn\u2019t found.</p><br/><p>The black orcs wandering around this area look calm, the Devil race\u2019s town is probably somewhere else.</p><br/><p>[Tracking Beacons] were sent out to search in the forest radially in order to expand the search area and we decided to go home.</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, can I try to use the [Teleporation Magic Stone] to go home?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, try it.\u300d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, it\u2019s going to be my first time seeing other people use [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, I\u2019m going!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya grasped the [Teleportation Magic Stone] tightly and poured Magic Power into it.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? I didn\u2019t get transferred?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan, this is a defective product!\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong?</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t she get transferred?</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, can you try and test it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>When Elena grasped the [Teleportation Magic Stone] tightly and poured Magic Power into it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Along with the sound of the wind, Elena disappeared.</p><br/><p>When I checked the [Tracking Beacon]\u2019s video, Elena had returned home properly.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seemed Elena could use it properly. Next, you try it, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Hilda could use it, too.</p><br/><p>However-!</p><br/><p>When I checked the [Tracking Beacon]\u2019s video, Hilda was sitting down on the spot where she had been teleported to at home.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda\u2019s situation is strange. Aya, let\u2019s go home immediately.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I took Aya and returned home, Elena was nursing Hilda, who had sat down.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, what\u2019s wrong!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It seems I\u2019ve used a lot of magic power.\u300d</p><br/><p>What!?</p><br/><p>When I used [Appraisal] on Hilda\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>Hilda\u2019s MP had been almost depleted.</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, eat a candy quickly.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Hilda ate a candy and recovered her MP; her physical condition somehow returned to normal.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, onii-chan, why did this happen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt seems the [Teleportation Magic Stone] uses a considerable amount of MP.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cConsiderable amount, you say, how much?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think it\u2019s around 3, 000. Since Hilda\u2019s MP is a little bit over 3, 000, she can barely use it once and since Elena has 7, 000 MP, she can use it twice.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, how about me, how much is my MP again?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya\u2019s MP is around 2, 500.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can\u2019t use it!?\u300d</p><br/><p>After that, as a result of doing various things and experiments\u2015\u2015</p><br/><p>We found out that the transfer across worlds consumes 3, 000 MP while in the case of the transfer within a world, 1, 000 MP is consumed.</p><br/><p>In addition, we also found out that the transfer across worlds can only be used once a day just like mine previously.</p><br/><p>\u300cAnnoying! How can I be the only one who can\u2019t use it!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya was stamping her feet in frustration.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019ll be able to use it if you\u2019re in Earth. Besides, isn\u2019t 2, 500 MP also a lot more than an ordinary person\u2019s?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI also want to go back and forth between Earth and the other world! Onii-chan, how can I increase my MP?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt will increase when the level of your magic increases.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHow can I increase the level of my magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy studying.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That~.\u300d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She ate the pudding from the refrigerator with a drowsy look and went back to sleep.</p><br/><p>When I watched Aya who went to Junior College, she charged towards the training room of the Karate club after school. </p><br/><p>As soon as she entered the training room of the karate club, she shouted.</p><br/><p>\u300c*FORGIVE THE INTRUSION!*\u300d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that, a dojo challenge?</p><br/><p>\u300cWho are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s only one kid inside the training room. Kid? That\u2019s the training room of the Junior College\u2019s karate club?</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m here to join the karate club\u2026\u2026 who are you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m the captain of the karate club that you\u2019d like to join.\u300d</p><br/><p>Captain? This kid? No matter how you look at it, she\u2019s1 about a primary school student.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, where\u2019s the T.R.U.E captain?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m like this so I\u2019m resigned to be misunderstood\u2026\u2026 are you perhaps a freshmen? That attitude is kinda rude towards a senior.\u300d</p><br/><p>After saying that, the kid\u2019s atmosphere suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya also noticed it and took a fighting stance.</p><br/><p>\u300cHou, that\u2019s a strange stance, are you self-taught?\u300d</p><br/><p>As soon as those words left her mouth, the kid kicked the floor and attacked Aya.</p><br/><p>Aya minutely dodged the kid\u2019s attack and took the opportunity. But, she slipped due to her wearing socks and fell down.</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause this is a wooden floor, you\u2019ll slide when wearing socks.\u300d</p><br/><p>Said the kid captain. Aya took her socks off and threw it away.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, shall we increase the speed a little?\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain rushed with movements quicker than before. Having her socks off, Aya was able to move properly now and managed to fend off the attack easily.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow did you manage to avoid that!? That\u2019s not karate in the least.\u300d</p><br/><p>After that, Aya continued to dodge the quick attacks of the kid captain.</p><br/><p>\u300cIyaa, your movements are interesting. It\u2019s like you can move at will.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou shouldn\u2019t talk.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHahaha! Thanks for the reminder.\u300d</p><br/><p>The offense and defense repeated many times, Aya dodged the kid captain\u2019s Foot Sweep Kick with a jump.</p><br/><p>\u300cEat this!\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain canceled the Foot Sweep Kick and let out an upper which looked like an ascending dragon. Aya couldn\u2019t dodge since she was in mid-air.</p><br/><p>*ka-pow* A dull sound resounded in the training room.</p><br/><p>Aya barely blocked it with a cross arm but was overwhelmed by the upper\u2019s power and was blown off to the back. Her back hit the brick wall of the training room.</p><br/><p>\u300cKu!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou were able to block that well, you\u2019re really amazing.\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain really praised her but Aya didn\u2019t think so.</p><br/><p>Aya glared at the kid captain with an exasperated look and began to use\u3010Strength recovery reinforcement\u3011.</p><br/><p>Oy, stop it you idiot. Don\u2019t use magic!</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh? You, what are you doing? Something in your body changed a little, what was it?\u300d</p><br/><p>It seemed the kid captain felt something. Is her perception that sharp?</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, are you doing some kind of trick? Show it to me a little more.\u300d</p><br/><p>When the kid captain says so, she\u2019s beckoning and provoking Aya. Aya\u2019s blood rushed to her head. She took the kid captain\u2019s provocation and rushed towards her.</p><br/><p>While Aya circled around the kid captain, she tried to catch her off-guard and performed knife-hand attacks but all of them were avoided.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s an interesting move but it\u2019s a bit monotonous.\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain kicked sharply and grazed Aya at the nose. Aya tried to dodge the sudden kick and tumbled away into the distance. The kick probably missed on purpose.</p><br/><p>Finally, Aya began to use\u3010Movement speed reinforcement\u3011magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I feel something strange. Is it a trick? It seemed to be something amazing!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya circled around the kid captain and unleashed a barrage of attacks with abnormal speed. The kid captain wasn\u2019t able to completely dodge them and was forced to block occasionally.</p><br/><p>\u300cAmazing! Amazing! What\u2019s thisss!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain frolicked in high spirits.</p><br/><p>Aya gets irritated that her attacks didn\u2019t manage to hit.</p><br/><p>She began to use\u3010Tailwind\u3011and\u3010Wind gust\u3011. Aya, you\u2019re going too far! orz</p><br/><p>\u300cWind\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Even the kid captain noticed the abnormal situation and her face became stiff.</p><br/><p>Aya gradually attacked and managed to graze the kid captain for the first time. The kid captain\u2019s face soon turned serious. </p><br/><p>The speed of the two\u2019s offense and defense increased bit by bit\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cWa?\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain noticed something and made a big jump away from that spot immediately.</p><br/><p>A\u3010Tornado\u3011occurred at the spot where the kid captain stood previously. </p><br/><p>When the kid captain was astonished at the sight, Aya aimed at the kid captain who was in mid-air and unleashed a fist while jumping.</p><br/><p>*ka-pow* A dull sound resounded in the training room, this time, the kid captain was blown off to the wall of the training room.</p><br/><p>Aya who had seen it looked downwards and tried to land but at the moment!\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cKu!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya received an intense pain from her solar plexus and crouched down on the spot.</p><br/><p>The kid captain was blown away but just before she slammed into the wall, she fixed her posture in mid-air and kicked the wall, using that momentum, she attacked Aya who was trying to land on her solar plexus.</p><br/><p>\u300cS-, Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to get serious.\u300d</p><br/><p>The kid captain apologized to the crouching Aya.</p><br/><p>Aya, who was more frustrated with losing that the pain, *egu egu* started crying.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I\u2019m really sorry. Please don\u2019t cry.~\u300d</p><br/><p>And then, a girl with glasses entered.</p><br/><p>\u300cC-, Captain! What did you do!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Yurie-kun. This young woman is sort of like a new member. Because she seemed interesting, we had a little bout.~ I didn\u2019t mean to get serious\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Is the name of this young woman Yurie?</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you serious, captain!? Is she alright!? Should we call an ambulance!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Yurie-chan said something exaggerated. Well, if it\u2019s an ordinary person who received that attack of the kid captain, it wouldn\u2019t end with just being sorry.</p><br/><p>Yurie-chan rushed towards Aya and forcefully pulled Aya\u2019s head into her chest. Aya was buried in the huge chest of Yurie-chan, she forgot to cry and struggled.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s fine already, I\u2019ll cheer you up.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*Mumble mumble*\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYosh yosh, it was painful, wasn\u2019t it?~\u300d</p><br/><p>This kid captain is a dangerous person but this Yurie-chan is also dangerous in a different sense. Huge\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Aya looked upwards in-between Yurie-chan\u2019s breast,</p><br/><p>\u300cKyaa! She\u2019s so cute! Would you like to stay at my house?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, Yurie-kun is a\u300eGachi2\u300fso it\u2019s better to be careful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou\u2019re heartless captain! I\u2019m not a\u300eGachi\u300f.~ I just like cute girls!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s called\u300eGachi\u300f!\u300d</p><br/><p>Is she such a person?\u2026\u2026 It\u2019ll be difficult to pick up Aya.</p><br/><p>Finally, when the 3 people regained their composure, they introduced themselves over again.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m Maruyama Aya, a freshman. I want to join the karate club. Nice to meet you.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m Kawai Mai, karate club\u2019s captain. Best regards.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m the manager, Mihara Yurie. Aya-chan, please treat me well.\u300d</p><br/><p>Such an event, full of ups and downs. That was how Aya joined the karate club.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Assuming that Aya is joining the girl\u2019s division of Karate club.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2This one is really hard to put into words (at least for me), look it up here.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

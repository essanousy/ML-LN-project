Visitors?\u300d</p><br/><p> What greeted us at the entrance\u2015</p><br/><p> was a little girl who looked just like Mai-san.</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? Mai-san's twin sister?</p><br/><p> ......</p><br/><p> No, I'm not going to be tricked!!</p><br/><p> You're Mai-san's okaa-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c......hehehe......</p><br/><p> How admirable of you to have seen through it!</p><br/><p> Right! I'm Mai's okaa-san!!</p><br/><p> As expected of the man who beat Mai!\u300d</p><br/><p> What farce is this......</p><br/><p> Her actual age is probably around 40 years old but\u2015</p><br/><p> both her appearance and behavior are on the same level as a 10-year-old child......</p><br/><p>\u300cStop it, okaa-san. It's embarrassing.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, isn't it fine. It's a normal thing, isn't it?\u300d</p><br/><p> You always do such a thing, huh.</p><br/><p> But, they look exactly alike.</p><br/><p> I've heard that they've been mistaken for sisters but\u2015</p><br/><p> they've been mistaken for twin sisters, huh......</p><br/><p>\u300cAlthough I'm embarrassed to say, this is my okaa-san.\u300d</p><br/><p> Mai-san's okaa-san respectfully bows while pressing three fingers of each of her hands on the floor.[1]</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, since it's hard to talk while standing, please come in.\u300d</p><br/><p> Mai-san's okaa-san welcome us inside while having a dark smile.</p><br/><p>\u300cHave you had dinner yet? Please eat.\u300d</p><br/><p> Umu, it seems to be a very common Japanese dining table but......</p><br/><p> the figure which is preparing dinner quickly looks like an elementary student trying to help.</p><br/><p>\u300cReally, I didn't expect that you were this young.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAra ara, you're such a flatterer, ohohoho.\u300d</p><br/><p> No no, realize that it's not a compliment!</p><br/><p> It already somewhat felt like playing house.</p><br/><p>\u300cNonetheless, as I've heard from Mai, I can sense that you have a frightful 'ki'.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKi?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, even though I've said I can sense your ki, I, only Mai and I can tell so.\u300d</p><br/><p> Because Mai-san can sense magic, is that it?</p><br/><p>\u300cI also want to fight a person who seems to be so strong once.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkaa-san!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand~</p><br/><p> even without making such scary face,</p><br/><p> I wouldn't do such a thing thoughtlessly for my age too ~.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, does obaa-san not come?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat reminds me, you've said that you wanted to hear the story of our obaa-san.</p><br/><p> I'm going to call her out now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood evening, I'm Mai-san's obaa-san.\u300d</p><br/><p> What appeared is an ordinary human.</p><br/><p> She's refined and seems to be a little young to be called obaa-san.</p><br/><p> However, when looking at these three people, no matter how you look at them, nothing but an obaa-san and twin grandchildren can be seen.</p><br/><p>\u300cLet's talk later, please help yourself.\u300d</p><br/><p> As we've been offered, we accepted and partook of the meal.</p><br/><p> Every dishes that little girl okaa-san cooked were delicious, it seems to be what they called the\u300etaste of mom's cooking\u300f.</p><br/><p> A mystery because despite her appearance, she seemed to be a person of suitable age when seeing this part of hers.</p><br/><p> That reminds me, are Elena and Hilda having a meal properly?</p><br/><p> When I checked the tracking beacon's video, Elena and Hilda ordered a pizza delivery and were eating with great relish while they were stretching the cheese with *nyoro~n*.</p><br/><p> When we finished eating and drinking a cup of tea\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300cWhile taking a rest, I'll tell you an old tale.\u300d</p><br/><p> obaa-san began to talk.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Going back exactly 40 years ago......</p><br/><p> When the young obaa-san was on her way home and was walking down the street at night which had become a little dusky\u2015</p><br/><p> she heard a sound like a beast\u2019s groan from a grove of mixed trees where she happened to passed by.</p><br/><p> She was very scared but badly curious for some reason\u2015</p><br/><p> she peered into the grove of mixed trees cautiously.</p><br/><p> Then\u2015</p><br/><p> an oni was there.</p><br/><p> Although one might say it was an oni, it only had 1 horn and apart from that, it looked like a normal person.</p><br/><p> And that oni was crouching down and growling in pain.</p><br/><p> After she approached further\u2015</p><br/><p> somehow or another, this oni seemed to be injured.</p><br/><p> Obaa-san returned home hastily and brought a first aid kit.</p><br/><p> At that time, obaa-san seemed to be going to school to become a nurse and seemed to have a bit knowledge about nursing.</p><br/><p> When obaa-san approached in order to treat the oni, the oni uttered words which obaa-san didn't understand and intimidated her.</p><br/><p> But still, obaa-san somehow managed to convey with gestures that she was going to perform treatment and she treated the oni.</p><br/><p> And when obaa-san finished the treatment and was about to go home\u2015</p><br/><p> the oni suddenly grabbed obaa-san's arm and she couldn't get away.</p><br/><p> But obaa-san didn't understand its language, she guessed what it said was it wants her to stay with it and stood beside the oni for a little while......</p><br/><p> And then, this and that happened......</p><br/><p> like stamen and pistil *bleep bleep*......</p><br/><p> It was morning when a sparrow was tweeting with *chirp chirp*, Obaa-san who had unknowingly slept woke up</p><br/><p> However, the figure of the oni was gone\u2015</p><br/><p> what left in the place were\u2015</p><br/><p> a mantle which covered obaa-san as a futon when she was sleeping\u2015</p><br/><p> a paper which was made with some kind of skin\u2015</p><br/><p> and a pendant placed on that paper as a stone weight for it to not be blown away.</p><br/><p> The pendant had a medal which had something like a family crest drawn on it.</p><br/><p> And a paper on which characters of unknown language are written.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cMy story is such.</p><br/><p> Well, please pay it no heed, it's just an idle talk of an old person.\u300d</p><br/><p> So there are things the oni had left behind......</p><br/><p> they are going to be clues.</p><br/><p>\u300cCan you show me that things it had left behind?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, it's fine.\u300d</p><br/><p> Obaa-san brought out an old wooden box and showed me the three things inside.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, I'll look at them.\u300d</p><br/><p> First, the mantle.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Demon Lord's mantle\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A mantle which can

thought it might be possible but the\u300eDemon Lord\u300f!?</p><br/><p> Next, the pendant.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cAppraisal\uff1e\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Demon Lord's pendant\u3011</p><br/><p>\u2502A pendant which has the crest of the Demon Lord drawn on it.</p><br/><p>\u2502Rarity:

written.</p><br/><p> Or perhaps I should say, this is\u300eDemon Language\u300f!</p><br/><p>\u250f\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501</p><br/><p>\u2503To the human girl whom I don't know the name either.</p><br/><p>\u2503</p><br/><p>\u2503 Thank you for treating my wounds.</p><br/><p>\u2503 I must go home soon,</p><br/><p>\u2503 I've left behind a pendant as thanks for the treatment.</p><br/><p>\u2503 If you're in trouble,</p><br/><p>\u2503 come to the demonkind's town with this.</p><br/><p>\u2503 I'll come to help.</p><br/><p>\u2503</p><br/><p>\u2503 from Demon

is surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, I've met someone who could be this person.</p><br/><p> I'm going to meet that person again this time\u2015</p><br/><p> Is it fine for me to take a picture of these?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I don't mind.\u300d</p><br/><p> I took pictures of the cloak, pendant, and the letter.</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I want to show them to the other party, may I take a picture of obaa-san as well?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, please forgive me.</p><br/><p> I don't want for that person to see this old appearance of mine.</p><br/><p> Take this instead......\u300d</p><br/><p> As obaa-san said so, she held out a picture.</p><br/><p> It was a picture of obaa-san at the age of around 20 years old.</p><br/><p> I took the picture from obaa-san\u2015</p><br/><p> and decided to meet the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p> However, what kind of face would the Demon Lord make when I show him these.</p><br/><p> I'm really looking forward to it!</p><br/><p>[1] \u3064 Mitsuyubi</p><br/>\n</div>"}

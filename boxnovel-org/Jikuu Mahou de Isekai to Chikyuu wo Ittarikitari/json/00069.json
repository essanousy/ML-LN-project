When I saw the billboard, I think it somewhat resembled the Delaidos\u2019 king.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s a billboard of whiskey.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s whiskey?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a liquor made from wheat.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so?

Those children will surely be glad.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, after eating ramen and a little shopping, let\u2019s go to the other world to hand over the souvenirs.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been decided to go shopping.</p><br/><p>First, I bought a whiskey which won a gold medal at a famous contest. Also, it\u2019s 5,000 yen for only 180 ml, it\u2019s so expensiveee!1</p><br/><p>I also bought fresh milk and Hokkaido eggs2 to be used in the wheat flour dish afterwards. I wonder if this is fine as a souvenir?</p><br/><p>We finally found a delicious ramen shop and sat at the counter, the 3 of us ordered a different ramen each.</p><br/><p>Mine is a chashumen3.</p><br/><p>Aya\u2019s is a hotate ramen4.</p><br/><p>Elena\u2019s is a miso butter corn ramen5.</p><br/><p>\u300cHotate yum-yum.~ I\u2019ll give this one scallop to Elena-chan.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAya-san, thank you.\u300d</p><br/><p>*Grr* this impertinent Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, I\u2019ll give this 2 slices of roasted pork.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, thank you!\u300d</p><br/><p>Sparks flew between Me and Aya when we glared at each other. Elena ate the miso butter corn with scallops and roasted pork ramen with great relish. Come to think of it, Elena is eating normally using chopsticks, she already became good on how to use the chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s go to the\u300eSuga town\u300ffirst.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cYe~s.\u300d</p><br/><p>We teleported to\u300eSuga town\u300ffrom the back alley in Sapporo.</p><br/><p>From there, I went around to each guilds of various towns.</p><br/><p>1.\u300eSuga town\u300f</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eAdventurers\u2019 Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Submission\u3010Slimes\u2019 nucleus\u3011.</p><br/><p>+50 A x 40 = 2,000 A</p><br/><p>Submission of\u3010Wolves fang\u3011(From\u300e Chapter 35 \u2013 Dangerous nigh road\u300freference)</p><br/><p>+100 A</p><br/><p>\u25c6Guild points: +70 (Total of 105)</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eMerchants\u2019 Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Delivery of\u3010Flour\u301125 kg x 1 bag</p><br/><p>+ 2,500 A</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eCraftmen\u2019s Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Purchase of\u3010Mandrake root\u3011x 10</p><br/><p>-100 A x 10 = -1,000 A</p><br/><p>Sale of potions</p><br/><p>\u3010Illness mitigation potion +1\u3011x 2</p><br/><p>+30 A x 2 = 60 A</p><br/><p>\u3010Illness mitigation potion +2\u3011x 1</p><br/><p>+40 A</p><br/><p>\u3010Wound healing potion +1\u3011x 29</p><br/><p>+150 A x 29 = 4,350 A</p><br/><p>\u3010Wound healing potion +2\u3011x 30</p><br/><p>+200 A x 30 = 6,000 A</p><br/><p>\u3010Wound healing potion +3\u3011x 1</p><br/><p>+400 A</p><br/><p>2.\u300eNippo town\u300f</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eAdventurers\u2019 Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Submission of\u3010Huge rats\u2019 front teeth\u3011</p><br/><p>( From\u300e Chapter 35 \u2013 Dangerous night road\u300freference)</p><br/><p>+50 A x 4 = 200 A</p><br/><p>\u25c6Guild points: 105 \u2192 111</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eMerchants\u2019 Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Delivery of\u3010Flour\u301125 kg x 1 bag</p><br/><p>+2,500 A</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eCraftsmen\u2019s Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Purchase of\u3010Mandrake root\u3011x 3</p><br/><p>-100 A x 3 = -300 A</p><br/><p>3.\u300eDelaidos Royal Capital\u300f</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eMerchants\u2019 Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Delivery of\u3010Flour\u301125 kg x 1 bag</p><br/><p>+2,500 A</p><br/><p>\u30fb\u300eCraftmen\u2019s Guild\u300f</p><br/><p>Purchase of\u3010Mandrake root\u3011x 10</p><br/><p>-100 A x 10 = -1,000 A</p><br/><p>When I brought the\u300eSlimes\u2019 nucleus\u300fto the\u3010Suga town\u3011, our guild points went over 100 and our adventurers\u2019 rank rose from\u300eE\u300fto\u300eD\u300f.

It\u2019s nice to meet you again.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san and I shook hands firmly.</p><br/><p>\u300cBy the way, what\u2019s your business for coming today? Weapon?

But, a liquor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, it\u2019s a liquor that became #1 in a liquor competition of my hometown.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat is it!!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san leaned forward suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, how about a straight first.\u300d6</p><br/><p>I took out a glass from the inventory and poured a little bit of whiskey. At the same time, a gentle fragrance of sweet malt spread around.</p><br/><p>\u300cW-, What is this fragrance! This is a fragrance of liquor!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, take a sip.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Umu.\u300d</p><br/><p>When Gamudo-san fearfully brought the glass close to his mouth, a strong fragrance went through his nose. Gamudo-san flinched for a moment, but made up his mind and poured it into his mouth. </p><br/><p>With a *thud*, the instant it entered his mouth, a refreshing rich flavor spread from his mouth throughout his body.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san had been immersed in the lingering aftertaste in silence, suddenly, a tear drop ran down from his eye.</p><br/><p>\u300cOjii-sama! What happened to you!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a lie\u2026\u2026 Such a delicious liquor, it\u2019s impossible to be from this world\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWas it so delicious?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, oh, it\u2019s not in the delicious level anymore\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re happy, it\u2019s worth that I brought it with me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShit, if you brought such a delicious liquor, what am I suppose to do! I\u2019ve got no money to buy this delicious liquor.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe didn\u2019t come here to sell liquor today, we\u2019ve come to buy armor. Besides, I brought this for you as a souvenir.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, armor! Sure thing! I\u2019ll make the best armors for you guys!\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san became excited and measured our size for the armors, since he said that it would take a week to complete the armors, we left Gamudo-san\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Okay, the whiskey they\u2019re referring to is Nikka whiskey. Thank you Tokanya and not_onizoka-gto.\u21a9</p><br/><p>2Not sure but apparently, major egg farms throughout Hokkaido primarily raise two breeds of laying chickens: Julia (white-shelled eggs) and Boris Brown (reddish brown-shelled eggs). \u2013 Hokkaidofoodlibrary\u21a9</p><br/><p>3Fatty slices of roasted or braised pork. Chashu is a very common topping, and standard bowls of ramen usually come with one or two slices of it. Most ramen-ya also serve Chashumen (chashu ramen) which is a ramen dish with additional pieces of chashu. Kakuni (braised pork belly) is served instead of chashu at some restaurants. \u2013 Japan-guide\u21a9</p><br/><p>4Hotate/Scallop ramen.\u21a9</p><br/><p>5Miso butter corn ramen.\u21a9</p><br/><p>6Apparently, drinking alcohol \u2018straight\u2019 means without ice.

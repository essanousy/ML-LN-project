West of the royal capital, there is a big mountain called\u3010Fujiyama Mountain\u3011. There are the 8 towns surrounding it:</p><br/><p>to the east (\u2192) of\u3010Fujiyama Mountain\u3011:\u300eThe Royal Capital\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the northeast (\u2197)\u300eNippon Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the north (\u2191)\u300eSuga Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the northwest (\u2196)\u300eIkebu Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the west (\u2190)\u300eShinju Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the southwest (\u2199)\u300eEbisu Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the south (\u2193)\u300eShinaga Town\u300f,</p><br/><p> to the southeast (\u2198)\u300eTokki Town\u300frespectively.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhich temple are in each town?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTemple huh\u2026</p><br/><p> In\u300eThe Royal Capital (\u2192)\u300fit\u2019s the\u3010Temple of Wind\u3011,</p><br/><p> in\u300eNippon town (\u2197)\u300fit\u2019s the\u3010Temple of Body Reinforcement\u3011,</p><br/><p> in\u300eSuga town(\u2191)\u300fit\u2019s the\u3010Temple of Water\u3011,</p><br/><p> in\u300eShinju town(\u2190)\u300fit\u2019s the\u3010Temple of Earth\u3011,</p><br/><p> in\u300eEbisu town(\u2199)\u300fit\u2019s the\u3010Temple of Recovery\u3011, that\u2019s all. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo~ If I want to go to\u3010Temple of Water\u3011, I\u2019ll need to head north to\u300eNippo Town(\u2197)\u300fthen go around to\u300eSuga town(\u2191)\u300f, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right.

I plan to go that way the day after tomorrow, would you like to come along?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOnii-chan doesn\u2019t have time for long travels so I think it\u2019s impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, it\u2019s a pity.\u300d</p><br/><p>Pikon!</p><br/><p> I cast\u3010Track\u3011on Azide-san and use\u3010Surveillance\u3011after realising.</p><br/><p> All right, with this the problem is solved.</p><br/><p> However, I suddenly notice something.</p><br/><p> It\u2019s not only Azide-san that I used\u3010Surveillance\u3011on.</p><br/><p> The first\u3010Surveillance\u3011is on Elena,</p><br/><p> the second\u3010Surveillance\u3011is on the adventurer,</p><br/><p> 3\u3010Surveillance\u3011are displayed on the map.</p><br/><p> How many\u3010Surveillance\u3011can I use at the same time?</p><br/><p>To test it out, I tried to use\u3010Surveillance\u3011on Aria-san.</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cSurveillance\uff1e\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502The\u3010Surveillance\u3011had exceed the usage limit.</p><br/><p>\u2502 Please select a\u3010Surveillance\u3011to delete.</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbSurveillance 1: Elena\u30fbDelaidos</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbSurveillance 2: (Name unknown)</p><br/><p>\u2502\u30fbSurveillance 3: Azide</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p> A screen is displayed.</p><br/><p> Apparently, I can use\u3010Surveillance\u3011up to 3 targets. On the 4th use, I need to delete a previous one.</p><br/><p> Surveillance 2, I think is the\u3010Surveillance\u3011on the adventurer.</p><br/><p>Those I don\u2019t know their names will be displayed as\u300e\uff08Name unknown\uff09\u300f.</p><br/><p> I wonder what decides the limit of\u3010Surveillance\u3011?</p><br/><p>Won\u2019t the limit of \u3010Surveillance\u3011 increase in the future?</p><br/><p>I delete the adventurer\u2019s\u3010Surveillance\u3011and add Aria-san\u2019s\u3010Surveillance\u3011.</p><br/><p> With this, the curry party is over.</p><br/><p> We said farewell to the children and head back to the inn.</p><br/><p> On our way back, Azide-san handed Aria-san souvenirs from his trip.</p><br/><p>It seems our meeting with Aria-san served a better purpose than just enjoying curry.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

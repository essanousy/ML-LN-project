I don\u2019t understand how it works well.</p><br/><p>I gave up on\u3010Fluorescent lamp\u3011and tried the\u3010Incandescent light bulb\u3011.</p><br/><p>This time, it worked well and illuminated the vicinity brightly.</p><br/><p>It garnered a lot of attention but there\u2019s no helping it.</p><br/><p>Maybe the people who saw this thought it\u2019s a\u3010Magic of light\u3011or whatever.</p><br/><p>I hold out the\u3010Incandescent light bulb\u3011in front of the upper right corner of my face and walk through the town at night.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s not even a single soul and all shops are closed.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no meaning in strolling anymore, however I won\u2019t be able to go home until midnight, well, let\u2019s forget about that and look at the map if there\u2019s anything good.</p><br/><p>Here, I noticed a strange thing.</p><br/><p>Only the places I\u2019ve gone is shown in the map and it appears that there\u2019s an area here that I\u2019ve never went to.</p><br/><p>I followed the map and lead me outside of the town.</p><br/><p>If I go on further and followed it all the way through, it will lead me to the royal capital.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this?</p><br/><p>Pikon!</p><br/><p>So this is the road that\u300eAzide-san\u300ftraversed from the royal capital to this town.</p><br/><p>Which means, if the location is displayed on the map, I can pinpoint the coordinates I can transfer using\u3010Teleportation\u3011?</p><br/><p>While concentrating on the coordinates halfway from this town to the\u300eRoyal capital\u300fin the map, I tried to use\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>It was one of the main road within the forest.</p><br/><p>I was able to teleport.</p><br/><p>This is good, I can use\u3010Teleportation\u3011to any road that\u300eAzide-san\u300ftraversed.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to come over here every time\u300eAzide-san\u300fget into a town like last time.</p><br/><p>\u300eAzide-san\u300fonly need to continue travelling like this and the coordinates will be displayed in the map for later use.</p><br/><p>I did a happy dance within the dark forest.</p><br/><p>To my happy dance, five shadows rushed.</p><br/><p>The five shadows are\u3010wolf\u3011monsters.</p><br/><p>Thanks to my solo merry making, I am now surrounded completely.</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s no people around, I used\u3010Electric shock\u3011to hit the\u3010Wolf\u3011between their eyebrows and killed them without refrain then I stashed them in my inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300cDid I have fun killing them?\u300d</p><br/><p>I reflected and returned to the town I were in earlier.</p><br/><p>This time, I didn\u2019t go inside the town but decided to look around the outskirts of town.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a verdant\u3010Field\u3011that stretched to the distance as far as the eye could see and checked it out for a while.</p><br/><p>I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011on it and it turned out to be\u3010Wheat\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cHou, this is a lot of wheat.\u300d</p><br/><p>The wheat field seems to stretched through out the east side of the city.</p><br/><p>I kept walking and saw a clearing with a\u3010Forest\u3011.</p><br/><p>I walked between the\u3010Forest\u3011and the\u3010Wheat field\u3011.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic reacted and a\u300eCaution\u300ficon appeared on the map.</p><br/><p>I went and looked carefully around the location where the\u300eCaution\u300ficon appeared on the map.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Wheat\u3011sways with a rustling sound of \u2018gasagasa\u2019.</p><br/><p>I cast\u3010Quick\u3011magic just in case and watch the\u300eCaution\u300f.</p><br/><p>A big rat jumped out of the\u3010Wheat field\u3011, it stopped though because it was surprised by the illumination of my\u3010Incandescent light bulb\u3011and scowled at me.</p><br/><p>The starring contest of the\u3010Big rat\u3011and me continued when I heard more rustling sounds and 20\u3010Big rat\u3011came out of the\u3010Wheat field\u3011.</p><br/><p>I freaked out by their huge numbers and took a step back, the 21 big rats attacked simultaneously. </p><br/><p>Although I avoided most of the attacks thanks to\u3010Future prediction\u3011and\u3010Quick\u3011magic, I had to use\u3010Barrier\u3011to block the attacks that almost hit me occasionally.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m getting fed up.</p><br/><p>With the right timing, I used\u3010Teleportation\u3011to move 10 m to the front and cast\u3010Lightning\u3011magic in the midst of the 21\u3010Big rat\u3011who lost the sight of their foe.</p><br/><p>BANG!!</p><br/><p>For an instant, the area became pure white and an explosion likened to a roar resounded.</p><br/><p>When the light faded the 21\u3010Big rat\u3011became charred and fell.</p><br/><p>For now, I stashed the 21 monsters to my inventory.</p><br/><p>\u300eLevel rose to 13.\u300f</p><br/><p>The level up message echoed in my head.</p><br/><p>I defeated 21 monsters but I only leveled up by 1.</p><br/><p>Were they weak monsters, I wonder?</p><br/><p>But still, the roads at night is dangerous.</p><br/><p>I head back to the town by foot.</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s past midnight when I arrived at the town, I returned home using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m home, you\u2019re still up?</p><br/><p>Is Elena already asleep?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome back, Elena-chan stayed up but fell asleep halfway.</p><br/><p>I got a little sleep earlier.</p><br/><p>How was the new town?\u300d</p><br/><p>I told her the things about the\u3010Map\u3011,\u3010Wolf\u3011and\u3010Big rat\u3011.</p><br/><p>Then she said,\u300cNiichan is unfair!\u300dOops! My imouto became depressed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Isn\u2019t slime a weak opponent?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cMore or less, it\u2019s 50 Aurum per request.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf that\u2019s the case, it seems to be strong to some extent.\u300d</p><br/><p>What was your criteria to determine that it seems strong, was it street fighter in some respect?!!</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, are you two OK with slime subjugation?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cKay~\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to the\u300eAdventurers\u2019 guild\u300fand inquired about the place where the slimes are.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse me, we would like to know the place where the slime is.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, are you guys Seiji-san\u2019s party?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Yes, that\u2019s right but\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cActually, we\u2019d like to have you guys participate in the orc subjugation expedition which will commence tomorrow, how about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI refuse.\u300d</p><br/><p>I replied in the speed of light.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, eh? err\u2026\u2026 \u300erefuse\u300f?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I refuse.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou see, if you can participate in the orc subjugation, you\u2019ll also be rewarded accordingly\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>There was a lapse of silence and then the female receptionist began to explain politely.</p><br/><p>\u300cRecently, there have been multiple cases of missing people in this town but it turned out to be the orcs\u2019 work, we suspect that there\u2019s an orc horde from the large number of cases, can\u2019t you participate by all means?\u300d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why but I have to go to work, Aya\u2019s junior college will start by tomorrow and we couldn\u2019t afford to let Elena go alone, I think it\u2019s impossible after all.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry because we have another business tomorrow, impossible things are impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so, it can\u2019t be helped.\u300d</p><br/><p>Despite that however, we were able to learn where the slime is and went to that place.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, wasn\u2019t it fine to agree upon the orcs\u2019 case?\u300d</p><br/><p>Is Elena worrying about the harm it causes to the town?</p><br/><p>\u300cEven if I say such a thing, I have to work and Aya is also a junior college.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShall I stay here by myself?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo!\u300d</p><br/><p>We arrived at our destination while having such talk. But the location was just exactly the opposite edge of the pond where we practiced magic yesterday.</p><br/><p>Because the pond is wide to some degree, I didn\u2019t notice that on the opposite edge was where the slime spawn.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, let\u2019s start the slime subjugation.\u300d</p><br/><p>However, the slime was weak, we subjugated about 40 of it at the place, not even 1 remained.</p><br/><p>I threw the\u3010Slimes\u2019 nucleus\u3011to the inventory, I was disappointed at the lack of resistance.1</p><br/><p>Since slime naturally spawns, it would spawn once again if we stand still for a while\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cAn-chan, the slime was weak.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>But, it was troubling. It\u2019s still before noon and we had already achieved our goal. What should we do now?</p><br/><p>When I\u2019m lost in thought, Elena frequently glanced towards me seemingly has something to say. Well, I know what you want to say, why don\u2019t you just say that you want to go on orc subjugation for the town?</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, let\u2019s go on orc subjugation right now.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Now?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs it truly okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, but, we have to return to Japan when the sun sets, also we won\u2019t get compensation because we didn\u2019t accept the request, are you still fine with that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d\u300cWell, it can\u2019t be helped.~\u300d</p><br/><p>After we had a light lunch with sandwich that was brought from Japan, using\u3010Teleportation\u3011, we moved to the forest where the orcs are.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, is there an orc?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWait a moment, I will look for it now.\u300d</p><br/><p>I was looking at\u3010Map\u3011magic for a\u300eCaution\u300fmark to be displayed. They were affected by the increased in magic power, the range of\u3010Map\u3011and\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic expanded to distant places that I couldn\u2019t detect yesterday, I noticed something that has gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat way, there seems to be something.\u300d</p><br/><p>We went to that direction with brisk steps.</p><br/><p>It was there. An Orc. Moreover, there are more than 100 of them.</p><br/><p>The orcs built simple huts in a tree and it has become like a small village.</p><br/><p>\u300cTheir number is large, what should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, an-chan, is the lightning spirit can\u2019t be used?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can be used but I\u2019m not really inclined to use it.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, you\u2019ll see when you meet it.\u300d</p><br/><p>I used\u3010Summon lightning spirit\u3011reluctantly.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, it\u2019s the first time after yesterday.\u300d</p><br/><p>Without abruptly attacking, it appeared quite normal this time.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis fellow is the lightning spirit.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? This ball of lightning is the lightning spirit?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? What are the both of you saying? I can\u2019t see anything?\u300d</p><br/><p>These two\u2019s look are somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s natural because I\u2019m a lightning spirit, a person without\u3010Lighting magic\u3011can\u2019t see me and when the magic\u2019s level is low, they can only see me as a ball and can\u2019t hear me.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch a thing, say it earlier!\u300d</p><br/><p>I explained the situation to Aya and Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300cI couldn\u2019t talk to it.~ Shame!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019d like to be able to use\u3010Lightning magic\u3011too.\u300d</p><br/><p>Since there\u2019s no helping it, I decided to become an interpreter.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith that, I want to borrow your power to subjugate that orc horde, can you do it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can annihilate that with ease.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, please wait a moment.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe orcs had abducted people from the city. There should be abducted people in that place. If we attack as is, the people might get caught up.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right! That\u2019s a close one.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cShall I check the situation?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe orcs won\u2019t be able to find you?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI would be discovered if there\u2019s an orc who can use\u3010Lightning magic\u3011, it\u2019s alright because that\u2019s impossible.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s it! Indeed.\u300d</p><br/><p>I put a tracking beacon on the lightning spirit and sent it out to make a reconnaissance.</p><br/><p>I projected the tracking video for Aya and Elena to see and verify the situation at the orc village.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a fellow who cooked dishes inside the orc village, a fellow who repaired weapons, it really feels like a village.</p><br/><p>At the place where the lightning spirit surveyed for awhile, we were able to find a cage where the captives are being held. The lightning spirit came back to where we are after it surveyed around the cage.</p><br/><p>\u300cI found the captives.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I was watching.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, what would you do? Are you going to fight the orcs alone?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI have a plan.\u300d</p><br/><p>The plan is this.</p><br/><p>1. The lightning spirit will move to a slightly remote position from the cage.</p><br/><p>2. Me, Aya and Elena will use\u3010Teleportation\u3011to move beside the cage.</p><br/><p>3. I will surround the cage with\u3010Barrier\u3011.</p><br/><p>4. The lightning spirit will attack the orcs.</p><br/><p>5. We will clear up the remaining orcs.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about this plan?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOK.\u300d\u300cI understand.\u300d\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>The lightning spirit moved near the cage and gave the signal, we confirmed it with the\u3010Tracking video\u3011and moved near the cage using\u3010Teleportation\u3011.</p><br/><p>Several orcs noticed us who suddenly appeared and tried to attack, they were pushed back by Aya and Elena\u2019s magic.</p><br/><p>In that interval, I set the barrier up around the cage and sent a signal to the lightning spirit.</p><br/><p>Dogagagagaaaan!</p><br/><p>Shit, I should\u2019ve block off the sound with the barrier.</p><br/><p>The area had been wrapped up in light accompanied by a thunderous explosion and it became pure white.</p><br/><p>When I looked behind, the 10 people\u2013men and women\u2013who were in the cage all fainted at the residual sound of the explosion.</p><br/><p>When I checked if there was any survivor with\u3010Vigilance\u3011magic, they are at death\u2019s door but, there were several orcs who survived.</p><br/><p>We eradicated the surviving orcs along the way.</p><br/><p>\u300eLevel went up to 27.\u300f</p><br/><p>The level rose by 4, well, it\u2019s only natural since we defeated orcs with that number.</p><br/><p>\u300cGood job.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cGood job.~\u300d\u300cThank you for the good work.\u300d</p><br/><p>We thank each other for the success of the plan.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I\u2019m going home.\u300dsaid the lightning spirit and returned home immediately.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, what should we do with these people?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFirst of all, I\u2019ll heal the ones who are injured.\u300d</p><br/><p>When I destroyed the cage with magic, Elena went around and heal all the 10 people. Meanwhile, I put away the orcs which we defeated in the inventory.</p><br/><p>When Elena\u2019s treatment was over, the ten people had regained their consciousness.</p><br/><p>They asked various questions and since it\u2019s troublesome-</p><br/><p>\u300eWe came because we heard an earth-shaking sound and we only treated the 10 people\u2013men and women\u2013because they had collapsed, we haven\u2019t seen any orc.\u300f</p><br/><p>is what we decided to say.</p><br/><p>For the time being, we sent the 10 people near the town and went home to Japan immediately.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Look for Rimuru for some godly resistance.\u21a9</p><br/>\n</div>"}

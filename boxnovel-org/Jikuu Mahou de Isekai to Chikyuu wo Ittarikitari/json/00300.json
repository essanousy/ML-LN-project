But Elena, there are people in the surroundings!</p><br/><p>Hmmm, well, anyhow, I can\u2019t tell her [don\u2019t help him] when there\u2019s a wounded person in front of her\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It appears that when they were trying to go out of the church, they have been attacked by someone.</p><br/><p>Elena and Nancy don\u2019t have injury, but there are some people in the surroundings that have been injured.</p><br/><p>This stops the conquering of the Tower of Sunrise; I have to go to help them.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are you alright?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama\u2026\u2026 Hm? Where are you, Seiji-sama?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI won't be able to explain it to Nancy and her mom if I suddenly appear. Sorry, but I\u2019ll keep hiding my form.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, Seiji-sama. Thank you very much for coming to help!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cElena, who are you speaking with since a little while ago?\u300d</p><br/><p>Crap, it\u2019s Nancy. </p><br/><p>Did she hear us talking?</p><br/><p>\u300cMoreover! Elena! What kind of person are you?!! </p><br/><p>An injury rapidly healed, how did you do it!?\u300d</p><br/><p>She saw perfectly when Elena used magic, huh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll explain it to you later! More than that, let\u2019s get everyone to safety.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Un\u2026\u2026 I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>It was an uproar in the church.</p><br/><p>Although it\u2019s place where these people can be most relieved, they\u2019ve been attacked by someone and there are injured people, too.</p><br/><p>The heck, what kind of fool is attacking?</p><br/><p>When I went outside of the church, there were about 20 guys with rifle in hand and were covered with black cloth from head to toe except for their eyes.</p><br/><p>This place should be Japan.</p><br/><p>What are those out-of-place guys. </p><br/><p>Those guys don\u2019t look like they are fighting for oil at all.</p><br/><p>\u300eIdiot, watch the other party carefully and attack! The target might have escaped!\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eI know! But you ordered to fire, didn\u2019t you?!\u300f</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a language that I've learned before, [Chinese].</p><br/><p>Perhaps, these guys are allies of the mafias we\u2019ve fought before.</p><br/><p>Although I caught so much last time, they came in great numbers again like this\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Moreover, what\u2019s with this situation!?</p><br/><p>They\u2019re probably trying to impersonate terrorists to hide their true identity.</p><br/><p>Involving unrelated people and having Elena and Nancy go through a dangerous experience.</p><br/><p>\u300cI will absolutely not forgive you!\u300d</p><br/><p>I transformed myself into ninja form and removed the [Invisibility] magic in front of those guys.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat\u2019s that guy!?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s a ninja!\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eIt suddenly appeared!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, that fellow! According to the report, it\u2019s the person who annihilated the first unit.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWhat!?\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eWarn everyone! It should be strong!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cToo late.\u300d</p><br/><p>I moved quickly and grabbed the leader-like guy by the collar.</p><br/><p>\u300eUwaa-! It teleported!\u300f</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not [Teleportation] just now, but merely an ordinary movement, you know?</p><br/><p>\u300eHey! What\u2019s you guys\u2019 objective?\u300f</p><br/><p>I spoke to the leader-like guy in Chinese.</p><br/><p>\u300eLike hell I will tell you, no one\u2019s going to tell you!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ratatatat!</p><br/><p>Uwa! </p><br/><p>The guys in the surroundings attacked me, including the leader-like guy, without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The leader-like guy is shot by his ally\u2019s rifle and is in critical condition. </p><br/><p>He\u2019ll probably die if left alone.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe ninja is not here!\u300f</p><br/><p>I sneaked around behind the guy, who spoke, and channeled electric shock on him, making him faint.</p><br/><p>\u300eUwa! What\u2019s this fellow!? Can we fight against such a guy!? I\u2019m going to escape!\u300f</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the guy, who spoke, fainted with an electric shock as soon as he tried to escape.</p><br/><p>\u300eUwa! A monster!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Those guys tried to escape\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the next moment, all of them collapsed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u300cFuu.\u300d</p><br/><p>I take a breath and look around.</p><br/><p>It was a situation where about 20 men, who wore black from head to toe, with rifle were collapsed on the ground unmoving.</p><br/><p>\u300cFor now, the leader-like guy doesn\u2019t seem to be dead.\u300d</p><br/><p>I approached the leader-like guy, who was shot by his ally. He was bleeding and nearly dead, but just stopping the bleeding will do and he won\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>\u300cD-, Don\u2019t move!!\u300d</p><br/><p>When I finished stopping the bleeding, the police came rushing in.</p><br/><p>However, in contrast with those 20 guys with rifle in hand, the police\u2019s weapon is shabby\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>If I didn\u2019t defeat these guys, there would absolutely be a casualty from the police.</p><br/><p>When I raised my hands while standing up slowly, the policeman approached slowly, too.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s bad to be asked about the situation like this. </p><br/><p>Well, let\u2019s leave the rest to the police.</p><br/><p>I disappeared using [Invisibility] magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It disappeared!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Giving the surprised policeman a sidelong glance, I returned to where Elena was.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, how\u2019s the situation?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, all the injured people have been healed.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena speaks with me in a low voice, so that she won\u2019t be noticed by other people.</p><br/><p>\u300cIs the outside already safe?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I finished off all of them.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAs expected of Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>I feel relieved with this.</p><br/><p>However, the eyes of the church people when they look at Elena\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>from a slightly distant place, the church people were [praying] to Elena.</p><br/><p>This place is the church. </p><br/><p>Elena healing a wounded person one after another with a mysterious power.</p><br/><p>This, she\u2019ll be involved in a really troublesome thing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, let\u2019s go home for today.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cEh? Is Nancy-san already okay?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYour magic have been seen, there will probably be a problem if you remain here, Elena. Since I beat all the bad guys, it's already safe.\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cAlright, if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll say goodbye to Nancy and her mom.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena is honest.</p><br/><p>\u300cNancy-san, mama-san, I\u2019m going to go home now. Let\u2019s meet again.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>Nancy is surprised.</p><br/><p>In front of Nancy and the other people, I took Elena\u2019s hand while invisible and\u2013went home using [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cS-, She disappeared.\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>When Elena disappeared, the church people began to [pray] more zealously.</p><br/><p>\u300cE-, Elena has\u2026\u2026 d-, disappeared.\u300d</p><br/><p>Nancy and her mom stood upright with their mouths wide open.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

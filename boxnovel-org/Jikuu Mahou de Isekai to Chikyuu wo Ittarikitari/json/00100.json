It will loosen up Elena like this everyday from now on. Yep, let\u2019s do that.</p><br/><p>That reminds me, I\u2019ve come here to defend Suga town.</p><br/><p>Looking at Elena\u2019s sleeping face, I almost forgot that point.</p><br/><p>When I checked the map, a horde of Goblins, Hobgoblins, Orcs, and High orcs had been gathered.</p><br/><p>Moreover, I was able to confirm that the Goblin prince was one of them.</p><br/><p>Finally, the attack will probably begin.</p><br/><p>Elena finally got up.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, are you going to use the bathroom again this morning?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I will refrain.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena blushed a little and pouted.</p><br/><p>The sulking Elena was cute too\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Somehow or another, Elena\u2019s mood recovered.</p><br/><p>When we contacted Lela, they haven\u2019t found the enemy yet around the Ikebu town. It seemed we can completely focus here.</p><br/><p>We leisurely have breakfast using room service.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m equipped with\u3010Necklace of Lightning +4\u3011and Replica Sword.</p><br/><p>While Elena is equipped with\u3010Hair ornaments of Ice +1\u3011,\u3010Necklace of Recovery +3\u3011,\u3010Magic rod\u3011on her right hand and\u3010Ice rod +1\u3011on her left hand.</p><br/><p>Fully equipped, we started to subjugate the monsters who gathered around the Suga town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Since the enemies were dispersed widely inside the forest, we defeated the ones approaching the town one by one.</p><br/><p>In preparation for a prolonged war, I conserved as much MP as possible.</p><br/><p>I defeated each and everyone of them with physical attacks.</p><br/><p>I cut the enemies using Replica sword while Elena sent them flying.</p><br/><p>In order to not get surrounded, while moving to the right and left, we kept on cutting down the enemies in the forefront.</p><br/><p>We were gradually getting pushed and as a result, they neared the town.</p><br/><p>Finally, the enemy came out of the forest to the grasslands that spread out between the forest and the town. The battlefield had been moved.</p><br/><p>The monsters came out of the forest one after another.</p><br/><p>The townspeople who heard the sound of our battle also noticed the monsters\u2019 invasion and closed the town\u2019s gates.</p><br/><p>A few adventurers and soldiers, who were left behind to maintain public order, were being gathered for the town\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>\u300cAt this rate, the monsters would reach the town. Let\u2019s change our strategy.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. What should we do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSince I\u2019m going to charge in to defeat the Goblin prince, Elena will withdraw to the town and reduce the number of monsters using magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, I understand. Be careful, Seiji-sama.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOu!\u300d</p><br/><p>I started to charge towards the Goblin Prince while prioritizing to kill the hobgoblins and high orcs, and ignoring the small fries.</p><br/><p>Elena, while sending the enemies who drew near flying, invoked\u3010Hail storm\u3011towards the crowd of enemies and somehow halted the advance of the monsters.</p><br/><p>But, it was at the cost of Elena\u2019s MP being depleted.</p><br/><p>When I arrived at the center of the enemy group, the Goblin prince was waiting there.</p><br/><p>When I appraised it\u2015</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Name: Inpainix</p><br/><p>\u2502Occupation: Goblin prince</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Level: 40</p><br/><p>\u2502HP: 13, 105</p><br/><p>\u2502MP: 1, 681</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Power: 305 Endurance: 305</p><br/><p>\u2502Ability: 170 Magic power: 168</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Skills</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Information magic\u3011(Lv 2)</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Body reinforcement magic\u3011(Lv 3)</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Body techniques\u3011(Lv 3)</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Sword techniques\u3011(Lv 3)</p><br/><p>\u2502\u3010Staff techniques\u3011 (Lv 4)</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>It has a name?</p><br/><p>Amazing, unexpectedly, it possessed\u3010Information magic\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re strong in spite of being a human.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Goblin prince spoke to me in fluent Goblin Language.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t all the orcs and goblins babble?</p><br/><p>As one would expect of someone who possessed\u3010Information magic\u3011, was it smart?</p><br/><p>\u300eA very talkative goblin.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHou! You can speak our language in spite of being a human? You\u2019re an interesting guy.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSorry, I can\u2019t let you advance any further.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eA confident human being. By any chance, are you the one who defeated my younger brother?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>Actually, it was Elena.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat fellow is the weakest amongst us princes. It\u2019s of no use to become conceited just because you defeated that fellow.\u300f</p><br/><p>The previous prince, in terms of size and status, was incomparable indeed.</p><br/><p>But, how many goblin princes there are in total? Though I understand if it\u2019s something like big four, or triad.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, a fool who charged alone in the midst of the enemy, I will send you the netherworld immediately.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Prince suddenly raised its hand\u2015</p><br/><p>The hobgoblins and High orcs obeyed and surrounded me.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s the same, I don\u2019t even need to fight. These guys will kill you!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300c\u300cGuoo!\u300d\u300d</p><br/><p>The hobgoblins and high orcs raised a cry all at once, they just rotate around me and didn\u2019t attack at all. </p><br/><p>Are they afraid?</p><br/><p>I became fed up\u2015</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Summon lightning spirit\u3011! \u3010Barrier\u3011x 5!\u300d</p><br/><p>I surrounded all directions simultaneously with barrier insulating Lightning and sound\u2015</p><br/><p>An AOE Lightning strike exploded from the Lightning spirit.</p><br/><p>At the same time as my field of vision became pure white, a frightful earth tremor came from the ground.</p><br/><p>When my field of vision returned to normal, the hobgoblins and high orcs laid on the ground, charred.</p><br/><p>The Goblin prince curled up into a ball.</p><br/><p>The lightning spirit, having read the situation, quickly went back in my body.</p><br/><p>When I checked the map, there was gaping wide hole in the middle part of the monster group, it was shaped like a donut.</p><br/><p>And, in the center of the donut, there\u2019s a dot\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eThat hurts! What did you do, Human? Uwa, my subordinates!?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Goblin prince was alive and well.</p><br/><p>As expected of the prince, to withstood that\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When I used\u3010Appraisal\u3011, one-third of its HP has been decreased.</p><br/><p>\u300eHolding such a secret weapon unexpectedly. It can\u2019t be helped, I will also take out my secret weapon.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the prince said so, he took out something like a magic stone.</p><br/><p>\u300eCome out! Pets!\u300f</p><br/><p>When the prince threw the item\u2015</p><br/><p>From inside the magic-stone-like item, 3\u300eTigers\u300fappeared.</p><br/><p>\u3010Monster ball\u3011!</p><br/><p>The tigers are black-and-white in color and they are also huge, the size of a garbage truck.</p><br/><p>The 3 tigers cried\u300cGaon\u300din a low voice and gathered around the Prince.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow are they? They are cute, aren\u2019t they? My pets.\u300f</p><br/><p>The 3 tigers rubbed themselves against the prince.</p><br/><p>Since the Prince and the tigers both had huge sizes, the normal impression was that they appeared to be just like a reduced scale.</p><br/><p>I tried to use\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2015</p><br/><p>\u250c\u2500\uff1cStatus\uff1e\u2500</p><br/><p>\u2502Race: Great cat tiger</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Level: 35</p><br/><p>\u2502HP: 3, 054</p><br/><p>\u2502</p><br/><p>\u2502Power: 153 Endurance: 153</p><br/><p>\u2502Ability: 153 Magic power: 102</p><br/><p>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500</p><br/><p>It seems their race is\u300eGreat cat tiger\u300f.</p><br/><p>And they\u2019re strong as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou guys, go!\u300f</p><br/><p>With the prince\u2019s signal, the three Great cat tigers lunged simultaneously.</p><br/><p>When I dodged by jumping\u2015</p><br/><p>The smallest of the three, stepped over on the back of the biggest one and jumped, catching up to me.</p><br/><p>Dangerous!</p><br/><p>Although I promptly set a\u3010Barrier\u3011up, the attack of the small Great cat tiger destroyed the barrier. Its claws caught my body and I received its attack, blowing my body away.</p><br/><p>Since the barrier became a buffer material, I received less damage. But I couldn\u2019t free myself from being blown away.</p><br/><p>When I looked towards the place where I will be landing on, the medium Great cat tiger was waiting.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Electric shock\u3011!\u300d</p><br/><p>I cast Electric shock towards the waiting Great cat tiger.</p><br/><p>Since that fellow was paralyzed from moving, I step over its face and managed to land.</p><br/><p>When I sensed\u300eDanger\u300ffrom behind and looked back, the small guy was approaching from behind.</p><br/><p>But, it was surprised that I managed to land, the tempo of its attack was delayed.</p><br/><p>I jumped towards the approaching small guy and attacked with replica sword in reverse grip.</p><br/><p>The small guy received the replica sword by its claws but didn\u2019t managed to stop the momentum of my attack. And it was blown away to the back.</p><br/><p>When it seemed it was about to crash into the ground, at the last moment, the big guy caught it and rebuild their order which I thought had become disarray.</p><br/><p>What a coordinated attack.</p><br/><p>Quite formidable.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

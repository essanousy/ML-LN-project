I was asked to shake hands. I was worried and lost.</p><p class=\"dUEYOsCKRHPWEAQtdHPa\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"vxFVnYZUOZPfYpTbmvQz\">Nancy\u2019s mum and Lily-san entered the country quickly and had to wait for a little because of me.

Several adults who are supposed to be teachers are injured, and some children are also injured.</p><p class=\"YSOMFwsPhsMSZzfhUfPU\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"fLgERozXduUZkThxKiiP\">Especially, there is a man with a severe injury, and he doesn't move as if he is dead.</p><p class=\"XIwRPTBXcrHUeGiurlcU\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"fzfMIzdUCYqtieDyyFRB\">That man is in danger.</p><p class=\"eCnjfLILDjELvhcinduZ\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"aqvhtEvwYvBKGOALHxEJ\">\u300cJennifer-san, it's dangerous.

Is this person an escort after all?</p><p class=\"HbNspNaqNexQLKPENiPX\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"XQjIGOvODtRABQWxevPW\">I approach the person who is seriously injured while also be wary of the vicinity.</p><p class=\"UZvKWSPrHMxwCcECTebK\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ptusYWlcXWfxppcVviFa\">\u300eAre you okay?\u300f</p><p class=\"sfbIhXdqCdzMHfkMaOIS\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"wnqBxdBlLtuExtcLcqmv\">There is no reply, very dangerous.

The scratches in the range that can be seen from the outside have the bleeding suppressed a little and priority is given to internal organs damage.</p><p class=\"HKUkXORiPEHfZinLjSLv\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"ovDxJpGCbcwnLIghXFxN\">However, this scar is caused by a gun. Moreover, several hits. Why do bandits do this?</p><p class=\"dqzMwGJcdwzyKIbwrEPq\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"OFdwHAOlpeWMPtmFQxbp\">At that moment, Nima-chan brought the vigilante people, and so the treatment of the injured people began.</p><p class=\"AHzTUfKrhZNIeIxvGhbL\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"yWBgtXMAYxKuTaGIVyaM\">I leave the treatment to them and return to the village chief and Nancy\u00b4s mom.</p><p class=\"XqUXXCTvCFvvPxasFcFb\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"yeCWfVBhADIQXiXeGHxa\">\u300cAre those who are injured safe?\u300d</p><p class=\"NOTVLXCsvDKkoHpHKBdx\"></p><p class=\"dDvKSdvugTVfiaVvCeNc\">Nancy\u00b4s mom is anxious.</p><p class=\"jnUjiqLmdOwVeEOvJkeg\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"cdlGRGpcLwQCDCREqZSn\">\u300cI think they are fine\u300d</p><p class=\"IEukwYBvROphlWebJvxD\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"IBFFFHobeSUauxZMrtWo\">\u300cWell, I hope so.......\u300d</p><p class=\"gjTEiFWBCkeramkMWISa\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"iAVvKIrsBrShXPhOQPRb\">First of all, I need to gather information.</p><p class=\"jJlYRaPGRQDSlAIjfjkT\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"mhvMPESZPLGjSEjYEgvf\">\u300eVillage chief, what's this all about?

Now I am worried about the people in the village.</p><p class=\"CbeRTlnoQyzcwfnOGxrE\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"YyyeLmLjEpqGjcGlARhP\">I changed to my usual ninja outfit and used [Teleportation] to the school.</p><p class=\"kvenbqNTxDZdKAYbGxSh\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"nYlNXmtufBrNHnqzuylr\">----------</p><p class=\"JgVXwvsVGJwOtffymuPo\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MAGSGefbUtmpIydVXEzP\">The injured have already been carried and collected in the nearby temple.

According to the story that I was eavesdropping, it seems that the children were attacked and he protected them with his own body which made him get injured. He seems to be a respectable person.</p><p class=\"TxpMoGrBugPUQqVlnjLm\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"FzlVvwjEhvMmhWulEqCh\">The children who were sleeping after being injured are cured with [Recovery magic] by me.

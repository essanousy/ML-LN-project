Other than Seiji-sama and Aya-san, only 1 person managed to acquire\u3010Lightning magic\u3011so far. To think that I acquired\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBecause Elena-chan has been living surrounded by electrical appliances in Japan.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBesides, have you been studying about electricity?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>With this, other than darkness, she was able to acquire all the magic from the places we visited. Our objective was completed!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> We went to Gamudo-san\u2019s shop to buy equipment that amplified magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, Gamudo-san.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYo! Seiji, good thing you\u2019ve come. The liquor?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs liquor your favorite word?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDid you bring it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI brought it but not much.\u300d</p><br/><p>I put the\u300eBrandy\u300fI bought at a liquor store in the shopping district on the table.</p><br/><p>\u300cN? It\u2019s not whisky?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou understand well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTheir fragrance is different.\u300d</p><br/><p>As expected of a drinker.</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a different liquor since it\u2019s raw material isn\u2019t wheat but it\u2019s also delicious.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, thanks. So, what do you need for today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cFinally, we can get down to business. Please arrange a short account of all the equipment that amplified magic i.e\u3010Water rod\u3011and\u3010Hair ornament of recovery\u3011from before.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Short account? What\u2019s the matter? Doesn\u2019t Elena-jouchan have water and recovery? By any chance, did your companions increased?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s not it, she acquired new magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNewly acquired? Is it Earth? Or Wind?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s Wind, but since she can surely acquire Earth too, I\u2019d like to buy it in advance.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-jouchan is an amazing magician. Please wait a moment for the hair ornament and rod.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gamudo-san brought some hair ornaments and rods from the back.</p><br/><p>\u300cHere,\u3010Wind rod\u3011and\u3010Earth rod\u3011,\u3010Hair ornament of Wind\u3011,\u3010Hair ornament of Water\u3011and\u3010Hair ornament of Earth\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh? There\u2019s no Fire?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe rare ones aren\u2019t placed here. If you really want, try to go to the weapon shop in Suga town.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you. We\u2019ll go later.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, these are the hair ornaments and rods, what would you do?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019ll buy them all, how much?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s 1, 000A apiece, totaled 5, 000A. Since I\u2019m indebted to Seiji, 3, 000A would do.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThank you very much.\u300d</p><br/><p>I paid 3, 000A and obtained the hair ornaments and rods.</p><br/><p>I left Gamudo-san\u2019s shop and went to the weapon shop in Suga town.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u300cHello.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome, did you come to destroy the courtyard again?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease forgive me. It\u2019s shopping.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, is that right? You\u2019ve come to buy what?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAre there\u3010Fire rod\u3011and\u3010Hair ornament of Fire\u3011here?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf you\u2019re looking for really rare ones, I have them.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, are there lightning, ice, darkness and light too?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThere should probably be\u3010Darkness rod\u3011and\u3010Ice rod\u3011. But no matter how badly you want the rest, I don\u2019t have them. \u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou can\u2019t make them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThough I can make them if there are materials, I don\u2019t have the material,\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere can we get it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIn the magic stone shop in Ikebu town. It seems the owner have been abducted by the goblins all the while and have been rescued recently.\u300d</p><br/><p>That person, huh.</p><br/><p>For the time being, we bought the\u3010Hair ornament of Fire\u3011,\u3010Fire rod\u3011,\u3010Ice rod\u3011and\u3010Darkness rod\u3011for a total of 12, 000A but\u2015</p><br/><p>Upon leaving the shop, I noticed something strange.</p><br/><p>An\u300eOrc\u300fis being displayed on the map.</p><br/><p>\u300cThere\u2019s an orc.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? Where?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s far away towards the forest.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Such a distant enemy in the forest can be seen?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI didn\u2019t realize it until now\u2026\u2026 but the monster type can now be seen too. I wonder why?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, isn\u2019t it because you acquired\u3010Wind magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right! I acquired\u3010Wind magic\u3011and was able to detect the scent.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN! Smell!?\u300d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Aya glared at me while holding the area around her thigh. Are you trying to\u300eOpen farting1\u300f?</p><br/><p>\u300cIt can only detect the scent of demon, I don\u2019t know if it can detect as far as the smell of\u300eOpen farting\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cStupid oniichan! Die!\u300d</p><br/><p>Putting Aya\u2019s\u300eOpen farting\u300faside, the orcs\u2019 numbers are troublesome, although they\u2019re in the forest, there are 20 orcs.</p><br/><p>When I was thinking on what to do\u2015</p><br/><p>Of the 20 orcs, 1 began to move towards the town.</p><br/><p>\u300c1 of the orcs is headed this way!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, only 1 of them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa, it is so. What on earth is it up to?\u300d</p><br/><p>We went over to village\u2019s entrance near the forest to see the situation.</p><br/><p>After a while, a carriage went inside the town.</p><br/><p>\u300cLook. The orc is riding on that.\u300d</p><br/><p>We followed the carriage.</p><br/><p>The carriage advanced for awhile through the town and went inside a slave merchant\u2019s shop warehouse.</p><br/><p>\u300cI see, is that the hideout of the guy who has been helping the orcs?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHelping the orcs? A human has been helping them?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, it seems so.\u300d</p><br/><p>We boldly went inside the slave merchant\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry. The slaves are out of stock right now\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOut of stock? That\u2019s odd, didn\u2019t you bring one inside on board a carriage a while ago?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo, errr\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, that\u2019s right. What you brought in wasn\u2019t a slave but a monster.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN!? No, it\u2019s not it!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen, what is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s, um\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf your mouth can\u2019t say it, should I say it instead?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYou bandits, allying yourselves with the orcs. Disguising an orc as a slave using\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011and helping it abduct people. Am I wrong?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>The\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2019s result was\u300eOccupation: Bandit\u300f.</p><br/><p>The bandit\u2013former slave merchant\u2013glared at me.</p><br/><p>\u300cNow, what would you do? By the way, the three of us, even if we fight against you one on one, are strong enough to win with a room to spare.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDie!\u300d</p><br/><p>Though the bandit said that, he who suddenly attacked fell into a swoon with a single punch from Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cThe orc?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s in the room at the back.\u300d</p><br/><p>When we moved to the room at the back, a man who smells like a rotten fish scowled at us.</p><br/><p>\u300cYou, what?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWe\u2019ve come to subjugate an orc.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c!?\u300d</p><br/><p>The man who smells like a rotten fish suddenly attacked but was stunned by my\u3010Lightning fist\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, we\u2019re not going to kill that guy?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, I intend to use \u2018it\u2019 for a little\u300eEntertainment\u300f.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cEntertainment, is it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAa. Aya, carry the bandit from a little while ago. We\u2019ll bring it to the adventurers\u2019 guild.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cUn.\u300d</p><br/><p>I, with the man who smells like a rotten fish while Aya with the bandit, lifted them both by the head, and carried them to the adventurers\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cExcuse meee!\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes\u2026\u2026 !? What are these unconscious men!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya and I put down the bandit and the man who smells like a rotten fish on the floor of the adventurers\u2019 guild.</p><br/><p>\u300cThat man over there is a bandit while this man who smells like a rotten fish is a human disguised orc.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWa? What sort of joke is that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m not joking.\u300d</p><br/><p>The adventurers and the guild\u2019s staffs gathered around.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, please look at this man who smells like a rotten fish. I\u2019ll show you the real identity of this fellow!\u300d</p><br/><p>As I declared so in a loud voice, I searched for the\u3010Magic stone of human transformation\u3011on the man who smells like a rotten fish in order for everyone to see.</p><br/><p>And then, the man who smells like a rotten fish transformed from human into an orc.</p><br/><p>\u300cI-, It\u2019s really\u2026 an orc!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe orcs are disguising themselves as humans using\u3010Magic stone of Human transformation\u3011. They are joining hands with the bandits and sneak into the towns by pretending to be slaves. That guy over there is a bandit who was pretending to be a slave merchant.\u300d</p><br/><p>The adventurers\u2019 guild was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh, this guy! He\u2019s a bandit henchman on the wanted list.\u300d</p><br/><p>The guild staffs seemed to know the man of the bandits.</p><br/><p>After that, there was a discussion at the guild and a unit was formed to subjugate the bandits. We said that we have other things to do and declined it.</p><br/><p>I think with this huge clamor, it would prevent the orcs from sneaking in.</p><br/><p>We left the Suga town and went to Ikebu town.</p><br/><p>Translator notes and reference:</p><br/><p>1Open farting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

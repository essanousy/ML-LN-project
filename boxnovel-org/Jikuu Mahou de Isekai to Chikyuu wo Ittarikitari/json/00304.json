My plan shouldn\u2019t have become such a thing!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Gold\u2019s eyes became bloodshot and he squeezed her neck tight with all his might. Because of the excessive power that he was using, [Ai-san]\u2019s feet rose up.</p><br/><p>Crap!!! </p><br/><p>I quickly transformed myself into a ninja and rushed there using [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>I give Gold a dropkick.</p><br/><p>Gold and Ai-san lost their balance and fell down, and I was able to somehow take them out from strangling-situation.</p><br/><p>\u300eCough, cough!!\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eShit, what the heck are you doing!?\u300f</p><br/><p>Phew, it seemed I was able to save Ai-san somehow. </p><br/><p>Now, what to do\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Since the two of them are speaking in Chinese, let\u2019s try talking to them in Chinese.</p><br/><p>\u300eHey.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eEh?

I\u2019m not going to be eliminated by the likes of you!\u300f</p><br/><p>Gold took out a handgun\u2013</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>and suddenly pulled the trigger!!</p><br/><p>\u300eHey, hey! Do you plan to repeat your crimes over and over again?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI-, Impossible\u2026\u2026 to the dodge the bullet of the handgun\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I slowly approach Gold.</p><br/><p>\u300eD-, Don\u2019t come!

You\u2019re an ally of justice, right!? What do you think of a person\u2019s life?!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re one to talk! If I let a bad person get away by saving a hostage\u2019s life, the victims will just increase even more, don\u2019t you agree? A guy, who doesn\u2019t understand such a thing, can\u2019t be called an ally of justice.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eT-, This cannot be\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>Actually, I know that Gold doesn\u2019t have any intention to kill her, you see~. </p><br/><p>That\u2019s why such a bluff works.</p><br/><p>Actually, when he takes Ai-san as a hostage, the [Vigilance] magic isn't notifying me of the danger.</p><br/><p>What's happening turns out to be the two people\u2019s bogus. </p><br/><p>When I ignored it and rapidly advanced\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>Gold pushed Ai-san away and escaped as fast as his legs could carry him.</p><br/><p>\u300eGue!!\u300f</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t let such a slow-footed guy free. </p><br/><p>After Gold suffered from my electric shock, he fell over flashily as he let out a strange cry and stopped moving.</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019re wasting my time.\u300f</p><br/><p>I took down Gold and turned around to face Ai-san\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u300eHiii!\u300f</p><br/><p>Ai-san seemed to have been paralyzed and couldn\u2019t move from the spot.</p><br/><p>Hm? Did some tea or something spilled? </p><br/><p>Well, whatever.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, woman. I\u2019ll let you choose what will happen to this man from this moment on.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eM-, Me\u2026\u2026 c-, choose?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right, 1. I will kill this man. 2. You\u2019ll report and turn him over to the police. Now then, choose.\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eS-, Such a thing\u2026\u2026 I can't do something like betraying Gold-sama\u2026\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI see, you chose number one, huh\u2026\u2026\u300f </p><br/><p>\u300eT-, That\u2019s not it!! Somehow, please let us off!! Since if you do, I\u2019ll give my life to you!!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI don\u2019t need something like your life! This man is the mastermind of the recent synchronized, multiple terrorist attacks; it\u2019s impossible for me to let him off!\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u2026I understand\u2026\u2026 I-, I will, report\u2026him.\u300f</p><br/><p>Ai-san finally made up her mind up to call the police.</p><br/><p>\u300cHello, is this the police? Uh, that, G-, Gold-sama\u2026\u2026 is the mastermind of the recent terrorism incident and then, he tried to kill me\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When Ai-san finished the call, she broke down crying with waah-waah.</p><br/><p>\u2042</p><br/><p>Since the police arrived in a few minutes, I disappeared using [Night Shade] and watched how things play out.</p><br/><p>\u300cAre you the one who made the report?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cYes\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhere\u2019s the one called Gold?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cHe's collapsed over there.\u300d</p><br/><p>About several police officers went to where Ai-san pointed at and found Gold, who's collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u300cHey, bring the stretcher!\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cOkay.\u300d</p><br/><p>Gold was put on the stretcher and was carried away.</p><br/><p>\u300cDo you have a moment? It seems you have been strangled, but what happened to that man?\u300d </p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2026\u2026 a ninja\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>While Ai-san is being cautious towards me, who is invisible, she explains the situation to the police.</p><br/><p>\u300cShit! The ninja again!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Huh? Am I being considered an enemy by the police? </p><br/><p>Did I act too flashy? </p><br/><p>But it can\u2019t be helped, right? </p><br/><p>After awhile, a female police officer brought over a blanket and approached Ai-san, but\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ai-san held out both her hands out in front in an [arrest-me1]-pose. </p><br/><p>\u300cHm? Did something happen with your hands?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cT-, That\u2019s not it, I\u2019m Gold-sama\u2019s accomplice and cooperated with Gold-sama in various ways\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>When she spoke up to there, Ai-san burst into tears again.</p><br/><p>\u300cI understand, I\u2019ll listen to your story at the police station.\u300d</p><br/><p>As such, the female police officer gently wrapped the blanket around Ai-san and led her towards the police car.</p><br/><p>Ahh, it\u2019s finished, finished! </p><br/><p>I\u2019m already at my limit!</p><br/><p>My mind and body are really exhausted\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>Let\u2019s quickly go back home and have Elena massaged my shoulders or something. </p><br/><p>I left the rest to the police and went home quickly.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s actually \u201ctie me with a policeman\u2019s rope\u201d or something.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

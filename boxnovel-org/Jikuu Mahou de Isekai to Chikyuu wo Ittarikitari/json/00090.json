Welcome.\u300d</p><br/><p>The shop manager of the magic stone shop is the one we had saved some time ago, it seems his name is\u300eKiseri\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cKiseri-san, how are you after that?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThanks to you, I can work energetically. Is there something you need today?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI came here because I heard that\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011is being sold here.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011, huh. I can prepare it immediately if it\u2019s Wind, Water and Earth.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat I need are Lightning, Ice, Darkness and Light but\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIf it\u2019s Ice and Darkness, I can prepare them if you can wait for about a month more. The same with Lightning and Light\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cDoes it really take a month?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWhen making Ice and Darkness\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011, you need to request a magician who can use those magic directly. Since there\u2019s also time between contacting and going here, it really takes time.\u300d</p><br/><p>I was hesitating whether to tell him or not that I could use those magic\u2015</p><br/><p>I decided to make a proposal.</p><br/><p>\u300cIf I bring a magician who can use those magic here, will you teach him how to make it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOf course, I\u2019ll also promise not to sell the crafted\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cU-, Um\u2026 you\u2019re my benefactor so I don\u2019t particularly mind. But, a magician who can use such rare attribute magic is always busy, to comply easily\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease keep what I\u2019m going to say after this a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI can use Darkness and Ice magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cN? Eee!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c*Hush!*\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, I-, I\u2019m sorry. Is it true!?\u300d</p><br/><p>I displayed\u3010Shadow control\u3011and\u3010Generate ice\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cA-, Amazing! A person who can use both Darkness and Ice!\u300d</p><br/><p>If I say I can also use Lightning, he might collapse.</p><br/><p>\u300cWith that, can you teach me how to make it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes! Of course.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san brought a\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011again from the back and placed it on top of the table.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes. By channeling 2 magic simultaneously to this, the\u3010Attribute reinforcement magic stone\u3011will be completed.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cTwo magic?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe first one is the attribute magic of the attribute you\u2019d like to create, while the other one is the magic,\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011of\u3010Body reinforcement magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300c\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011? So there\u2019s such a magic.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cRight, because I can do\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011, I need Seiji-san\u2019s attribute magic. Let\u2019s start with\u3010Ice magic\u3011, would that be alright?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, I understand.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san and I placed a hand on\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011and held it between our hands.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, let\u2019s do it. 3, 2, 1, go!\u300d</p><br/><p>Along with the cue, I channeled the\u3010Ice magic\u3011to the\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011shone for a while.</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay, it\u2019s fine now.\u300d</p><br/><p>The light settled down when I released my hold and the\u3010Magic stone of Nullpo\u3011turned into a light-blue magic stone.</p><br/><p>The\u3010Appraisal\u3011showed that it had become\u3010Ice reinforcement magic stone\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, this is how it was created.~\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, Yes\u2026 t-, that\u2019s\u2026 right.\u300d</p><br/><p>Looking suddenly to Kiseri-san, his complexion had become worse.</p><br/><p>\u300cKiseri-san, what happened!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThis\u2026 operation\u2026 used up\u2026 considerable\u2026 magic power\u2026 but\u2026\u2026 *haaa haaa*\u2026\u2026 Seiji\u2026 -san\u2019s\u2026 magic power\u2026 is enormous.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so!?\u300d</p><br/><p>When I confirmed it myself, the MP had been decreased by about 100.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a big deal for me. But for other people, 100 MP was a fair amount.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow did you learn how to use\u3010Magic power reinforcement\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI think\u2026 you can learn how to use it\u2026 with a little practice of\u3010Body reinforcement magic\u3011.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? Then, I\u2019ll try to practice it.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cHuh!? Is it possible that you can also use\u3010Body reinforcement magic\u3011?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh\u2026\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s right.\u300d</p><br/><p>Oops, I unintentionally made a slip of the tongue.</p><br/><p>\u300cNothing, it really makes one jealous\u2026\u2026\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cPlease, keep it a secret.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes!\u300d</p><br/><p>Oh, he seems to be a serious person, it would be fine.</p><br/><p>\u300cSo, this\u3010Ice reinforcement magic stone\u3011\u2026\u2026 will you let me buy it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo need to buy it, because Kisari-san taught me how to create it, it\u2019s yours.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cSuch\u2026 usually, the work of channeling\u3010Ice magic\u3011receives a fair amount of money, so it won\u2019t do.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThen in exchange, can I have some interesting magic stone?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI see. Suited for Seiji-san, right?\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san brought a magic stone with strange shape from the back.</p><br/><p>\u300cHow about this?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIt\u2019s a strange magic stone.\u300d</p><br/><p>The magic stone\u2019s shape is like a\u300eBottle gourd\u300f.</p><br/><p>\u300cThis is called\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011, it was recently unearthed and a rare magic stone to some extent.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAbout this\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011, can this be separated into two and combined into one?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san showed me how to detached the two attaching\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u300cIn this way, it can be separated into two and they will stick together like a little while ago when you brought them close to each other.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cJust stick together?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNo no! Well, please wait here with it one of the pair.\u300d</p><br/><p>Kiseri-san said so and gave me one of the magic stones, and moved to a slightly remote position.</p><br/><p>\u300cWell then, I will now make the\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011vibrate.\u300d</p><br/><p>*Tap tap*</p><br/><p>As Kiseri-san tapped the\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011he held\u2015</p><br/><p>The\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011counterpart I held was similarly vibrating.</p><br/><p>\u300cOh!? It\u2019s vibrating.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s right, this\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011transmits a vibration to its counterpart. No matter how far, the counterpart magic stone will also vibrate in the same way.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI seen, it\u2019s an interesting magic stone.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, because it only does that, it\u2019s not that useful. Recently, it became popular by making two pendants with this magic stone and lovers wear it to ascertain their love with each other.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI don\u2019t know if it could be of help to you but how about it?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cOkay!! This is good!! I want more of this, do you have more?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s only this one set currently. The people who dig out magic stones have been borrowed for war. I think it would be difficult until the war is over.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cIs that so? When the war is over, can you procure this for me?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes, I understand! I\u2019ll procure it.\u300d</p><br/><p>I shook hands with Kiseri-san and left the shop.</p><br/><p>\u300cOniichan, why do you want to obtain too many\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011? To make a harem and have them wear\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011pendants each?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWell, look.\u300d</p><br/><p>I took out paper cups and Sellotape from the inventory. I attached each part of\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011at the bottom of the paper cup one at a time.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, hold this.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cY-, yes.\u300d</p><br/><p>I distance myself a little and talk in the paper cup.</p><br/><p>\u300eHello, Elena. Do you hear me?\u300f</p><br/><p>At the other side, Elena was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u300eSeiji-sama, I can hear you! How did this happen?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eBecause sounds produce vibrations in the air. It\u2019s possible to transmit vibrations at a distance using\u3010Twin magic stone\u3011.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eI-, It\u2019s amazing!!\u300f</p><br/><p>Now then, what should I use this unexpected product for?~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

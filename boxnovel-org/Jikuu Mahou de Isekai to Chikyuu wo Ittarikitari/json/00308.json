Then, just in case, put on that mask as well.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright.\u300d</p><br/><p>Elena, after putting the masquerade-like mask on, slowly channeled her magic power.</p><br/><p>Invoking the [Divine Protection Of The Recovery Spirit], a gentle pink-colored light spreads out with Elena as the center, enveloping the whole town.</p><br/><p>\u300cWhat\u2019s this light!?\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cThe light is spreading out from over there.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it!\u201d, the surrounding people, who noticed it, started making an uproar.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this bad?</p><br/><p>Elena is unable to move while she\u2019s still using the magic.</p><br/><p>\u300cEveryone! This way!\u300d</p><br/><p>A citizen found Elena and shouted.</p><br/><p>When they heard that voice, all the citizens gather.</p><br/><p>Elena was finally surrounded.</p><br/><p>Crap.</p><br/><p>I was going to pretend to be going to the restroom and go to help, but\u2026\u2026 the situation is somehow strange.</p><br/><p>The people, who were crowding around her, knelt on the spot and started praying.</p><br/><p>When Elena smiled sweetly at those people, the [Divine Protection Of The Recovery Spirit]\u2019s light spread out even more, becoming one-level stronger.</p><br/><p>A short time later, the staggering number of the people praying completely filled the space around Elena.</p><br/><p>This, what is she going to do?</p><br/><p>However, Elena wasn\u2019t embarrassed, she approached the people praying and stopped in front of a woman, who had an injured face.</p><br/><p>When Elena brought the [Rod of Aesculapius] near that woman, the Recovery Magic\u2019s light envelops the woman and the injury on that woman\u2019s face healed completely.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people started praying even more fervently and it became out of control.</p><br/><p>Even so, Elena didn\u2019t stop and an injured person, whom she noticed, was being healed one after the other.</p><br/><p>As for Aya, when I tried to see what she\u2019s doing\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>She changed into an appearance of a pink ninja for some reason and was going around applying [Recovery Magic] on the people with non-serious diseases.</p><br/><p>Why pink, and why ninja?</p><br/><p>Somehow or other, as the level of Aya\u2019s Recovery Magic rises, the likes of non-serious injuries, too, are being healed on the way.</p><br/><p>Almost all the injuries and diseases are healed, and since the gathered people continue to pray around the two, it\u2019s impossible for them to sneak out of the place.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019d like to get out quietly, but\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s troublesome.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAt such a time, are you going to summon that!?\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya hold the pendant she wore around her neck high up and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u300c\u2019Nii-chaan\u30fbComee!\u300d1</p><br/><p>What kind of parody is this?</p><br/><p>Well, I understood that she wants me to come.</p><br/><p>I pretended to be going to the restroom and put on [Invisibility], I then rushed towards the two people with [Teleportation].</p><br/><p>\u300cDon\u2019t call me in the midst of work.\u300d</p><br/><p>I spoke to the two people in a low voice while still invisible.</p><br/><p>\u300cSeiji-sama, I\u2019m sorry to trouble you at such a busy time.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cNow then, onii-chan, take us to a safe place!\u300d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t [take us!] me!</p><br/><p>Good grief.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>I sent the two people home.</p><br/><p>\u300cHm?

Do it again tomorrow.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAlright.\u300d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s distressful, I can\u2019t even work quietly.</p><br/><p>I immediately went back to the company.</p><br/><p>\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca\u2666\u25ca</p><br/><p>Since that day, Aya and Elena went to Nepal everyday and kept casting Recovery Magic at various places.</p><br/><p>And then, Friday night.</p><br/><p>The [Divine Protection Of The Recovery Spirit] was spread out across five places and covered a considerably large area.</p><br/><p>At the actual place, it seems to have become a talk about a goddess and a ninja are wandering around healing injured people at various places.</p><br/><p>They\u2019ll go home after they finished today\u2019s on-site activity; Hilda was the first one to return home and looked after the house.</p><br/><p>\u300cI\u2019m home, Hilda.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cWelcome back.\u300d</p><br/><p>I finished having dinner with the four people after a long time, I was refreshed when I drank tea and had a talk with Elena and Aya.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena, Aya, let\u2019s stop the activity in Nepal for now. If it continues as it is, unrelated people, who might get the wind of it, will come.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d\u300cWell, it can\u2019t be helped, huh~.\u300d</p><br/><p>The two people, too, seem to understand somehow and obediently listened.</p><br/><p>Well, a considerable number of injured and sick people had been healed, it\u2019s a fairly good outcome.</p><br/><p>\u300cElena-chan, where should we go next?\u300d</p><br/><p>Where should we go next!!?</p><br/><p>\u300cLeaving that aside, we\u2019re going to go to the 60th floor of The Tower of Sunrise on Saturday.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cAh, that\u2019s right!\u300d</p><br/><p>Aya, did you forget?</p><br/><p>\u300cHilda, too, come here on Saturday.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cYes.\u300d</p><br/><p>\u300cBoss fight, huh~.

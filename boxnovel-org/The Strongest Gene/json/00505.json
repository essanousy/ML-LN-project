Everyone was clear on how difficult this Beyond X project was. None of them had expected that in a short one month, someone would have already succeeded. Moreover, it was such a high degree of completion. A duration of three seconds? This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up uniformly and gazed at the arena.</p><br/><p>\"What do you think?\" Chen Feng asked the person in charge of BC beside him.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" He paused. \"I'm not sure.\"</p><br/><p>Initially, he had not believed that someone else had completed this research as well. However, when the result was demonstrated in front of him, he had no choice but to believe it. There were indeed other teams that had completed the research as well.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the person in charge thought of a possibility. \"This might be a result of focused research.\" If they had only focused on a single B-class genetic warrior in their tests to push that person to the state of beyond, such a research speed would be possible. However, the flaw of such a research was the fact that the result was something that would not work on everyone. Perhaps this was the reason they had completed their research so fast?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"Focused research?\" </p><br/><p>Presently, the crowd was cheering the demonstration before them.</p><br/><p>Everyone started talking emotionally.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is too excellent.\"</p><br/><p>\"What historic moment!\"</p><br/><p>\"Dear seniors, please listen to me.\" In a somewhat guilty manner, Man Junxi stated, \"Although the demonstration was very successful, there are still some flaws in our research. For example, the solution does not work on everyone.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone blanked momentarily before recovering themselves and nodding slightly. \"That is understandable.\" This was the only rational reason for Man Junxi's team to have reached this far in their research in such a short period of time. Not working for everyone, eh? It did not matter, though. As long as there was a first, there would be more results moving on. At the very least, them reaching a duration of three seconds in their very first research was already a demonstration that this Beyond X project was indeed something that stood a chance at succeeding.</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" The head of the research department was very satisfied. \"As such, we can halt all other research and focus on this direction alone\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The assistant stopped him. \"Hold on. Head, there are two more results that have yet to be presented.\"</p><br/><p>Only now did the head recall this. \"Oh, oh.\" He had indeed been too excited after seeing this first result. Based on their protocol, he should indeed take a look at all submissions. But then, he truly did not put much hope in the subsequent two results.</p><br/><p>\"Please wait a moment,\" the head told Man Junxi gently. \"Let's take a look at the subsequent presentations together.\"</p><br/><p>Man Junxi was somewhat disappointed. \"All right.\" Ultimately, the others had still managed to submit their results. Next, everyone started waiting for the second presentation. Nobody noticed the cold gleam that flashed through Chen Feng's eyes. What the head had said earlier had indeed alarmed him. To stop all other research and focus on this one? That meant\u2026 Suddenly, he turned around and looked at the person in charge of the BC team beside him.</p><br/><p>The person in charge of the BC team smiled bitterly. \"This is also the reason my team decided to work with you. The Genetic Union started with so many research teams purely to encourage competition and to provoke growth. Since we are still in the initial stages, naturally, the more research teams, the better. But the moment the research enters the developmental stage, for long-term benefits, all research teams must be combined.\"</p><br/><p>\"In other words\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Apart from the research that the union decides to focus on, all other research will be stopped.\"</p><br/><p>This startled Chen Feng. So that was the case! Previously, he had still been feeling doubtful. Even if other teams also had their results, it wouldn't be such a coincidence as three teams submitting their results on the same day. Now that he looked at it\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"They were aware that we are submitting our results today. Initially, they planned to continue their research before submitting. After finding out that we are submitting our results today, they submitted their results earlier than us without any hesitation. Moreover, in order to obtain control over the entire project, they have to have a better result than us. At least, that is what it seems like.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's brain raced. A lot of things he hadn't understood initially appeared clear now.</p><br/><p>\"In short, if we hadn't decided to submit our results today, they won't have either. From the timing of their submission, they merely submitted less than an hour before us. This shows that although there are no traitors in your BC team, someone still leaked our submission time. This is the reason the other two teams managed to submit before us. Second, since these two teams hadn't submitted their results before this, this signifies that their results must be incomplete. The only reason they rushed their submissions is the pressure they were feeling from us. If so, their results must be flawed. If they had truly reached the extent of pushing the duration of beyond to three seconds, they would have submitted their results long ago instead of waiting till now. Third, their presentation appears rather awkward. Despite the lack of actual mistakes during their presentation, it is obvious that this was the first time the B-class warrior had obtained such power.\"</p><br/><p>Shortly after, Chen Feng rearranged his thoughts. He was sure that there had to be some problem somewhere with this Man Junxi guy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sent a message to Qin Hai. \"Qin Hai, investigate this Man Junxi guy for me.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026Why are you telling me to investigate someone from your Genetic Union?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Naturally, I will have someone investigate from my side, but haven't you heard that the person who knows you best is your enemy? I believe that on your side, there must be a certain amount of records.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai shrugged. \"Fine.\" Man Junxi\u2026 this seemed to be the child of a certain powerful family. The ancient race had indeed prepared a record detailing the family of this Man Junxi.</p><br/><p>\"Let me conduct some checks.\" Qin Hai left to look for information.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Feng, he continued observing the presentation without a change in his expression. Presently, Man Junxi was already crouching silently at the side. This time, an old man walked out. He appeared to be around 70 or 80 years old and was presenting the results of his team.</p><br/><p>\"Stand here.\"</p><br/><p>He led a B-class warrior out before taking out their team's gene reagent.</p><br/><p>Gulp.</p><br/><p>The gene reagent was swallowed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Gold radiance surged.</p><br/><p>Indeed, yet another super saiyan appeared. The formidable power surged. Even if this level of power wasn't much for the people here, the significance of this power was very huge. Beyond B class! Yet another beyond B class!</p><br/><p>\"Good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\"</p><br/><p>The head was extremely excited. Now that two teams had succeeded in their research, this signified that this undertaking was indeed doable. The future of humanity was now within their grasp! Alarming everyone there, this was merely the beginning.</p><br/><p>One second.</p><br/><p>Two seconds.</p><br/><p>Three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>\"It's still active?\"</p><br/><p>They seemed to realize something.</p><br/><p>Four seconds!</p><br/><p>Even Man Junxi's eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Five seconds!</p><br/><p>Everyone was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Finally, the power of beyond stopped.</p><br/><p>Everyone was incredibly emotional. Five seconds! After the first team's three seconds, a team with five seconds had appeared. This was too powerful!</p><br/><p>\"Are there any restrictions on this?\" the head asked instinctively.</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026 the gene reagent does not work well on everyone,\" the old man stated.</p><br/><p>\"That's fine, that's fine.\" The head was all smiles. \"To make it work for everyone, a countless amount of tests will be required. Time will be required as well. To have reached this point is already an extremely good result.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

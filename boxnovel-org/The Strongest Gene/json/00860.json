Tsk tsk tsk.\u201d In an extremely narcissist way, that person felt his own body while endlessly lamenting, \u201cLook at this chest, look at these abdominal muscles, look at this waist, look at this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he crazy? The gods felt powerless when they saw this. So this fellow had walked this far just to find somewhere with water with which to worship his own body? Hehe.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas his identity been confirmed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He is Xu Fei, a person with an extremely powerful fleshy body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, can he be more powerful than a god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince his identity has already been confirmed, it is time to deal with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t stand watching that fellow\u2019s narcissist actions. After exchanging glances, powerful godly power erupted as their attacks headed toward Xu Fei.</p><br/><p>Before Xu Fei could even react, he was hit by the attacks.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous godly power\u2013induced explosions appeared. The terrifying power had blasted apart even the nearby lake. Xu Fei was completely submerged in the flood of attacks. Where he had stood, a huge crater, several dozen meters deep, had been created. Their attacks had transformed even the topography of this place. The various gods watched on coldly. Just as they were about to conclude that their mission was a success, a single hand suddenly reached out from the crater. As the gods saw this, their pupils shrank.</p><br/><p>There, a frail-looking person slowly crawled out of the crater.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They had an ominous feeling. That had not been enough to kill him? Let alone dead, he wasn\u2019t hurt in the slightest. This fellow\u2026 had resisted the bombardment of a bunch of gods with his flesh alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d howled the leader of this group of gods. Nobody was stupid enough to continue fighting in this situation. The earlier attack had already been extremely powerful, created by them joining hands. If even such intense godly power couldn\u2019t harm Xu Fei, killing him was impossible.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they decided to retreat without the slightest hesitation. Alas, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>With a red flash, a figure streaked past. Xu Fei erupted with extremely horrifying speed and streaked everywhere. Each time he was seen, a god died, blood splattering about.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Finally, the last god fell. An indignant look was left in his eyes, which were still wide open. He could not understand this. Xu Fei\u2026 How had that weakling become so powerful? After all, he was obviously a regular human, a person who was supposed to be incapable of breaking through\u2026</p><br/><p>How\u2026</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>The final god landed on the ground, dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeaklings.\u201d Xu Fei curled his lips. He began to sense the power he now had. In short, before, he had only been immune to energy, whereas at present, he was immune to even godly power? This feeling\u2026 His body felt weird now. His rise had been an odd one. Turtles, dragons, and all those weird things he had experienced. Now, with the baptism of time, his body had gained this odd constitution, which he himself couldn\u2019t explain clearly.</p><br/><p>The power of time was extremely powerful. However, what they had experienced was merely a portion of what had leaked out of Wang Yao\u2019s place. Moreover, this little amount of leaked power had been spread all over this world. Therefore, when it had landed on living beings\u2019 bodies, the effects hadn\u2019t been as powerful as the pure power of time would be.</p><br/><p>Thanks to Xu Fei\u2019s immunity, the effect of the power of time on him had been halved as well. Therefore, what should have been enough to directly cause Xu Fei to die of old age had been shortened. He had only experienced 10,000 years. This had allowed his odd flesh to go through a millennium\u2019s worth of evolution.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, a millennium. This surpassed the life span of many life-forms. Yet for Xu Fei, who had inherited the bloodlines of a dragon and of a turtle, he had merely somewhat honed his flesh. After all, such as dragons, which possessed formidable flesh, had always been existences that grew strong with the passage of time.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Xu Fei had reached completion in his cultivation just like that. Based on what the little turtle had told him previously, if the day came when his cultivation reached completion, his strength should be\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Xu Fei punched at the ground beneath him. The firm and substantial soil, which had become even stronger after this world\u2019s transformation, couldn\u2019t even take a single punch from Xu Fei. A huge crater was instantly created. A true god!</p><br/><p>Xu Fei howled with laughter. \u201cHahahaha.\u201d <em>Luo Yuan, did you ever imagine that this would happen instead? I am now as strong as a true god! Luo Yuan, wash your rear and wait for me!</em></p><br/><p>Xu Fei was immensely satisfied as he continued praising his still-naked body. Even when he was praising his little brother down there, his head was still held high and his chest was still puffed out. All his feelings were being wantonly let out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, I will be the hunter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a different location, a certain god had just appeared.</p><br/><p>An alarmed expression appeared on the 30-plus gods around him. None of them dared to get near him. That was because this god had become extremely powerful after being hit by the power of time. He was now comparable to a true god. After all, there had to be some lucky ones among Luo Yuan\u2019s subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all, come with me,\u201d he said. The gods in this area had discovered a target as well. He would now personally go to deal with that target.</p><br/><p>The gods accepted his command. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow is called Qin Hai. It is said that he is Chen Feng\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on that minor god\u2019s introduction, Qin Hai\u2019s time was reversed after he was hit by the power of time. He is now a little child with nearly zero strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were very pleased when they heard this. With this, there would be no mistakes. After reaching the location, they could indeed see a child. This child appeared rather tender and unfamiliar. However, he did indeed resemble Qin Hai somewhat. This Qin Hai fellow, who was one of the stronger members of Chen Feng\u2019s group of friends, had actually been transformed into a child!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were delighted. \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They pressed forward toward that child. Alas, right at this instant, that child turned around and glanced at them. Suddenly, the child shook his head and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Just as the gods were about to chase after him, their leader stopped them. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat place\u2026\u201d That god pointed at where the child now stood. They could see that a faint radiance was flickering there. The flow of time seemed to be changing constantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a region where the flow of time changes, an extremely dangerous place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods were alarmed. Even though they were gods, they still wouldn\u2019t dare to carelessly enter such an area.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>After giving them one last glance, the child stepped deeper into that area. At a speed visible to the naked eye, his body began growing again.</p><br/><p>One could vaguely see that a sword was held in the child\u2019s hand. He seemed to be\u2026 doing something?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, one god understood. \u201cHe is cultivating!\u201d</p><br/><p>This person called Qin Hai was actually making use of this region of flowing time to cultivate.</p><br/><p>The gods dared not believe this. \u201cIs he not afraid that this will be the cause of his death?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was an area that even they did not dare to enter. After all, that was a place where the flow of time would forever be unknown. Moreover, a situation might even arise where different parts of one\u2019s body experienced the flow of time in different directions. Therefore, none of the gods dared to enter that area. That person called Qin Hai seemed to be gambling\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFocus on him. I refuse to believe that he can survive this.\u201d Their leader did not believe that Qin Hai could survive this. After all, the flow of time in this area seemed to be extremely long. Could Qin Hai truly reach the end? At this rate, he would most certainly die of old age before he reached the end. This was the opinion of all the gods here. Thus, they all focused their attention on Qin Hai, who was within the region of flowing time. They watched as he walked forth one step at a time. With each step he took, he grew older. Soon, he was already a youth.</p><br/><p>Youth\u2026</p><br/><p>Middle age\u2026</p><br/><p>Old age\u2026</p><br/><p>With each step he took, he grew older by a year. Now, he had actually walked to his old age. His expression appeared much older now. His body was no longer tall and straight, instead stooping down at a speed visible to the naked eyes. Despite that, he still maintained the same posture and was still holding the sword. The sword had never moved either. Just like that, he walked through the region of flowing time, reaching the end of his life span. All the gods were shocked when they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is this fellow trying to do?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

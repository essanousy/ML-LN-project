Although he had yet to meet Chen Feng, once Luo Yuan began to pay attention to him, all his plans seemed to be unable to hide. After all, the two knew each other all too well. Therefore, Luo Yuan was able to see through nearly all of Chen Feng\u2019s plans. Since Chen Feng had not appeared here, he had definitely gone to outer space.</p><br/><p>Based on Luo Yuan\u2019s understanding of Chen Feng, he would hide his identity, then head to outer space to rescue Wang Yao. Unfortunately, an inescapable net had been set there long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I will not allow you to flee from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan had a firm gaze. There were way too many detection traps planted in outer space. Moreover, within his space station, there was a huge number of fatal traps. Of course, Luo Yuan did not believe that these traps could actually kill Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was still Chen Feng. The traps would only be able to trap him there. Ultimately, Luo Yuan would still need to personally make a move to end Chen Feng. In any case, only by moving himself would he be able to ensure Chen Feng\u2019s death. Luo Yuan knew that if he didn\u2019t personally witness Chen Feng\u2019s death, he would spend his entire life wondering whether Chen Feng was truly dead. As such, he had to personally ensure Chen Feng\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t received any alerts from the space station yet. Mhm\u2026 It seems Chen Feng isn\u2019t there yet,\u201d Luo Yuan muttered himself. He had to time his arrival nicely. If he arrived too early, Chen Feng would flee before reaching. In any case, his sensors there weren\u2019t something any ordinary person could detect. Therefore, when Chen Feng broke through the restrictions there, when he began to slowly enter the palace\u2026 that would be the perfect time for Luo Yuan to arrive.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, until that moment, he had to prepare. Regardless of how much he looked down on Chen Feng, a true god was still a true god. Chen Feng was no longer the same person as before. To eliminate a true god, the proper measures needed to be taken. Otherwise, if Chen Feng escaped, he wouldn\u2019t be so easy to catch in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to prepare some methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>He scanned the numerous abilities he possessed before finally stopping on his recently emptied book ability.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he should form a new alien world from a different book? Neither Godly Model Creator nor The Crystal Palace would do. If so\u2026 what about a book regarding cultivation? He found a book called Heaven Slaughtering Diagram. In this world, there were 3,000 grand daos as well as a process for gathering godly power. It shared some resemblance to his cultivation system.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe author of this book is astonishingly intelligent and highly popular. Moreover, the cultivation system they have fits me nicely, and there are countless experts in this world. I might even be able to catch a glimpse of the process of world creation from this book.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was very satisfied with his choice. Thus, a new alien world was formed based on this book, and Luo Yuan entered happily. Alas, three days later, he left with a pale expression. There was no other reason than that the author of this book was way too capable of writing filler. In the later parts of the book, when godhood was near, the author wrote never-ending filler. Luo Yuan followed along with the filler until he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. If he continued with this story, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the end and witness the main character\u2019s ascension even after Chen Feng had taken his space station apart.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan raged. \u201cThese damnable filler-writing authors! I will kill you guys sooner or later! At this rate, how long would I need to wait for the main character to ascend?\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave up on this book. He had finally learned that alien worlds were truly unreliable. Many times, the books were only written due to sudden flashes of inspiration from the authors. It was truly fortunate that Luo Yuan had selected a book that was actually finished. If the book had been dropped, it would have been even worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I still gained something from this trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he had been in that world, he had been able to gain some comprehension when observing the great dao. This had allowed his strength to grow again. It wouldn\u2019t be long before he was able to become a world controller. Perhaps\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t even need the godhood of misfortune. Regardless, that damnable Chen Feng still had to die.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan gazed at the sky. \u201cBy now, you should be reaching the space station, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his wristband began beeping like crazy.</p><br/><p>Didi\u2014</p><br/><p>Didi\u2014</p><br/><p>This was the sound of alerts originating from outer space.</p><br/><p>A smile crept onto Luo Yuan\u2019s face. \u201cYou have finally arrived.\u201d Since he had received the alert, it was time for him to set off.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, in outer space, a huge mess had been created at the entrance of the originally imposing palace. The outer part of this palace had been nearly taken apart. Half the palace had crumbled apart. That\u2019s right, Chen Feng had long since entered the palace. With Chen Yuan here intercepting the alert transmissions, he\u2019d had nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>As such, he had broken in through brute force. Over two days, nearly the entire palace had been taken apart. Despite this, he had still failed to enter the core area. Unfortunately, that was where Wang Yao was located.</p><br/><p>Before him, an immense palace was floating. Countless crushed blocks hovered around, orbiting the palace. Only the hall in the middle of everything still shone with a magnificent radiance, the very hall that was untouchable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is untouchable,\u201d Chen Yuan said as he narrowed his gaze. \u201cIn fear of some accidents or Wang Yao\u2019s escape, this place has been set in a way such that nobody can open it. Not even Luo Yuan. Only when Wang Yao finished her cultivation would this place be automatically opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chen Feng replied calmly.</p><br/><p><em>What is the point of coming here if you already know this? </em>Chen Yuan could not understand Chen Feng\u2019s motivation. Wasn\u2019t he here to rescue Wang Yao? If they couldn\u2019t do that, then wasn\u2019t this trip pointless?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely laughed. \u201cHehe.\u201d Next, his body floated forward and slowly neared that huge palace.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A deafening boom resounded. One could see Chen Feng utilizing all his might to lift the entire palace.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan\u2019s eyes went wide. This\u2026 Was he sick? He was planning to carry the entire palace away?</p><br/><p>Clang! Clang!</p><br/><p>Accompanied by various clanging sounds and the blazing alarms, the huge palace actually began moving. Next, it slowly accelerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really planning to carry it away?\u201d Chen Yuan was shaken. This fellow had gone crazy.</p><br/><p>Although Chen Feng was only carrying the core part of the space station, he was still carrying a huge, intact palace. Wasn\u2019t he aware of how big that thing was? Compared to that palace, Chen Feng was akin to an ant.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \u201cOf course. Since I can\u2019t bring Wang Yao away, I will just take everything away. With this, there won\u2019t be any danger when she wakes up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s thought process was quite simple. However, when Chen Yuan pondered it, what Chen Feng was doing was in fact quite logical.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Chen Yuan could only accept this. In any case, he was only here to help Chen Feng in the first place. In outer space, the void was ripped apart. Chen Feng contacted Wang Chun to have him establish a tunnel using this tear in the void, and before Chen Yuan\u2019s speechless gaze, he stuffed the huge palace into the alien world.</p><br/><p>Clang! Clang!</p><br/><p>The friction between the huge palace and the crack leading to the alien world created a loud sound.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Once again, countless cracks appeared in the alien world. If Ming Yue and Shen Wang hadn\u2019t appeared to stabilize the alien world, it might have collapsed for real this time. Ultimately, the entire palace was successfully stuffed inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Chen Feng had a pleased expression.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had never expected this to be the result of their trip here.</p><br/><p>He had initially believed that Chen Feng was planning to leave traps around the space station and wait for Luo Yuan\u2019s arrival. Then the two would fight a decisive battle. Unexpectedly, what had happened instead was the palace being carried away. What in the world? Chen Yuan was still stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, time to notify Luo Yuan,\u201d Chen Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Chen Yuan blanked. \u201cNotify him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Chen Feng glanced at Chen Yuan. \u201cThe entire palace has been stolen. The moment we leave, he will find out. Therefore, it does not matter if we notify him first. Don\u2019t ever look down on his intelligence. We only succeeded because he is not aware of your existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long while, Luo Yuan arrived with an imposing aura. Instantly, he was stunned. What he was looking at\u2026 did not seem to be what he had pictured? There was no Chen Feng. There were no enemies either. In fact\u2026 even his palace was no more. Here, all that remained was some ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stared blankly for a long time. Finally, he reached a verdict. That bastard had stolen his entire hideout while he was absent! What Chen Feng had been able to destroy had been destroyed. What Chen Feng hadn\u2019t been able to destroy had been stolen. However, with this, Luo Yuan\u2019s guess was confirmed. Chen Feng was indeed still alive. Damn it, only Chen Feng would do something like steal an entire hideout. Was he a madman or something?</p></div>\n</div>"}

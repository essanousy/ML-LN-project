Her expression was somewhat unsightly; her massive bosom trembled as she breathed heavily in anger.</p><br/><p>\"What terrifying humans, to be able to use such a method to cause our army to become complacent.\"</p><br/><p>The general was extremely shocked. The ancient race had undergone great changes recently, becoming a race of a single gender. Although the strength of their race had increased greatly, they had similarly become even more emotional. Something like this happening wasn't surprising, honestly; the biggest question facing the general was what they should do next.</p><br/><p>Keep up the war? Their soldiers were no longer willing to fight. In this grand war of the ancient race's, their grand army had only conquered three of the humans' border cities before losing the entirety of their combat power. Intruding upon the hinterlands of the humans would remain a dream. What should they do, then? The general smiled bitterly. It seemed like she could only report this to the higher-ups.</p><br/><p>And thus the front-line updates were sent at a high speed. Both the humans and the ancients reported to their higher-ups first thing. Upon receiving the updates, both sides were dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>The higher-ups of humanity were gathered here in a meeting. Everyone looked at the report in their hands before glancing at Chen Feng and remained in a long stupor. This development was somewhat different from what they had estimated?</p><br/><p>\"Is this something you thought up long ago?\" the Strategy Department head asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\" If he could have even foreseen this happening, that would have truly been miraculous. Based on his initial plan, he had been hoping that the ancient race would be too busy dealing with an internal issue\u2014solving their reproduction problem\u2014thus giving humans more time. But now\u2026</p><br/><p>\"The biggest question is what do we do next?\" the deputy president asked solemnly.</p><br/><p>This change among the ancient race was a good thing for the humans. However, how should they maintain this advantage? That was the issue to consider now. They had to keep delaying the main army of the ancient race.</p><br/><p>\"This is simple.\" Chen Feng had a rather deep understanding of the ancient race. \"Although this race is strong and has a long history, the actual level of their civilization and nation are rather low.\"</p><br/><p>As everyone heard this, their eyes gleamed. If that was the case\u2026</p><br/><p>On the next day, several blockbuster movies with good ratings were played for free in every city the ancient race was in. The excuse given was \"to gain understanding of human culture.\" At this, all the ancient race members in those cities gathered in the various cinemas. Toward the end, some cried, some cheered, and they were all stunned by humanity's films.</p><br/><p>Movies, games, music\u2026</p><br/><p>All of these penetrated the lives of these ancient race members. For the first time, they discovered the existence of such wonderful things. The world of the ancient race was a rather unique world. The ancients as a race placed military achievements above all others. Regardless of one's talent, regardless of one's interest, everyone did only a single thing: pursuing strength without stop. There were no forms of entertainment or hobbies whatsoever among the ancient race's society.</p><br/><p>But here in human society, for the first time, they discovered that apart from war, there were other interests in this world.</p><br/><p>\"This item called an energy piano seems rather interesting,\" said Wang Tiedan, an ex-bandit who had committed numerous crimes in the past. At present, the ex-he, present she was hugging a piano in a trance. Every single time she pressed down on a note, a captivating sound and a wondrous light effect would appear, bewitching this ancient race member.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, this Dead or Alive[1] 1 game is really fun. I had originally believed that having a big bosom would affect one's combat ability. The ladies in this game all have massive bosoms, yet they can actually move so fluidly in battle\u2026\"</p><br/><p>A certain ancient race female was seriously studying a rebranded version of Dead or Alive, making a great effort to learn the combat methods displayed in the game. Naturally, whether she would learn those moves where one's bosom could be used as a weapon to smash at one's enemy remained to be seen\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Wuwu\u2026 This soap opera is so very touching. The female lead is so pitiful. After her man died, her parents died as well. Next, she was gang raped. Her grandmother died, her grandfather went crazy, yet she still needs to take care of three babies\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"True, true.\"</p><br/><p>The rather emotional ones among the ancient race were all crying rivers of tears while watching human soap operas.</p><br/><p>\"I wish I was the female lead instead so I could kill off all those villains,\" one particular ancient race female said.</p><br/><p>By the side, a certain ancient race female was dazedly staring at the scene where the female lead was gang-raped, and she muttered to herself, \"Yea, how I wish so\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The rest: \"???\"</p><br/><p>\"Lalala, this song is very nice.\"</p><br/><p>\"What song is it? Please recommend it to me.\"</p><br/><p>\"A song called Ifuudoudou[2] 2 \u2026 I can only sing a few phrases, though. The rest of the lyrics I don't know how to sing.\"</p><br/><p>A group of ancients who enjoyed music had also fallen to human culture.</p><br/><p>Naturally, there were also a number of them who disliked such things. Fortunately, there were such girls with non-mainstream interests among humans as well. For these people, the multitude of games humanity had to offer would surely interest them, right?</p><br/><p>Humanity's present assortment of games was simply akin to an entirely different world of fantasy!</p><br/><p>For example, competitive games! Games that gave one boundless excitement, pushing one to new heights!</p><br/><p>For example, sim games! Games where one could assume a new identity and play as whatever character they wished to!</p><br/><p>For example, RPGs! One would start slowly and would need to rely on loot to increase one's strength!</p><br/><p>For example, adventure games! One could massacre everything one saw and engage in never-ending killing with an elegant and spectacular world as the backdrop. One could even be prince charming and rescue a princess in distress.</p><br/><p>If even these could not satisfy those ancient race members, how about those legendary adult games? The latest releases, such as \"True Boyfriend,\" \"Beach Soccer,\" \"Cloud Wolf,\" \"Artificial Beta Boy,\" \"Chronicles of Teenage Boys, 5th Edition,\" and so on. There had to be one game out there suited for the ancient race members!</p><br/><p>Ultimately, the entirety of the ancient race became addicted to these human entertainments. The moment these ancients that had originated from a civilization with a rather crude and dry culture encountered the information age of the humans, they were thoroughly captivated.</p><br/><p>At present, the several cities where humans and ancients coexisted together had transformed into unique cities. Even humans enjoyed visiting these cities, as there, a lot of entertainment was provided free of charge. And just like that, the popularity of those few cities increased dramatically.</p><br/><p>As for the war\u2026 everyone had completely forgotten about it. The females of the ancient race felt that their mere presence would be sufficient to conquer whatever place they arrived at. At the Genetic Union, a group of people were discussing this matter seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent. Our next step should be teaching them human words. We do not need to rush that. We need to gradually and slowly make them accept human culture before assimilating them into human society.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng listened on in silence. This wasn't something he was good at. However, he couldn't avoid feeling awe for what these fellows here were capable of.</p><br/><p>Fighting a war? How boring. The scarier method was cultural invasion. If it were a normal culture, there would most certainly have been some sort of conflict and resistance against something like this. But the ancient race? That all-female race? They accepted everything presented to them as if it was the most natural thing to do. It seemed like they were conquering the humans and the humans were completely helpless against them, as all the humans were treating them with the utmost respect. However, by the time all of them fully assimilated into human society, the ancient race would truly vanish from this world. That was the scariest part!</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right, we need to research some new gene reagents as well. Isn't this something Chen Feng is most proficient with?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they had started talking about Chen Feng. Chen Feng, who had not been paying attention to the meeting, was caught off guard. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"We have something that requires your help,\" the Reagent Department head stated solemnly. \"The assimilation of the ancient race is only the first step, and it's not assimilation in the truest sense. As such, we require something that can truly help them blend with us humans, and that something is a future generation. Due to the unique makeups of the bodies of humans and ancients, it might be rather difficult for a baby to be conceived between both races. We will need your help in this, to assist them in the creation of life. Hence\u2026\" He paused and looked at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shivered and firmly refused. \"Not possible!\"</p><br/><p>Something seemed fishy from how this plot was developing.</p><br/><p>\"???\" The Reagent Department head scratched his head. \"So it turns out such gene reagents are really that hard to create?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had an odd expression as he asked, \"Gene reagent?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah. We need some gene reagents capable of helping them become pregnant.\" The Reagent Department head gazed at Chen Feng in a daze and continued, \"Isn't that what you meant when you said no earlier?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

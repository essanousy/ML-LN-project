He had known that when Xiao Ying faced danger, Ming Yue would most certainly appear. This was quite a bizarre summoning method, though.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue snorted. \"I will destroy you sooner or later.\" She raised her bathrobe and glared at Chen Feng before throwing a glance at the happily smiling Xiao Ying. At that sight, her anger lowered somewhat. \"What are you laughing about? No matter what, you are still an intelligent life form. Why have you not grown up yet even after so long? Has the growth of your brain been allocated to your length instead?\" Ming Yue was furious.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time he'd heard someone use such a unique method of scolding someone, although the \"length\" in his mind was different than the \"length\" in Ming Yue's mind. One was thinking of the growth of age, and the other was referring to a growth in length. Mhm\u2026 Ming Yue was quite well studied in human literature, after all.</p><br/><p>\"When I'm done with my affairs over there, I will personally come and give you lessons.\" Ming Yue glared at Xiao Ying before looking at Chen Feng. \"Don't keep using this method to summon me. The danger level will not always be transmitted correctly to me. If I fail to sense it in time\u2026\" Ming Yue warned Chen Feng solemnly before leaving.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"All right.\" He had also been forced to summon Ming Yue. If not for the unique circumstances he had been in previously, he wouldn't have used such a method to summon her. That was because the exhaustion of using this summoning method was rather\u2026</p><br/><p>At this thought, Chen Feng checked his luck value, and his heart ached. The distance between Xiao Ying and Ming Yue was too far, a distance of two worlds. As such, even if Xiao Ying encountered danger, Ming Yue could only sense it from a different world. Under such circumstances, numerous factors, such as spatial flow and so on, might affect her ability to sense Xiao Ying's danger. As such, the instant when Ming Yue sensed the danger might not necessarily be the exact same instant that Xiao Ying encountered danger. This was also the reason Ming Yue had left such a solemn warning to Chen Feng. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>In order to ensure that Ming Yue would sense the danger immediately, his luck value had been consumed. The amount of luck value exhausted to clear the spatial flows between both worlds had reached a staggering 1,000 points. This was an extremely terrifying amount. Even though Chen Feng had been saving up his luck value during the past half year, he still couldn't afford to waste them this way.</p><br/><p>\"Only 2,000 points remain\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart ached. Half a year! Apart from the several times he had used it to increase the skill usage history for his God Punisher, he had been saving them and had managed to save only 3,000 points in total. For his God Punisher's advancement, he had been using several luck value per day to release never-before-used abilities from his Myriad Illusions in order to accumulate his history of used abilities.</p><br/><p>At times, one luck value would be sufficient to release several new abilities, but at other times, several luck value would be required to release only a single ability. Slowly, the many abilities in his Myriad Illusions were released and the accumulation of his God Punisher changed. This was rather stable progress. This was also the reason Chen Feng had been able to contend against that devil race member earlier by using God Punisher and Virus Mode.</p><br/><p>Alas, he was ultimately still too weak. Despite his ample preparations, he had still been unable to properly contend against that devil race member. It was the same this time. The opponent had been too strong, to the point Chen Feng hadn't even been able to unleash his God Punisher in time. Ultimately, he'd had no choice but to forcefully summon Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that the devil race member had indeed been eliminated, the exhaustion of his luck value was truly\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. He had lost 1,000 of his pitiful 3,000 luck value with only a single summon. How could his heart not ache? Yes, Big Sister Ming Yue was indeed powerful. However, the exhaustion from summoning her was truly too excessive.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like I have to take note of this in the future.\" Chen Feng sighed yet again. He was not only anxious about his safety, he was also hurting from the exhaustion of his luck value. He raised his head and was welcomed with gazes of reverence from the people around him.</p><br/><p>They couldn't help but respect him. This Chen Feng guy hadn't only reached the apex in gene production, even when looking for wives, his wives were apex experts as well. He was simply a winner at life!</p><br/><p>\"A friend\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng wanted to give an explanation yet found it impossible to explain. How was he supposed to explain this? Telling them that lady was a summon of a friend of his? Or perhaps the leader of the harem his friend had summoned? Who would actually believe that?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a groan was heard. Everyone's attention was attracted as they noted that the Li Lei that had been being hunted by the devil race had finally regained consciousness.</p><br/><p>\"Li Lei!\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president walked over emotionally. \"Are you fine?\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei shook his head. \"I'm fine. Devil race\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president comforted him. \"The devil race members chasing after you have been killed. Don't worry.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, that's not what I mean.\" Li Lei seemed agitated. \"In the devil race's territory, I discovered traces of S class.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone widened their eyes. Devil race? S class? This single sentence of Li Lei's was akin to a storm that engulfed the entire Genetic Union. All their experts, all the beyond A classes, even those who were still in seclusion forcibly left their seclusion in advance before rushing over to this place to try to listen to the secret Li Lei had discovered.</p><br/><p>This was, after all, something pertaining to S class\u2026 All their hearts trembled. At present, humanity was at a bottleneck. Regardless of the old A classes of the past or the beyond A classes of the present, to break through their bottleneck, there was only one possibility: entering S class and fusing with a brand new genetic ability, thus creating more powerful abilities.</p><br/><p>\"Where?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which clan of the devil race?\"</p><br/><p>\"What ability is it?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was going crazy.</p><br/><p>\"Have you guys not sensed it?\" Li Lei paused. \"When scouting in the devil race territories, I accidentally encountered the devil race's sacrificial ceremony. I tried spoiling that ceremony, yet unexpectedly, they still successfully awakened that\u2026 terrifying devil race member! That was also the devil race member that injured me. Otherwise, those three devil race members wouldn't have been my match at all,\" Li Lei stated hatefully.</p><br/><p>So that's the case. Everyone finally understood. Previously, they had still been wondering why Li Lei was being chased by those three despite his strength. So it turned out that there was a particular extremely powerful devil race member. True, only such an expert could accomplish such a feat.</p><br/><p>The experts of Genetic Union exchanged glances and gulped. S class\u2026 That was an S class! If they could kill that S-class devil race member, if they could obtain its gene\u2026</p><br/><p>They were all tempted.</p><br/><p>The news brought by Li Lei was too shocking. So shocking that these experts that had been stuck at the peak of beyond A class for a long time could no longer maintain their calm. It was no wonder that the devil race had been trying to kill Li Lei. Such a secret\u2026</p><br/><p>However, this just made some of them more curious. \"Why did it change its target to Chen Feng toward the end, then?\"</p><br/><p>After Li Lei found out what had happened, he understood immediately. Sneering, he said, \"The reason for that is simple. To produce a true S-class gene reagent, an exceptionally powerful gene producer is required. Presently, among humanity, Chen Feng is the only one capable of this.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hands. \"How is that possible? Those great masters are all better than me in production.\"</p><br/><p>Yes, his production level was indeed high. However, those old great masters were much better than him in terms of production. He couldn't contend with them.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, their production levels are higher than yours. However, their combat power is too weak, so weak that they can't even defend themselves.\" Li Lei shook his head. \"To produce a true S-class gene reagent, the producer will have to enter that place where the devil race members were being awakened. There, danger is everywhere. It is impossible for those gene producers to return alive from such a place. This is even more true for the older generations of gene producers. Their combat power is nonexistent. Only you, Chen Feng! You are the best option for becoming the producer of this S-class gene reagent. This will also be the most powerful gene reagent in the history of humanity: an S-class fusion gene reagent!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

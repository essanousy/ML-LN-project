He did not believe that he his strength would increase for no apparent reason, even more so when the prowess he displayed did not conform to the level he was actually at. There seemed to be a problem somewhere.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He punched out. A huge tree immediately collapsed. As the huge monkey watched on from a distance, his heart trembled in fear. This tree was no normal tree; its roots were several dozen meters in length, and it had faint godly power. As such, this tree was incomparably firm, yet this very tree had been crushed by Chen Feng with a single punch.</p><br/><p>\"Twenty-five times...\" he muttered inwardly. So long as he fully exerted himself, he could unleash a power around 25 times that of a level 1 awakened.</p><br/><p>This strength...</p><br/><p>He was still analyzing this newfound strength of his. There were 10 levels in the awakened realm. While in the resonance realm, one would begin to have access to godly power, also similarly split to ten levels. Interestingly, though, by virtue of godly power alone, a mere level 1 resonator would be around a hundred times stronger than a level 1 awakened.</p><br/><p>In a situation where neither the disparity in talent nor the type of godly power was taken into consideration, the pure, raw power of a level 1 resonator would be a hundred times greater than that of a level 1 awakened. This was proof of how powerful godly power was.</p><br/><p>This was also why all resonators looked down on awakened ones. Without godly power, awakened ones were nothing but bugs. The maximum limit of the awakened realm was only level 10. Even the more talented ones would only be somewhat stronger. They would still be too far from a level 1 awakened. Yet here was Chen Feng, whose punch had unleashed a might equivalent to level 25 awakened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled something. \"The last time I tested it, my punch unleashed a might of a level 9 awakened.\"</p><br/><p>Back in the Genetic Union, he had once tested his combat prowess and had nearly destroyed the replacement equipment the Genetic Union had prepared for him. At that time, he had still been a level 3 awakened.</p><br/><p>Hold on... If as a level 3 awakened he could unleash the might of a level 9, and at level 5 he could unleash the might of a level 25... This seemed to be something that could be solved with math? To the power of two? Chen Feng found this inconceivable. So it turned out that his attacks would unleash a might equal to the square of whatever level he was? Why was that?</p><br/><p>Once again, Chen Feng punched out. At this moment, he could seemingly see the miniature person within him performing the same action. When he punched out, the miniature person punched out as well.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another tree collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"Is it because of you?\" Finally, Chen Feng understood. His unique prowess was due to this miniature person within him. This was in fact another him, a Chen Feng that had been conceived by Luck Aura. If this miniature person could truly allow his attack to be amplified like so...</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes gleamed as he thought of something. If, at level 5 awakened, he could unleash the might of a level 25 awakened, what if he was a level 10 awakened? Would he be able to defeat the level 1 resonators even without godly power? Would he be able to surmount the limit placed by godly power?</p><br/><p>He was overwhelmed with emotions as he realized this. Even in this era, gods were still very rare. One look at the herculean apes and their lack of a god even after so long was enough to ascertain this fact. Naturally, due to Chen Feng's unique identity, he was someone that would not be able to resonate with any gods.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he could only rely on himself. As for ascending to godhood, such a thing was still rather far away from him at present. From what the huge monkey had said, if one wanted to become a god, one would have to traverse numerous dangerous places to obtain the seed of a god. To achieve that, one would require extraordinary strength.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this was not part of Chen Feng's considerations for now. At present, it would be more reliable to first increase his strength.</p><br/><p>Power of two...</p><br/><p>Chen Feng clenched his fists tightly, eager to test out his theory.</p><br/><p>\"Are you truly not a god?\" the huge monkey asked as tree after tree went down.</p><br/><p>\"Nope,\" Chen Feng answered.</p><br/><p>The huge monkey smiled bitterly. \"Fine.\" Truthfully, the idea of a mortal displaying such a performance was much scarier than the idea of an unrecovered god doing the same.</p><br/><p>\"Do you guys have anything one can use to increase one's strength?\" Chen Feng paused slightly before continuing, \"For example, drugs or medicine or anything like that? Since you guys are all awakened ones, you should have something like that, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we do,\" the huge monkey said. However, after a slight pause, he added, \"We used to.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng raised his brow.\"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>\"In this forest, there is a region inhabited by a certain species of fruit trees. The fruits of these trees were all nourished by godly power, and after consuming one, one's strength will increase. It is also a fruit all of us need to take at a certain point in our lives. However, this year, that territory was conquered by the Grasshorde Tribe. In fact, they are weaker than us. However, after becoming the believers of a god, they obtained godly power. As such...\"</p><br/><p>The mere thought of this caused the huge monkey to gnash his teeth in anger.</p><br/><p>\"Is there any way to solve this?\"</p><br/><p>The huge monkey looked at Chen Feng with anticipation. \"Fight them!\" In his opinion, with Chen Feng's formidable prowess, he was capable enough to lead them and regain the lost territory.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm...\" Chen Feng pondered shortly before saying, \"I can't beat them.\"</p><br/><p>The huge monkey: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"I am truly not their match.\" From what this huge monkey had said, the enemy seemed to have been a weakling in the past, with their top combat power being at around level 10 awakened. Naturally, with this monkey's battle prowess being equivalent to level 20 awakened, they had been too weak. However, now that they had entered the resonance realm, this monkey was no longer their opponent. So long as one had godly power, even a level 1 resonator would be a hundred times stronger than a level 1 awakened. How could he hope to defeat such an opponent?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"I might be able to defeat them sometime in the future, but not now. I have yet to fully recover my strength. For now, I still need to verify some things.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that why you require something capable of increasing your strength?\" Finally, the huge monkey understood the reason for Chen Feng's question.</p><br/><p>\"If it's only an increase in strength...\" The huge monkey pondered before saying, \"Will a temporary increase work? I know of something capable of providing a temporary boost in strength.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. \"Yes, that will do.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right. Please wait a moment.\" As he finished his words, the monkey left. Shortly after, he returned with a blue medicinal herb in his hand.</p><br/><p>\"This is something that received the nourishment of godly power. After consuming it, one can obtain a temporary boost in strength,\" the monkey explained.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent.\"</p><br/><p>After checking and confirming that this herb was fine, Chen Feng immediately took it.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A powerful force erupted within him.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A surging warm current provoked his body, causing his body to unleash an even stronger strength, pushing Chen Feng from level 5 awakened to level 6.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The medicine was still in effect, pushing Chen Feng's strength onward. Alas, just as it was about to reach level 7, the medicinal effect started to weaken before slowly vanishing. At this moment, Chen Feng's strength started decreasing as well. If this continued, he would most probably revert back to level 5 awakened before long. This \"temporary\" was much shorter than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>If so, he would have to test it now. Without hesitation, he unleashed all the strength available to him and punched out.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A mighty force blasted out. Chen Feng could clearly feel that, in a mysterious manner, the power both he and the miniature person were unleashing had somehow converged together, forming a perfect circle.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His energy blasted out, destroying a row of trees before him. The huge monkey watched on in horror. He could feel that at present, Chen Feng was much stronger than he had been before, completely unlike the increase of one mere level. This... was equivalent to level 36 awakened! Chen Feng was completely enthralled, as he had also confirmed that his conjecture was correct.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

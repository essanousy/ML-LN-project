Unfortunately, nobody heard his scream. Thanks to Qin Hai, Lu Hun's call for help had been fated to fail from the beginning. Gou Li's trio had unsightly expressions on their face, as they felt like they had been played for fools. Even when in such circumstances, this Lu Hun was still in the mood to play around with them? Just how much did he look down upon them?</p><br/><p>Gou Li's eyes gleamed coldly. \"I refuse to believe that I won't be able to force your trump card out.\"</p><br/><p>Kill!</p><br/><p>The cold light in their hands intensified. A faint barrier surrounded them, evidence that Gou Li's trio had unleashed an even more powerful might. Their line of thought was a simple one: to increase the might of their attacks without stop. If it resulted in Lu Hun being forced to unleash his trump card, it would be fine. However, if he insisted on still not using his trump card, then Lu Hun could just obediently be beaten to death.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying radiance erupted. Suddenly, Lu Hun shut his eyes. When the attacks of Gou Li's trio neared him, the attacks slowed down. Suddenly, the barrier around their attacks all but vanished.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint green light flickered. The entire world was seemingly enveloped in green. Beside each of them, a green cube formed of strings appeared. Each of the green strings was very clear and bright, so very dazzling amid the darkness.</p><br/><p>Their hearts jolted furiously. What is this? The entire world had seemingly become green at this moment. The black rain, the Earth, everything had seemingly vanished. The only thing they could see was a boundless darkness and those sparkling and translucent green strings.</p><br/><p>Trump card! This was Lu Hun's trump card. Their hearts jolted. Finally\u2026 this guy had finally unleashed his trump card. However, what exactly was it? Nobody had an answer. Chen Feng checked his communication device and noted that his call with Qin Hai had been severed. This black space wasn't a lighting effect caused by the green strings. Rather, they had actually arrived in an entirely different space.</p><br/><p>\"This is a different space.\" The spatial specialist of the Genetic Union gulped before continuing, \"An independently existing space.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun looked at all of them. \"Welcome to my world.\"</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>He stepped out one step at a time. As he strode forth, green steps automatically appeared before him.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Numerous green grids swarmed around. Along with the movement of the green grids, all their surroundings changed as well.</p><br/><p>\"What damnable thing is this?\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions changed slightly. Space\u2026 Independent space\u2026 A lot of them had been in such a place before. Generally, the construction of a complete space would start from the structural makeup and the perfection and stability of the space. With this, one could potentially create a brand new space out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Even in the Genetic Union itself, there was a certain powerful genetic warrior that had built his very own world of palaces using this method. It was said that in his world, numerous unique palaces stood. It was a mythical and glorious world, something that genetic warrior had spent countless years creating.</p><br/><p>That was a traditional version of an independent space. It was equivalent to one owning a mini-world for oneself where one could do whatever one wished. The stronger one was, the faster the construction and the more one could place within the world. Moreover, one's world would also be bigger and more stable. However, a world like the world before them was unheard of. This world of Lu Hun's appeared very crude, to the point that even a normal genetic warrior specializing in space could construct something similar. The only thing about this world that was truly different from others was\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Gou Li attempted to cut Lu Hun. However, the green grids forming the ground he stood on moved automatically, moving him away from Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>!!!</p><br/><p>Gou Li was alarmed. This space was actually an active one! The things within this world were all formed of some simple strings that took on the form of grids with green-framed that were filled with green cubes and were so simple that even the grids were entirely black apart from the green frames. However\u2026 everything in this world seemed to be alive.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The green grids below everyone's feet started moving. The entire world seemed to move in accordance to Lu Hun's wishes. It seemed impossible for any attack to reach him. This was Lu Hun's space. No, to be more accurate, this was Lu Hun's world, a real world.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Green radiance flickered on Lu Hun's green diamond without stop.</p><br/><p>In this world, everything belonged to Lu Hun. Different from earlier when the Shroud Art had been employed, this time, Gou Li's trio were the ones whose ability was restricted. All the connections their ability had with the outside world had been severed.</p><br/><p>Their strength dropped drastically and the energy exhaustion increased. Moreover, their energy recovery had stopped as well. With all this, before them all, this beyond A9 Lu Hun was no different than a god.</p><br/><p>Lu Hun pointed casually. \"Condense!\"</p><br/><p>Around Gou Li's trio, a huge cube formed of green strings appeared. It locked them within, restricting all movement.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm?\" Gou Li tried to move his body. Every single step he took, the cube moved forward as well in tandem with his movement. This was a pitch-black world with pitch-black grids framed in green everywhere. Gou Li tried taking several steps forward yet was incapable of escaping the cube-shaped prison. He might seem like he was stepping forward, but in truth, he was actually remaining in the same place. This was a world they were not the master of. How had this happened? All of them trembled.</p><br/><p>In this world, Lu Hun was no different from a god. How were they supposed to battle him, then? They had indeed successfully forced Lu Hun's trump card out. Unexpectedly, his trump card was actually this powerful. If Lu Hun had used this earlier, all of them would have died long ago.</p><br/><p>Eh, hold on. Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something. Since this world was so powerful, why had Lu Hun not used it earlier and had instead allowed them to beat him up? Was he so insistent just because this was a trump card? Chen Feng recalled Lu Hun's expression from earlier. No. It was obvious that Lu Hun had been incredibly unwilling to use this ability. He would have preferred to suffer injuries than make use of this mystical world of green strings.</p><br/><p>Why was that? Because this was a world that hadn't yet been perfected? Or perhaps this was a world where some flaws existed somewhere? Chen Feng's heart jolted.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, help me check out this world.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit's glance swept past this world. The strength of her perception was built with Chen Feng's strength as the core. As such, her perception was at the level of a beyond B class. Therefore, she failed to note any exceptions in this world.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry,\" Spirit apologized. \"I can't find any exceptions.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"Don't worry.\" The single most important purpose of Spirit was optimization.</p><br/><p>His beyond-B-class perception had been greatly improved after Spirit's optimization. Initially, he had believed that this would be sufficient to discover something from this world. Alas, it was evident that it was still not sufficient. That was acceptable, though, as even Spirit would not be so overpowered that she could transform an eMMC into a UFS.[1] 1</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's gaze swept past Gou Li's trio and Chen Feng. \"Everyone I hate is now gathered together. Die, all of you.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A green radiance erupted. On the surface of the green cubes that formed this world, numerous green strings flashed past. The surface of the green cubes was transformed into something like a green mesh formed of green strings. After glowing with a chilling radiance, the cubes started closing in toward them. Everyone's expressions sank. This guy was actually planning to kill all of them in here.</p><br/><p>Like a laser grinder, the green cubes were capable of slicing everything in existence, both man and energy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng called inwardly, \"Spirit.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded. \"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>Noiselessly, Luck Aura activated and the optimization began.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's luck value dropped rapidly, and Spirit completed the task. Chen Feng's gaze shot around disorderly before finally settling on a specific spot within the world. There, a different power could be felt.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gaze became focused. Is this your weakness? Let me take a look at what the weakness is, then.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

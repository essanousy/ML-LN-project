Terrifying auras surged up one after another.</p><br/><p>\"Madman! You are a madman!\" the Dream Recall Bell roared furiously.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely sneered. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>\"You will be the end of this world,\" Dream Recall Bell said with a sharp voice.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. \"Keh. In any case, my world was on the verge of being destroyed by you already. What difference does it make?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you do not understand.\" Dream Recall Bell's voice had a trace of fear in it. \"Even though I dared to alter the past, to establish my Dream Recall Dynasty, I only dared do it in the late Primordial Era, when those fellows had all been sealed. Yet you\u2026 you have awakened all of them!\"</p><br/><p>Dream Recall Bell was filled with fear.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>He had awakened those logic-defying existences of the Primordial Era? It did not matter. Perhaps the likes of Dream Recall Bell would always avoid that era for fear of something unexpected happening. However, for the Genetic Era, for Chen Feng, if the primordial had not been reawakened, the Genetic Era would have vanished. What else could they have done? They had never had a choice. Evidently, the Dream Recall Bell was aware of this as well.</p><br/><p>\"If I had known this, I most definitely would not have provoked you,\" Dream Recall Bell muttered. \"Why is that damnable pen on you? This thing was supposed to be destroyed in the Primordial Era\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Terrifying auras emanated everywhere. Everywhere around the world, numerous powerful auras were rising. Duma soared up into the sky. Around his body was a powerful and dreadful force, the true power of Duma, the true power of the scarab race, which had been previously sealed.</p><br/><p>The Dream Recall Bell noticed Duma straight away. \"Scarab race\u2026 You are the turtle that escaped back then\u2026 You have actually survived till now. The life spans of the scarab race are indeed much more terrifying than imagined. Your race is indeed the race that should have been destroyed first.\"</p><br/><p>Duma smiled calmly. \"Hehe.\" Since his strength had returned, he no longer feared this bell.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He raised his hand slightly.</p><br/><p>A formidable, incredibly dreadful power seemed to be at his beck and call.</p><br/><p>The Dream Recall Bell's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Resonance\u2026 Even you have reached this level? However, do you believe that you are the only one with the power of resonance? Hahahahaha.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the bell started shaking, and a sharp sound spread out without stop. Next, a power that was incredibly similar to Duma's power undulated out of the space.</p><br/><p>Resonance\u2026 This was yet another power of resonance.</p><br/><p>\"This damnable seal didn't only seal you. I was sealed as well. Although I do not wish to use such a power, now that the primordial has descended, let us take a look at who will be the final survivor!\" roared the Dream Recall Bell.</p><br/><p>The bell resounded.</p><br/><p>Dang\u2014</p><br/><p>Dang\u2014</p><br/><p>Undulations rippled out, pushing Chen Feng and the rest away as the bell's body became illusory.</p><br/><p>\"Thinking of leaving just like this?\" Duma stretched his hand out, forcefully intercepting the bell.</p><br/><p>The Dream Recall Bell's killing intent surged. \"Are you aware of what you are doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course I am aware,\" Duma coldly said. \"For your act of tampering with history as you wish, you deserve death. Regardless of whether the primordial has descended, you should no longer be allowed to live. Furthermore, your power of resonance is the best tool to awaken that existence. As such, you must die!\"</p><br/><p>Duma's killing intent surged.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the Dream Recall Bell to reply, he moved.</p><br/><p>Duma sneered. \"I know you are very powerful, but right now, the power of resonance has just been reinstated and has yet to fully recover. In your previous battle, you were already greatly injured, not even a tenth of your strength remaining. What can you rely on to fight me?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Surprising everyone, the Dream Recall Bell, which had still been talking so ferociously earlier, was actually trying to flee. It was indeed not able to last any longer.</p><br/><p>\"Stop it!\" Duma said.</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and the rest exchanged glances and blocked the Dream Recall Bell's escape route. With Duma behind him, they forced the bell to an impasse.</p><br/><p>\"You all\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Dream Recall Bell's intense hatred was accompanied by a trace of weakness. This unrivaled existence yesterday was presently on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>\"I am the Dream Recall Bell. I am the greatest existence of the Primordial Era. I will most definitely die off just like this. If you guys want to kill me, you guys will have to pay a price as well. All these fellows who resisted me earlier, you all shall die together with me as well!\" the Dream Recall Bell stated in a deranged manner.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A petrifying aura surged out.</p><br/><p>\"Careful.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Duma dragged everyone back into Mysterious Town.</p><br/><p>Right after they left, an immense explosion bloomed. With a dazzling explosion, all of Mysterious Town vanished into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Like an atomic bomb had been set off, Mysterious Town loudly exploded. Before their eyes, the entirety of Mysterious Town was enveloped by a scorching white. A terrifying undulation swept out, and the loud boom rang by their ears for a long time as they stared blankly. Mysterious Town was gone!</p><br/><p>Just as they thought that this was the end, numerous swirling lights of various colors shot out of Mysterious Town before streaking away.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. \"That is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>These colors\u2026 These auras\u2026 Those primordial fragments had actually escaped!</p><br/><p>\"The power of resonance has similarly awakened a part of their strength as well,\" Duma said.</p><br/><p>Swish! Swish!</p><br/><p>Countless powers erupted.</p><br/><p>From their point of view, it was as if a beautiful firework was being set off in Mysterious Town. However, this beauty carried a trace of fatality.</p><br/><p>\"With the primordial fragments escaping\u2026 something will happen, right?\" guessed Chen Feng. Each of these fragments was extremely powerful. Duma, the Genetic Union, and the Research Agency had exhausted great efforts to gather them here. Yet now\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Duma gazed at the sky. \"With the awakening of the primordial power, these primordial fragments will awaken their consciousnesses as well. From now on, their spirituality will awaken, and it will be the time for them to select their respective masters\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's attention was attracted by this. \"Select masters?\"</p><br/><p>Duma spoke calmly. \"Yes. The primordial remnants will select their masters. Since these primordial remnants are still mere fragments, they will first select someone to be their master before getting that master to help them collect their remaining fragments so they can be whole again. Next, both the primordial remnant and the selected master will be able to enter the realm of resonance together.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes widened. \"This works?\"</p><br/><p>Duma nodded. \"That's natural. After all, those are primordial remnants! Previously, they were too weak, since they had merely been fragments and had lacked spirituality. Now that the power of resonance has awakened\u2026 Mhm\u2026 They will be able to sense the location of their separated fragments. Moving on, numerous awakened ones will appear in this world. The moment a primordial fragment succeeds in selecting a master, after fusion, the master will naturally be an awakened one,\" Duma said calmly.</p><br/><p>Duma recalled something. \"Oh, right. Not only the primordial remnants. At present, since the seal on this world has been lifted, those beyond A classes will naturally be able to break through now. Not only the primordial remnants, even the humans and ancients that have been stuck at beyond A class for a long time will be able to break through now.\"</p><br/><p>\"!!!\" Chen Feng and the rest exchanged glances, their heart trembling furiously. In short, numerous awakened ones would now appear in this world?</p><br/><p>They inhaled deeply.</p><br/><p>Hiss\u2014</p><br/><p>Just imagining the scene where masters of primordial fragments walked everywhere\u2026 And where recently awakened genetic warriors were everywhere as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if they did not view humans as an evil race, it there was no doubt that among these people, there would be kind and evil ones. Only a single one of them needed to be evil to plunge this world into chaos. This was proven by the fact that the Dream Recall Bell alone had caused such a huge incident. If countless awakened ones were creating disturbances\u2026 The mere thought of this caused their heads to ache. It seemed like the peaceful Genetic Era would not return.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At this point, Chen Feng was already extremely certain that he was the extremely poor fellow who had learned of ways to save his godly power because the amount of godly power he had was way too low. As for the goddess, well... let's just say that she was indeed worthy of being a goddess. Chen Feng spread both his arms wide and took in all of the Luck Goddess's attacks. He welcomed the figurative whip of the Luck Goddess with his very body, absorbing the misfortune power within.</p><br/><p>Come! Let the storm intensify!</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>His godly power surged. The initially pitiful 100 points of misfortune power he'd had was now reaching 900 points, an increase of nine times. This was quite a terrifying increase. After all, this was not luck value. Rather, this was pure godly power.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled as he mused that she was indeed his Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Hua\u2014</p><br/><p>The misfortune was still coming without stop. Chen Feng led the group as they advanced smoothly. In a short period of time, they already traversed half the lake. At present, the Luck Goddess, who had unleashed 10-odd attacks, was dumbfounded. This development\u2026 did not seem quite right! It would still have been acceptable if she had only failed to get them to fight among themselves. Now, even the disasters she had thrown their way had been stopped? Moreover, the Luck Goddess could not even sense the effects of what should have happened when her godly power of luck was used.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess was filled with doubt. \"What's going on?\" In this entire long life of hers, something like this had never happened.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess had a deep gaze. \"This Zhou Ye fellow, he has made such ample preparations for me?\"</p><br/><p>She guessed that to be the case, since as far as she was concerned, the only variable in this operation was Zhou Ye. At present, far away at the salt lake, Chen Feng had already seen through the Luck Goddess. Naturally, this time, what he had seen through was her mind, rather than her body, since he had already seen everything she had to offer long ago.</p><br/><p>\"What body?\" Zhou Ye asked as he heard Chen Feng muttering.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng coughed and answered, \"Nothing. I am merely analyzing something.\"</p><br/><p>The two discussed in whispers.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know that even though the Luck Goddess is a deity and is incredibly powerful, she similarly has pitifully little combat experience, thanks to her very prowess?\" muttered Chen Feng, \"Moreover... she has never experienced failure.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's eyes shone as he heard this. \"You are saying\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled toyingly. \"That's right. If this were a god with rich battle experience, the god would be able to determine the problem the moment the problem occurred, using their godly power, based on the god's past experience. Unfortunately, this is not something the Luck Goddess is capable of, since she has never failed before. In this long life of hers, her only failure was that one time when she was forced to perish together with all the other gods,\" Chen Feng guessed.</p><br/><p>\"That's right.\" Zhou Ye recalled the life of the Luck Goddess. Since birth, she had proceeded along smoothly. Nobody had been capable of competing with her. That had been acceptable, though, because she was, after all, the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>\"Therefore\u2026 she has no idea what the problem is right now. Moreover, she wouldn't guess that I am here as well.\" Chen Feng continued, \"However, the main reason for her ignorance is because she is unaware that the Misfortune Goddess has already awakened. Otherwise, she would be able to deduce the truth easily.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\" Zhou Ye agreed. Despite her lack of experience, she was still an intelligent person. The moment she discovered some slight clues about the appearance of the Misfortune Goddess, she would easily be able to discover the truth of things.</p><br/><p>\"Therefore, we need you to stand out,\" Chen Feng said with a bright pair of eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was curious. \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Among you guys who are hostile toward the Luck Goddess, you are the most influential person and the only person among the resonators here that she knows of.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was the descendant of a god, and only the descendant of a god would be worthy of being remembered by the Luck Goddess. As for the others? What did they count for?</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was doubtful. \"Are you certain that me standing out will be useful?\" He was very clear on his own strength. Even though he had become stronger, it would still be impossible for him to reach a point where he could pressure the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"You only need to pretend you can. As for the rest\u2026 the Luck Goddess will make up the explanations in her own head.\"</p><br/><p>Make up\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's expression darkened. So they still needed their enemy to make up some explanations to con herself?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced at him and said, \"Let me rephrase. She will use her deductions to answer her own questions. Does this sound better?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Zhou Ye blanked, but he couldn't help but agree.</p><br/><p>\"Semantics.\" Chen Feng curled his lips and said, \"Don't worry. The Luck Goddess does not only possess the power of luck. She is also very good at deduction. After failing, she will start deducing based on the clues she has available, searching for a rational reason, the reason with the highest probability of being correct. The result being you, Zhou Ye.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a sharp gaze as he finished.</p><br/><p>He patted Zhou Ye's shoulder with his right hand. \"Never forget\u2026 you are the descendant of a god.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Boundless godly power surged out. That godly power was unique to Zhou Ye.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess in the forest instantly sensed this. \"Indeed\u2026 This is the aura of Zhou Ye. Compared to the past, he has indeed gotten much stronger.\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess sank into contemplation. However, within that aura, apart from Zhou Ye's aura, another aura was mixed in. That was an aura that caused the Luck Goddess to feel extremely twitchy.</p><br/><p>\"Zhou Ye, have you found something capable of countering me?\" the Luck Goddess guessed. Since Zhou Ye dared to come and kill her, he must have found something capable of countering her. Perhaps it was some power or divine tool!</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess's killing intent surged. \"Is this the source of your confidence?\" She did not fear Zhou Ye. However, she did not wish to see this god's descendant arrive here carrying a tool capable of countering her, as at present, she was still too weak.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Before her, radiance swirled about. The awakening of the Forest Goddess was nearly complete. At present, the only thing she could do was wait and destroy those annoying bugs.</p><br/><p>\"Zhou Ye\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess made some deductions.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, her surging power flooded the salt lake.</p><br/><p>\"Here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was overjoyed. He had known that the Luck Goddess would definitely do this.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power of misfortune descended. Seeing this, Chen Feng was incomparably happy. He had waited a long time for this very moment.</p><br/><p>\"You actually guessed correctly,\" Zhou Ye exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>He knew that Chen Feng was the resonator of the Misfortune Goddess. However, he had never guessed that Chen Feng's understanding of the Luck Goddess would reach such a level, seemingly capable of reading her thoughts. How was this even possible? The Luck Goddess was, after all, a god\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely smiled as a response. \"Hehe.\" It was only natural that he had a deep understanding of the Luck Goddess. One could say that his understanding of the Luck Goddess was way too deep. If Spirit was the Luck Goddess, the newly birthed Spirit back then had been the manifestation of the truest Luck Goddess, including how she thought. As such, Chen Feng was way too clear how she would think.</p><br/><p>Alas, that foolish girl\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed as he realized something. What had the Luck Goddess proved by not knowing how to optimally use her godly power of luck? This proved that during her fusion with Spirit, Spirit had deleted from her memory the optimal usage of the godly power of luck she had learned from Chen Feng. Spirit had been aware of the situation Chen Feng would be in. She'd had no idea whether she would still be willing to protect Chen Feng after her recovery.</p><br/><p>As such, before the full fusion, when she had still been Spirit, she had deleted everything she had learned about using the godly power of luck, leaving a chance for Chen Feng. This was the only explanation for this.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, I will not disappoint you. Even if this is a goddess\u2026\" Chen Feng's eyes gleamed coldly. \"I will retrieve my Spirit!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

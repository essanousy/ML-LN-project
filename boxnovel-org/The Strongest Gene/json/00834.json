The reason for that was rather simple: the army of censors would regularly sweep through the internet for indecent content, and these were the greatest threat to the authors of adult fan fiction. As such, the authors of such works were normally scattered everywhere. It was extremely normal for them to regularly change their online handles or the place they posted. As such, it was extremely hard to locate these authors even in times of peace, let alone times of chaos like this</p><br/><p>After all, adult fan fiction was generally written by the supernerds on the lowest rungs of society, which had possibly been the ones most likely to perish in the Genetic Era. After experiencing the descent of the primordial, the descent of the gods, Ye\u2019s Sin Era, Chen Feng\u2019s Glorious Era, Luo Yuan\u2019s Control Era, and the chaotic era that followed after Luo Yuan\u2019s wristbands were broken by Chen Feng, as mere ordinary people, could these authors have even survived this long?</p><br/><p>Wang Chun did not have an answer. Perhaps the author was long dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will we know without trying?\u201d Chen Feng asked with a smile. \u201cFortunately, I am very good at locating people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled about as Luck Aura activated.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun was astonished to see this. \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t use that ability?\u201d Due to Luo Yuan, it had been a very long time since Chen Feng had dared to use this ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can still lightly use it when I\u2019m in a different world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. A succession of coordinates appeared before Chen Feng\u2019s eyes. This was the limit of what he could obtain. He didn\u2019t dare to further use his luck power. Even though they were in two different worlds and he was screening himself with godly power, Chen Feng was still unsure of whether he would attract Luo Yuan\u2019s attention if he used the power of luck excessively.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith these coordinates, we can return and look for him,\u201d Chen Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wang Chun agreed with a sigh.</p><br/><p>They had no choice but to leave this place and head toward the coordinates. Fortunately, they ultimately found the address and arrived before a shabby yet still somewhat luxurious house.</p><br/><p><em>There is hope.</em></p><br/><p>Chen Feng was hopeful. Wang Chun went and knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>A gloomy voice sounded from within. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDelivery,\u201d Wang Chun answered with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the delivery at the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the delivery has already been put down. We have also received notification that your water meter is broken\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe delivery guys also repair water meters nowadays?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are operating a business with a PO Box.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably a false report. I am taking a shower. My water supply is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We detected that your electricity might be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am watching a video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026There might be a gas leakage here. We need to do an inspection\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s working fine. I am cooking here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun was instantly speechless. He had never expected that would be seen through before saying much.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless as he saw this. \u201cSeems like I am still not smart enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He proceeded to kick open the door. The two of them were instantly startled at what they saw. Inside the building was a chubby middle-aged man wearing messy clothes. In the living room was a huge bathtub. The middle-aged man was submerged within the bathtub, seemingly trying to save half the water by submerging himself in the bathtub to raise the water level. And the TV in the living room was indeed playing a movie. Mhm\u2026 This was an adult movie. An ancient gas stove was boiling water, and some silicone toys were visible within the water.</p><br/><p>The loud sound of the door being kicked down alarmed the fatty. He blanked shortly before suddenly saying, \u201cDid I forget to close the door? Oh, well, just leave the delivery there. When I am free, I will give you a good rating\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng and Wang Chun sank into silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrolicking Night Wind?\u201d Chen Feng asked with a sigh.</p><br/><p>The fatty was horrified. \u201cHuh? How do you know this pen name of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indeed him,\u201d Wang Chun confirmed with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>They directly knocked him unconscious and took him away. They couldn\u2019t even stay a second longer at a place like this. In all honesty, for him to be living such a life in this era, he was quite talented. To be safe, they carried the fatty to a certain cave. After a long time, the fatty woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I was wrong. I will no longer steal silicone toys. I truly have no idea who they belonged to before. I merely picked them up to boil and disinfect them so I can use them as well. If I knew that they were yours, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have touched them!\u201d the fatty screamed miserably.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So those things had been picked up? Scary.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun was rather shocked as well. \u201cHow about the gas stove\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI picked that up from a garbage heap.\u201d The fatty cried a tearless cry. \u201cThe monitored and controlled world is too scary. Therefore, I escaped from the monitored part of the world. However, the nonmonitored part of the world is now living a primitive life. As such, I had no choice but to use such a method to maintain some quality of life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026Fine.\u201d He rubbed his head. \u201cI am not interested in all this. Now, tell me. Do you still remember the things you wrote with the pen name \u2018Frolicking Night Wind\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The fatty nodded frantically as he realized something. \u201cI wrote a lot. That pen name was one I used to write about The Crystal Palace, with emphasis on adult fan fiction. For instance, the story about the Shen Yi sisters\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun interrupted him. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The fatty was frightened by the shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know about the adult fan fiction.\u201d Wang Chun gnashed his teeth and continued, \u201cYou only need to tell me about a certain fan fiction you wrote, the one that was even drawn as a comic. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Fatty appeared rather disappointed. \u201cThat work is not explosive enough. It was supposed to be adult fan fiction as well. However, in order to publish it as a comic, I was forced to delete a lot of indecent scenes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is precisely the version I am asking about,\u201d Wang Chun said with a fierce expression. \u201cIf you dare to mention anything else, I will instantly kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The fatty trembled in fear. \u201cLet me give it some thought\u2026 Which ones did I delete back then? It has been too long, I can\u2019t remember them anymore. However, I have numerous original copies here with me. Do you want to take a look at these instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty passed over his wristband while trembling.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cWristband?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the fatty explained, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to put this one on to use it. No internet connection is required either. It was modified by me into a single edition and can be used like a personal computer. Look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He turned the screen on. Next, a folder named \u201cstudies\u201d appeared. Within were numerous folders with names such as physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. A particular folder named biology was opened, and a world of porn appeared before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is only natural, right?\u201d the fatty said awkwardly. Within this folder were the numerous pieces of adult fan fiction he had written in the past, and the vast majority of them were focused on The Crystal Palace. There were nearly 20 works featuring the Shen Yi siblings as the main characters. When Wang Chun saw this, his complexion became ashen. One could only imagine his expression when he actually began searching through them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you with this?\u201d Chen Feng asked when he saw Wang Chun\u2019s unsightly expression.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun hastily stopped him. \u201cThere is no need for that.\u201d It was better for Chen Feng to not see the contents of these. Thus, he clenched his teeth and did the work personally. He read every single adult fan fiction pertaining to The Crystal Palace in here before finally locating what he was searching for. Naturally, having read everything, he did not appear well.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm, which character did you want to know about?\u201d When the fatty saw what Wang Chun was pointing at, he continued, \u201cOh, I remember now. This is the special edition I wrote after deleting a whole bunch of adult content and adding yuri content to get published back then. What do you guys want to ask about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Wang. What is the setting for her character?\u201d Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Fatty gave it some thought before saying, \u201cI gave her a tragic childhood, allowing her nature to undergo a great change, changing even her sexual orientation so as to keep her consistent with the worldview of the characters in this book. In the future, she and Ming Yue will love and hate each other, and after numerous fights, their misunderstandings will be solved and they will ultimately get together. Unfortunately, this book was dropped by the publishers before I could even finish it. They cited the indecent yuri content as \u2018immoral\u2019 or something. What the hell, right? Back then, they were the ones hinting at me to write yuri content.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty became furious as he thought about this.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turned out the two of them were in fact a couple?</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand now. Do you still have the script for the latter parts of the novel?\u201d Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. However, their misunderstanding is the core of the book. The two have known each other since they were young yet do not understand each other, resulting in their separation, and so on. I can still roughly remember the storyline,\u201d the fatty said.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent. Write it down and I will let you go,\u201d Chen Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was getting excited. He had initially thought that he would die today. Surprisingly, these kidnappers were actually fans of his past work. What a good feeling this was.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wang Chun thought of something. \u201cHold on. So you have never forgotten the setting for the character Shen Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty nodded. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun gnashed his teeth. \u201cIn other words, even if I hadn\u2019t read all this, you could still have told me about her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The fatty began to cry a tearless cry. \u201cBut earlier\u2026 you only said that you were looking for that book. I was assuming that you were merely looking to download a full copy of the story. That\u2019s why I directed you to the folder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe.\u201d Wang Chun was so infuriated that he started trembling. Earlier, he personally read nearly 20 books depicting Shen Yi being subjected to numerous experiences. Wang Chun was totally infuriated as he recalled what he had read. After one hour, Chen Feng and Wang Chun left smoothly. When they returned to the harem world, Chen Feng already had an idea for the future development of the two gods of this world. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the yuri arc began.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Wang Chun still had an unsightly expression on his face. In fact, his head looked rather green at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pitiful,\u201d Chen Feng lamented. \u201cThis is what you get for cultivating the world of an adult fan fiction as your ability.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He had to figure out for himself what exactly this so-called godhood ascension was. One could say that, for the resonance and apostle realms, the difference was the level of the godly power they could muster. Chen Feng was currently stuck and was not capable of advancing further. As such, he had to figure out what godhood meant.</p><br/><p>After godhood, how would one\u2019s strength continue to increase? And what exactly was it that determined whether one was a god or not? He had to figure that out.</p><br/><p>The minor god spoke honestly. \u201cIn this battle, you might be nothing but cannon fodder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \u201cNevertheless, I still have to try, right?\u201d Suddenly, he recalled something and asked, \u201cHow did you ascend to godhood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The minor god stayed silent for a long time before saying, \u201cI can\u2019t remember. It feels like\u2026 since the day my thoughts come into existence, I have been a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder this god was this weak.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng instinctively asked, \u201cWhat is the difference between a god and a normal life-form?\u201d If he could find an answer from this minor god, he would perhaps have more confidence.</p><br/><p>The minor god shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Among the millions upon millions of life-forms, their energy makeup and flesh are different. I don\u2019t have any understanding of that, and I have no basis from which to draw a conclusion. As for you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The minor god reached out with his hand, trying to cast his senses into Chen Feng\u2019s sea of consciousness. Unsurprisingly, he was unable to sense anything.</p><br/><p>The minor god shrugged. \u201cI still can\u2019t sense anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Chen Feng could only smile bitterly at this. He did not know if having this fake nascent soul good or bad. This nascent soul had provided him with might far surpassing his imagination, enabling him to challenge those of a higher realm. However, at the same time, the nascent soul had also severed his route of advancement. He could no longer become an apostle, become stronger. Perhaps\u2026 only godhood ascension would change this.</p><br/><p>The minor god paused. \u201cWait. I have some resources here. They were offerings from my past believers. I initially planned to use them on my apostle to increase his strength. Perhaps these resources can be of use to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The minor god handed the resources to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>The resources were comprised of numerous bizarre yet powerful fruits, medicinal herbs, and so on. After studying them for a bit, Chen Feng turned all of them into gene reagents. However, even though these items could be used by apostles, even after Chen Feng\u2019s gene production, the improvement they provided him was rather feeble. From level 10 resonance, he rose to level 12 resonance. With so many gene reagents, he had only obtained two levels.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was disappointed. He knew that his advancement would be harder and harder. However, one piece of good news for him was thus: as his miniature person had entered the great-circle stage, even though it was no longer capable of improving, the amplification effect it brought now was the cube of whatever level he was at. For instance, his present amplification effect was 12 times 12 times 12.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, after converting from resonance to apostle, I am roughly equivalent to a level 17 apostle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng clenched his fists tightly. He wasn\u2019t particularly powerful. However, every single bit of growth, however weak it was, would have a qualitative change after the amplification effect. As such, each level he gained brought about a rather astonishing effect. If he could advance by maybe a level or two\u2026 Chen Feng\u2019s heart trembled at the thought.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the gene reagents he had produced had not purely consisted of strength-increasing reagents. Half of them were actually reagents with various buffing or explosive effects. This was a battle he had to emerge victorious from.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While all this was happening, all the apostles that were planning to participate in the trial were making their respective preparations. Naturally, not a single one of them saw Chen Feng as an opponent. Rather, their sights were set on those comparatively powerful apostles, those gods\u2019 descendants. In all the past trials, the trials itself were the hardest part. This time, though, the trial would be the easiest; their competitors would be the actual problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cA trial activated by resonance will most definitely not be hard. Therefore, the difficulty of the trial itself can be neglected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Chen Feng\u2019s feat of challenging apostles as a resonator is rather astonishing, he is only capable of unleashing combat power equivalent to a level 10 apostle. He is negligible. Therefore, our opponents will be the other participants! Their strength\u2026 will most definitely not be simple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? There is no need, right? This is but a single battle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, you must ascend. I have a bad premonition, as if something is about to happen sometime soon. Therefore, before then, you must ascend as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>All the participants were preparing themselves. After seven days, countless apostles descended upon the Bamboo Isles. Zero also appeared out of thin air. Before the shocked gaze of numerous beings, he used a single hand to rip the sky apart, forcefully ripping half of the world and revealing an astonishing alien world behind the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, this is where the trial will be held.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The sky was ripped apart. Within the alien world that was revealed, a divine seat was faintly discernible. It flickered with a faint glow, showing clearly the tier of the seat being offered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it is the lowest tier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, countless apostles charged forth. They were all filled with excitement and expectation. They could not wait to immediately take on the trial. With Chen Feng\u2019s identity as a resonator, this trial activated for his sake would most definitely be the lowest rank of all. However, this would also be the easiest trial ever.</p><br/><p>What were the so-called godhood trials? They were, in fact, challenges toward the origin strength of the god who had previously occupied the position. If it was a high tiered seat, the trial would employ around 20% of the original god\u2019s strength. For apostles, this was extremely terrifying, an almost insurmountable trial. If it was a mid-tier seat, perhaps only around 10% of the original god\u2019s strength would be employed. As for a low-tier seat, perhaps only around 5% of the original god\u2019s strength would be employed. As for this seat before them, this was the lowest of the low, employing only around 1% of the original god\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>In other words, the mirror image of the god they had to face in this trial would possess only 1% of the original god\u2019s strength, an unspeakably weak amount. Therefore, nearly anyone could succeed in this trial. As such, they had to move as quickly as possible. As for their opponents, those would be the competitors around them, who were all aiming for the godhood.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Immediately after entering the alien world, the battle erupted.</p><br/><p>The apostles started fighting each other, not allowing anyone to get ahead of them. They exhausted everything they had to stop others from advancing while they themselves advanced. From the start, the battle was an extremely bitter one. Not far away, at the entrance of the alien world, Chen Feng was staring ahead blankly, not entering.</p><br/><p>The observers started talking about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. I suppose he is shocked at what he\u2019s witnessing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is understandable. After all, he probably never imagined that godhood trials would be so cruel, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, what a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a pity. If he gives up on this, he might be able to preserve his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was still some attention being focused on this unique trial-taker. However, unknown to all of them, Chen Feng was truly staring blankly because he was overly shocked. However, he was not shocked by the apostles. Rather, he was shocked by the alien world. Wasn\u2019t this world the Twin Horns World, where the Sin God had previously resided?</p><br/><p>In short\u2026 the so-called divine seat\u2026 Chen Feng\u2019s gaze landed on the center of the alien world, landing on that faintly glowing divine seat. His heart chilled. If his guess was correct, this seat\u2026 was the seat for the position of the Sin God! That was because, from his memories, there was only one god in the Twin Horns World.</p><br/><p>Wait, no. That did not seem quite right. Chen Feng was filled with doubt. A godhood trial should obviously be a trial for the godhood of a deceased god. Why would the divine seat of the Sin God be offered here? After all, he was the strongest god of this new era.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly have I misunderstood?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Them, the gods revered by countless beings, had actually been scammed?</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess spoke. \"I know of a person. The strongest human, Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Next, she projected everything Chen Feng had done into the air. After the other gods saw it, they understood thoroughly. Everyone sank into silence. Such a character, and those familiar methods\u2026</p><br/><p>A certain god raged. \"A mere human. When I return, I will eliminate all nine generations of his family.\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, it seems like we can no longer return.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the gods appeared bitter and astringent.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They all sank into silence. Anger? What was the point of getting angry now? They were no commoners; they were all able to instantly suppress their anger. However, as they looked at the twin-horns world before them, this desolate world, they wondered if they truly had to remain trapped here.</p><br/><p>A certain god suddenly said, \"This is not possible! I feel like there are some issues with this analysis. If this operation was truly problematic to begin with, how could it have gone unnoticed by the several thousand of us? Moreover, the method of returning\u2026 Granted, some gods are quite clumsy in nature. However, there are some who are extremely cautious as well. Therefore, there had to be some gods who immediately figured out a way to return the moment they arrived here. Those gods should have extracted memories pertaining to how to return the moment they arrived here. Perhaps that portal's collapse had nothing whatsoever to do with Chen Feng. Rather, it was the work of some gods that wished to trap us all?\" this god concluded, providing a new angle to consider this from.</p><br/><p>\"That is quite possible.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone sank into contemplation, finding this analysis to be more probable. True, how was it possible for several thousand gods here to all think of the same thing? How was it possible that not a single one of them had even bothered thinking about their return? Therefore, it was quite probable that there was a traitor in their midst! How could a mere mortal like Chen Feng be able to trick them, trick the gods?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a god spoke. \"Blackmount God. I recall noticing you doing something earlier.\"</p><br/><p>The Blackmount God did not deny that as he coldly said, \"Yes. The first thing I did after entering was kill a certain elder. After that, I tried searching his memories to look for information pertaining to the teleportation. However, nothing was found. Therefore, I assumed that perhaps the other gods had extracted the information pertaining to teleportation before me.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone had a pensive look. \"Indeed. Who else did the same thing immediately after arriving?\"</p><br/><p>Something like this could not be hidden from all the gods here. Therefore, it did not take long for some gods to start standing out. However, horrifying all of them, all the gods said the same thing. None of them had obtained any information pertaining to teleportation. Several thousand gods had searched for the information, yet not a single one of them had obtained it?</p><br/><p>\"Are you all kidding me?\" the Slaughter God asked furiously.</p><br/><p>\"They are not lying,\" said the Deceit God. \"I can't feel any lies from these fellows, nor any godly power fluctuations.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>All the gods sank into silence. Was this clue a dead end as well? Suddenly, the truth of things became fuzzy. Was this the work of Chen Feng, or was it some traitor? Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>A certain god spoke suddenly. \"I have an idea. Regardless of who the culprit is, Chen Feng or a traitor, we only need to focus on returning. Thus, does the local god here have any teleportation or spatial abilities? I feel like our only hope lies in him.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone realized that this was indeed the truth. So long as they found that god, everything would be solved.</p><br/><p>\"Go.\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances before once again heading toward that god.</p><br/><p>At this time, Chen Feng was chatting up Kong Bai and the rest at the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>\"What do you think those gods will do?\"</p><br/><p>\"What else?\" Qin Hai said expressionlessly. \"They will probably go looking for the local god. That is their only hope. Naturally, the result for that will only serve to bring them into further despair.\"</p><br/><p>Since they had decided to act, they had certainly acted thoroughly.</p><br/><p>The things Qin Hai had done when he had entered the twin-horns world previously had severed all possibilities of further teleportation. With the assistance of luck, all possibilities had been easily destroyed. Not a single god would be able to return to this world. They would struggle and fight each other until, finally, the leftover gods started competing over the little amount of faith that world contained.</p><br/><p>Everyone was there. At this time, as Chen Feng guessed, the gods there had finally reached their destination. There, a god slumbered. They did not need to even awaken that god. From the first moment their gazes land on that god, their hearts chilled. That was because the aura of this god was so weak that it was almost negligible. This was clearly a low-tier god, a minor and new god that was not even qualified to have a title attached to his name.</p><br/><p>\"Try asking him.\"</p><br/><p>They forced the god awake.</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\"</p><br/><p>The god looked around at his tiny world blankly. For so many gods that were more powerful than him to have suddenly appeared here, he nearly collapsed emotionally. \"You\u2026 who are you guys?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you have any information about teleportation?\" asked one of the strongest gods there while he was radiating a faint aura capable of causing one's heart to flutter.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes I have,\" the minor god answered in fear. However, before they could even feel any joy from his answer, the god started giving off several names. These were all the elders of the twin-horns race. \"These people, all of them know about teleportation.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"They are all dead. The data pertaining to teleportation has vanished as well.\"</p><br/><p>All the gods were speechless.</p><br/><p>\"If so, there is no longer any information pertaining to teleportation here. All I have ever done here is sleep. Everything was handed over to them.\"</p><br/><p>The minor god was collapsing emotionally.</p><br/><p>All the other gods: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>As of this moment, they all realized with great sorrow that they had truly been trapped here. All these illustrious gods had to be trapped on such a tiny world?</p><br/><p>\"I know of a certain person who knows about teleportation,\" the minor god said after giving it some thought. \"Based on what the elders reported to me previously, Chen Feng once arrived on this world. He is also the only human who has successfully left this world. Perhaps you guys can\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The gods were so angered that they started coughing up blood. Chen Feng! Again! How could they still not understand? All this was a trap set by that damnable human, Chen Feng!</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng!\"</p><br/><p>Their grievances surged to the sky. Never had they hated a single mortal so much.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2026 can no longer return?\"</p><br/><p>After giving it some thought, their fear intensified. They could no longer return! This was the scariest of all!</p><br/><p>The gods here had recently awakened and had little godly power at their disposal. The only reason they had even come here was in order to kill the Sin God and obtain his godly power to aid their own recovery. Who could have expected that they would end up trapped here? The moment their godly power dried up, they would probably\u2026</p><br/><p>No! I don't want to fall into slumber yet again!</p><br/><p>A certain god pointed at the minor local god and asked, \"Hey, come. How many people do you have on this world?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not much,\" the minor god said in horror. \"Some of them have already been killed by you guys. At this moment, there are around a hundred thousand of them. Please don't kill me. If you guys need faith, I can convert it all to you guys.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>The gods' eyes shone. Among the gods trapped here, some were still filled with remorse, while some had yet to recover from their shock. There were also some who had already started setting their sights on the inhabitants here. If they couldn't return, they had no choice but to fight over the twin-horns members.</p><br/><p>They believed that so long as they survived, they would be able to last long enough, until the day came where the twin-horns race once again found passage back to their home world. Since they had been able to discover the methods of teleporting once, they would most certainly be able to do it once again after some time. They only needed to survive until that day arrived. And before the arrival of that day, they would require a never-ending supply of faith and godly power.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Their gazes landed on the living beings of this planet. When they once again looked at each other, hostility was apparent in their eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was no longer capable of keeping up with Chen Feng strengthwise. When Chen Feng broke through to the true god stage, they would not be able to hide the fluctuations from the breakthrough from Luo Yuan. A casual investigation would reveal the truth about Chen Feng. Next, the anger Luo Yuan had accumulated over several decades would most certainly result in a huge battle.</p><br/><p>What would the odds be like in a battle between Chen Feng, as a new true god, and Luo Yuan, a veteran true god? Duma was unsure.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng suddenly recalled what he had wanted to said before this suicide. \u201cThere is still one godly power I have yet to fuse with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Duma was clearly still stuck on the previous topic. The next day, Chen Feng brought them and visited a unique existence: the Forest Goddess. That\u2019s right. It was precisely this Forest Goddess that had been completely neutral and hadn\u2019t gotten involved in the affairs of the world at all. In Ye\u2019s era, Chen Feng\u2019s era, and the subsequent era of Luo Yuan, the Forest Goddess had never become anyone\u2019s enemy and had never thought of getting involved with any party.</p><br/><p>This was how she had stayed alive until today. In Chen Feng\u2019s eyes, this person had always been an enigmatic existence. Naturally, he did not realize that as far as the Forest Goddess was concerned, he was the enigmatic one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are actually still alive?\u201d She didn\u2019t dare to believe this. Given Luo Yuan\u2019s strength, how could anyone hide the fact that they were still alive from him?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. I have merely been maintaining a low profile,\u201d Chen Feng said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess shook her head and sighed. Indeed, none of these fellows were simple existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was aware that since Chen Feng had come, he definitely had something he needed from her. When Luo Yuan had visited, he had requested her godly power. She had given him what he wanted, as she had known the price she needed to pay if she wanted to remain free in this land.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need your godly power,\u201d Chen Feng said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe basic version?\u201d the Forest Goddess said with a faint smile. What Luo Yuan had wanted was merely her type of godly power as part of his collection. As such, she had given him the basic version of her godly power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is fine.\u201d Chen Feng paused, then coughed and added, \u201cNaturally, it would be even better if you could give me an updated portion of your godly power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An updated version of her godly power was in fact quite an excessive request. One ought to know that with this request, the Forest Goddess would have to duplicate a copy of the entirety of her present power.</p><br/><p>She shook her head. \u201cFine.\u201d After all, this was not the first time she had met Chen Feng, though their relationship had never been a harmonious one. However, compared to the era of Luo Yuan, she much preferred the era of Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>She stretched out her hand. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Boundless godly power converged around Chen Feng. One after another, the power unique to the Forest Goddess appeared. This was the terrifying power of the only peak major god that had survived from the Primordial Era to the present era.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The surging power charged at Chen Feng. Chen Feng realized how strong the Forest Goddess was. He was made aware of how lucky he had been when he first crossed swords with her back then.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He was totally submerged in the godly power of the forest. Fortunately, Chen Feng was not the same as before. With 100,000 godly powers within him, he had quite a lot of endurance. As such, he was able to take on this intense godly power.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Gradually, the godly power calmed down. At this instant, the power within Chen Feng finally reached a certain summit after undergoing numerous transformations. His next point of growth was the point where he would enter the true god realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t grow anymore.\u201d His gaze was sharp. The only way he could grow further was by breaking through. After fusing with the godly power of forest, the barrier that seemed to have been obstructing him appeared to have blurred. Chen Feng had a feeling that so long as he wished so, he would be able to enter the true god stage anytime he wished.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you neutral?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng couldn\u2019t help but have a sense of respect toward this goddess. He had never expected that, during his crucial moment, it would be this Forest Goddess that provided him with this crucial aid. One ought to know that even when Luo Yuan came, she only gave him a small amount of a basic version of her godly power.</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess chuckled. \u201cTrue neutrality does not exist\u2026 So-called \u2018neutrality\u2019 is merely a position one assumes to gain better conditions, a position one assumes before discovering the proper person to put one\u2019s weight behind. Now I have found that person.\u201d As she finished her words, she looked at Chen Feng silently. Chen Feng instantly understood her motivation.</p><br/><p>He expressed his gratitude earnestly. \u201cMany thanks.\u201d Next, he left speedily. There was no helping that. Even though this senior Forest Goddess appeared so young, she was, in fact, incredibly old. Perhaps she had chosen Chen Feng due to his character. The gaze she had looked at Chen Feng with had been filled with kindness, greatly resembling the old granny that used to take care of him.</p><br/><p>What else he could do but run? However, shortly after leaving the Forest Goddess\u2019s territory, a servant of hers came bearing a message. \u201cI sensed the power of misfortune and luck in your body. I don\u2019t know why you have three godhoods in you; however, be aware that the moment you become a true god, all these godhoods will vanish, leaving behind only a single godhood, the single divine seat of a true god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s heart trembled. So these divine seats would all vanish? Suddenly, Chen Feng realized something. It would not matter if his or the Luck Goddess\u2019s divine seat vanished. However, if the Misfortune Goddess\u2019s divine seat vanished and returned to the world and was subsequently obtained by Luo Yuan, his strength would\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be so.\u201d His head ached. In short, if he wanted to become a true god to face Luo Yuan, he had to take the risk of Luo Yuan being able to obtain full control over the world at any time?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the rate of ascension on Luo Yuan\u2019s side?\u201d Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cA huge bunch of them ascend every single day.\u201d Duma rubbed his head. \u201cBased on the present speed, the moment the godhood of misfortune becomes available, it will reappear in no less than three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short\u2026 I will only have three days.\u201d Chen Feng sank into silence.</p><br/><p>Duma shook his head. \u201cNot quite. Three days is merely the maximum length of time you might have. It is also possible that the instant you break through, the godhood of misfortune will reappear, allowing Luo Yuan instant control over this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They seemed to have stumbled upon their biggest problem yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will happen once he controls the entire world?\u201d Chen Feng asked with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings will get very dangerous.\u201d Duma shook his head. \u201cTrue godhood is the highest stage of godhood. World controller signifies an entirely different realm\u2026 It signifies the realm of an existence such as the Creation God. In that realm, all living beings are under one\u2019s control. Every flower, every tree, every blade of grass, every single life-form, every inch of soil, every single god, and every single godly power. If one wishes to, the entire world can be destroyed with a mere thought.\u201d Duma finished his explanation expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and the rest sank into silence. So a world controller was actually so scary?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me if I have broken into the true-god stage?\u201d Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Duma smiled bitterly. \u201c\u2026You will still be under his control.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the case. Chen Feng sighed. It was no wonder that Luo Yuan was ignoring everything and focusing solely on gaining full control over the world. The so-called mysterious person and the Forest Goddess were existences he couldn\u2019t care less about, because there was no need to care.</p><br/><p>So long as the godhood of misfortune reappeared, he would become the world controller. Mysterious person? Enemy? True god? Mere jokes. Was Luo Yuan stupid? No, he had never been stupid.</p></div>\n</div>"}

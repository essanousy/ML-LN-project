Alas, after looking at Chen Feng's condition, he could only shake his head.</p><br/><p>Duma sighed. \"This power\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president was anxious. \"Even you can't help him?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Shock was apparent in Duma's eyes. After scanning Chen Feng's body attentively, he could only share a bitter smile. \"In his body, traces of a god can be seen.\"</p><br/><p>At this, the pupils of the deputy president and others shrunk. \"A god\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Duma sighed. \"That's right. A god. Resonators are appearing without stop. Unexpectedly, the first god has awoken as well. Moreover, this god is in fact the Luck Goddess.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president could not understand. \"Why were her eyes set on Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>Duma contemplated and said, \"Perhaps it was due to the continuous miracles that Chen Feng created. Chen Feng is an incomparably talented youth with incomparable luck as well. Perhaps this is why the Luck Goddess set her eyes on him.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest were completely confused. Was it not a good thing to have the Luck Goddess's attention on oneself?</p><br/><p>Duma shook his head. \"If one had the attention of a complete Luck Goddess, it would naturally be a good thing. However, the newly awakened Luck Goddess clearly doesn't have her full strength yet. As such, she has to absorb sufficient power to recover\u2026 Take a guess, for the Luck Goddess to recover her godly power, what does she need to absorb?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest inhaled a mouthful of breath in shock.</p><br/><p>\"Could it be\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Duma sighed. \"That's right. Luck. Perhaps this is why Chen Feng caught her attention. He was so lucky that it was heaven defying.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest blanked. Gods\u2026 those gods were actually such existences?</p><br/><p>\"How could this happen\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Duma smiled bitterly. \"Kind gods do not exist. Think of the gods as even more powerful humans. Some are good, and some are evil, and they all have their own emotions, desires, and even ambitions. As for the Luck Goddess\u2026 if not for a certain existence keeping her in check back then\u2026\" Duma stared ahead. \"Since she has already awoken, perhaps the time has also come for the existence that was responsible for keeping her in check to awaken as well\u2026 The legendary... Misfortune Goddess.\"</p><br/><p>Misfortune\u2026</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest exchanged glances, startled. This goddess, from her name alone, did not seem like a god one could easily get along with.</p><br/><p>The deputy president was still worried about Chen Feng. \"How about Chen Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Duma pondered and said, \"Let him stay at the Gene Production Association. His achievements have been way too conspicuous. If this had happened in the past, it would not matter. Now that his luck has been fully absorbed, his situation is way too dangerous. It would be the best for him to stay at the Gene Production Association. Keep the happenings of today a secret and protect him as best as you guys can. We can slowly think of a way to reinstate his abilities.\"</p><br/><p>\"Fine.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest exchanged glances and agreed that this was the only option. They tried their best to hide this incident.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the appearance of the Luck Goddess had caused too big of a scene, causing everyone to find out that Chen Feng had indeed been crippled.</p><br/><p>\"Have you heard? Chen Feng seems to have been crippled?\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that for real?\"</p><br/><p>\"How is that not real? The lover of the daughter-in-law of the husband of the lover of my brother is a member of the Genetic Union. This is absolutely true. It is said that Chen Feng was carried away.\"</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit, who did it?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea, but I heard it was a god.\"</p><br/><p>\"!!!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon, the news that Chen Feng had been crippled spread online as well. From that astonishing radiance, the aura of a god, and the resonators that confirmed this fact, everyone was startled to find that it was indeed true. The number one human, Chen Feng, had truly been crippled. The entire world was shaken.</p><br/><p>\"I heard it was a god.\"</p><br/><p>\"God damn it, what are those gods planning to do?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know. But I heard that during the Primordial Era, gods were everywhere. Now that the resonators have appeared, I suppose more and more gods will appear as well\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"But why did they target Chen Feng? He was a legend among us humans.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone talked about this. A majority of them were furious about it and felt that this was too much of a pity. Due to Chen Feng's unique identity and the myriad contributions he had made toward humanity, even after being crippled, he was still completely incomparable as a legend of humanity.</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully he can wake up soon enough.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, for this to have happened\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it. One day I will beat up all these gods\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Count me in.\"</p><br/><p>The internet was talking about this without stop.</p><br/><p>While the entire world was talking about him, slowly, Chen Feng woke up. He stretched his hands out, then cast his senses inward only to find that his entire body felt empty. All his power, all his abilities, were gone.</p><br/><p>Myriad Illusions\u2026</p><br/><p>Nethergaze\u2026</p><br/><p>God Punisher\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything!</p><br/><p>Although these abilities had been his to begin with, they had all been obtained using the illusory world of Luck Aura as the base. Therefore, when his illusory world collapsed, everything vanished with it. He sank his consciousness into his own body. Only a blank piece of nothingness could be found. The illusory world was indeed no more.</p><br/><p>\"My strength\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, trying to sense his present strength. He was still a level-three awakened. No growth and no abilities. He was probably the weakest level-three awakened in existence, perhaps even weaker than those master producers of the Gene Production Association, since they could at least use genetic abilities. As for Chen Feng, he had nothing.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng clenched his fists tightly. \"Luck Goddess\u2026\"</p><br/><p>You have not only taken my Luck Aura, you have also taken my illusory world?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was sure that with the Luck Goddess's strength, if she had wanted to only absorb his Luck Aura, she could have done so. But this damnable woman had even absorbed his illusory world, the very foundation of all his abilities!</p><br/><p>\"B*tch!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. Even after fusing with Spirit, fusing with all her innocence and goodness, it was still not sufficient to balance out the so-called ambition of a god, how much of an asshole she was. It was no wonder that Thomas and the rest had all called her a b*tch.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spread both his hands wide. \"In short\u2026 I am truly a cripple now?\" For the first time, he felt so weak. Such strength\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hu\u2014\"</p><br/><p>He stood up. At present, he was in a special-grade ward in the Genetic Union. The environment was extremely quiet, with only a screen beside him. On the screen was data left behind for him by the deputy president. It detailed everything Duma had said as well as the progress of everything that had happened so far.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"Stay with the Gene Production Association?\" Impossible.</p><br/><p>He was very clear on how terrifying the future would be. Therefore, he could not give up just like that. He had to recover his strength, even without Luck Aura. As long as he could recover his previous strength, it would be sufficient.</p><br/><p>\"Even without Luck Aura, if I erupt fully and enter pseudo-resonance mode, I will still be sufficiently strong.\"</p><br/><p>This was his confidence. In any case, he hadn't really used Luck Aura since the upgrade started. With his very own strength, he had also opened a wide path for himself. As such, how could he allow that b*tch to destroy everything he had built?</p><br/><p>I must become strong! I cannot stop here!</p><br/><p>The first person he contacted was Kong Bai. \"Kong Bai, can you come over?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai shrugged. \"No.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled bitterly. \"The deputy president told me about you. I also visited you before. I know that you want me to take you transmigrating. If this were any other day, I would definitely do it, regardless of the low probability of success. However, your strength\u2026\" Kong Bai shook his head. After pondering the matter, Kong Bai decided to say, \"With your present state, if you can't recover after around two or three transmigrations, you will definitely die. On top of that, Duma has something he wants me to tell you.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>With some difficulty, Kong Bai said, \"Rest at ease behind the frontlines. If the Luck Goddess is your opponent, victory is impossible. Regardless of how many times we transmigrate, we will not be able to transmigrate back to the past, to the correct point in time to change this.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

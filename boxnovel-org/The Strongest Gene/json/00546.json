The information from the mysterious seal was gradually revealed clearly in Chen Feng's mind. This was a completely brand-new energy operating system, an original energy operating system created by Bi Quzhi.</p><br/><p>Shroud Art\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. He had never expected that Bi Quzhi had truly perfected this. He had also never expected that before the demise of Gou Li's group, they would truly pass this on to him. However, although all the data and inheritance were already in Chen Feng's mind, with a single look, Chen Feng was already aware that this was something he could not afford to use. Every single use of this technique would require one to pay one's own vitality as a cost.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was as Gou Li had said. When this technique was improved or encountered its fated owner, it would be able to once again display its true power to the world.</p><br/><p>Li Lei seemed to covet it. \"This thing\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"You have been thinking too much,\" Chen Feng grumbled. \"This is a spatial barrier, something produced specifically to counter Lu Hun. As such, it can only be useful against someone with an ability like Lu Hun's. As for the cost of using this technique, haven't you seen it for yourself?\"</p><br/><p>\"Fine.\" Li Lei could only give up on his thoughts. They stared ahead. There, the figures of Lu Hun, Gou Li, and the others were already gone. Here in this corner of the unknown region, only their group was left behind. On the ground, there were still several ancient race corpses remaining.</p><br/><p>Someone laughed bitterly. \"We have still ultimately failed our initial mission.\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\"</p><br/><p>At this, they recalled the reason they had ended up here in the first place: the devil race.</p><br/><p>In their initial plan, they were supposed to put an end to the \"major boss\" of the devil race and plunder the S-class genes from that \"major boss\" in order to break through the present limit of humanity. How had it changed into a battle to the death with Lu Hun, then?</p><br/><p>Oh, yeah. Because of that pee. They all recalled the scene they had seen.</p><br/><p>Li Lei spread his hands. \"What should we do?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone smiled bitterly. \"What else? We failed.\"</p><br/><p>With their present strength, facing that legendary S-class expert was no different than courting death. It was quite probable that even with all of them, they wouldn't be able to do much against that expert. How were they supposed to battle a person of such strength?</p><br/><p>\"What if we return and request reinforcements?\" someone proposed.</p><br/><p>Li Lei shook his head. \"It would still be useless. That fellow is much stronger than you even in your wildest dreams. Unless humanity is prepared to lose a huge amount of beyond A classes, it is impossible for humanity to face that fellow head-on.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was in a heavy mood. Could they kill that S-class fellow off? Yes, they could. But what would be the price for that? A huge amount of beyond A classes would fall. Could humanity afford such a cost? Yes, the blood essence of an S class was a precious item. However, this did not mean that after defeating that ancient race fellow, humanity would definitely enter S class. Rather, with this blood essence, humanity would only be able to start researching S class\u2026 That was all. This research might be a success, but it might be a failure as well.</p><br/><p>Li Lei sighed. \"Forget it.\" It was too risky. At present, humanity couldn't afford to take such a risk.</p><br/><p>Someone was anxious. \"If we really let that fellow off just like that, what if he were to enter human territory in the future?\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei sneered. \"He is welcome to try. If we tried hunting him down here, we would have to pay a huge price, but if the battle were to happen in human territory, hehe\u2026 The Research Agency has a huge number of high-energy equipment that we can't bring along during this trip due to that equipment being hard to move. If that fellow dares to step foot into human territory, hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The rest exchanged glances. Only after hearing this did they heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>They stood up. \"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei turned his screen on and opened the mission interface system. Just as he was about to submit the failure of this mission, Chen Feng suddenly walked over and said, \"Says who that we have failed the mission?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone stopped what they had been doing. Li Lei's astonished gaze landed on Chen Feng. \"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pondered the matter. \"Mhm\u2026 although we are not a match for that expert\u2026 Please hold on.\" </p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash of red, a pitch-black and bizarre figure appeared and streaked across the air in a perfect curve before smashing into the ground. Devil race? The expressions of the others all sank. However, when they get a clear look at this new arrival, their expressions became somewhat odd. Indeed, this was a devil. However\u2026 the devil that had appeared here was rather unique. This was the very cause for the failure of their mission, the one who had caused this failure. This was the young prince of the devil race.</p><br/><p>One of them was shocked. \"Urine\u2026 Urine God?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the young prince's expression immediately darkened.</p><br/><p>\"When did you kidnap this fellow?\" Li Lei exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed happily. \"When we were being chased by that boss of the devil race.\" When that expert had been chasing them, Chen Feng had told Xiao Ying to kidnap this young prince, taking the advantage of the fact that everyone's attention was concentrated on these humans at that time\u2026</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>What flawless execution. And the reason for kidnapping this prince was to prevent the devil race expert from using this young prince as a summoning tool to complete the restoration of all the other big shots of the devil race who were still slumbering. To prevent this, kidnapping was the only option. But then, how should they deal with this prince now? This was rather troublesome.</p><br/><p>Li Lei frowned. \"How should we deal with this?\" This fellow had an esteemed identity as the young prince of the devil race and also the future of the devil race. However, this fact would only remain true before the restoration of all the true experts of the devil race. To allow that expert from earlier to be awakened in advance, that old devil had used such a unique method to complete the summon. Evidently, this young prince was not someone they had intended to keep around for long. The relationship between the devils and this young prince had long been severed.</p><br/><p>The present young devil prince was someone completely worthless to both the humans and devils. Using the prince to threaten the devils? They would most probably be ignored. Killing this young prince? It would be somewhat of a waste, though. It was truly astonishing how this glorious devil prince had now become baggage. Li Lei's head ached.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled toyingly. \"His true worth is not in his identity as a prince. Have you all forgotten the reason for the failure of our mission this time? I am rather curious about how amazing the urine of this dear young prince here is. If we can research it properly and try to solve our problem from a different perspective, then perhaps\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes shone. Indeed, the advanced awakening of that expert was closely related to this young prince. Why was it possible for that expert to be awakened in advance? Why had that expert been filled with the smell of urine? What secrets were there within this young prince's body? If they could answer all these questions and reverse engineer it, then perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" Li Lei stood up emotionally.</p><br/><p>The rest had burning gazes as well.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Their gazes landed on the young prince uniformly. Instinctively, their gazes lowered toward the young prince's crotch.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2026 are you guys planning to do?\" The young prince covered his crotch and hid in a certain corner, trembling with fear. He had a feeling that compared with these humans, he was the weaker life-form instead while these terrifying humans were the actual devils.</p><br/><p>\"Hehehehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Perverse laughter resounded as several burly humans started dragging the young prince into the dark\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although only half of the world was under Luo Yuan\u2019s control, this half of the world was the center of the planet, the largest continuous region in the world. The dense aura emanating from this civilization shone brightly upon various hidden life-forms.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to have gotten even stronger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the 100,000 gods rebelled, I thought his era would end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Who could have guessed this result?\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless life-forms sighed. Luo Yuan was too powerful, to the point that everyone despaired at his strength. A lot of the life-forms lived in constant fear, even ones that weren\u2019t living within the region ruled by Luo Yuan. Everyone was afraid that one day, this part of the world would be conquered by Luo Yuan as well, subjecting them to lives worse than death.</p><br/><p>They were all waiting for a powerful existence to rescue them. Alas, the hero they hoped to see never arrived. What did arrive was an odd and mysterious person. He was clothed fully in black, and his appearance couldn\u2019t be seen clearly. He appeared in region after region, challenging various gods without stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cChallenging gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is he planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the present world, everyone is bitterly cultivating to become stronger. Why is someone triggering internal strife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could not understand his purpose. However, they couldn\u2019t reject his challenges. Once, a god rejected the challenge. As a result, the black-clothed man chased after him just to beat him up, putting him in an awkward conundrum.</p><br/><p>Thus, they had no choice but to accept the challenges. Fortunately, that black-clothed man did not seem to have any intention of killing them. Even after challenging numerous gods, not a single one had been killed. From minor gods to journeyman gods, every god was challenged. After all, the gods in this part of the world were from the earlier era, and they were rather low in amount. After the black-clothed man finished here, he moved on to the part of the world ruled by Luo Yuan. This was the moment the various life-forms not under Luo Yuan\u2019s rule were shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually went to Luo Yuan\u2019s territory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gods there are somewhat terrifying, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about their strength; the main issue is their number. Moreover, Luo Yuan is there as well. If the black-clothed man ends up captured, things will be truly dangerous for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this instant, countless life-forms had their gazes focused on Luo Yuan\u2019s empire. What exactly was that mysterious person trying to do? Soon, that mysterious person began to challenge the 100,000 gods there. Regardless of whether or not they accepted his challenge, he would charge forth and deliver the challenged party a beating, forcing them into a fight.</p><br/><p>Such a brutish and idiotic method shocked the life-forms not under Luo Yuan\u2019s rule.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas this guy gone crazy? Does he think that he is still in the other half of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoing this in Luo Yuan\u2019s territory will attract Luo Yuan\u2019s attention. At that time, I reckon he will die without even realizing how it happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless people were alarmed. Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t long before even Luo Yuan took notice of this person. His first impression was that this fellow was courting death. Luo Yuan did not care about the lives of the gods under him. However, he could not tolerate others messing about in his domain. His plan could not be messed up by some troublemaker.</p><br/><p>He had spent thirty years bitterly nurturing gods and was already in a bad mood. As such, he would not allow anyone to create trouble. This lasted until he heard the slogan the mysterious person seemingly yelled all the time. In the course of the mysterious person\u2019s challenges, these were the only words he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a god. My goal is to ascend to godhood. You are all gods with trashy godhoods. If I ascend, I will most definitely ascend to a higher-tier godhood. Thus, before that, I shall first defeat you trash gods as proof to myself and as a drive to make myself stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words spread, countless people were alarmed. So this fellow was not a god yet? Could it be that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we had known that earlier, we would have kept him on our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapable of challenging a god without being a god? After ascending, he will be at least a major god. If he receives specialized care, he will probably be able to challenge even Luo Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. How did we allow him to go over to Luo Yuan\u2019s territory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? This fellow is quite an idiot. He kept silent while he was here. The moment he arrived on Luo Yuan\u2019s side, he started yelling his slogan. How excessive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Luo Yuan will most certainly kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all deeply worried. They knew that they had probably missed their sole chance. However, surprising them all, Luo Yuan did not kill this person. On the contrary, he actually allowed his subordinate gods to accept the challenge one by one. He even issued an order saying that each of them had to accept the challenge at least once.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this was Luo Yuan\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigher-tier godhood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan smiled. He knew that what he had been waiting thirty years for might have finally arrived. Perhaps he had been looking in the wrong direction all along. Only those that were powerful enough, such as this mysterious person or that Chen Feng, would be qualified to challenge the godhood of misfortune. Perhaps this was the way to go about it.</p><br/><p>Since that fellow wanted to challenge gods, Luo Yuan would allow it. Moreover, in order to ensure that his Luck Aura would not interrupt the arrival of the godhood of misfortune, Luo Yuan made sure to not get involved in anything regarding that person. Naturally, he also had to ensure that the challenger stayed alive. Thus, with Luo Yuan\u2019s secret protection, Chen Feng\u2019s journey of challenges proceeded incredibly smoothly.</p><br/><p>Nearly 100,000 gods were challenged by Chen Feng. This was incredibly smooth. It far surpassed even Chen Feng\u2019s own imagination. In his original plan, he had expected Luo Yuan to not get involved after yelling those words. Unexpectedly, the anxious Luo Yuan had decided to help him in his growth. How perfect.</p><br/><p>Indeed, his decision to die had been the correct one. If he had merely escaped or gone missing, with Luo Yuan\u2019s character, the moment a mysterious challenger appeared, Luo Yuan would have been filled with suspicions. Only by truly dying for thirty years had Luo Yuan finally forgotten about him. Even when a mysterious person appeared, it never crossed Luo Yuan\u2019s mind that this might be Chen Feng, merely the appearance of a talented person.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was filled with gratitude toward Luo Yuan. At present, the strength within him was off the charts. After all, he had over 100,000 godly powers contained within him. With the fusion of the fake nascent soul, a brand new power would be formed. At present, both luck and misfortune were working overtime, and the fake nascent soul was surrounded by various powers. Evidently, the digestion of these powers was still going on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \u201cI have a feeling. I am about to break through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Break through? Their hearts trembled. Chen Feng was already a major god. If he were to break through, he would be a true god! As they thought of this, their eyes shone. In other words, the moment Chen Feng was done fusing all the new godly powers he had gained, he could probably gain comprehension of the profoundness of a true god and truly become a true god.</p><br/><p>That progress was quite logical. After all, he had absorbed more than 100,000 godly powers encompassing all aspects of life. Wouldn\u2019t the combination of all these powers be equivalent to a true god?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \u201cStill\u2026 lacking something.\u201d He had an uncomfortable feeling, as if the path had been open but was now covered by a barrier. \u201cPerhaps\u2026 I should look for\u2026\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Duma appeared. \u201cHold on. Xiao Yue sent me here to do something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed as he heard this. Xiao Yue would only look for him for one single reason.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng committed suicide. After a long time, Duma resurrected once again him. However, this time around, the resurrection took a very long time. It nearly failing toward the end. Even after the resurrection, Chen Feng had a pale expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can continue doing this.\u201d Duma sighed. \u201cA trace of a true god\u2019s aura is already contained within you. When you are done with the fusion, I will no longer be able to resurrect you. At that time, any death will be a true death.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

When that streak first flashed past, they merely looked over purely due to curiosity. Only when they felt the pain coming from their wrists did they become aware of what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move my hand anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis communicator seems to have buried itself in my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were alarmed. With shock, they found that even gods could not avoid this. Something had entered their bodies from the communicator and was spreading toward the internals of their body, controlling them.</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>The spread continued until, ultimately, all of them were kneeling on the ground, welcoming the arrival of that streak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething is off about this communicator\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are all under control now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were furious. They had merely been curious about the communicators and thus had used them. Unexpectedly, the communicators were now their greatest weakness.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Some were extremely decisive, chopping their limbs off without hesitation before that power could spread. They would rather expend some energy to reconstruct their body than be controlled.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Quite a number of gods did the same thing. Some of them hesitated somewhat, but during that short moment of hesitation, their bodies completely fell under the devices\u2019 control. When they finally decided to chop their limbs off, they couldn\u2019t do it anymore. A certain power was seemingly preventing them from doing so. This power had originated from the communicators.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Such a power actually exists?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all fearful and angry at the same time. Nobody was sure if such a controlling power existed for real. Even if it existed, it should be filled with weaknesses. The stronger the controlling power, the greater the limitations should be. Unfortunately, they had voluntarily delivered themselves to the devices.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we have been so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>They looked at the wristbands they were wearing and could only smile bitterly. If they had known this earlier, they would never touch the humans\u2019 communicators. However, who could have guessed that this would happen?</p><br/><p>Not only the almighty gods. The ancients and various other races with intelligence were using variations of the wristband communicator as well.</p><br/><p>These wristbands were all custom-made for them by the Stormtech Company. After Ye\u2019s death, the entire world had entered a period of peace. As such, nearly all life-forms were now equipped with their own communicator wristbands. And now, nearly all of the life-forms here were kneeling down.</p><br/><p>This was kneeling in the truest sense, the type of kneel signifying the greatest submission. One could kneel down voluntarily or one could be forced by the communicator to kneel. Either way, it no longer mattered. Unlike the various life-forms that were all fearful, most of the humans were more confused than afraid. What exactly was going on?</p><br/><p>Stormtech Company was a name nearly every human knew. Whenever there was a disaster, this company would be the first to appear to provide aid. As such, this was the company with the greatest reputation among humans. This was also the undisputed number-one technology company in the world.</p><br/><p>And thus, the Genetic Union had accorded them the highest authority, and the Research Agency had supplied them with the greatest amount of resources. They had agreed tacitly that the Stormtech Company would be the next greatest faction of this world after them.</p><br/><p>This company that had always been low profile, that had always treated everyone with sincerity, was liked by all. The communicator wristbands created by them had also benefited all of humanity.</p><br/><p>And yet the wristbands were in fact a trap? How was this possible? When they had felt the pain coming from their wrists, a vast majority of humans had assumed that it was merely some bug. They had merely thought that they should get a replacement from Stormtech Co.</p><br/><p>This had lasted until they saw everyone else around them kneeling on the ground as well. Only then did they realized that something had happened. This was especially true when they received the \u201cI have returned\u201d message on their wristbands. Luo Yuan? Some humans who recalled what had happened in the past were now filled with fear. Could it be that he had not yet forgotten that incident?</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The radiance surrounding the silhouette intensified. Every life-form raised their head, awaiting the arrival of that silhouette.</p><br/><p>At this moment, when that immense silhouette entered the atmosphere and started his descent, his figure became clear. He was precisely Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am back,\u201d he faintly said. With the communicator, this sentence was spread worldwide. Everyone\u2019s heart throbbed. It was him, truly him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were all alarmed. They all recognized this person. It wasn\u2019t that they recognized Luo Yuan. Rather, the aura of the silhouette from before was exactly the same as the aura this person was radiating. This was the aura of the person who had fought Ye to the point that both were gravely injured, the guy that had supposedly been left behind by the Creation God?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not the bright silhouette. The Creation God would not allow his subordinate to do something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods were fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Luo Yuan laughed heartily. \u201cGods? Mere jokes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He raised his hand. Instantly, the few gods that had questioned him crumbled apart. A force of immense power seemed to have emerged from within their bodies, instantly enveloping the entirety of their bodies and destroying them. For a moment, every life-form was in a daze.</p><br/><p>What he had just killed so easily with a casual wave of his hand were gods. How was that possible? The various gods were utterly shocked. It was at this moment that they realized how scary the wristbands stuck on them were. At the thought of this, their hearts felt heavy, filled with regret. If they had known this earlier, they would have severed their limbs and fled without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Alas, it was too late. The gods were forced to submit. As for the various races, they were forced to submit as well. If even gods had submitted, what option did they have? And yet, it was at this moment that a roar sounded.</p><br/><p>An angry howl sounded from afar. \u201cLuo Yuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan looked over.</p><br/><p>At this time, those that dared to howl at him would only be humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you trying to do?\u201d This was what the Genetic Union president asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d This was Research Agency chairman\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to kneel as well?\u201d This was Luo Yuan\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>\u201cI once told you.\u201d The Genetic Union president looked at Luo Yuan and said, \u201cI am not interested in the presidency. If you want it, you can have it at any time. You rejected my offer, yet now you come and do something like this. What exactly are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>He truly could not understand. Revenge? How? Destroying all of humanity? The president truly could not understand. Rather interestingly, back then in the old era, when the Genetic Era was still the strongest organization, he had obtained his position as the president for free. The various geniuses such as Luo Yuan and others had fought each other for it. Ultimately, some had died, some had been injured, and some had withdrawn. And just like that, this president had obtained the seat for no apparent reason. In fact, he had never had any interest whatsoever in the seat.</p></div>\n</div>"}

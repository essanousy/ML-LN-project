The next instant, he had been instantly killed. His dream had been crushed so quickly he hadn't even been able to react to it before dying.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>His gaze landed on Chen Feng. It was this guy who had used some unknown method to take away his steles. Hateful! There was also that bastard called Ba Gu\u2026 If it wasn't because of his insulting actions earlier, the old devil would not have shifted his attention and that Chen Feng would not have had any chance to do what he had. The humans were actually so treacherous!</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>The old devil collapsed onto the ground weakly. Dead.</p><br/><p>His final gaze landed on that S-class devil. He could not understand why this devil, which he had always been able to summon as he wished, had been delayed when summoned earlier. He felt like this death of his was too great of an injustice!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence. The old devil was dead, killed so very quickly. The president gazed at his own hands. He had not dared to believe that he would be able to easily kill such a powerful devil with a random attack, yet this was what had happened.</p><br/><p>The president gained understanding. \"He's actually so weak without the fused power.\" So it turned out that, originally, this old devil had merely been as strong as a regular A class.</p><br/><p>\"It's that child.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Chen Feng. They all knew that during the crucial moment earlier, it had been Chen Feng who had used some unknown method to move the steles, giving them the upper hand. This time, Chen Feng had once again made a huge contribution.</p><br/><p>The president was very satisfied. \"Not bad.\" Only Ba Gu had an expression of melancholy on his face. He had finally realized that Chen Feng had merely used him as bait to attract the attention of that old devil. This was too excessive!</p><br/><p>\"How did you move the steles?\" Li Lei asked the returning Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave a rough explanation. \"Although the steles were formed by S-class power, the old devil was, after all, still a beyond A class. Since the steles were created by a beyond A class, a beyond A class could certainly break them.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had not said much. After all, he couldn't possibly tell them that the only reason he had been able to move those steles was because he was an S class, that the steles had no defenses against S classes. Wouldn't it be embarrassing if he couldn't unleash S-class power after telling them that? As an incomplete S class, Chen Feng still saw himself as being \"between beyond A class and S class.\" That was all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Tianyu Liming said, \"Look there.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone followed her line of sight. Distantly, as the old devil died, the devilish aura around them vanished. Only an S-class devil was left behind. This S-class devil seemed to have sunk into sleep.</p><br/><p>\"Is he sleeping because he's sealed?\" Li Lei asked after some thought.</p><br/><p>\"Nope. However, the devil controlling him is already dead. At present, he is in an unmanned state, as his consciousness is temporarily incomplete. Moreover, even after waking up, he will still only move according to his instincts. If we take this chance to kill him\u2026\" the president said unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged gazes. This was indeed a chance for them.</p><br/><p>\"Ba Gu, the gene reagent,\" the president stated.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Ba Gu became agitated. The old devil was dead, and the S-class devil was in a temporary coma. They could make use of this opportunity to seal this devil. This was the best opportunity for the humans. Earlier, only a single gene reagent had been used. To face this S-class devil, they had prepared a huge amount of S-class sealing reagents! Naturally, this was also the fruit of that young prince continuously peeing for one entire week.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Ba Gu poured the numerous gene reagents onto the S-class devil's body. The faint powder shrouded the entirety of the S-class devil's huge body, glimmering with a bright radiance.</p><br/><p>\"It's working.\"</p><br/><p>All their eyes shone. They watched on as the radiance entered the body of that devil and the power of that devil slowly declined. From an intense devilish aura, it was reduced to the point where one couldn't even sense the aura. A huge part of his strength had been sealed. Everything was progressing smoothly.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent.\" The president's eyes shone. \"Next, kill him!\"</p><br/><p>After saying that, the president made his move.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Alas, just as his attack landed on that devil's body, those tightly shut eyes suddenly opened. The devil that had been nearly fully sealed had awakened.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance erupted. The devil's body shone brightly and blocked the president's attack.</p><br/><p>\"Awake?\" The president wasn't surprised. \"Ninety percent of his strength has been sealed. Even if he is still an S class, he can't display the power of an S class. At present, he is merely equivalent to two peak beyond A classes.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone pondered. So that was the case. If it was only the strength of two peak beyond A classes\u2026</p><br/><p>Tianyu Liming stood beside the president. \"Let me go with you.\"</p><br/><p>The president nodded. \"All right.\" Against this devil, the two of them would be sufficient.</p><br/><p>\"Come!\"</p><br/><p>The president charged at the devil, erupting with his formidable power. However, right at this instant, the expression of Tianyu Liming, who was beside him, changed greatly.</p><br/><p>\"Careful.\" After crying out, she pushed the president out of the way.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>A flash of red.</p><br/><p>The president turned around hastily, and instantly, his entire body chilled. Where he had stood previously, an entire section of space had vanished. As for Tianyu Liming, one of her arms was missing\u2014the arm she had used to push the president away earlier. The arm had vanished together with the space it had resided in.</p><br/><p>The president flashed and instantly appeared beside her. \"Lady Liming.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A warm radiance flashed in his hand as he tried healing her. Alas, it was ineffective. The missing arm seemed to not exist and was thus incapable of restoration. The president was shocked. How was this possible...</p><br/><p>Tianyu Liming did not seem to care. \"I'm fine.\" From the moment she had become a general of the ancients, she had been prepared to sacrifice herself. Their race was numb toward the prospect of death. Rather, the president's concern was what caused her heart to feel warm. Everyone saw what had happened, and their hearts chilled.</p><br/><p>Damn it. What damnable power was that?</p><br/><p>Tianyu Liming looked at that devil. \"The power of that fellow\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>Slowly, and clumsily, the devil flew up to the sky. He seemed rather weak, yet the power he had unleashed earlier had been truly alarming, exceeding all their understanding. A power at this level\u2026Yet this devil had obviously been sealed\u2026</p><br/><p>They couldn't understand this. Chen Feng was the only one who had fixed his gaze on that devil. Earlier, he had been the only one who sensed that the power unleashed by that devil wasn't ordinary S-class power. It was the legendary power of the awakened!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So this was the ancient race's voice transmitter? What in the world? Did the ancients believe that humans had throats as powerful as theirs? Talking with this so-called \"phone\" was no different than wailing.</p><br/><p>Intermittent howls were transmitted through the ball. \"You\u2026 stand higher\u2026 Maybe\u2026 signal\u2026 poor\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fine.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked around and, with a leap, reached the top of a huge 10-meter-tall tree. This was the tallest tree in his vicinity.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, hello?\" Kong Bao howled. \"Can you hear me now?\"</p><br/><p>The voice being transmitted became clearer. \"Somewhat better. What were you trying to say earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai blanked. \"Let me think\u2026\" After howling at the ball of light for such a long time, he had forgotten what he initially wanted to say. After two whole minutes of thinking, he finally remembered. Right, he had wanted to talk about resonators. Right now, the resonators seemed to be slowly recovering, though they had yet to fully recover.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, they had still been so happy about breaking through into the awakened realm, yet in the blink of an eye, resonators had started appearing one after another, delivering to them a massive blow. Therefore, they had to enter the resonance realm as soon as possible. Regardless of whether it was Kong Bai, Xu Fei, or the others, they all had the same opinion. Doing otherwise would be no different than sitting around and waiting for death.</p><br/><p>\"Resonance\u2026\" On the other end, Chen Feng sank into contemplation as well. During the Primordial Era, those resonators had all been peak awakened ones who resonated with gods to enter the resonance realm. But in this era\u2026 there were no other gods. If one truly wanted to reach resonance, one could only resonate with the Luck Goddess. After thinking about it, Chen Feng discovered how terrifying this could be. In short, during this period of time, they had to not break through before the other gods recovered.</p><br/><p>\"You guys should try to reach the peak of the awakened realm first, but remember to not enter the resonance realm. Even if breaking through is possible, do not do it,\" Chen Feng reminded them.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was confused. \"Why is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because\u2026 at this time, the Luck Goddess is the only god in existence,\" Chen Feng said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai sank into silence.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess\u2026 After the disturbance earlier, they were all naturally aware of what had happened to Chen Feng. If it was the Luck Goddess\u2026</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked pensively at the wave of gold that was surging out in the distance. \"Then, this time\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"That's right. This is the work of the Luck Goddess again.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand now.\" Kong Bai finally understood thoroughly. A war between the gods would come in the future. They currently had no way of getting involved in it, as they were too weak. The only thing they could do was not enter the resonance realm so as to not cause further trouble to Chen Feng and the others. As for the fate of this world, well, it would depend on the results of this world. After ending the call with Chen Feng, Kong Bai relayed what Chen Feng had said to Xu Fei and the others that were in a rush to breakthrough.</p><br/><p>When they heard this, they all sank into silence. Wait? Wait for other gods to recover? Could they even afford to wait?</p><br/><p>Xu Fei was the first to stand up. \"I cannot accept this.\" Even with the present state of the world, they could only watch on and wait for the final result? He was naturally unwilling to accept this. If they were to wait until the other gods recovered to enter resonance, it would be too late.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai sighed. \"Well, it is the same for us.\" He had once been the Mysterious Organization's leader, one of the strongest existences in the world. Now that he was reduced to a mere side character, he was naturally unwilling to accept it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Kong Bai recalled an old friend. \"How about Wang Chun?\" It had been quite a while since they had last met.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Qin Hai pondered before saying, \"Spending time with his harem, I suppose?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Harem\u2026 Oh, right, Wang Chun's ability.</p><br/><p>\"He is the man with a harem during a chaotic era. What a guy.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Fei was filled with envy. The rest felt the same.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Hai thought of something. \"About Wang Chun\u2026 I seem to have heard Master say that, a short while ago, he could feel godly power emanating from the area Wang Chun was in. Based on Master's guess, that was probably the power of the Nether God, yet there was a slight difference as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's expression changed. Nether God?</p><br/><p>\"That young lady!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they recalled that incomparably tyrannical girl in Wang Chun's harem: Ming Yue. They could seemingly remember this girl saying that she had been a god in her original world.</p><br/><p>\"Originally, the limit of this world was beyond A class. Therefore, even after entering this world, Ming Yue was too weak. Now, though, with the lifting of the limit, that young lady can use her godly power here in this world?\"</p><br/><p>All of them were shocked. If that was the case, that Wang Chun\u2026</p><br/><p>Qin Hai nodded. \"That's right. It is quite possible that he entered that world to inherit the power of the Nether God.\"</p><br/><p>Hiss\u2014</p><br/><p>They all inhaled a mouthful of cold air in shock. This Wang Chun guy had been missing with his harem for quite a while. They had all thought that the next time they saw him, he would be weakened from overexercising. Unexpectedly, this guy had actually silently surpassed them all.</p><br/><p>Godly power\u2026</p><br/><p>They all lamented. That world belonged to Wang Chun alone. As such, he alone could enter.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Xu Fei stood up. \"I am leaving. Even Wang Chun found his own way to obtain godly power. I will not sit in my home waiting for death. In this era, I must have my own strength as well.\"</p><br/><p>He had decided to go look for his own fortuitous encounter. Recently, since an indeterminate point in time, a dream-like voice seemed to have appeared in his heart, seemingly calling out to him. As time passed, that voice was getting clearer and clearer. This time, he had to take a look at what this voice was all about!</p><br/><p>Qin Hai stood up as well. \"Same here.\" He was the disciple of Duma, the person with the best information network in the world. He believed that his master would most definitely have a way for him to obtain godly power, even if it would be extremely difficult.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled calmly. \"Looks like we have all decided.\" He was a transmigrator. His future was not one anyone could dictate. Since, in this era, the gods had yet to awaken, he would traverse time itself and return to the primordial. He believed that in that unique era, he would be able to find his very own fortuitous encounter, even if it would be extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess. She had been one of the strongest gods in the Primordial Era. She had been the right hand of the Luck Goddess the whole time. She had possessed valiant strength, and in their defeat during the god war back then, she had also entered a slumber. This was the information Chen Feng had recently obtained. Evidently, this Luck Goddess, the first god to awaken, was recovering her underlings as well.</p><br/><p>Thomas sighed. \"What we fear most has still happened.\" If it were any other god, it would be fine, as the god would have to slowly recover even after waking up. However, the first god just had to be the Luck Goddess. With her unique power, if she wanted to cause certain gods to wake up first, it would be much easier. And this was precisely what she was doing.</p><br/><p>Thomas smiled bitterly. \"She will wake them up one by one, then organize them. By the time the other gods wake up, the Luck Goddess and her fellow gods will surround and kill them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a pensive look. Doing what the Genetic Union is doing to the awakened ones?</p><br/><p>Didi\u2014</p><br/><p>Thomas's group's communicators buzzed. Chen Feng glanced over, and his face darkened immediately. These resonators had all adapted well to this new modern era and had started using these tools of convenience. On the other hand, he\u2026</p><br/><p>He gazed at his empty wrist. Earlier, after howling into the ball to communicate with Kong Bai, he had almost ruined his throat. He finally understood why, regardless of gender, the ancients' voices were always so rough. </p><br/><p>I wonder if their voices are so rough in all circumstance\u2026 For instance, when Tianyu Liming and the president are doing it\u2026 Huh, what am I thinking about here?</p><br/><p>He coughed, stopping his messy thoughts.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Thomas's group became agitated. \"Good.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked over. \"What good news have you guys received?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

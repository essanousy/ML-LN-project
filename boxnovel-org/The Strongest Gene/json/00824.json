After all, he now controlled half the world; he wasn\u2019t the lonely commander from all those years ago. And yet, some would rather die than obey this command.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not your opponent, nor have I ever thought of rebelling. I was the first to follow you, yet I never imagined that you would go back on your word\u2026 As an illustrious god-king\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>He erupted his godly power, committing suicide then and there.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was alarmed. Damn it! There actually existed someone who would rather commit suicide than put the wristband on? Truthfully, Luo Yuan was not afraid of the chaos that might arise from this suicide. Rather, he was worried about the possibility of the holder of the power of misfortune committing suicide\u2026</p><br/><p>There shouldn\u2019t be such a coincidence, right? Damn it! He could not allow any other gods to commit suicide. Luo Yuan was truly given quite a fright by that suicide. He activated his unparalleled godly power as he decided to use force to make those gods put wristbands on. Alas, this action alarmed even more gods.</p><br/><p>Not allowing suicide and forcing them to put on the wristbands? In other words\u2026 Luo Yuan was afraid that they would commit suicide? Heavens\u2026 What exactly was he planning to have everyone do? As they thought about this, their fear intensified. Some of them decisively committed suicide. These were the people that had experienced that era. As such, they were clear that the wristbands would turn them into nothing but puppets. As for the ones who did not commit suicide, they decided to rebel.</p><br/><p>A certain god noticed something. \u201cHe does not dare to kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>More and more gods realized this and started shouting. \u201cAs a god-king, it seems like if he kills us, he might be adversely affected as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is why he is trying to use this method to exert control over us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t dare to wantonly kill gods. This might be related to the laws left behind by the Creation God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some gods started shouting. Next, the gods that had been hesitating to kill themselves vigorously rebelled. They could all see Luo Yuan\u2019s hesitation and fear. Believing that they had discovered the truth, they rebelled.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Various godly powers surged out as the various gods erected their defenses.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s killing intent surged. To hell with \u201cthe god-king can\u2019t kill gods\u201d and \u201cthe laws left behind by the Creation God.\u201d Such things did not exist. The sole reason he did not dare to kill wantonly was his fear of accidentally killing someone hiding the misfortune power, returning that power to the world.</p><br/><p>That was his only misgiving, and that did not signify he truly didn\u2019t dare to kill any of them. Unfortunately, to the various gods, his hesitation seemed to be due to a limitation left by the Creation God. Thus, the gods rebelled. Among the 100,000 gods, at least 80,000 rebelled.</p><br/><p>These were all gods that Luo Yuan had personally nurtured. He did not even get the chance to say anything before he was engulfed by a huge number of godly powers. Being attacked by gods he had personally nurtured\u2026 caused an intense anger to burn within him.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Boundless godly power spread everywhere. What would a battle between 100,000 gods look like? Now, this scene was here for everyone to see. The astonishing number of godly powers alarmed the entire world. Shortly after, the escaped gods began to spread the truth. Those who had yet to submit to Luo Yuan laughed heartily as they heard this. It seemed like their decision back then had been correct after all.</p><br/><p>What would a farmer do when the plants they had planted reached maturity? Why, harvest them all, of course. This was precisely what they saw Luo Yuan doing. He was harvesting the results of his hard work. The so-called \u201cnot needing to wear wristbands,\u201d the so-called \u201cnurturing gods,\u201d those had been lies. His final target had always been having everyone wear a wristband.</p><br/><p>And thus, a great war erupted. Everyone was waiting for the end of this war. Could the 100,000 gods obtain the final victory? Perhaps\u2026 Luo Yuan would truly be killed by the gods he had personally nurtured? The mere thought of this cause one\u2019s heart to pound in excitement.</p><br/><p>Alas, three days later, the battle ended. From the battlefield, only a single person walked out, his body soaked in blood, radiating a terrifyingly cruel atmosphere around him. That person was precisely Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>At this instant, the entire world lapsed into silence. Luo Yuan had obtained victory. On the battlefield, 100,000 corpses were left. It was said that Luo Yuan had initially had some misgivings but had erupted in anger after being injured by the continuous attacks. As such, he had ignored everything and slaughtered all the gods there. At this instant, the entire world trembled in fear. The ground itself was dyed red with blood. From this day onward, none of his subordinates dared to resist him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut on the wristbands,\u201d he commanded coldly. He had decided to kill the 100,000 gods so he could awe everyone. After the first kill, he had decided to no longer hesitate and kill them off as a warning to others. At the very least, from today onward, everyone would obediently listen to his commands. As for the other half of the world, the half that was still not under his control? Not much thought was needed.</p><br/><p>With his history of slaughter, the members of the other half of the world would never be willing to submit to him. As such, Luo Yuan had no intention of wasting his energy trying in vain to recruit them. He would rather spend his energy and time nurturing more gods. In any case, the moment he obtained full control over this world, everything else would be meaningless.</p><br/><p>For now, he had to focus on nurturing more gods. This time, everyone had to wear a wristband. This time, not a single person dared to disobey him. This time, if the power of misfortune was indeed hiding among his subordinates, he would be the first to detect it.</p><br/><p>Soon, under Luo Yuan\u2019s iron-fisted rule, a new round of breakthroughs began. During the first year, 3,000 gods appeared. During the second year, 5,000 gods appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten years later, the number of gods under Luo Yuan reached 100,000 once again. This was an astonishing number. Alas, the power of misfortune was still nowhere to be found. The power of misfortune had totally vanished. He had no way of locating it. There were times he that even began to doubt Chen Feng\u2019s death. However, Luck Aura confirmed time and again that Chen Feng was indeed dead.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Chen Feng had indeed vanished for thirty years. After all, Luo Yuan had more than one deduction ability. Each time he verified Chen Feng\u2019s death, he did it with over three hundred abilities. All his abilities returned the same answer: dead.</p><br/><p>As such, it was impossible for Chen Feng to have faked his death. He had no way of hiding from all of Luo Yuan\u2019s abilities. However, where was the power of misfortune? Nobody knew the answer. This was the sole godly power immune to the power of luck, as they were archenemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been thirty years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stared into the distance. Was the probability of misfortune\u2019s appearance truly so low? Or perhaps\u2026 there was something wrong in the way he was nurturing gods? Luo Yuan could not answer his own question. He had a feeling that he had been doing something wrong.</p><br/><p>Thus, Luo Yuan resorted to superstition. Before the next batch of believers tried their hands on ascending, he told them to wash their hands more. For the next batch, he told them to wash their faces more. For the subsequent batch, he told them to wake up very early in the morning and break through at the same time.</p><br/><p>Alas, it all seemed pointless. Perhaps he should try using Luck Aura? However, there was no point in that. The moment Luo Yuan tried to use the power of luck to search for misfortune, he could sense an intense feeling of disgust rising from the power of luck.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, disgust. This was not one-sided disgust. In fact, both luck and misfortune were disgusted by each other. Ultimately, Luo Yuan gave up on this.</p><br/><p>Misfortune\u2026 Where exactly was the divine seat that held this power? What exactly had Chen Feng done before his death? Luo Yuan felt like his emotions were collapsing all over again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

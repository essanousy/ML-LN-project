Chen Feng wanted to say something, but he could find nothing to say. It was a mistake? He had not been aware that those people were this god's believers? If he dared say this, he would probably be immediately killed.</p><br/><p>Even if he himself were the god in question, he would probably be angry. For this god to have the patience to explain the reason to him, this was already a rather kind god. However, Chen Feng still grumbled. Couldn't this god have spread his believers around more rather than have them all so concentrated? Of course, these words were only thought, not spoken.</p><br/><p>The huge monkey by his side was instead the one to talk. \"Why are you so stupid? Even us monkeys know that you shouldn't put all your eggs in the same basket.\"</p><br/><p>It's over. Chen Feng's heart chilled. He raised his head. Indeed. The god's killing intent was surging. Under this terrifying pressure, the air itself almost coagulated, to the point that even their breathing was now impeded. It seemed like this god was now truly angry.</p><br/><p>God damn you, huge monkey!</p><br/><p>At this time, high above the starry sky, a throne hovered. A certain person was seated there as he overlooked this world. Suddenly, he seemed to see something, and a smile formed on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, I can't allow you to kill him. After all\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He rotated the ring on his finger lightly as faint godly power surged out. Instantly, the throne started flickering before vanishing once again.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the forest outside Mountcarve City, the furious god finally made his move. Instantly, his terrifying godly power charged at the huge monkey. Chen Feng sighed. Even though the attack was aimed at the huge monkey, without a doubt, not a single one of them would be left alive. Thus, they had no choice but to fight it out with all they had.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng erupted in strength. He bloomed with all his power, unleashing a terrifying might with his miniature person. Instantly, an overwhelming might surged out of him. This was his strongest combat form, a form that was capable of instantly killing any resonator in existence, or even those above the resonance realm. This was his confidence.</p><br/><p>But of course, his present goal was to be able to block even one of this god's attacks.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>For the first time, his attack clashed with the god's attack.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>A crisp sound rang out.</p><br/><p>What he saw next was the sight of the attack he was so confident in immediately collapsing. Under the attack of the godly power, his attack could not even put up a fight; it was totally destroyed.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>His entire attack shattered like glass. As for that god's godly power, it was not even dented. Was this the strength of a god? Chen Feng could do nothing but to give a bitter smile. Encountering a god at his present level was truly no different than encountering a dead end. They could only watch on blankly as the god's attack reached them.</p><br/><p>And then\u2026 the attack stopped.</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart trembled. He raised his head and noted that the god was still filled with anger and killing intent, yet at the same time, he seemed to be hesitating somewhat, as he had actually stopped his attack at this moment. Hope was in sight! Chen Feng had no idea what had happened, yet it was evident that this god was now hesitating.</p><br/><p>\"Your strength is not bad.\" The god held a grudging look. Evidently, the strength Chen Feng had erupted with had stunned him. Even if this strength was still nothing to him, it was nevertheless still remarkable for a mortal.</p><br/><p>The god looked at the herculean apes. \"You guys are not bad either.\" They lacked godly power and resonance, yet they had been able to erupt with power comparable to resonators. What did this signify? This signified that the moment they resonated, their strength would reach a terrifying realm. All these fellows here were seeds with great potential, whether it was Chen Feng, the huge monkey, or the other herculean apes.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even though this god truly wanted to kill them all, at the final moment, he had chosen to listen to reason instead of acting based on his emotions. He had decided to convert these people into his own. After all, the losses he had suffered were way too great.</p><br/><p>\"Are you all\u2026 willing to be my believers?\" the god asked coldly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The hearts of Chen Feng and the others jolted violently. Believers! They exchanged glances and were able to see joy in each other's eyes.</p><br/><p>\"I agree,\" Chen Feng said without hesitation. What kind of joke was this? This was not a situation where he could hesitate.</p><br/><p>The god nodded. \"Very good. Let me bestow upon you all the power of gods.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Faint godly power rippled out. Next, a translucent contract took form in the sky. With that, the herculean apes and Chen Feng officially became the believers of this god. Almost instantaneously, the strength of all the herculean apes rocketed. They, who had already been at the peak of the awakened realm before, instantly broke through under the stimulation of the godly power. They entered the resonance realm, yet their levels were still increasing without stop.</p><br/><p>Level 1 resonance, level 2 resonance, level 3 resonance, all the way to level 9 resonance. Even the god was startled at this sight. One ought to know that this wasn't happening to only one of them. Rather, it was happening to the entire tribe. Godly power had always been capable of providing a huge boost in strength. Now that the herculean apes, having been stuck at the peak awakened realm for so long, had finally obtained the nourishment of godly power, their strength rocketed to an unprecedented height.</p><br/><p>Now, they wouldn't be too far off from the peak of the resonance realm. As for the huge monkey, there was no suspense whatsoever. He was able to easily enter the peak of the resonance realm. That coupled with his innate strength as a herculean ape would ensure that his combat power was even higher than a regular peak resonator.</p><br/><p>How powerful. Even the god was shocked. He suddenly found that in this short period of one minute, these monkeys had all become the core of his pool of believers, becoming the strongest tribe among his believers. How lamentable. The god mused that his decision to listen to reason had indeed been correct.</p><br/><p>While the god was rejoicing in his decision to not kill them, he looked over at Chen Feng. He knew that this guy was the leader of these monkeys, the strongest among them. If the herculean apes could reach level 9 resonance and the huge monkey could reach level 10, what about Chen Feng? He looked over at Chen Feng expectantly.</p><br/><p>One minute, two minutes, five minutes\u2026 Time passed, yet nothing happened. The god even wondered if he had forgotten to bestow his godly power upon Chen Feng. As such, he sent yet another wave of godly power over to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>One minute.</p><br/><p>Two minutes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the world seemed to lapse into silence. Nothing seemed to be happening to Chen Feng. That godly power capable of granting those monkeys an immense growth in strength had not taken effect on Chen Feng. Even Chen Feng himself was extremely stupefied. What was going on? Was he so powerful that that amount of godly power was not sufficient for him? After thinking about it, the god decided to personally transfer a gust of godly power directly into Chen Feng's forehead.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The godly power pulsed.</p><br/><p>With his very own eyes, he watched on as that gust of godly power entered Chen Feng's body before vanishing. Nothing was once again happening to Chen Feng. Just like that, the godly power was gone.</p><br/><p>This time, the god was truly dumbfounded. What was going on?</p><br/><p>\"Hu\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The god took in a deep breath. Once again, he sent out a gust of godly power. This time, a strand of his consciousness latched onto the godly power as he personally observed it enter Chen Feng's body before slowly entering Chen Feng's sea of consciousness and preparing to merge with him.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed to be progressing correctly so far. And next\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everything turned black. He lost his connection with that strand of consciousness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

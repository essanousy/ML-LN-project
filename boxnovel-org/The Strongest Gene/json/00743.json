Regardless of how strong they were, it was pointless before these gods. In horror, the twin horns members fled before being frozen and subsequently killed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Their minds were extracted and read by the gods.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"They are trying to expand the faith of their god.\"</p><br/><p>\"Has anyone found that fellow?\"</p><br/><p>\"Found him. However, it seems somewhat weird. From our progress thus far and what we have seen of their god from their memories, this god does not seem too strong.\"</p><br/><p>\"An unknown minor god?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026 His aura is somewhat weak, and his appearance does not resemble the Sin God.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is it a disguise? Perhaps he wanted to hide his appearance from these mortals. After all, there is no need for a god to reveal their true appearance to mortals.\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\"</p><br/><p>The gods all sank into silence. Everything they had seen thus far had been extracted from the memories of these twin horns: the image of a god that had been exaggerated with some special effects to spice it up. This was definitely different from how the god normally looked.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter. Regardless of whether that is his true appearance, won't we know after taking a look?\"</p><br/><p>\"That makes sense.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for these twin-horns members, just kill them while leaving their consciousnesses behind. In any case, we still need to find a way to return after we are done here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous lights swirled around. The twin-horns members that were charging at the gods were no different than moths flying into a flame. After dying, they all transformed into numerous clumps of consciousness. One only needed to approach the clumps to extract all their memories. Due to the information contained in their heads, even in death, they could not obtain a complete death.</p><br/><p>That the twin-horns race had been able to invade the human world multiple times proved that they had complete knowledge of how to teleport to the human world. As such, the gods were not worried about the matter of returning to their home planet. Everything seemed to be under control.</p><br/><p>\"Found him,\" a god said with shining eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\"</p><br/><p>All the gods charged over. The Sin God\u2026 had the time come for battle? They were all filled with anticipation. After joining hands to kill this Sin God, all of them would be able to increase their strength. However, some of the gods were still doubtful, as they felt that something did not seem right, as if they had missed something. Was the god here truly the Sin God?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Genetic Union, Chen Feng was silently studying the screen in front of him. All the statistics from the awakening of the gods until their recent departure were gathered on this screen he was looking at. And now\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The portal was shown on that screen. Just earlier, he had with his own eyes watched on as all the gods had stepped through the portal, leaving this planet.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the gods were in no way stupid. Some of them had placed some firm barriers around to lock the entire portal down, not allowing any regular life-forms near it.</p><br/><p>\"None of those gods noticed you monitoring them?\" The deputy president was amazed.</p><br/><p>\"Satellite monitoring,\" Chen Feng replied expressionlessly. These primordial gods probably had no idea that, high up in the sky, there was a thing capable of seeing them, monitoring all their actions. No godly power was required, nor was there a need to lock on to any of the gods. The monitoring could progress noiselessly, undetected.</p><br/><p>\"It's almost time,\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A black radiance flashed. Near the portal, a pitch-black figure appeared. For the first time, the appearance of this figure was revealed: he was Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>\"How is it?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"No problems encountered,\" Qin Hai said calmly. \"Based on the coordinates you provided, I went over and killed all the twin-horns members that knew about teleportation and the coordinates. All the materials and data that could be used has been destroyed as well. As of now, that twin-horns world will not be able to teleport to this world.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Very good.\" In other words, they only had to destroy this portal and the connection would be completely severed.</p><br/><p>\"It has been hard on you and Kong Bai,\" Chen Feng said in a soft voice. That's right. All this was the handiwork of Chen Feng, Qin Hai, and Kong Bai. Kong Bai did not dare transmigrate to the Primordial Era. However, what of the subsequent eras? Those were godless eras, eras Kong Bai could visit as he wished. With the assistance of Chen Feng's Luck Aura, Kong Bai had been to easily visit the different eras so as to leave behind numerous legends pertaining to the so-called Divine Sect, as well as the slabs the gods had discovered.</p><br/><p>These were what the gods had uncovered. The only reason for all this had been in order to lure all the gods to the alien world. Chen Feng remembered that in their previous battle with the twin-horns race, they had discovered that there was also a god there on the twin-horns world. Regardless of how much the twin-horns race had bragged about their god, it seemed like this was in fact a minor god. They had reached this conclusion after noticing how slow this god's recovery rate was.</p><br/><p>In any case, it did not matter if this god was powerful or not. So long as there were trails of this god's existence, Chen Feng would be able to disguise this god as the legendary Sin God, Ye. Next, all the awakened gods would head over. And finally\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \"Qin Hai.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>The black diamond on Qin Hai's forehead started gleaming.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>In Chen Feng's hands, luck and misfortune pulsed and landed on the barriers protecting the portal. Instantly, the barriers collapsed, allowing Qin Hai free passage.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous loud booms resounded. Instantly, the huge portal collapsed, transforming into nothingness.</p><br/><p>\"So long, gods,\" Chen Feng said with a burning gaze. The Spatial God was long dead. A huge number of gods had awakened this time, yet not a single one of them possessed a teleportation ability. This was the core of Chen Feng's plan. Now that all those gods had been sent to the alien world, they had any way of returning.</p><br/><p>With this, the humans would be safe. Or perhaps one could say that the Genetic Era would regain its peace. This was Chen Feng's plan, his scheme against all the gods. From the legends of the Sin God to the slabs planted by Kong Bai, followed by the assassinations conducted by Qin Hai, each section was closely linked together, finally resulting in the full departure of all the gods that did not belong to this Genetic Era.</p><br/><p>Everyone gazed at the sky. Behind the haze, a sunny and cloudless sky seemed to be coming out. Was everything finally over? At this time, on the alien world, the gods that were heading toward the Sin God heard the loud explosion. Next, they saw the portal collapse.</p><br/><p>\"Who did it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hold on\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Some of the gods already had a bad premonition. \"We seem to have neglected something.\"</p><br/><p>A certain god that was known for his wits vigilantly said, \"Quick, start up a brand new portal.\"</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>From the innumerable consciousnesses of the dead twin-horns members, they started searching for information pertaining to the teleportation portal. Alarmingly, all the information pertaining to the portal seemed to have vanished. No coordinates could be found, nor could any no know-how regarding portals. On top of that, even all the recorded data had vanished.</p><br/><p>The gods were alarmed.</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>Finally, some of the gods realized it.\"This is a trap\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Someone used the destruction of the Primordial Era as bait to lure all the gods away.\"</p><br/><p>\"That is not possible!\"</p><br/><p>\"How is that not possible? Think properly. Is the god here even the Sin God? Even now, you guys are still doubtful, right?\"</p><br/><p>The gods all sank into silence. True, was the god here even the Sin God? After pondering the matter from this perspective, they discovered something dreadful. If this was truly the Sin God's world, how could it be so weak? Moreover, from the memories they had extracted, the god here had only moved once to stop a mere comet, and his figure had immediately gone translucent afterward. That was simply too weak. As such, there was no Sin God here. Here\u2026 only a minor unknown god could be found. As for all the other gods, they had been tricked into this world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

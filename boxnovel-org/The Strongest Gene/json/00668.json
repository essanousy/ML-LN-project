Chen Feng had a solemn expression. He had thought of countless possibilities\u2014for instance, Qin Hai's father being killed. If that were what had happened, he would have gotten a fake Qin Hai's father and ensured Qin Hai's childhood memories were still the same. Even if Qin Hai's father had been castrated, Chen Feng could have produced a brand new \"tool\" for him. No matter how hard it would be, he would have been able to accomplish it, as he was strong enough.</p><br/><p>However, he had never expected that Qin Hai's father would actually be \"bent\" so thoroughly.</p><br/><p>\"Erm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spent a long time thinking yet could not figure out what to say. He had zero experience in convincing those with unique tastes to return to their roots, get married, and make babies. He looked at Qin Hai's father's resolute gaze and even started feeling like he was the villain here.</p><br/><p>He sighed. He entertained the thought of killing Qin Hai's father directly and preparing a puppet to give birth to a \"Qin Hai\" instead. However, he had to give up on this thought. He was certain that the Dream Recall Bell had some backup plans waiting for him if he did that. It would not be wise to kill now.</p><br/><p>In any case, this was Qin Hai's father. Could he truly bring himself to kill this man?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"Things will be troublesome this way.\" If the ordinary method did not seem like it would work, he had no choice but to pick a different option, to brainwash Qin Hai's father. Chen Feng personally believed that as an illustrious awakened one, brainwashing an ordinary genetic warrior shouldn't pose him much trouble. Unexpectedly, his brainwashing was totally ineffective.</p><br/><p>All mind-affecting abilities seemed completely ineffective against Qin Hai's father. He was presently madly in love, resulting in a dramatic increase in his willpower. Unless he was truly killed or destroyed, nothing could change his mind.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man gazed at Qin Hai's father and said, \"Our love will last forever.\"</p><br/><p>\"We would rather suffer death than be separated,\" Qin Hai's father said resolutely.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u2026</p><br/><p>What a useless father!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng decided to try changing Qin Hai's father's mind about the bride. \"You and your bride seem to have known each other from a young age and have a good relationship with each other, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"I know, but I have always seen her as a little sister. She is younger than me. Therefore, she has always behaved mischievously. Naturally, I love her dearly as well. However, that is mere familial love,\" Qin Hai's father replied seriously.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng tried leading him on. \"Since you see her as a mere sister, do you happen to be interested in incest?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's father was stupefied. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Forget it.\" Indeed, Qin Hai's father was not interested in an incestuous relationship. In that case, this would be hard to solve. But then, this was rather acceptable, as if Qin Hai's father had been interested in incestuous relationships, if after Qin Hai's birth\u2026 Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng cut short this line of thought. He felt like pursuing this line of thought would result in some NSFW scenes.</p><br/><p>I need to think of something.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps I can ask around on the internet?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pondered and decided that perhaps collecting ideas from a wider pool of people would be better for solving something like this. As such, he posted a thread online: \"How to turn a gay straight? To fall in love with a woman?\"</p><br/><p>Yet instead of answering his question, the online netizens all started being grammar nazis, all getting into an intense argument on the proper grammar of his question, getting totally off topic.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"???\"</p><br/><p>Even the online community during the era of Qin Hai's father was so terrible? Forget it. He should think of a way himself.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng checked the time. Based on the proper timeline, Qin Hai's father should get married within two days. After several months, his wife would be pregnant with little Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>There was still some time for him to solve this. In any case, a few days of delay should not cause any major changes. He refused to believe that he couldn't straighten this fellow out.</p><br/><p>\"You know of my strength,\" Chen Feng said coldly. \"I will give you a test and see if you are truly not straight. If you can pass the test, I will allow you two to be together forever. If you fail, obediently go back and get married. Naturally, you have no rights to protest against this test.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right,\" Qin Hai's father decisively agreed. Evidently, he was confident in himself.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng dragged Qin Hai's father away. Next\u2026</p><br/><p>\"During these two days, stay with her and have a short incursion here.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave Qin Hai's father the best environment, a beautiful beach with everything paid for and an astonishingly beautiful, mature woman with a seductive figure, hoping that this would lead to them doing the deed.</p><br/><p>Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was disappointed.</p><br/><p>He spent two days observing them and noted that Qin Hai's father was as calm as ever. He was extremely courteous and polite toward this pretty woman. Even after she stripped herself naked and lay on his body, he still had the same calm expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Holy shit, is he truly no longer straight now?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>Change!</p><br/><p>And thus, Chen Feng got a younger female for Qin Hai's father instead. This time, he gave Qin Hai's father a youthful and energetic girl that was extremely adorable. Alas, it was still pointless, as this time, Qin Hai's father merely treated her as a little child, assuming the identity of a father, taking care of her properly without going overboard at all.</p><br/><p>Change!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng adjusted his strategy without stop, offering numerous types of women to Qin Hai's father, certain that there had to be one that Qin Hai's father would prefer.</p><br/><p>Alas, none of them caught Qin Hai's father's attention. From youthful girls to seductive sisters, from nurses to delivery ladies\u2026 All sorts of women were supplied to Qin Hai's father. Anything a pimp had to offer was offered to him. An illustrious awakened one like Chen Feng had almost changed his profession to a pimp already, yet it was still ineffective. Qin Hai's father still appeared as calm as ever.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's head ached greatly. \"What the hell.\"</p><br/><p>\"I told you. It is true love between me and him,\" Qin Hai's father said earnestly. \"Now, have I passed the test?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng looked at him with a gloomy expression. \"Mhm\u2026 Yeah, in a way. However, before that, you have one final test. So long as you pass this test as well, I will send you back.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's father was filled with confidence. \"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"Hehe.\" You are the one who forced me to do this!</p><br/><p>This might be somewhat cruel and inhuman for Qin Hai's father. However, there was no other choice. The changed history had to be corrected! As such, on that night, Chen Feng kidnapped the bride and tossed her at Qin Hai's father. Mind-control abilities were useless against him? It did not matter. Drugs would work, right?</p><br/><p>As such, on the second day, the cheerful Chen Feng looked at the parents of Qin Hai who had already done the deed. Hehe, with this, there will be hope for Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>\"Wuwu\u2026you lied to me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's father wrapped the blanket around himself and cried, \"How could you do this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's mother was instead the calm one. After all, since adulthood, she had already been aware that she would one day be married to this guy. As such, she did not reject this.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry.\" Qin Hai's mother patted Qin Hai's father's shoulder and said, \"I will take responsibility for this.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>How manly of her!</p><br/><p>Since the hardest part was already done, what was next would be easy to deal with. And thus, under Chen Feng's great effort, the two completed the wedding and gave birth to little Qin Hai. As for whether their lives were happy or not, that wasn't something Chen Feng could care about. However, to be safe, he taught Qin Hai's mother the recipe for a certain drug. In any case, the moment Qin Hai's father became disobedient, she would drug him.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>As simple as that, history was corrected.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Light swirled before his eyes. Chen Feng returned and found that Qin Hai had indeed returned!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>However, for an unknown reason, he found that this time, the gaze when Qin Hai looked at him seemed somewhat odd. That feeling\u2026 was sending a chill down his spine.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart chilled. Holy shit, it can't be that he found out his dad is gay, right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

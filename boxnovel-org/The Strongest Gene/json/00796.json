With this single battle, they had all thoroughly submitted. Against Ye, they no longer dared had any thoughts of resistance. Even though they could guess that Ye was rather exhausted and that he might not have much strength left, not a single one dared to gamble that their guess was right. They only dared to keep their thoughts to themselves, as this was Ye they faced. This was Ye, who, even in death, could still ensure all the gods would die together with him if he wished.</p><br/><p>They were all clear that a person at Ye\u2019s level would most definitely have a trump card that could be unleashed at the moment of death. As such, even if they were to use all their might to fight him, even if the battle progressed smoothly, the best conclusion would still be everyone\u2019s death. Was there a need for that? After all, none of them were major gods. They did not have such courage, nor did they have such capability.</p><br/><p>Ye mere regarded them coldly. Only after a long time did he start speaking. \u201cVery good. Hand over half the believers you guys have gotten from this world,\u201d he coldly said. He was now clear that if he was too kind, these people would doubt him more. As such, he did not need to feign kindness. His ice-cold bearing could still be unleashed as he wished.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The low stage gods all heaved a sigh of relief. So long as he did not require them to hand over all the believers, everything would be fine. And thus, the battle came to an end. All of the apostles and believers of the major gods were returned to Ye, and all the other gods handed half their believers to him. With this, this incident came to an end.</p><br/><p>Ye walked to the corpse of a certain major god he had killed.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A translucent radiance flickered. An imprint shone on the dead god\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p><em>This\u2026</em></p><br/><p>The eyes of all the gods there went wide. However, soon after, they realized what was going on. Right, Lord Ye was recovering a divine seat. As far as this Lord Ye was concerned, regaining a divine seat was nothing special. So long as he was not interrupted, he could ascend to godhood again at any moment. At that time, Ye would fully regain all his strength.</p><br/><p>After ascending, with the replenishment of believers, he would be able to recover in a short while. Everything would return to normal soon after. However, right at this moment, light laughter resounded. This laughter resounded throughout the area and was heard by everyone.</p><br/><p><em>Who?</em></p><br/><p>Everyone turned around instinctively. There, in a certain corner, a shadow had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye stopped what he was doing. Since there was an enemy, he could not continue with the process of recovering a divine seat. After all, the several minutes of time he would require would be sufficient for an enemy to kill him. As such, he stopped. Coldly, he looked at the shadow expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. There are more suicidal clowns around?\u201d Ye asked coldly.</p><br/><p>That shadow merely laughed. \u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClown\u2026 Are you talking about yourself, Ye?\u201d the figure said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you reveal yourself before you continue talking,\u201d Ye said in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am already out here,\u201d the shadow replied toyingly. \u201cThis is my main body.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Nearly everyone was stunned. Main body? A shadow? Hold on\u2026 Their eyes widened as their gazes focused on that corner. There, they had initially seen half a shadow, seemingly the shadow of someone hiding in the corner. However, now that they focused on it, they found that it was precisely a shadow that had walked out of the corner.</p><br/><p>There was no body, only a single shadow there. What life-form was this? The gods were all amazed. Shadow\u2026 Ye had an ominous feeling as he saw this.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the shadow asked, \u201cI believe you have met my junior brother, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour junior brother?\u201d Suddenly, a certain silhouette appeared in Ye\u2019s mind. Finally, a minute change appeared in his expression. Even though his face immediately returned to its previous expression, the slight change was still noticed by some of the gods present. That expression of his\u2026 was an expression of fear! That\u2019s right, Ye was actually scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. It is exactly as you guess.\u201d The shadow smiled as he looked at Ye. \u201cMy junior brother is the silhouette you fought a few days ago. Mhm\u2026 Originally, I thought that he would succeed in killing you. Mhm\u2026 Looks like you are stronger than I imagined.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the other gods heard this, their hearts jolted furiously. That silhouette\u2026 That person that had seriously injured Ye was actually this shadow\u2019s junior brother? Senior brother, junior brother\u2026Heavens, what kind of existences were these two? The hearts of all the gods present started to palpitate. This was too scary a thought. This was too astonishing. As for Ye, his expression was incomparably solemn.</p><br/><p>He could ignore all these regular gods. However, he could not ignore this shadow, because if this shadow was truly that silhouette\u2019s senior brother, his strength should be\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s voice became hoarse. \u201cWho exactly are you people?\u201d He truly had no idea. If that silhouette was an existence he had overlooked, then who exactly was this shadow? This world\u2026 How had such terrifying existences appeared in his very own world? This was not supposed to be possible.</p><br/><p>If these two were the existences of an alien world, with how sensitive this world was, he would have been able to detect their appearance long ago rather than them arriving without him noticing. That silhouette had hidden in outer space, so he could accept the reasoning that the silhouette had avoided the senses of the world. However, this shadow here\u2026 Ye was truly clueless. And thus, he had asked the question he was most curious about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe?\u201d A faintly discernible voice drifted out from that shadow. \u201cDo you truly not know? Back then, before Master left\u2026 We were created. Light representing the light of the world, darkness representing the darkness of the world. We have never gotten involved in the events of the world, instead distancing ourselves from everything. We have only maintained the order of the world in secret. Are you curious about why we do not suffer any of this world\u2019s repellence? The answer is rather simple. Because\u2026 this is our world! Before your arrival, this world belonged to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s mind boomed. Master left\u2026 Created the two\u2026 Maintaining the order of the world\u2026 The world belonged to them\u2026 Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Two!\u201d said Ye, one word at a time. \u201cLeft! By! The! Creation! God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>All the gods\u2019 eyes went wide as they heard this. Creation God\u2026 How could this\u2026</p><br/><p>The shadow laughed. \u201cHehe. You have finally thought of this. Did you know? I have been waiting a long time for this moment. Master used his very own body to create this world, yet the world was conquered by you, the ambitious traitor. Do you truly believe that master didn\u2019t have any trump cards? You were wrong. Master is merely too benevolent, so he had intended to give you one more chance. Evidently, you have not treasured the single chance given to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow appeared rather disappointed. As for Ye, he trembled, his eyes bloodshot. Creation God! Him again! How many years had it passed since the Creation God had transformed himself into the world? Yet even now, his shadows were still lurking in this world, still capable of judging Ye\u2019s actions! How ridiculous!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the Creation God\u2019s benevolence, you would have died a long time ago. However, you have nevertheless still crossed the line.\u201d The shadow spoke indifferently. \u201cIf you had truly focused on improving and managing this world, so what if the world was given to you? The benevolence of the Creation God is sufficient to accept your existence. Alas\u2026 You are truly disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shadow looked over at the dead major gods. Their aura still lingered in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo many gods have died.\u201d The shadow sighed. \u201cSo many that the world\u2019s operational system is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, sorry, I shall implement the Creation God\u2019s command and erase you from this world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe.\u201d Ye\u2019s expression warped. The Creation God! Again! Who did he think he was? A mere dog! With the two toys he had left behind, he wanted to put the Sin God under his control? How utterly ridiculous!</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not accept this!\u201d Ye howled.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, he erupted with power. While the shadow was still talking, while everyone was still contemplating, Ye unleashed his attack. A horrifying power surged out once again. The attack came at an incredible speed, a speed that caused the hearts of all the gods present to chill. Ye had actually preserved some of his strength. If they had tried to fight him earlier, they would probably have died. And now\u2026</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>That attack directly blasted into the shadow\u2019s body.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Chen Feng's collapse had truly alarmed everyone present. The employees of Genetic Union took him into the building hastily and started feeding him energy-regeneration gene reagent. Only with this did a wisp of energy reappear in Chen Feng's body.</p><br/><p>Hou Liang, who had rushed over, anxiously asked, \"How are you feeling?\"</p><br/><p>The employee shook his head. \"He's fine. He overexerted his energy. He will be fine after taking a rest.\"</p><br/><p>Only at this did Hou Liang heave a sigh of relief. \"That's good.\" After hearing about the devil race's surprise attack and Chen Feng's unconsciousness, he had truly been given quite a fright.</p><br/><p>\"How about that devil race member?\" asked Hou Liang.</p><br/><p>\"Already escaped. However, based on our guess, it could come back to attack at any time,\" the employee stated honestly.</p><br/><p>Hou Liang told them, \"The security here will be handed to you guys.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was wearing a solemn expression. Several beyond A classes were outside looking for traces of that devil race member. They were aware of how terrifying this devil race member was, a devil race member who was ready to die accomplishing his mission. This time, they would most certainly not give him any chances.</p><br/><p>\"Has Lord Li Lei awakened?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Heal him as quickly as possible. We need to know what secret it is that he has discovered. Only by leaking that secret will the devil race member stop trying to assassinate him.\"</p><br/><p>They were sure that after the secret was leaked, it would be pointless for the devil race member to kill him.</p><br/><p>\"All right,\" the employees replied.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterward, the treatment of Li Lei using numerous gene reagents began. Both Chen Feng and Li Lei were on the verge of regaining consciousness. Several beyond A classes increased their vigilance as they patrolled. They were aware that if the devil race still intended to assassinate Li Lei, now would be the time to do it.</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>A cold gleam flashed past.</p><br/><p>Here it comes!</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes shone.</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>Numerous terrifying cold gleams streaked toward Li Lei.</p><br/><p>They sneered. We have been waiting a long time for you. </p><br/><p>If it was an undetected ambush, such as what had happened, when the devil race members first appeared, there might still have been a chance of success. Now that so many beyond A classes were standing guard here, regardless of how strong that devil race member was, he would still have to submit. So what if his strength had reached beyond A8?</p><br/><p>\"Rise!\"</p><br/><p>Surrounding Li Lei, three beyond A classes erected a defense.</p><br/><p>They were all confident in their strength. However, to be safe, they had decided to still erect numerous layers of defense so as to not give that devil race member any openings. Presently, the rest of the beyond A classes were attempting to surround that devil race member on all sides.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Their powerful attacks were seemingly going to pierce through that devil race member.</p><br/><p>All of them had cold gazes. \"Die.\"</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>The devil race member's attack finally landed on Li Lei. Surprisingly, the attack that appeared so powerful failed to even cause a ripple on their defensive barrier before the attack was directly destroyed.</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>Everyone felt doubtful. They had already expected that they would be able to defend against this attack, but for it to be this easy\u2026 They looked at the energy and noted that not a single bit of the energy supply of their defensive barrier had been exhausted. That seemingly terrifying attack had actually been a feint!</p><br/><p>All of their expressions sank. \"Careful!\"</p><br/><p>Midair, the attacks of the beyond A classes finally reached the devil race member as well.</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>A series of oppressive sounds echoed. All their attacks had blasted into the devil race member's body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Instantly, the devil race member was heavily injured and flung away. Not a feint? They were somewhat dumbstruck. They had believed that this devil race member had feigned an attack at Li Lei while condensing a truly powerful attack to deal with the other beyond A classes. Unexpectedly, it hadn't even resisted their attacks and had been inflicted with heavy injuries just like that.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Had the injury it suffered the other day been too serious? However, just as everyone was still feeling doubtful, the heavily injured devil race that had been flung to the ground suddenly erupted at the split second when everyone had relaxed their vigilance.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A familiar radiance appeared. That was the power of sacrifice! That's right, just as the two other devil race members sacrificed themselves, this final devil race member once again used the method of sacrifice on himself. Once again, the several beyond A classes consolidated their defenses.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, this time, the devil race member switched his target.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The radiance surged. The devil race member's new target was Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>The terrifying attack shot straight at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Everyone was stupefied. Chen Feng? What? Was the devil race's target not Li Lei?</p><br/><p>Previously, when Chen Feng had been blocking in front of Li Lei, this devil race member had only intended to get around him to deal with Li Lei and had not planned to kill Chen Feng at all, but now\u2026 What was going on, exactly? This devil race member was ignoring Li Lei and sacrificing himself just to kill Chen Feng? Everyone was dumbstruck. As a result of their stupefaction, they were unable to react in time. Even those beyond A classes failed to catch up to the attack, since this devil race member was truly too powerful.</p><br/><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><br/><p>The killing intent of the devil race pervaded the air. A terrifying power locked onto Chen Feng. At present, the Chen Feng who had only recovered a bit after the initial treatment was jolted awake by that bone-piercing aura. Just as he opened his eyes, a huge shadow could be seen streaking toward him.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>His eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>His thoughts started operating at hyperspeed. Instantly, everything around him seemed to slow down. Spirit immediately transmitted the information on everything that had happened to his brain. Finally, Chen Feng understood what was happening. This devil race member had actually switched his target at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's expression darkened. \"Shit.\" He had never expected that he would be targeted by this devil race member. Wasn't this devil race member supposed to kill Li Lei to protect their secret? What was the point of killing Chen Feng? Even now, Chen Feng could not understand why this devil race member was trying to kill him instead. Apart from the devil race, nobody knew the reason.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>That terrifying radiance was going to reach Chen Feng at the next instant. Regardless of how fast Chen Feng's present thoughts were, regardless of how powerful Luck Aura was, in such a circumstance, regardless of whether it was Chen Feng himself or Spirit, they would not be able to think of a good solution. No matter what, this seemed like a hopeless situation. Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>\"You truly want to do that?\" asked Spirit.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"What else can I do?\" Looking at the incoming attack that was tearing apart even space itself, Chen Feng focused his gaze. He assumed a proper pose before lightly waving his right hand. Next, a red flash shot out of his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Run, Xiao Ying!\"</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>The red flash shone dazzlingly before colliding with the incoming shadow.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright explosion erupted.</p><br/><p>\"Trying to kill me with just this?\" The devil race member laughed nastily. He had indeed failed to assassinate Li Lei. However, if he was able to kill Chen Feng instead\u2026</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Although this red streak was powerful, it was still not a match for this devil race member. This red streak that was like a tiny worm would not be able to stop this devil race member for even a single millisecond. The gap between them was simply too huge. Alas, the excitement of this devil race member was not long lived. Just as it was about to destroy this tiny red snake, a terrifying aura appeared suddenly as a tender and fair hand pierced space to appear here.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The fair hand clasped, forming a fist, and punched down resoundingly.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>The devil race member's eyes widened. He could clearly feel that at this instant, the space before him, including his attack, including everything else, shattered as cracks started appearing.</p><br/><p>How is this possible\u2026</p><br/><p>This devil race member watched on in shock as his body transformed into countless fragments before vanishing in the air. Where the red radiance had been previously, a petite figure appeared. Why\u2026 had\u2026 this happened? The devil race vanished with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the radiance dispersed. A young lady with a bathrobe wrapped around her appeared. Her feet were bare and she was staring at Chen Feng furiously. \"Bastard! I told you, don't ever use such a method to summon me!\"</p><br/><p>Ming Yue was bursting with rage. Was this bastard doing it on purpose? Every time he summoned her, it was when she was taking a shower! If she wasn't sure that Chen Feng had no way of crossing over to her world, she would even start to believe that Chen Feng had installed a hidden camera in her bathroom. This was too excessive! Hadn't Chen Feng claimed that Xiao Ying was his brother? Who would toss their brother out in the middle of a fight? Wasn't this too excessive? Even if this was not a true biological brother, this still wasn't proper, right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The berserk power of awakened ones flooded out. Wealthy Zhao's eyes gleamed coldly as he once again activated his godly power, a faint power of nothingness materializing around him.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The radiance swept forth, and instantly, the attacks of the ten-odd awakened ones were greatly weakened.</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao shook his head. \"I control the godly power of wealth\u2026 So long as there is a tiny speck of greed toward wealth in your hearts\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>This time, Wu Liang moved.</p><br/><p>With a single sword, a terrifying godly power surged out. With a boom, the ten-odd awakened ones were flung away, each coughing up from their mouths.</p><br/><p>\"Hiss\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest were overwhelmed with shock at this development. They knew that awakened ones were powerful. However, they had been under the impression that experts at such a level had yet to recover their strength. Surprisingly, even without being fully recovered, they were already this strong. So this was resonance?</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao spoke unhurriedly. \"My advice remains the same. Hand us Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president glanced at him and pressed a certain button. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Several cannons appeared and aimed straight at Wealthy Zhao's group. These were energy weapons manufactured by the Research Agency.</p><br/><p>\"Several friends of mine left a message. Mhm, this latest invention of theirs is capable of insta-killing awakened ones. Are you guys interested in trying to see if it can kill resonators as well?\" the deputy president said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the expressions of Wealthy Zhao's group changed slightly. Insta-killing awakened ones\u2026 So humankind had already created such a weapon?</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou waved his hand. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint godly power surged out. A faint barrier latched onto the cannons.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou smiled toyingly. \"Do you know what the biggest flaw in these weapons is? They are nearly defenseless. It is way too easy to simply seal them up.\"</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>The deputy president pressed the power switch. Indeed\u2026 the cannons were no longer working. Facing the power of the gods, technology was indeed too weak.</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao walked up to the president and aimed his finger straight at the deputy president's forehead, killing intent leaking out of him. \"Are you still not willing to hand over Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president merely gazed at him coldly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's existence was way too significant for humanity. As such, regardless of the past or present, if they were to hand over someone who had contributed so much to humanity, it would be as good as obliterating their own humanity. If that happened, it would truly be over for mankind.</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao appeared rather regretful. \"Excellent. You can go die, then.\"</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>His finger started glowing. Since the humans were unwilling to hand Chen Feng over, they would have to look for him themselves. However, just as he was about to kill the deputy president, a familiar voice resounded. \"Are you looking for me?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>This startled everyone.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng?</p><br/><p>Instinctively, everyone looked in the direction of the voice. There, Chen Feng was unhurriedly walking out.</p><br/><p>\"You have indeed arrived,\" Wealthy Zhao said with a toying smile.</p><br/><p>The deputy president's expression changed greatly. \"Chen Feng! What are you doing, coming out? Didn't I get them to send you away secretly? Why did you not follow them away?\"</p><br/><p>He had previously dispatched some people to secretly send Chen Feng away. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng had stayed behind.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled. \"Do you think they can order me around?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president was anxious. \"But\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng patted his shoulder. \"Don't worry. Let me deal with this. Don't worry, these fellows are old friends of mine.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president and the rest sighed. \"Chen Feng\u2026\" They were all aware that Chen Feng had, for the sake of both himself and the Genetic Union, decided to come out. In this new era where the primordial had descended, they were ultimately still too weak. The deputy president looked at his communicator. The distress signal he had sent to Duma was still buffering without stop. Mhm\u2026 The message was still blocked.</p><br/><p>Since these resonators had decided to come, how would they give the Genetic Union a chance to ask for help? Otherwise, all the awakened ones the Genetic Union had would be sufficient to flood these fellows to their death. Although these resonators were arrogant, they were not stupid.</p><br/><p>However, looking at Chen Feng, these genetic warriors all felt incomparably bitter. The Genetic Union that had once been number one in the world had been reduced to such a state?</p><br/><p>Thomas chuckled. \"Old Zhao, what you said is indeed right. He indeed came out himself.\"</p><br/><p>\"That is only natural,\" Wealthy Zhao said with a smile. \"After all, I have been living among humans for quite a while. As such, I am aware of the significance of Chen Feng among the humans, and naturally, I know the significance of humans to Chen Feng as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have been waiting for you,\" Wu Liang said with a vicious face.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>This was a name they had been thinking about for a very long time.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go,\" Chen Feng said with a calmly. \"Are you guys not here to take me away?\"</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao nodded. \"How straightforward.\"</p><br/><p>Since they had already obtained what they had come for, it would be for the best if they left now. Alas, surprisingly, someone else spoke up this moment. </p><br/><p>\"Although Old Zhao said that we can easily take you away without killing you, I am still rather displeased here.\" Thomas fixed his gaze on Chen Feng. \"During this period, we have been pursued badly. Why would we allow you to die with such an ease?\"</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Thomas, don't act recklessly.\" The only reason they had even been able to succeed in this undertaking was because they had ambushed the Genetic Union while the Genetic Union's other awakened ones were not here. After all, the total amount of awakened ones the Genetic Union had was quite terrifying. If they were to act recklessly and escalated this\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Screw the awakened ones! I, as an illustrious resonator, should be afraid of those trash? So what if there are a lot of them? I can simply hide in the wilderness. Which of them can even locate me? You guys are all willing to stay among human society. The same does not apply to me.\" Thomas laughed wildly. \"Chen Feng, you are coming with us willingly? Hehe. Sorry, I prefer causing suffering to others.\"</p><br/><p>The expressions of Wu Liang and the rest sank. \"Don't act recklessly.\" This follower of the War God was indeed rather crazy.</p><br/><p>Thomas started hissing violently. \"Haha, it is already too late.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, that immense hatchet appeared. Godly power surged out, spreading everywhere. He was actually planning on killing all the Genetic Union members here with a single swing of his hatchet.</p><br/><p>\"Thomas, calm down!\"</p><br/><p>\"Die, you all! Chen Feng, you displeased me. I shall displease you in return as well!\" Thomas had a menacing look on his face. Willingly? Like hell I will allow you to die willingly. You have tricked me so badly. How can I allow you to die willingly? Do you not treasure your fellow humans? I will let you experience the pain of watching these people die before you!</p><br/><p>Thomas laughed menacingly. He could no longer wait to see the expression of utmost pain on Chen Feng's face.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The terrifying hatchet swung down.</p><br/><p>Since his attack arrived so fast, even Wu Liang and the rest were unable to stop him in time and could only watch on blankly as that terrifying hatchet swung down loudly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The earth trembled.</p><br/><p>\"It's over.\"</p><br/><p>The hearts of the deputy president and the rest chilled. Alas, the anticipated death did not appear. When they opened their eyes once again, with astonishment, they found that beneath the immense hatchet, a figure had appeared.</p><br/><p>One of his hands was raised, stopping the fall of the hatchet. When they got a clear look at his appearance, they all inhaled a cold breath of shock. Even Thomas and the other resonators' bodies chilled in shock. Why? That was because that figure was none other than Chen Feng!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

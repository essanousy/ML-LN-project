They had no intention of contacting Chen Feng and interrupting the training session. However, to be safe and maintain contact, they had been sending data packets without stop to Chen Feng's wristband. These data packets had no substantive usage. They were merely being sent to receive a response.</p><br/><p>With each request sent, a response would be received. That was all.</p><br/><p>Di! Di!</p><br/><p>The requests and responses matched each other without stop. Every single request they sent was answered with a response.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like they are in serious training,\" the deputy president muttered. He felt like he was the one with the most bitter of lives. When Chen Feng had been at the Genetic Union, the deputy president had had to constantly worry about that fellow annexing the Genetic Union. Now that Chen Feng was out training, deputy president still needed to worry about any dangers that might befall him. This was the vision of the bigger picture someone at his position needed to have. However, the deputy president had been feeling that something was off. He frowned. \"Am I merely unhappy after falling for Chen Feng's scam?'</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry.\" By his side, someone comforted him. \"Qian Chen and Si Fan are there as well. Both of these children are peak beyond B classes, and they are among those with the greatest future in our Genetic Union. With them, Chen Feng will be safe.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully so.\" The unease in deputy president's heart was extremely intense. Qian Chen\u2026 Si Fan\u2026 Suddenly, the deputy president thought of something. \"Give me the information on both of them.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The information was shown. When the deputy president read about their strength, a trace of praise appeared in his eyes. The two of them were indeed geniuses. However, when the deputy president's gaze landed on the records of their past experiences\u2026</p><br/><p>Every single person would have a lot of recorded information about them. As members of the Genetic Union, almost every update of their profile would involve the inclusion of several thousand records detailing the new missions these members had undertaken since the last update. When all of these were added up together, it could reach even several hundred thousand records. The deputy president skimmed past the records at high speed before suddenly stopping on a certain record.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>On a certain day, contact with Qian Chen was lost at coordinate ***. This lasted five minutes. It might be due to enemy interference.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Something like a lost signal, especially during a mission, was in fact a very common occurrence. After all, things like enemy interference or even a mere battle could cause the signal to be lost. They had long been accustomed to this. Besides, this particular record was detailing a mission from a very long time ago.</p><br/><p>What roused the deputy president's curiosity wasn't the date of the incident; rather, it was the location of this incident. This record was something from a long time ago. As such, nobody had noticed it. However, subsequently, when some incident happened at that same place, it was recorded down. These were the coordinates of the destroyed headquarters of the Mysterious Organization.</p><br/><p>\"Therefore, Qian Chen lost contact with us at this place for five minutes?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president contemplated. An accident? Or a coincidence?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He opened the records for Si Fan's battle history. This time, he utilized the filtering function to directly search for what he wanted. With astonishment, the same thing had happened to Si Fan as well. She had similarly lost contact with the Union for several minutes here.</p><br/><p>The deputy president's expression sank. \"Damn it.\" If it were only one person, it might be a mere coincidence. But if it was two of them\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Contact Chen Feng,\" the deputy president stated abruptly.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, he might be in the midst of training,\" the technician reminded him in a low voice. They had been sending only data packets to Chen Feng, never disturbing him.</p><br/><p>\"Contact him immediately! Transmit the highest-tier warning,\" the deputy president spat gravely. He did not feel like providing an explanation.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" The employee immediately did as he had been told. Alas, nothing happened. Even though all their data packets were still receiving responses as usual, Chen Feng oddly did not reply to them, as if he was too busy for them.</p><br/><p>\"Something has happened!\" The deputy president's heart thumped. \"Send reinforcements to the Ownerless Land immediately. Get all the experts we have near the Ownerless Land to head there directly.\"</p><br/><p>Di! Di!</p><br/><p>The entire Genetic Union started bustling with activity. An unsightly expression was on the deputy president's face. He sincerely hoped that he was mistaken this time. Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>He sighed. This guy was akin to a walking calamity. Wherever he went, mishaps followed. He hereby vowed that when Chen Feng returned, even if he needed to tie Chen Feng up, he would do it to ensure Chen Feng stopped going out looking for death. But then, suddenly, the deputy president recalled how Chen Feng's present authority had surpassed even his own.</p><br/><p>\"What bullshit is this?\"</p><br/><p>His head ached. He prayed that nothing bad had happened.</p><br/><p>Alas, the reinforcements near the Ownerless Land indeed rushed over, yet there were no replies whatsoever. The Ownerless Land, which was originally a human territory, had seemingly transformed into a black hole, a black hole devouring all information and energy.</p><br/><p>Presently, at the depths of the Ownerless Land, Chen Feng's astonished expression slowly became cold. \"It's actually you guys.\"</p><br/><p>He had never imagined that the two who had been constantly helping him throughout the trip were actually puppets of the ancient race, believers of the White Religion. Even Luck Aura had failed to detect their malice toward him. No, that wasn't right. If they truly harbored malice, Luck Aura would not have failed to detect it.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at them. \"You two\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry.\" Qian Chen was still speaking as coldly as usual. \"I was indeed genuine and sincere when helping you. If it was a different enemy or the devil race, I would most definitely help you. However\u2026 I am truly sorry.\" He looked at Master Mu, his gaze becoming fanatical as he continued, \"It is my honor to have the chance to serve the White Church.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He gained a rough idea of the truth. Rather than puppets or controlling them, this was pure brainwashing. He had personally witnessed how terrifying the brainwashing process of the Mysterious Organization was. On regular days, those brainwashed would behave normally. Only when it pertained to the White Church would they suddenly become fanatical. Using their words, this was the so-called \"faith.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the gentle young lady Si Fan and saw her present the gene reagent to Master Mu deferentially before prostrating in a fanatical and emotional fashion. \"Greetings, Master Mu.\"</p><br/><p>Master Mu stood there loftily.</p><br/><p>Finally, Chen Feng understood. \"You have both been brainwashed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Spirit faithfully analyzed the situation for Chen Feng. \"It seems like they encountered this Master Mu before when on a mission. During the encounter, rather than killing them, Master Mu brainwashed them and then allowed them to return, waiting for the day when they would finally be needed, such as right now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Well done.\" Master Mo caressed Si Fan's face and said, \"You are very obedient.\" He gave Qian Chen a glance. \"The same for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\" With fanatical gazes, the both of them stood beside Master Mu emotionally. Evidently, receiving such praise was an utmost honor for the both of them.</p><br/><p>\"Now.\" Master Mu looked at Chen Feng. \"What else can you do? Do you have other spatial teleporting gene reagents?\"</p><br/><p>\"Master,\" Si Fan stated deferentially. \"I checked him earlier. He no longer has any.\"</p><br/><p>Master Mu laughed heartily. \"Hahaha. Not bad. Not bad, indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"So\u2026 this is your third plan for me?\"</p><br/><p>Master Mu smiled cruelly. \"Of course.\"</p><br/><p>He was rejoicing in the fact that his junior apprentice brother had helped arranged all this thoroughly for him before coming. Qian Chen and Si Fan were obviously his third plan to deal with Chen Feng, their role being purely to prevent Chen Feng's escape rather than to kill him.</p><br/><p>Finally, this Chen Feng, who had escaped them numerous times, who had even killed his apprentice brothers, had been forced to an impasse. This time, escape seemed impossible for him. Alas, just as Master Mu was about to finish this\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the diamond on his forehead flickered rapidly. Next, he staggered and nearly slumped down to the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

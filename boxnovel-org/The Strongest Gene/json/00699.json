Your threat level is much higher.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"Is that so\u2026\" He checked the luck value he had within his body. Thirty thousand luck value, a rather terrifying amount. If it was any other day, he would be incomparably excited by this. Alas, he was presently facing four resonators. He did not have the confidence to escape them.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou spoke faintly. \"I already have the surroundings blocked with a dimensional barrier. Do you know that I really, really like this name of mine? Because of it, a lot of people will take me lightly. What an amusing experience\u2026\" Sakata Chuunibyou smiled toyingly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>I miscalculated.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, have I been too arrogant?\" Chen Feng asked inwardly.</p><br/><p>Spirit shook her tiny head. \"No. To even have reached this point, you are already amazing enough. Even now, none of them realize that you are a mere awakened one.\"</p><br/><p>\"True\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng felt helpless. If he was truly a resonator of the godly power of luck, would he still need to waste his time talking so much with them? Unfortunately, his true realm was the awakened realm. Chen Feng started assessing his present luck value, thinking of using it to kill a way out of this.</p><br/><p>Wu Liang gave Chen Feng a glance and spoke. \"Don't worry. I won't give you any chances. Hehe. I have also set up a barrier with the godly power of the sword. Any chance of a loophole appearing no longer exists. This place is already thoroughly locked down by us.\"</p><br/><p>They all eyed Chen Feng and slowly approached him. Evidently, they were still afraid that Chen Feng still had some trump cards hidden. They didn't dare to advance too hastily.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave them all a serene glance. \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Truly no other choices? Well then\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. He did not know about resonance, nor did he know about the godly power of luck. However, what he knew was the fact that if the 30,000 luck value he had was fully activated, it would be sufficient to destroy heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\"Thirty thousand\u2026\" Chen Feng mumbled. If he activated it all with his full power\u2026</p><br/><p>Gazing at them, Chen Feng suddenly laughed. \"Do you guys want to know the terror of luck?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm?\"</p><br/><p>Thomas and the rest were instantly on guard.</p><br/><p>\"You guys have blockaded the surroundings. I indeed have no means of escaping. However\u2026\" Chen Feng gazed at the sky, stretched both his hands wide, as if he was about to hug someone. \"You all have still underestimated the power of luck.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the clear sky turned blood red.</p><br/><p>\"???!\"</p><br/><p>They all looked at the sky in horror. There, somewhere outside of their blockade, an immense spatial current appeared. Chen Feng was unable to leave. He was indeed trapped here. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Beyond that spatial current was actually the boundless outer space! A comet blazing with a red radiance was present charging directly at them. It tore the blue dome of heaven apart. It tore space apart, passing through the spatial current, descending upon this planet.</p><br/><p>\"!!!\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions changed greatly.</p><br/><p>\"You have gone crazy!\"</p><br/><p>Fear appeared on the faces of Thomas and the rest. Screw the Luck Goddess. What damnable strength was this?</p><br/><p>\"You will die doing this!\" Sakata Chuunibyou said in alarm.</p><br/><p>\"It does not matter. This way, we can all die together, right?\" Chen Feng had an expression of tranquility, seemingly completely accepting his death.</p><br/><p>\"Shit!\" Wu Liang cursed. Without a doubt, if that comet were to descend upon this planet, it would most certainly land right here, nowhere else. For users of the godly power of luck, this was something extremely basic.</p><br/><p>Fear appeared on Wealthy Zhao's normally calm expression as well. \"No!\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou was panicking. \"Chen Feng, stop it. We will not attack you anymore.\"</p><br/><p>\"It is already too late. Hahahaha!\" Chen Feng started howling with laughter. \"Die together with me! Hahahahaha!\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions sank. \"Madman!\"</p><br/><p>\"Leave!\"</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, they decided to leave. Just as Sakata Chuunibyou was about to leave, he found with astonishment that the comet's direction was in fact\u2026</p><br/><p>He inhaled deeply. \"The coordinates you have the comet locked on is in fact this stone?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed nastily. \"What else? Do you think I will allow you guys to escape smoothly?\"</p><br/><p>\"Madman!\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou tossed the stone away before leaving hastily.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The rest left speedily as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng continued muttering, \"Run! Run! Look at this comet\u2026 so big and round\u2026 Look at the trail it is leaving behind\u2026 so long and wide\u2026 How far will you guys be able to escape?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng continued laughing wildly in a deranged manner.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou and the others all completely ignored him, thinking of nothing but escaping. All their godly powers were pushed to the limit, trying to escape as fast as they could. That comet\u2026 and the radiance surrounding it\u2026 That was clearly not an ordinary comet. The moment it landed here, everything within a circumference of 500 kilometers would be destroyed. As such, they had to escape! Even if they couldn't escape in time, they should at least try to distance themselves from the center of the impact to reduce the damage they might suffer.</p><br/><p>\"Madman!\"</p><br/><p>\"Those with the power of luck are all lunatics!\"</p><br/><p>They all cursed in rage.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it. That bitch Luck Goddess did the same thing back then. Seeing as she was about to die, she dragged all the gods down with her, but she still had the guts to claim that she was actually sacrificing herself for the sake of all life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Slut!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Up in the sky, the red radiance was still as dazzling as ever, an omen of the coming apocalypse.</p><br/><p>Run! Run! Run!</p><br/><p>They all fled frantically.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Wu Liang coughed up a mouthful of blood, then stepped on his sword and fled with a speed several times faster than his previous speed.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Similarly, Thomas coughed up a mouthful of blood, then applied his godly power to his hatchet and, after giving Wu Liang a glance, rode on his hatchet as he fled, also at a much higher speed. At times like this, nobody would be bothered with whether their actions were embarrassing or not.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>As for Sakata Chuunibyou, he teleported forth without stop, exhausting his dimensional power. As for Wealthy Zhao, with a vicious expression, he ignited his wealth without stop. For him, wealth was the equivalent of strength, as he was capable of transforming wealth into true strength. Therefore, he rather treasured his wealth. His wealth was in fact not lower than the Stormtech Company's.</p><br/><p>But now\u2026 he had no choice but to ignite frantically ignite his wealth.</p><br/><p>Run! Run!</p><br/><p>The group of them fled while cursing Chen Feng. At the supposed point of impact for the coming apocalypse, Chen Feng was still laughing wildly as he looked at the coming apocalypse.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The sky turned blood red. Finally, it seemed like that comet with a terrifying radiance around it was about to descend upon this world. The apocalypse was imminent. At this instant, countless people worldwide were also focusing on this seeming coming apocalypse.</p><br/><p>And next\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The sky turned sunny and cloudless again. Instantly, all of the blood-red radiance vanished from the sky.</p><br/><p>The comet was gone.</p><br/><p>The blood-red hue was gone.</p><br/><p>The spatial current was gone.</p><br/><p>All the phenomena were gone.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng gave the sky a deep gaze before looking at his completely empty supply of luck value and sighing. \"Damn it. 30,000 luck value, yet I was only able to catch a glimpse of it?\"</p><br/><p>That's right. His luck value had been fully exhausted. How was it possible for a mere 30,000 luck value to actually create an apocalypse? The only thing it had been able to accomplish was allow them all to glimpse the sight of what the apocalypse would look like. What else could one wish for with this amount of luck value?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

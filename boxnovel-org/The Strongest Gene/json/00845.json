He understood now. This clone, which had always been synced with him, had accidentally encountered this mud on the alien world and had discovered that it was capable of blocking their connection. No, if that were all, it would not have escaped Luo Yuan\u2019s notice. The clone had to have noticed that their connection had been severed for some reason after entering the alien world. Subsequently, he had begun to have thoughts of disloyalty.</p><br/><p>In the past, regardless of whether it was the present world or an alien world, his clone would be always synced to him. As such, there had been no differences between the two. Now that their connection had been severed, a crack had appeared and the clone had decided to not return to Luo Yuan. After all, the clone was essentially himself, a person with wit and ambition.</p><br/><p>If so, what was the clone\u2019s goal? Suddenly, Luo Yuan\u2019s vigilance rose. The clone\u2019s goal should be the same as his own, obtaining control over the world, and his source of motivation should be the flower-like young lady as well.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan raged. \u201cYou are courting death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only had was clone being disloyal, he even dared to think of laying his hands on her. Luo Yuan was certain of the clone\u2019s motives. After all, the clone was as intelligent as him and shared the same memories as him. As such, they would have the same dream and ambition. This clone was simply another Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Hehehe.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan laughed. His aura rose without stop, causing everyone in his kingdom to tremble.</p><br/><p><em>Clone\u2026 you are courting death.</em></p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stood up. He had decided to make a move personally to take control of this traitor. Initially, he had planned to directly destroy this clone. However, this was quite a unique occurrence, and thus, he had to figure out the reason behind it. Otherwise, what would he do if his next clone betrayed him as well?</p><br/><p>This should not have happened. His cloning method was different than the regularly used methods, those comparatively trashy abilities that could create numerous clones with a shout or something. In fact. His clone was a truly independent and powerful body. It was simply a different Luo Yuan who possessed all his abilities. The clone had his consciousness, and when he and the clone acted, it was equivalent to two Luo Yuans moving together.</p><br/><p>This was also why he had dispatched a clone to fight Ye back during the godhood trial. After all, this clone was sufficient to do a lot of things on his behalf. Moreover, Luo Yuan was also capable of switching his clone body and his real body as he wished. They would forever be synced with each other. This was the strongest aspect of the cloning ability he had used.</p><br/><p>But now, everything had been severed. During the battle with Su Hao, he had lost his clone and even his main body had received a grave injury. Therefore, he had exhausted his power to create a brand new clone while also maintaining the highest level of vigilance while dealing with the new alien world he had created.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the final result was the betrayal of his clone. Alien world\u2026 The Crystal Palace\u2026 What exactly was in that world? Luo Yuan had to figure that out. It was impossible for him to go there personally. The alien worlds were too scary and dangerous. After the two mishaps he had encountered on alien worlds, he would not deliver himself to his death on an alien world. As such, the best solution was to regain control over his clone.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sneered. \u201cSo you think that some mud can block me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This clone was still too naive after all.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled before Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stepped forth into empty air and directly appeared above that brand new kingdom. As for the sort of resistance this kingdom might pose, Luo Yuan did not care. This was how domineering he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance descended. Above this brand new country, Luo Yuan\u2019s huge figure appeared. He immediately locked his attention on the palace, on the unique clone right in the middle of the palace. That person, despite his covered face, still possessed a figure that was exactly the same as his own.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan pointed forward. \u201cSync!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous beams of light surged forth. Instantly, a thread was created, linking the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn,\u201d Luo Yuan muttered.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance spread. Luo Yuan sneered. The connection between them took priority over everything else. With such a short distance, nothing could block their connection.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes went wide. What? Before him, that bright radiance faded after turning into various light particles. That distant figure appeared fine, and Luo Yuan himself was still not getting any information or feedback whatsoever from this clone. Moreover, he could even see a sneer at the corner of that clone\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>For the first time, that person opened his mouth. \u201cDid you truly think I had no way of dealing with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice\u2026 This was the voice of Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>That person proceeded to say something extremely astonishing: \u201cKnow this. What you know, I know as well. What I know, though\u2026 might not necessarily be what you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The clone waved his hand. Instantly, the space surrounding Luo Yuan collapsed. After all, he had only forcefully sent his projection here from his kingdom. As such, the amount of power available to him wasn\u2019t much. As such, facing such resistance, his projection immediately collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will return for you!\u201d Luo Yuan said with a cold gaze.</p><br/><p>The clone merely laughed coldly. \u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash of light, everything returned to normal.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was blasted back to his own kingdom. A deafening sound spread as Luo Yuan nearly destroyed his own palace in his fury. Luo Yuan raged. Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! That damnable clone! How long had it been since Luo Yuan had last been so infuriated? It had been a very long time indeed. He had never expected a day to come where he suffered a loss due to his own clone\u2019s scheming. As for the words that clone had uttered, they caused Luo Yuan\u2019s heart to chill.</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow this. What you know, I know as well. What I know, though\u2026 might not necessarily be what you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>These words\u2026 Just thinking about them caused fear to rise in Luo Yuan\u2019s heart. True, what the clone had experienced on the alien world was still completely unknown to Luo Yuan. What exactly had happened there? That clone was also certain that the real Luo Yuan would never dare personally step foot on that world. To be precise, that clone wasn\u2019t at all afraid that Luo Yuan would enter that world in the flesh. Why was that? Because that alien world was stronger? Or perhaps the clone had been subdued by the people of that world?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan did not know. And the unknown was the scariest. Luo Yuan had remained undefeated for way too long. This matter with the alien world was causing him to be somewhat crazed. He was now sure of one thing: that alien world, that so-called ability capable of creating an alien world based on a book\u2026 was in fact a Pandora\u2019s Box that should never have been opened! This applied to both Godly Model Creator and The Crystal Palace. If Luo Yuan were given a second chance, he would absolutely not touch them. Why had he even decided to copy that ability in the first place? Regardless, right now he had to focus on regaining control over this clone that had gone rogue.</p><br/><p>Hopefully, the clone hadn\u2019t leaked too much of his secrets.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stood up. A faint shiny silhouette took form before him. Despite the fact that Luo Yuan\u2019s cloning ability was powerful, it had a weakness. Only a single clone could remain active at a time. Under normal circumstances, when Luo Yuan formed a new clone, the previous clone would automatically dissipate into nothingness. As such, Luo Yuan was very curious about what would happen when a new one was formed.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>From within Luo Yuan\u2019s body, countless abilities were drawn out. His godly power dropped rapidly as the abilities converged before him to form a faintly shining silhouette, becoming a brand new Luo Yuan. This was precisely his new clone. At present, in the distant world of The Crystal Palace, Luo Yuan\u2019s clone was in the midst of fearlessly throwing insults toward Ming Yue and the others from his cage. Suddenly, an acute pain arose in his heart. The world before his eyes grew dark as his consciousness faded.</p><br/><p>This feeling\u2026 He felt fear as he realized something. He had actually been abandoned by his real self? Chen Feng had actually succeeded? How many days had it been?</p></div>\n</div>"}

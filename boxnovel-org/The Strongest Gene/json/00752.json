He only needed to urge the miniature person within him to perform the same action as him and he would be able to unleash power surpassing his imagination. But then, what exactly was this?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng himself was unclear. He had once conducted a study of other awakened ones and had concluded that this was not something all awakened ones possess. However, what he was sure of was the fact that this miniature person was not an external power like luck or misfortune. Rather, this power was uniquely his.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent.\"</p><br/><p>He was overwhelmed by emotions at this realization. He would have to think of how to increase his strength. As of now, his strength had already decreased from the temporary boost. What that huge monkey called \"temporary\" was truly excessively temporary, as it had only lasted three seconds.</p><br/><p>A true man, mused Chen Feng at the idea of three seconds being \"temporary.\"</p><br/><p>By the side, the monkey was somewhat dumbstruck. He looked at the sole remaining herb in his hand before looking at the row of destroyed trees. Since when was this herb so powerful? He seemed to recall that this herb would only provide an increase of a single level?</p><br/><p>Why did it feel like this Chen Feng had obtained an increase of around 10 levels? He could not make sense of what he was looking at. This was like someone eating garlic chives in the hope of providing some nourishment to one's body, yet they obtained the effect of Viagra.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The gaze with which the monkey was staring at him caused him to be somewhat dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\"This thing only lasts three seconds?\" he asked as he grabbed the other herb from the monkey's hand.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" The monkey contemplated shortly before gloomily saying, \"If it was something good, it would have been taken by the Grasshorde Tribe as well\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled. True. By now, he had a somewhat rough understanding of these two tribes. Both tribes were essentially monkeys, and they were always engaged in a struggle for resources due to their close proximity to each other. It was natural for them to be mortal enemies.</p><br/><p>\"If you want to increase your strength, you have to destroy the Grasshorde Tribe.\" The monkey confidently continued, \"The resources they have plundered from us will be sufficient for you to gain three levels.\"</p><br/><p>Three levels\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes burned as he heard this. Three levels\u2026 would allow him to reach level 8 awakened. Eight to the power of two\u2026 Mhm\u2026 Chen Feng licked his lips in anticipation. Alas, before that, they would have to first deal with the chief of the Grasshorde Tribe, the level 1 resonator. Chen Feng cooled his head shortly after remembering this. The future was indeed beautiful. However, this all required that he first keep a low profile and grow.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced over at the huge monkey. \"Don't keep urging me on. If I can defeat them, I will most certainly attack. However, you yourself are also clear on the strength of a level 1 resonator. That is a level that is even stronger than me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah,\" the huge monkey answered sadly. It seemed like this Chen Feng's strength was truly not sufficient to achieve that. Resonator\u2026 Godly power\u2026 Were they truly hopeless against one?</p><br/><p>He was clear that this time, with the resources plundered from them, those weaklings at the Grasshorde Tribe would be able to develop rapidly. As for them, their growth would be stunted. Slowly but surely, they would no longer be able to contend against the Grasshorde Tribe. Moreover, there was even a possibility that, after some time, they would be totally slaughtered by the Grasshorde Tribe.</p><br/><p>As he thought of this, the huge monkey clenched his fists in indignation. By the side, Chen Feng was not bothered. Even if the herculean apes were in a bad position, he could not afford to listen to the huge monkey and go throw his life away. He had to first guarantee that he had sufficient strength before he could proceed.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the herb in his hand, deep in thought. In this era, a lot of things had obtained the nourishment of godly power. As such, they all contained unique power. This was why the awakened ones of this era were able to continue growing. The reason for this reaction of Chen Feng's wasn't the power of this herb. Rather, it was because this herb was extremely familiar.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng fixed his gaze on this herb. Even if it was glowing and pulsing with faint godly power, if these \"special effects\" were removed, wasn't this the blue-leafed grass? This was an herb Chen Feng had once used when he had first become a gene producer. In fact, this herb had been the main ingredient of a certain gene reagent capable of providing a small boost in one's strength, an herb that would be normally used by the weaker ones when they were still at their starting point.</p><br/><p>And now\u2026 Chen Feng's eyes went wide as he realized something. Level 1 awakened was in fact a rather unique realm. However, there was no doubt that, in this era of gods, the awakened realm was the starting point for everyone. As for this herb? It was evidently also a comparatively weaker herb in this era.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart started pounding. If, during the genetic era, this herb had been used to produce gene reagents that increased beginners' strength, what if this current herb, nourished by godly power, was used to produce a gene reagent? At this realization, Chen Feng's lips went dry in excitement. Blue-leafed grass! Gene production! At this moment, everything seemed to have become clear.</p><br/><p>Back then, the growth of gene production had been stunted the moment humanity had reached the awakened realm. It was through great effort that Chen Feng had opened up a new path to enable gene producers to keep growing. But what if the stunt had not been due to gene production in itself? What if the problem had in fact been the materials?</p><br/><p>What if those materials had all received the nourishment of godly power? Would they now prove useful for awakened ones? Chen Feng was extremely agitated. Gene production had always been his career. Even though he hadn't been involved much in the development of the subsequent new gene production breakthroughs, prior to that, he had mastered nearly all the formulas in existence. Even without Luck Aura, he was still an undisputed grandmaster producer!</p><br/><p>\"If so\u2026 bring it on!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was filled with expectation. The blue-leafed grass could be used with several supporting materials to produce a low-tier gene reagent. This gene reagent, known as the allida reagent, was capable of providing a temporary boost in combat strength to the user.</p><br/><p>As for the reagent's odd name, Chen Feng reasoned that perhaps the creator of this formula had initially set off to create a different formula and had ended up with a battle-type reagent instead.</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully you won't disappoint.\" </p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gaze became sharp. Next, he got the monkeys to gather all the herbs in the vicinity. Ultimately, he found sufficient herbs to serve as substitutes for the lacking herbs in the original formula. Moreover, using these materials, the produced reagent could be even better than the original version.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started gene production. Unexpectedly, though, he had only just gotten started, yet the surging power contained within the herbs had already caused him to despair. A huge amount of time had to be spent before he could finally suppress that terrifying power.</p><br/><p>\"These materials\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took in a deep breath in shock. It was at this moment that he gained a clearer understanding of this era.</p><br/><p>Even if he was a grandmaster producer, he still had to exercise caution. This was not due to any mistakes he might commit during the production process. Rather, he had to maintain control over these materials. Fortunately, the allida reagent was ultimately a rather weak reagent. Shortly after, Chen Feng was done with his production.</p><br/><p>The produced reagent was a glowing light-blue liquid that was presently cupped within a leaf. At this point, Chen Feng faced a new problem. This place did not seem like a place with any reagent bottles. As such, he could not even store the reagent he had produced.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Only leaves?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm,\" the monkey answered. \"These are also the leaves we use to wipe our butts.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was rendered speechless. \"It has been hard on you guys.\"</p><br/><p>Forget it. He would first test the effects of the reagent. Without a reagent bottle, this reagent could not be preserved anyway. He might as well take it immediately.</p><br/><p>Gulp.</p><br/><p>Next, a blazing source of power seemed to pour into his body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, a terrifying aura erupted. Awe-inspiring power erupted from Chen Feng. The berserk aura caused even the herculean apes around him to repeatedly fall back in alarm. And then\u2026 nothing. The eruption suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\"A fake drug?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was somewhat dumbfounded. No, that was not the case. The huge monkey studied Chen Feng and noted that although that berserk aura was gone, Chen Feng's strength was higher than before, even if not by much.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stretched his hand out and immersed himself in his newfound strength: level 10 awakened. That's right. In a split second, the allida reagent had granted him an increase of five levels. For those in the awakened realm, this reagent would enable the user to crush all opponents.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the effect might not be as pronounced for those that were already strong to begin with, such as the huge monkey. After all, he already had the combat power of a level 25 awakened. A five-level increase was but a quarter of his total strength. Yet for Chen Feng, his strength had been directly doubled. No, to be precise, his level had doubled. As for his actual combat power\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His eyes gleamed coldly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He punched out without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Formidable power surged out. Within him, the miniature person did the same. Instantly, the power blasted out.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power swept out, causing all the trees in front of him to shake violently. Around him, all the monkeys were startled. In all their life, they had never seen these sturdy trees shake\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The trees shook violently. Shortly after, the shaking stopped.</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>The huge monkey scratched his head in confusion. That was because, despite the violent shaking, the trees had not been destroyed. This\u2026 What was going on? All the other monkeys were similarly puzzled. One ought to know that, initially, Chen Feng had been able to blast a tree apart with a single punch. Yet now, after consuming that weird liquid, he had merely massaged the trees instead of destroying them?</p><br/><p>As such, this liquid's function was to make one's attack look way cooler while reducing the might? This was the conclusion all the monkeys reached. Right at this moment, though, a cool breeze swept past the forest. Almost instantly, all the trees were reduced to ashes that dispersed in the air and waffled away along with that breeze.</p><br/><p>\"Hiss\u2014\"</p><br/><p>All the monkeys hissed in shock. As for the huge monkey, his eyes went wide. He was unable to believe what he was seeing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

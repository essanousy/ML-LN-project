Everywhere I went to get believers, you were always there first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake public your believers, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking nonsense\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods started casting their suspicions on the other gods. As for Chen Feng, he could only leave dejectedly. With this, the situation in the human world had calmed somewhat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey seem to be publicizing their believers one after another to find the culprit.\u201d Qin Hai had a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Chen Feng sighed and bitterly said, \u201cThey all looked down on me and forbade me from joining them. When the believers are split after the investigation, each god will probably get several million believers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hai merely sneered. \u201cHehe.\u201d He was certain that Chen Feng was the culprit. Why was he still pretending?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Hai said, \u201cIt has been two months, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm\u2026\u201d Chen Feng narrowed his eyes. The battle between the Sin God and that silhouette should have produced a result by now, right? If they hadn\u2019t gotten involved, the Sin God might very well have fallen this time. If that silhouette had been able to occupy the divine seat, it would indeed have brought the Sin God great trouble. However, due to Chen Feng and Qin Hai\u2019s involvement, the silhouette had been greatly weakened as well. As such, the result of the battle was now unknown.</p><br/><p>The Sin God would not die so easily. As for the silhouette, he was obviously not a simple person either. If the two were similarly not at their peak strength, their battle might result in their mutual destruction. This would be the best conclusion for Chen Feng. Suddenly, Chen Feng\u2019s heart jolted as he thought of this. Regardless of whether or not this happened, if he wished to be so, it would be so.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His senses returned to himself. Instantly, the faith, which was being split fairly, was adjusted so the Luck Goddess was the only person receiving any. She had originally been accumulating godly power for more than a month here. With this, she instantly broke through and became a major god again.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit\u2026 the rest will depend on you.\u201d Chen Feng transmitted his thoughts over.</p><br/><p>Spirit\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cYou are trying to\u2026\u201d Nevertheless, she had been with Chen Feng for quite a while. Despite her astonishment, she still as she was told without the slightest hesitation. Nearly all of her godly power was utilized for this task.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A massive amount of the godly power of luck started operating.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Chen Feng\u2019s godly power was nearly emptied. Despite this, the exhaustion never stopped. As the torrential faith arrived, it was instantly converted into godly power and then cleanly absorbed by the Luck Goddess. This was godly power being unleashed by a major god with all her might.</p><br/><p>The faith of the massive human population erupted, supplying her with unending godly power. This allowed the Luck Goddess to erupt with a power surpassing her realm.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The boundless godly power of luck started radiating. Noiselessly, all the power of luck was used to influence a battle that they couldn\u2019t even hope to lay eyes on. Perhaps the Sin God and that silhouette were battling it out now. However, only one result would be allowed. Ye could definitely not die, because if he died, the silhouette\u2019s plan would come to fruition.</p><br/><p>Although Chen Feng did not know who that person was, he had obviously planned each of his steps, and the death of Ye was definitely part of his plan as well. When that happened, the silhouette would probably be unstoppable. And thus, the silhouette was not allowed to win. However, he could not die either.</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s strength was too scary. The silhouette had only reached this level by existing beyond this world. That was also why Chen Feng had been given the opportunity to ascend. If that silhouette died, after Ye figured out everything that silhouette knew, something even scarier could very well happen. As such, the silhouette could not die either. Both of them had to suffer the same fate.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The endless godly power of luck surged up. Time slowly passed. One day, two days, three days\u2026 It reached the point that even Chen Feng himself did not know how many days had passed. On a certain day, a huge figure appeared in the sky. No godly power could be sensed from that figure, yet the figure\u2019s oppressive might was sufficient to cause all of creation to shudder in fear.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart trembled as he realized that Ye had returned. Finally, the exhaustion of the godly power of luck stopped as well. A result seemed to have been reached. Chen Feng took in a deep breath. He had no idea what the result of their battle was, nor did he know if the godly power of luck had been effective. After all, the target this time was truly too powerful. The only advantages Chen Feng had were Ye\u2019s temporary lack of a divine seat and his ignorance of both what they were doing and the existence of the two goddesses.</p><br/><p>If one thought about it, it was truly quite scary. The illustrious Luck Goddess unleashing her full power with the assistance of millions upon millions of believers had still been forced to act against Ye in secrecy. From this, it was apparent how scary Ye was. Fortunately, this had finally ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Ye is finally back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been waiting for Lord Ye\u2019s return for far too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damnable clown has been hiding for so many days. This time, we ought to get Lord Ye to drag that person out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were all furious. These days, they had been searching for clues without stop. The suspected gods had all been forced to publicize their believers. Alas, after half the gods had been forced to publicize their believers, they had still found no clues. Granted, they would still eventually discover the culprit if they continued investigating, but if Ye was willing to help, the culprit would definitely be found.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>In the sky, that huge figure descended. Just like always, Ye was cold and dreadful. Even without any godly power emanating out from him, his every motion still caused everyone to feel fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 No divine seat can be felt from Lord\u2019s body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis godly power has vanished as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he his hiding it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. A lord is, after all, a lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods no longer dared to stick to this topic. After all, Ye was an existence far surpassing them all. he was not one they could talk about. He was one who had started this era, the one giving this life to all these gods.</p><br/><p>They saluted Ye deferentially. \u201cLord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Ye\u2019s gaze swept past them, killing intent occasionally pulsing out. Whenever this happened, the gods\u2019 hearts would flutter. They did not know how they had angered this lord. Ultimately, Ye\u2019s gaze landed on the distant human world. At present, the entirety of the human world had entered an age of gods. All of the godless humans now had their respective faiths. They had all become believers.</p><br/><p>Nearly each human pulsed with godly power. The humans\u2026 had been fully split up by these gods.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>Ye tightly clenched his fists. His heart started burning with rage. After all, he had poured 12 years worth of effort into this world. His anger was especially pronounced when he saw that the tens of thousands of resonators he had cultivated with great difficulty had been transformed into the apostles of various gods. After all, the apostle\u2019s contract was irreversible.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all, very good,\u201d Ye said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the praise, Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were all overjoyed. As for Ye\u2019s present attitude, which did not seem too friendly? It did not seem to matter to them. After all, as far as they were concerned, Lord Ye had always been possessed this cold bearing. They had long grown used to it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

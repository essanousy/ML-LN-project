The Sin God\u2026 Ye\u2026 It was actually him for real! How was this possible? How could it be him? Had this not been a scam on the part of Chen Feng? Was this not a lie told by Chen Feng? This guy\u2026 This guy\u2026 They all trembled.</p><br/><p>\"How is it possible\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They did not dare believe that the Sin God was actually still alive and was actually this powerful.</p><br/><p>The Sin God smiled. \"I have to thank you all for this. After absorbing the blood, bodies, and godly power of several thousand gods\u2026 Ahh\u2026 This is truly too perfect. I don't know how much longer it would have taken me to recover without you guys.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Their hearts all shuddered. Everything they had done had been taken advantage of by this fellow. If they had known earlier that the Sin God was here, they would have most certainly been able to kill him by joining hands. But now\u2026 But now\u2026 Their hearts trembled. Several thousand gods had killed each other until only a hundred remained. As for the several thousand gods that had died, they had served as fertilizer for the Sin God, transforming into his source of power. With the pitiful little power the surviving gods had, how could they contend against him?</p><br/><p>\"No wonder,\" the Forest Goddess muttered. Earlier, she had been curious about why a mere minor god had been able to keep this world stable even as all the other gods were battling it out. Unexpectedly, this guy was indeed the Sin God. Finally, all the pieces of the puzzle had clicked into place. The entire god-slaying operation had started with the Sin God, and now, it was ending with the Sin God. They had finally confirmed the existence of the Sin God, yet they were no longer capable of contending against him.</p><br/><p>\"No, this is not possible. How is it possible that you can absorb all their power? Their godly powers obviously dissipated amid the air. How is it possible that you could absorb them?\" one of them roared. How was it possible to absorb godly power that had dissipated? On top of that, there was also the blood of those gods.</p><br/><p>They had clearly seen the blood seeping into the ground while the godly power dissipated and dispersed. How could the Sin God have absorbed it? This was not something the Sin God was supposed to be capable of doing.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. Didn't the legend you guys read tell you?\" The Sin God had a faint smile. \"Because\u2026 this is a world I created myself.\" He raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire world started spinning. At this instant, all the powers that had dispersed into nature, into the world itself, merged with the Sin God, becoming his. This, in turn, caused the hearts of all the gods present to jolt violently. They had finally recalled what they had read from the slabs\u2026 The Sin God had created his own world, and it was because of that that he had started fighting the Creation God. He wanted to gain comprehension on the true origin of a world, and he also wanted to gain comprehension on the methods to create a true world.</p><br/><p>They all despaired.</p><br/><p>\"How could things have developed this way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Sin God laughed toyingly. \"Welcome to my world.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Next, the godly power of sin swirled out, enveloping all the gods there.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, everyone in the Genetic Union was celebrating the disappearance of the gods. The primordial that had just descended had vanished yet again before it could even display its might. Humanity had once again returned to a godless era.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, the gods are all gone.\"</p><br/><p>\"Without gods, those resonators will not be able to borrow the power of gods anymore.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, now the resonators are nothing but stronger awakened ones. They are no longer as threatening.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is great.\"</p><br/><p>Countless people were overjoyed. On this day, countless people celebrated. This was a day of celebration for all of humanity, not to forget the ancients. Nearly the entire world was in a wild celebration. The rain had stopped, while the haze was receding, with the sun finally shining through. The warm sunshine bathed the world, giving everyone a feeling of warmth. From now onwards, this would again be an era of humans.</p><br/><p>The deputy president patted Chen Feng's shoulder. \"Many thanks.\" His face was rather flushed, a testament to how much liquor he had drunk in celebration.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew more than him how difficult it had been for humanity, and he was the only one who knew how anxious the higher-ups of humanity had been. Fortunately, everything had ended.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded, but he did not partake in the celebration. He walked over to a nearby summit and gazed at the sunny sky, his brows frowning.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, can you check for me if there are any problems?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit shook her head. \"I checked. Nothing.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was filled with doubt. \"Even you can't see it?\" Was it truly a misconception on his part? For reasons unknown, he had an uneasy feeling. He had already checked with Spirit and confirmed that among all his plans, no problems had cropped up and everything had been implemented perfectly. It was no longer possible for those gods to return. Moreover, they had even started fighting among themselves. Not many of them remained now. Chen Feng had confirmed all these things. Everything had progressed smoothly. So why was he still feeling so uneasy?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai sat down beside Chen Feng and said, \"I told you to not touch yourself that much. See, even your spirit is weakened now.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Is it because you haven't had anything progress so smoothly for a while now?\" Kong Bai curled his lips. Is Chen Feng's confidence truly so low?</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Chen Feng shook his head and said with a solemn expression, \"I am still anxious because the opponents are, after all, gods!\"</p><br/><p>God. This was no mere term or title. As a person with dual godly powers himself, he was clear how scary the gods were. Even with his present strength, when it came to pure combat strength, he would probably fail to defeat even the weakest of gods, let alone the several thousand gods that he had schemed against.</p><br/><p>\"The so-called gods are nothing but stronger life-forms,\" Kong Bai said in disdain.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"You are talking about minor gods. Those minor gods are indeed nothing but life-forms with stronger combat prowess. However, those major gods possess way too many things we do not understand. Those things\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at the sky. Those were exactly what he was worried about. After all\u2026 those were gods!</p><br/><p>\"What is there to fear?\" muttered Kong Bai. \"Regardless of how strong they are, they are all off of this planet now, right?\"</p><br/><p>However, just as he finished his words\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying flash streaked past the sky, startling countless people.</p><br/><p>This was now a godless world, yet that enormous bolt of lightning that had appeared was formed of godly power. A godly power that far surpassed anything they had felt thus far.</p><br/><p>Everyone was alarmed.</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Thunder roared as numerous enormous bolts of lightning descended and godly power enveloped the entire sky.</p><br/><p>\"What is that?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai and the rest were shocked as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's pupils shrunk. \"That is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Amid the boundless lightning, a figure suddenly appeared. This figure resembled a giant, and with a single hand, he ripped the sky apart, like someone tearing apart a piece of cloth. Instantly, the sky was ripped into two parts, presenting an extremely sinister view to all the onlookers below. Half the sky was clear and boundless, while the other half was filled with crackling lightning. Just like this, amid this bizarre sight, that figure stepped out. With a single step, boundless godly power roiled out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

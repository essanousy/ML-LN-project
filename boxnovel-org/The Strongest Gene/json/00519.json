The potential of the applicant is taken into consideration as well.</p><br/><p>Cost of certification: 100,000 yuan</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>This was a steep price for a lot of people. However, this amount of money was absolutely not a problem for advanced producers. If they couldn't even afford such sum with their identity as an advanced producer, their skill level was truly questionable. After all, an advanced producer should be able to earn that much money by randomly producing a single gene reagent.</p><br/><p>Such a steep price was also a mechanism put in place to prevent the disturbance caused by excessive attempts from intermediate producers. As for the content of this certification, it was rather slack. Basically, as long as the applicant had potential for growth and was not one of those producers who wouldn't make any sort of progress even after several dozen productions, the applicant would be accepted. After seeing the requirement for this certification, nearly all advanced producers made their move.</p><br/><p>Hou Liang was extremely anxious. \"Will this really be fine?\" The nurture of producers was akin to a huge pit. During the past few days, they had exhausted a huge amount of materials just to nurture several producers of their own organization to a sufficient level to start producing the beyond X gene reagent. If they were now required to nurture all advanced producers in existence\u2026 Even with Chen Feng's thick pockets, it still wouldn't be sufficient to fulfill what all these producers required to grow.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng, we can't keep this up for more than two days,\" Hou Liang stated seriously. \"Not all producers have your success rate in production. I have seen a huge amount of producers who still remain rookies even after more than a hundred productions.\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't have to worry about that.\" Chen Feng smiled. \"There are naturally sponsors for these materials.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>Hou Liang blanked. Right at this moment, Chen Feng finished arranging the mission he had on his wristband. The mission was sent out.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Beyond X Gene Reagent Conversion</p><br/><p>Conversion target: All genetic warriors.</p><br/><p>Conversion method 1, material conversion: One beyond X gene reagent for 10 complete sets of materials required for 10 attempts at beyond X gene reagent production.</p><br/><p>Conversion method 2, cash conversion: 100,000,000 yuan (This is a brand new formula. Hence, the success rate of all our producers is still below 1%. Please carry out your own calculations before deciding to purchase).</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Finally! As the genetic warriors that had been waiting for the gene reagents saw this, they all became agitated.</p><br/><p>Alas, they had never expected that the Gene Production Association would provide two methods of purchase for this gene reagent, with the cash purchase option being so incredibly high. Had they gone crazy? Even if the success rate was less than 1%, they shouldn't be selling it at such an excessive price, right?</p><br/><p>\"Let me do some calculation.\" One of them started calculating. \"Mhm\u2026 Moonlight grass, 1,000 yuan\u2026 Calm wind liquid, 2,000 yuan\u2026\" He kept jabbing at his screen to calculate the cost of production. As he was calculating, he paused. \"Sighing grass\u2026 38,000 yuan?\"</p><br/><p>Hold on. He was somewhat dumbstruck. This price\u2026</p><br/><p>The price he had used for his calculation was based on the average at the exchange for the past three days. These prices were all openly shown. He had truly never expected that the price of this sighing grass\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Why is it so expensive?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because there's no stock in the entire market. Since what Chen Feng is selling is only limited to advanced producers, his stock is considered internal resources and was not considered when the market adjusted the price.\"</p><br/><p>\"The hell. If this price is multiplied by 100\u2026\" Suddenly, he was alarmed. Shortly after, he finished his calculation. The sighing grass alone would already cost over 3 million yuan. Ultimately, a single beyond x gene reagent would cost 100,000 to produce. After taking into consideration the success rate of less than 1%, multiplying this cost a hundred times, it would truly cost 100,000,000 yuan to produce.</p><br/><p>\"So it truly costs this much\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Seems like we can only try to trade with materials.\"</p><br/><p>\"What a pity that it is so expensive.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's still better to trade with materials, after all.\"</p><br/><p>Now, their attention was switched to material conversion. It seemed like, compared to cash conversion, material conversion was more worth it. Based on the present market price of the materials, only around 1,000,000 yuan was required and they would be able to obtain a single gene reagent. This was so cheap that it was beyond one's imagination.</p><br/><p>\"It costs 10% of the production cost?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is such method of conversion even available?\"</p><br/><p>A lot of people couldn't understand the reasoning for this. They truly couldn't understand. With 100,000,000 yuan in cash, they could only purchase a single gene reagent, yet with materials worth 1,000,000 yuan, they could also purchase a single gene reagent. With sufficient money, only a single minute was required for them to purchase all the required materials for exchange from the virtual market.</p><br/><p>\"Is the Gene Production Association stupid?\"</p><br/><p>They felt powerless to even berate this stupidity. However, as far as they were concerned, this was absolutely good news for them.</p><br/><p>\"Buy, buy, buy!\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to gather the materials.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone entered the virtual community in excitement. Only at this did they find with shock that now, the sighing grass priced at 50,000 yuan that had been ignored by the masses for several days already was now being cleared from the market. As time passed, the price of this material increased without stop.</p><br/><p>The price increased to 60,000, yet it was still cleared from the market.</p><br/><p>The price increased to 80,000, yet it was still cleared from the market.</p><br/><p>The price reached 100,000, yet it was still cleared from the market.</p><br/><p>The price of sighing grass was still increasing! Toward the end, the market was truly short of stock. Even if one had the money for it, one couldn't buy it.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How did this happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"The production is still too low, but the demand is too huge.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's too expensive for us to buy it from the market, yet those sold at Chen Feng's shop can only be purchased by producers. What can we do, then?\"</p><br/><p>\"I shall go dig for these herbs by myself! Isn't this a mere material? If I can't even obtain something like this, how am I supposed to face others?\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I heard that a certain place has researched a brand-new method of growing sighing grass. However, this is a method only doable by genetic warriors\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Please introduce me to that place.\"</p><br/><p>The market was cleared of sighing grass. In helplessness, the masses finally started to develop the growth of sighing grass. In a short two days, several hundred research projects pertaining to the growth of sighing grass appeared.</p><br/><p>Energy growth\u2026</p><br/><p>Feeding growth\u2026</p><br/><p>All sorts of bizarre methods appeared. Among these, the most loved method was the method of creating sighing grass's unique habitat by using genetic abilities. This unique habitat would allow the sighing grass to absorb the energy within the habitat to grow rapidly. Some decided to use such a method to obtain sighing grass, whereas some decided to go to the dangerous wilderness to start harvesting sighing grass. With this, the pressure on the Gene Production Association when it came to the supply of materials was greatly reduced.</p><br/><p>Finally, after one week, before the reserve of sighing grass at the Genetic Union's warehouse was exhausted, a balance was reached between the materials provided by the genetic warriors and the demand from the gene producers. The genetic warriors were responsible for gathering and farming, and then they'd trade these materials at the Gene Production Association for beyond X gene reagents. On the other hand, the advanced producers were responsible for production.</p><br/><p>\"Yet another batch of producers has reached a success rate of 80%.\"</p><br/><p>\"A huge group of them have reached a success rate of 50%.\"</p><br/><p>Hou Liang compiled all the latest data in a report. During the past three days, with an unlimited supply of materials, those producers involved had produced with all their energy. Finally, they'd been able to become true beyond X producers.</p><br/><p>Granted, Hou Liang was of the opinion that with so many materials supplied, even the most idiotic of all could be trained. The appearance of every additional beyond X producer would greatly reduce the pressure on the Gene Production Association. This was because this signified that these people would be slaving away for the Gene Production Association for a long time.</p><br/><p>Hou Liang looked at the list of names of beyond X producers. He looked at the long list of points these producers owed the association, and then he laughed happily.</p><br/><p>In a single week, the production and marketing of beyond X gene reagent entered the proper track. With the spur thanks to the development of the growth of sighing grass, despite the somewhat pressured supply of materials, it was still able to somewhat satisfy a huge amount of genetic warriors. Presently, the crowd of genetic warriors at the entrance of the Genetic Union was long gone, all busy harvesting materials.</p><br/><p>At the same time, more and more beyond warriors appeared. Beyond B, beyond C\u2026</p><br/><p>Earlier today, a beyond D class warrior even appeared, causing quite an uproar. This uproar was due to the fact that even now, a lot of A class and B class warriors had yet to grasp the power of beyond. Only now did the masses realize one thing: one's comprehension of the power of beyond seemed unrelated to one's strength?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

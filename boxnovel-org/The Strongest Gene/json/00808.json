Those who erred have received their punishment. As for that person, he is long dead. What else do you want to do?\u201d What happened back then was the tragedy of the era. A lot of people had erred. Subsequently, those people had paid a disastrous price. Luo Yuan had not even needed to do anything himself. Once he grew to an alarming height, the respective families of those culprits took the initiative to seize those people and drag them to Luo Yuan, forcing them to kneel before him and ask for forgiveness. They had declared that they would deal with those people.</p><br/><p>Most of them were crippled, truly crippled. Since the young missy was dead and Luo Yuan had been crippled once, if they wanted to stay alive, they at the very least had to cripple everything they were capable of. And thus, that incident had come to an end with the elders forcing those people to cripple themselves.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan had agreed to that, and with a gentle smile on his face, he had watched on as those people crippled themselves. With that, the incident had been considered over and done with. Alas, nobody had expected Luo Yuan to actually have such ambition. In the wristbands he had created, he had left behind something terrifying. When the time was finally ripe, that thing had erupted and controlled everyone, including the world.</p><br/><p>Why? What exactly was he trying to do? Nobody knew the answer. Was he making everyone kneel before him just for revenge?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s father looked at Luo Yuan coldly. \u201cDo you want me to kneel to you as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was natural that his wristband hadn\u2019t forced him to kneel. He did not care if all of humanity was threatened by Luo Yuan. He did not care if the gods were threatened by Luo Yuan. What angered him was the fact that something had appeared from his wristband and entered his body as well. His son was trying to gain control over his body as well?</p><br/><p>This was not something he could put up with. His son was trying to control even him! The newcomers all rebuked Luo Yuan in anger.</p><br/><p>The higher-ups of humanity were filled with anger. Evidently, they had never expected that after surviving the descent of the primordial and the awakening of the gods, they would now suffer under the hands of a fellow human. How lamentable. How hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yuan, give me an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you truly feel so happy to have the world revolve around you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous questions were being pushed forth. Luo Yuan maintained his silence. As for the various gods witnessing this scene, they were incomparably alarmed. Heavens, these humans dared to talk to him in such a manner? One ought to know that this person had been able to fight Ye to a standstill. The various gods remained kneeling, not daring to stand up. They could clearly feel a sense of anger bubbling up within Luo Yuan\u2019s body. That terrifying aura was now on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Luo Yuan bellowed.</p><br/><p>Plop! Plop!</p><br/><p>One by one, the people questioning him knelt down.</p><br/><p>Some of them howled in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yuan, you dare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow audacious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am your third uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout me, could your Stormtech Company have reached this height?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should have eliminated you back then. What a thankless wretch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPiss off!\u201d said Luo Yuan, his eyes gleaming coldly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He clenched his right fist. A terrifying power bloomed suddenly, and the old men shouting at him were instantly decimated, turning into dust, dying in body and soul.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence. A lot of them still had their mouths opened, ready to shout at Luo Yuan. Yet now, all of them stopped, covered in cold sweat. Looking at the ashen-faced Luo Yuan, they had finally realized that at present, their lives were within Luo Yuan\u2019s grasp. Those that resisted him would surely die.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A lot of people trembled, unable to find anything to say. Should they continue scolding him? They did not wish to die. Right now, Luo Yuan did not seem like he would listen to reason.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s still the same.\u201d He laughed a rather sinister laugh. \u201cExactly the same as back then. Back then, when forcing me to give up on her, this is how you people behaved. For my well being, for the future, for humanity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan laughed. \u201cYou people always come up with numerous reasons to give me, yet none of you have ever mentioned that what you people truly care about, what you guys want me to do is precisely for your own well-being as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t that incident been put to an end already?\u201d someone asked with a sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas it ended?\u201d Luo Yuan found this funny. He spoke coldly. \u201cWhen Stormtech Company matured, you people finally came to apologize. You made my rivals back in the day cripple themselves. Did you guys seriously believe that this could be considered an apology?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the old men could not understand. \u201cYou yourself chose to forgive them back then. If you hadn\u2019t actually forgiven them, why didn\u2019t you kill them back then?\u201d Back then when they dragged those people to Luo Yuan, they had been prepared for those people to die. However, Luo Yuan had not killed anyone. He had merely forgiven everyone with a smile on his face. Yet now he had reneged on his words?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stared straight at them. \u201cThat is precisely the most lamentable part. Do you people know what was I reminded of when I saw the unyielding gazes of those forced to apologize to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone maintained their silence, not daring to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey reminded me of myself.\u201d Luo Yuan gazed at the starry sky. \u201cWe\u2026 were geniuses. Even though they were weaker than me, they were nevertheless still geniuses. Alas, people like us, our lives could never belong to us. We were nothing but puppets, puppets controlled by you old bastards. This applied to me as well as them. In fact, in the incident back then, they were not truly guilty. After all, everything we young geniuses did was under the guidance of you old geezers. What kind of authority did any of us have at that time? Thus, I never hated them. The ones I hate are you people\u2026 and the system of human society as a whole!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, his gaze was filled with killing intent. Those people all lapsed into silence. So it turned out that the ones he hated were actually them? They shut their eyes, wondering if what they had done was indeed wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you need to do, then.\u201d One of them looked straight at Luo Yuan and said, \u201cSince the system is what you hate, do it. There are way too many families and clans that have grown over the ages to an immense size. Only by completely destroying everything will this system truly collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already prepared to die. He was of the opinion that since Luo Yuan was still angry, it would be fine if they allowed him to vent his anger. However, to his surprise, Luo Yuan merely laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know? The era has changed. If this were still the Genetic Era, I would truly do that. Unfortunately, this is now the Gods\u2019 Era.\u201d A bizarre radiance flashed in Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes as he uttered these words.</p><br/><p>This was the era of the gods, an era filled with numerous wonders and miracles. Impossible tasks were now possible. His initial plan had indeed been to collapse the entire system, turning the entire world upside down. However, when his understanding of the world grew, when he found out about the Primordial Era, when he gained understanding of the era of the gods, he had started studying the so-called miracles, even though these miracles had always remained legends.</p><br/><p>As he studied, his plan had slowly changed. Now, his plan was on the verge of completion.</p></div>\n</div>"}

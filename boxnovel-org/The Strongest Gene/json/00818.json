So the meaning of this was the final victor of this battle would still be Luo Yuan? These clouds\u2026 and these hints\u2026 Had that girl reached this level as well? Was Luo Yuan, even without the numerous life-forms under his control, still so powerful? Chen Feng had no answer to that.</p><br/><p>He took in a deep breath. \u201cIn any case, I still have to give it a try, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He condensed all his strength, and just as the various gods were duking it out with Luo Yuan, an incredibly mighty power shot out of Chen Feng\u2019s hand. This was the strongest power Chen Feng could erupt with at present. This attack utilized both luck and misfortune and was amplified by his fake nascent soul.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power erupted, instantly piercing through Luo Yuan\u2019s chest. Luo Yuan, who had still appeared so mighty earlier, appeared to have been directly killed by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the entire world lapsed into silence. The various gods looked at Chen Feng in shock. Holy shit, a one-hit KO? They were all alarmed. This strength\u2026 As for Chen Feng, he frowned. That did not feel like an illusion. The impact had felt solid, proving that his attack had indeed hit Luo Yuan. Was he truly dead?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a heavy sound echoed.</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>Again.</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s hearts pounded together with this sound. What sound was this? Everyone instinctively looked in the direction this sound had come from. Astonishingly, the sound had originated from Luo Yuan\u2019s body, which was sprawled helplessly on the ground. There, something seemed to be pounding.</p><br/><p>Dong! Dong!</p><br/><p>Akin to the throbs of a heart. Slowly, the frequency of the poundings became concentrated. As for Luo Yuan\u2019s body, which had been utterly trashed earlier, it suddenly recovered and even appeared somewhat stronger than before. Boundless power seemed to be converging in his body.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled a certain ability.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Name: Nine-Lives Cat</p><br/><p>Class: A</p><br/><p>Function: Protects the user\u2019s heart when fatal damage is received. The power of the damage received will be converted into a recovery power to instantly heal the user. The user\u2019s strength will be fully recovered and will even increase.</p><br/><p>Limitation: Only usable nine times in a lifetime, with an interval of no less than one year between usages.</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>It was actually this ability! Chen Feng was alarmed.</p><br/><p>This was an extremely rare ability, yet it was also incredibly useless. Why? Because this was an A-class ability. \u201cA class\u201d generally signified formidable battle prowess. As such, those that selected this ability would forever be weaker than their peers that selected a combat ability. A user of this ability would never be able to defeat those at the same level as them, since they would not have a combative A-class ability.</p><br/><p>And thus, despite this ability\u2019s astonishing survivability, it was rarely chosen. Moreover, Nine-Lives Cat was an incredibly rare gene in the first place. Chen Feng could remember that, according to the formula, one had to be sure that the selected nine-lives cat had never used this ability once in its life. Otherwise, the cat\u2019s genes would not be usable. The number of times the cat had used this ability would be deducted from the person that had selected the genes of this particular cat. This was the saddest part of this ability.</p><br/><p>And thus, those that coveted this ability had to first use a unique method to kill a cat with nine lives without giving it any chance to resurrect. This was also why very few people chose this ability. Yet this was an ability that Luo Yuan had. Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something extremely terrifying.</p><br/><p>This was merely one of the many abilities that granted resurrection. There were various other resurrection abilities in existence as well. Even though they were all extremely rare, they still existed. And since they existed, wouldn\u2019t Luo Yuan have them as well?</p><br/><p>Definitely. After all, Luo Yuan had the abilities of nearly every life-form in existence. If so, these resurrection abilities\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng hissed in shock. He finally understood the meaning of those clouds. If they continued fighting on in this manner, they would totally be outlasted by Luo Yuan due to Luo Yuan\u2019s collection of astonishing resurrection abilities. They would never be able to truly kill him. With hundreds or even thousands of resurrection abilities in his arsenal, could one truly kill Luo Yuan?</p><br/><p>Moreover, all of these resurrection abilities were unique. Some might resurrect someone who died from curse abilities, or from the abilities of fleshly bodies, or even from spiritual abilities. Regardless of the method used to kill Luo Yuan, he would have a way of resurrecting himself. Killing him was fundamentally impossible.</p><br/><p>Dong! Dong!</p><br/><p>Slowly but surely, Luo Yuan fully recovered.</p><br/><p>His aura seemed to be even stronger now. As for the injuries he was still carrying from his battle with Ye, many of them had now healed. The Luo Yuan that was about to emerge from his resurrection seemed to be incredibly terrifying.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not hesitate.</p><br/><p>Retreat!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Bringing Qin Hai and the others with him, he speedily fled. After all, they had already accomplished their main goal here. Even though they had failed to kill Luo Yuan, they had still severed his foundation and his rapid growth. In the future, they could slowly look for an opportunity to kill him. After all, they could afford to wait now.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and the others instantly vanished. When the surrounding gods saw this, they all blanked. Left\u2026 just like that? Luo Yuan had resurrected. He appeared even stronger now. They had initially believed that Chen Feng would continue his barrage of attacks, allowing them to sneak some cheap shots at Luo Yuan as well. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng had departed without any hesitation. They all exchanged glances in dismay.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, they were all startled awake from their stupefaction. If even Chen Feng had fled, what were they doing, staying here? Waiting for death?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the various gods fled as well. As the heartbeat\u2019s frequency increased, Luo Yuan finally completed his resurrection.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He woke up from the darkness. A mighty power shrouded his body. His previously injured body was now fully healed. The Sin God had had various cards up his sleeve. As such, facing death, he had erupted with numerous trump cards capable of instantly killing major gods. As for Luo Yuan, he only had one trump card: his seeming immortality.</p><br/><p>What he had put the most effort in, the only collection of abilities he had truly organized among his numerous abilities, was his collection of recovery and resurrection abilities. These abilities had been reorganized to create a complete recovery system for himself, with each of these abilities closely interlinked together. As such, he did not fear death. On the contrary, after being killed, he would come back even stronger. This was his ultimate trump card.</p><br/><p>He howled with laughter. \u201cHehehehe.\u201d Amid his wanton laugher, his body continued its transformation. He had returned!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A surging aura blasted out.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng! Don\u2019t you want to fight? And the damnable gods! Don\u2019t you guys want to take advantage of the chaos? Damnable fellows, let me show you guys what true strength look like!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura converged around him. It was at this instant that Luo Yuan finally opened his eyes for the first time since his resurrection. His sharp eyes gleamed and numerous razor-sharp beams shot straight toward the distant horizon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it on!\u201d he shouted. Next, he stood there dumbfounded. His tsunami-like surging aura even paused awkwardly, not knowing where it should actually head. Where were the enemies? Luo Yuan had a stupefied expression on his face as he looked at the empty battleground around him. Chen Feng was not here. The various gods were not here either. One could say that, within a thousand miles, there was not a single life-form.</p><br/><p>You all\u2026</p><br/><p>You all\u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sensed the boundless power converging within his body, waiting for the right moment to erupt. His heart, which had previously been brimming with a heroic mood, went taut.</p><br/><p>How can you guys be like this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

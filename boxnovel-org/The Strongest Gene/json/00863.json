The few gods that had escaped had learned of Xu Fei and the others\u2019 strength. Now, the gods could only hide from them. After all, they were now facing three people at the level of true gods. With this, the eight major gods began to flee everywhere, looking quite sorry. Gradually, they managed to understand the characteristics of those three.</p><br/><p>They found out that the fellow called Xu Fei enjoyed going to places with bodies of water so as to gaze at his own body. Therefore, so long as they avoided areas with water, they wouldn\u2019t encounter him. Thus, the gods running around aimlessly were no longer willing to approach areas with water. Everyone headed deeper into the continent.</p><br/><p>They also found out that the fellow called Kong Bai wandered around randomly. The moment he saw someone, he would ask those he met who the most handsome man was. At that time, the person in question would have to give the correct answer: \u201cKong Bai is the most handsome man.\u201d That guy seemed to have forgotten his own name, yet he still held stubbornly to this belief he used to have. Therefore, so long as they provided the correct answer, they would normally be able to survive any encounters with Kong Bai\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Naturally, this did not apply to gods that were too handsome. There was a case where a certain handsome god was sneered at and killed immediately after that god told Kong Bai that he, Kong Bai, was the most handsome. Afterward, when any handsome gods were unlucky enough to meet Kong Bai, the first thing they did was disfigure themselves. Moreover, they had to do it for real, as they wouldn\u2019t be able to trick Kong Bai otherwise. This was the only way to preserve their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the ugliest! Kong Bai is the most handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>These were the words those gods normally used. Hearing this, the elderly Kong Bai would leave, satisfied. As for the handsome god that had just disfigured himself, his heart ached so badly that it was suffocating. Having to do this just to survive was the ultimate shame for him. However, what could he do about it?</p><br/><p>After Kong Bai\u2019s departure, a god came over to help the disfigured god. \u201cAre you fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>That god sighed. \u201cYes. However, I don\u2019t think my face will ever recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was no need for that anyway,\u201d the other god said. \u201cAfter all, your looks were quite average at best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disfigured god sighed. \u201cHow could I be sure, though? Previously, a god with rather average looks was killed by Kong Bai. That was the moment I realized that even us with average looks are much better looking than Kong Bai. Therefore, disfiguring ourselves is the only solution,\u201d he said painfully.</p><br/><p>As the other god heard this, he was instantly horrified. So it had reached this point? The god heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cLuckily, he did not notice me.\u201d He prepared to leave with the disfigured god. The moment he turned around, he saw a lone figure standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 Who is the most handsome man in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>That god began to drip wet with sweat. He had actually encountered this fellow for real! It was over!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Compared to Xu Fei and Kong Bai, Qin Hai should be the safest one to encounter. He seemed to still be busy cultivating. So long as one didn\u2019t disturb him, he wouldn\u2019t kill them. After all, it was quite clear for everyone to see that boundless might had gathered in that sword of his. That was a result of a lifetime of cultivation. Therefore, nobody dared to give his sword a try.</p><br/><p>After all, when holding that sword in hand, Qin Hai\u2019s aura alone was sufficient to kill. That was too terrifying, too alarming. They knew that Qin Hai\u2019s strength must definitely be above the other two. He was the scariest person here, yet as far as they were concerned, Qin Hai was the also safest person to encounter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. So long as we hide, it will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were all cautious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo only those three are left among all of Chen Feng\u2019s people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut based on the information we had, there are more than three on Chen Feng\u2019s side, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure either. Perhaps some of them were unlucky and were directly killed by time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><br/><p>They nodded. In their memories, the youngest of Chen Feng\u2019s group was a person called Wu Hui. If he had been unlucky enough to encounter a reversed time flow for several decades, and if he didn\u2019t have any kind of immunity toward time, he might very well have died from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s really only the three of them left. Be careful. At the very least, we have to last until Lord Luo Yuan emerges from his cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, so long as Lord Luo Yuan emerges, we will be able to survive this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their hearts were already filled with fear by this point. Right at this instant, a figure appeared in the distance. Their faces fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it. Run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t run. The faster you move, the faster that bastard Xu Fei\u2019s pursuit will be. I heard that he inherited bloodlines from a turtle and a dragon. Damn it, this is the first time I have seen a turtle run so fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain god suddenly said seriously, \u201cTurtles can truly run fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was rendered speechless. However, at this time, nobody bothered to spare any effort to respond to him. After gulping, everyone stared vigilantly at the distant figure and prayed in their hearts that this person was Qin Hai. They would only survive if this was Qin Hai. After all, they would have to disfigure themselves if they encountered Kong Bai. If they encountered Xu Fei, death would be certain. Qin Hai was the only one they could survive.</p><br/><p><em>Please be Qin Hai! </em>the gods prayed. When they finally got a good look at that figure, they heaved sighs of relief. There they could see the elderly figure of Qin Hai. He still looked as solemn as ever, and a sword was still held in his hand. Step by step, he walked in a certain direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d The gods were all secretly delighted. They had managed to avoid disaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cFast, move out of the way. Do not obstruct Qin Hai\u2019s way,\u201d a god said. Nobody was willing to be the cannon fodder that was killed by Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a god asked, \u201cIs Qin Hai really that strong? Is it possible that he only looks scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, they had been tricked way too many times by the humans. Therefore, they began to suspect whether this Qin Hai only looked scared. After all, if he was truly that strong, why hadn\u2019t he begun killing them?</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d a different god said. \u201cIf you have a death wish, don\u2019t drag the others down with you. Have you forgotten about Kong Bai and Xu Fei? Hehe. Qin Hai is even more intelligent than them and has better innate talent. Moreover, he has always been stronger than them. Now that all three of them have neared the limits of their cultivation, do you truly think that he is a weak person?\u201d that god said coldly.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the other gods lapsed into silence. True, this was Qin Hai. Carefully, everyone moved out of the way and awaited Qin Hai\u2019s departure. Alas, right at this moment, an indistinct voice suddenly waffled out from Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t even open, yet his voice somehow managed to travel out. \u201cAlmost there\u2026 The Divine Sword has been forged. Now, I will have to baptize the sword in blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>These simple words sounded like thunder in the ears of the nearby gods. Damn it! They couldn\u2019t be this unlucky, right? Killing? Baptize the sword in blood? These words were acutely heard by them. They exchanged glances. If Qin Hai decided to start killing to give his sword a baptism in blood right here and now\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Flee! </em>They didn\u2019t hesitate. The gods immediately turned around and began to flee. Right this at moment, they could seemingly see Qin Hai waving the sword he held in his hand.</p><br/><p>The gods\u2019 hearts chilled. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>A single slash swept past. The majority of the gods there were directly cleaved in two. That terrifying power actually instantly killed a group of major gods. Heavens, that was only a single slash.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The few lucky survivors frantically continued to flee. They failed to even notice that a faint smile had formed on Qin Hai\u2019s face. With this, all the gods now knew of the horror known as Qin Hai. He was the strongest of the three! Soon, other gods began to encounter Qin Hai as well. They were so shocked they ran everywhere in disarray. However, Qin Hai seemed too lazy to even be bothered with them. He was still immersed in that sword of his. However, there were some unlucky gods that encountered Qin Hai when he required a baptism of blood for his sword. And thus, the gods came to a realization: Qin Hai\u2019s decision to kill or not to kill was completely random.</p></div>\n</div>"}

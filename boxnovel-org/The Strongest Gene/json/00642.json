However, without anyone guiding you, you will forever unable to achieve resonance,\" Duma stated without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>So that's the case. Chen Feng contemplated. Since Duma didn't dare to mention it, he would stop asking.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed bitterly. \"It seems like I have been busy for nothing again.\" He had initially believed that he would be able to learn a lot of things here. However, after gaining some understanding, with great helplessness, he found that without using the power of resonance, nobody was any better than anyone else. After all, all the awakened powers were merely supplementary effects of the awakening.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>This applied to even Duma. As such, he could stop dreaming about learning anything too powerful here.</p><br/><p>\"If so\u2026 I have one final question.\" Chen Feng looked at Duma. \"Since you have such strength, are not part of the ancient race, and have also witnessed the birth and fall of numerous races and even lived through countless eras, why would you partake in the Holy War?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Duma raised his head abruptly. Holy War\u2026</p><br/><p>Compared to the distant Primordial Era, the Holy War was akin to something that had happened a short while ago, to the point that everything that had happened at that time was still vivid in his mind. So vivid was his memory that he could still remember that the Chen Feng and Qin Hai before him had also been there during the Holy War back then.</p><br/><p>Duma shook his head. \"Have you forgotten my duty? Ancients, devils, and humans, I don't really care who wins in the end. Otherwise, do you think I would have allowed the humans and ancients to integrate?\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng blushed with shame. That was true. If Duma had truly wanted to get involved in the affairs of the ancient race, those minor schemes Chen Feng had used on the ancients would have been pointless. All of humanity might have been destroyed instead.</p><br/><p>\"The rise and fall of a race is as the natural order should be and is unrelated to me. Back then, the only reason I got involved in the affair pertaining to the barbarians was because of their chief\u2026\" Duma frowned and continued, \"He employed a primordial power! From somewhere unknown, he obtained some fragments of primordial items and nearly caused a resonance. I was forced to act.\"</p><br/><p>Primordial\u2026</p><br/><p>Resonance\u2026</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng understood everything clearly. So it was because of that. If so, the barbarians hadn't been destroyed for nothing back then after all.</p><br/><p>\"How about the devils\u2026\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"They surprised me as well.\" Duma's head ached. \"I was only forced to act on the barbarians. Next, it should have been the time for the devils and ancients to grow and further develop with the absence of the barbarians. Unexpectedly, scenes of me participating in the war were spread. Perhaps I had defeated the barbarians way too easily back then, scaring the devils to the extent that they all started slumbering.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless when he heard this. So it turned out that the devils entering their slumber had been unexpected. This\u2026 If those devils were to find out the truth, they would probably be so angry that they started turning in their graves, right?</p><br/><p>\"You must pay more attention to that stone,\" Duma said with a solemn tone. \"The moment the power of resonance is activated, it will be unstoppable. The Primordial Era might descend upon this world once again. Therefore\u2026 regardless of which primordial power it is, the moment it appears, you must destroy it. There's also that pink power\u2026\" Duma pondered and spoke solemnly. \"I will teach you some techniques to search for and capture primordial powers. You will have to finish the job.\"</p><br/><p>New technique acquired!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng walked out of the palace and sighed deeply. He had initially come to increase his strength, yet ultimately, he had instead learned some scanning and scouting techniques that could be used on primordial powers. As for his personal combat power, there hadn't been many changes.</p><br/><p>He pointed at the empty air three times.</p><br/><p>Disintegrate!</p><br/><p>Disintegrate!</p><br/><p>Disintegrate!</p><br/><p>He could feel the empty air disintegrating. This was a power far surpassing the comprehension level of an ordinary person, so powerful that one couldn't even begin to imagine its prowess. However, even something so powerful was merely a supplementary effect of the power of resonance?</p><br/><p>Resonance\u2026 how powerful was it?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart chilled. Despite how powerful and attractive such powers were, if possible, Chen Feng did not wish to witness the appearance of such a power, since nobody knew what would happen afterward. Well, for now, he should first focus on dealing with the escaped pink power. Chen Feng shook his head and discarded his extra thoughts.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With Spirit's assistance, Chen Feng was able to master the techniques quickly.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint light wave swept out. From a certain distant location, a faint aura traveled back to him. It was precisely the pink origin that Chen Feng had encountered previously.</p><br/><p>\"Found you.\" Chen Feng was happy at the discovery. This technique to search for primordial powers was much more powerful than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the pink origin was actually located within a human city in a certain flourishing metropolis.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had an ominous feeling. \"Not good.\" He had once experienced himself how scary this thing was. If the pink decided to attack without prejudice, something might happen to an entire city with a population of several million residents. As he thought of this, Chen Feng rushed over.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, Chen Feng arrived in the city. Even without using the searching technique, he was already able to feel the existence of the pink origin. Following after the aura, he was able to locate it soon after.</p><br/><p>However, when Chen Feng saw the pink, he froze. He had guessed that the pink would probably latch upon another person. However, he had never expected that the pink would actually select her! Xie Zhongtong!</p><br/><p>At present, the scantily dressed Xie Zhongtong was having \"fun\" with a group of people. Numerous hands roamed her body, and numerous peculiar voices resounded amid this alley.</p><br/><p>This fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. Xie Zhongtong and Han Yula had gone through numerous hardships before they had been able to put this wild side of hers under control and finally been able to be together. Unexpectedly, something had still happened to her. Initially, he had believed that due to their experiences together, at most, Han Yula would suffer a little amount of green[1] 1 . But now, it seemed like the green on Han Yula's head was as wide as a grassland, to the point that horses could run on it.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng flashed over and was about to act when he suddenly saw the dazed expression in Xie Zhongtong's eyes. Instantly, he was alarmed. This appearance\u2026 Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stopped moving and observed carefully for a short while. Finally, he confirmed one astonishing fact. That powerful and mysterious primordial power was in fact enjoying this! That's right, the pink power was enjoying being caressed by this group of people here.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was truly startled. \"This\u2026\" This was a primordial power! These people should be akin to bugs and tools for this primordial power! Yet this power was actually enjoying this\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Could it be\u2026\" Chen Feng took in a deep breath. \"Such a dreadful power has actually been influenced by Xie Zhongtong's nature?\"</p><br/><p>If that was the case, how \"passionate\" was Xie Zhongtong as a person for her to even influence a primordial power?</p><br/><p>\"It's possible,\" Spirit agreed without hesitation. \"In fact, after that senior apprentice sister was possessed, the pink was influenced by her to a certain extent as well. That is why the pink hated you so much. However, that senior apprentice sister's willpower seemed rather ordinary, as toward the end, she was fully under the pink's control. As for this Xie Zhongtong\u2026 and if this is truly the pink origin\u2026 based on the strength of that senior apprentice sister after fusing with this pink origin, the moment this pink fused with Xie Zhongtong, the power was sufficient to cover this entire city,\" Spirit deduced seriously. \"That senior apprentice sister's ability is merely charming, controlling one's mind. As for Xie Zhongtong, she can induce a mass breeding season! Her only weakness thus far is that her strength is too weak. But after fusing with the pink power, this weakness no longer exists. This is what's scary about this situation. The moment Xie Zhongtong unleashes her full power, this entire city, the several million inhabitants, nobody will be able to escape.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started to imagine the scene where, after this incident, numerous new videos were uploaded onto those amateur porno websites. As he thought of that, his head ached. Perhaps that was the reason the pink power chose Xie Zhongtong? The only mishap was that, after latching on to Xie Zhongtong, the pink power had surprisingly been influenced by Xie Zhongtong's nature instead and had started enjoying all this\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Scary.\" Our dear friend Han Yula is truly pitiful.</p><br/><p>Spirit continued deducing seriously. \"It doesn't matter. In any case, he is already so green that his heart is hopeless. Why would he bother with increasing the intensity of his green? He is already so green that he's a forest now.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed endlessly. From the alley, bizarre panting sounds resounded without stop. Spirit was still making deductions. \"From her expression, tone, and her bodily reaction, she will be fully engrossed in this state of utter bliss soon\u2026 The moment you act, she will be jolted awake from this state of utter bliss in an extremely miserable manner. At that time, there is a 96% probability that she will then unleash a wide area attack. The possibility of this entire city falling victim is incredibly high. Therefore, I suggest that you don't do anything for now and continue observing the development.\"</p><br/><p>This was Spirit's proposal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It is pointless for you to eat this young master here. My purity is too high, so high your idiotic scarab race can never hope to absorb it. Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.\" The little turtle ran as he screamed. Chen Feng and Qin Hai watched on with amazement. So this fellow was actually the spirit turtle of the scarab race.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Duma chased after the little turtle in a frenzy. Chen Feng and Qin Hai watched on and allowed this to drag on. In any case, they could end this the moment Xiao Ying found the source of the pink energy. Alas, at this moment, the little turtle howled, \"Qin Hai, why are you still not saving me?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"We have known each other for so many years. Even if there are no emotions between us, there should be some degree of bromance, right?\" the little turtle cried for help.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Each time I saw you, you were in master's pot. Where was the bromance?</p><br/><p>\"I knew of your identity as a human, yet I never exposed you,\" the little turtle howled. \"What's that saying of the humans? Familiarity begets fondness. We have been together for so long, there should be some fondness by now, right? Quick, save me!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Who in the world was together for long with you? If you don't know the human sayings, don't use them in such a misleading manner, all right?</p><br/><p>The little turtle screamed miserably. \"Ao\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\"Is there a need for this?\" Qin Hai rolled his eyes. \"This is not your first time being eaten. Why are you struggling so bitterly?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it's not the same!\" the little turtle screamed. \"This stupid Duma seems off today. If I really get eaten by him today, I will most probably be gone for real. Holy shit, I have no intentions of being food for real!\"</p><br/><p>Gone for real\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Qin Hai exchanged knowing glances.</p><br/><p>\"What should we do?\" Qin Hai asked.</p><br/><p>\"Save him,\" Chen Feng said without hesitation.</p><br/><p>What they had said earlier about foodies had, after all, been a joke. For Duma to have given up on Chen Feng and Qin Hai even in this situation where he was being controlled and instead concentrate on chasing after the little turtle, there was only a single possibility: the little turtle contained boundless energy. If Duma ate the turtle, he might very well become even stronger. This was what they were worried about.</p><br/><p>Therefore, no matter what, the little turtle had to be rescued!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Both stood up instantly, thinking to stop Duma.</p><br/><p>Duma waved his hand casually. \"Scram!\" A formidable power enveloped both Chen Feng and Qin Hai. This was still the power of time.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng tried to destroy time.</p><br/><p>Destroy!</p><br/><p>The black diamond on Qin Hai's forehead shone.</p><br/><p>Extinguish!</p><br/><p>In a well-practiced manner, they destroyed the power of time enveloping them only to discover that in fact, a long time had passed in the outside world.</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The little turtle was already on the verge of being captured.</p><br/><p>\"Time\u2026\" Chen Feng's head ached. If they faced Duma with brute force, even if the power of time would trouble them, they could still keep Duma busy. But now, Duma only needed to use his power of time to create a time difference to render the both of them completely useless.</p><br/><p>\"This won't do,\" Qin Hai said with a solemn expression. If this continued, they would never be able to save the little turtle.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng concentrated his gaze. \"Time\u2026\" This power was too scary, seemingly flawless. Even if he could destroy Duma's ability with brute force, he would still be affected by the power of time. As such, he and Qin Hai would always be too late to rescue the little turtle. They were both awakened ones, yet the difference between him and Duma was so very large. If not for the abnormal state Duma was in, Duma could probably eliminate both Chen Feng and Qin Hai any time he wished.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The two moved and were once again trapped in time. It was the same time difference ability Duma had used earlier.</p><br/><p>\"Let me think\u2026\" Chen Feng rubbed his head. The flow of their time would forever be slower than Duma's. This wouldn't do. However, they had no access to powers capable of contending against the power of time. Therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>Hold on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something. Time! Yes, time! Duma was not the only one with the power of time. Chen Feng had an ability with the power of time as well. Time Quicksand! His eyes shone brightly.</p><br/><p>He couldn't control, change, or absorb time like Duma; he could only exhaust time. However, if he could use it in an appropriate manner\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, he moved. Duma wasn't the least bothered. With a casual wave, the power of time was unleashed again.</p><br/><p>Time Quicksand!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Time jumped forward. Whether it was Chen Feng or Duma, Qin Hai or the little turtle, everyone's time leaped shortly.</p><br/><p>One second!</p><br/><p>And the power of time unleashed by Duma vanished noiselessly within this one second.</p><br/><p>Success!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. Now! Move!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance erupted. Duma's pink claw that was about to land on the little turtle was smashed away by Chen Feng, brushing past the little turtle.</p><br/><p>\"You actually managed to arrive\u2026\" Duma's eyes gleamed coldly. The time difference ability he had unleashed had actually been broken by Chen Feng. That was the power of time! How had this kid\u2026For the first time, he looked at this young human seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Hahahaha. Kill him!\" The high-spirited little turtle stood behind Chen Feng. \"You pink turtle, actually thinking of touching this young master? Just you wait to be transformed into turtle soup!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Had this fellow forgotten that he himself was also a turtle?</p><br/><p>\"Interesting,\" Duma said in a deep voice. He had never believed in coincidences. During that split second earlier, he had sensed a familiar power. The time difference he had unleashed had actually skipped to the future. \"You possess the power of time skip?\" Duma sneered. \"In that case... let me show you the power of unlimited time skips.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His four pink claws stood on the ground. A faint chronal power shrouded his surroundings, a powerful force lingering within.</p><br/><p>What is this? Chen Feng and Qin Hai frowned. Everything felt fine for them.</p><br/><p>And yet, as they were about to make a move, their expressions changed greatly. At this moment, they finally understood the function of this new ability Duma had unleashed.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng raised his hand, clearly feeling his movement slowing down.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fear appeared on his face. Lag! Time Lag! His line of thought had already been transmitted. His body had already moved. And yet his reaction time was evidently slower by one or two seconds now. Even after his brain stopped urging his body to move, his body would still continue moving for an extra one or two seconds due to inertia. This\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took a deep breath. Lag, a term that should only exist in online games for him. He had never imagined that a day would come when he would even lag in real life, and for it to be so scary! This was a feeling he hadn't felt for a very long time. In his memories, the last time he had suffered such lag and ended up killed in a ridiculous fashion by his enemy had been in his previous life when he'd played a game called PUBG.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>In a flash, he and Qin Hai were blasted away, since their movements were now lagging behind. Their brains were able to move at normal speed, but everything else lagged. Their entire bodies seemed to move much slower than before. This was the scariest aspect of lag. This time, they were in deep trouble.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

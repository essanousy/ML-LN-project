Chen Feng's gaze swept past her, and suddenly, he blanked.</p><br/><p>Spirit blinked her huge pair of eyes. \"Hey?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng thought of something. \"If it's you\u2026\" What if Spirit was the one displaying the deduced ability? After all, Spirit didn't have a physical body, and thus would not have any problems regarding body structure. With this, the hardest issue would be solved.</p><br/><p>Spirit shrugged. \"But I am merely an illusory existence.\" After all, she had been created by Chen Feng's spiritual consciousness. She had no true body and was incapable of exerting any sort of control over Chen Feng's power.</p><br/><p>\"I know,\" Chen Feng replied with bright eyes. \"But he can.\"</p><br/><p>He pointed. In the corner, a tiny red snake was stretching there. Blankly, Xiao Ying raised his head. Why was everyone looking at him suddenly?</p><br/><p>Spirit was surprised. \"Xiao Ying?\" Indeed, Xiao Ying and Chen Feng were in a symbiotic relationship. If she used Xiao Ying, it would indeed be possible for her to make use of Chen Feng's power. If Xiao Ying was used as an intermediary, with her being the one to circulate and unleash this power\u2026</p><br/><p>Spirit was overjoyed as she considered this possibility. This might very well succeed. In fact, Xiao Ying was the most optimal choice to try using the power on behalf of Chen Feng. Alas, due to his rather low intelligence, if he was told to control such a complicated power, he might kill their own people with it instead. As such, they would have to rely on Spirit.</p><br/><p>Spirit was somewhat anxious. \"Will this be fine?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at her seriously. \"Trust me.\" At a time like this, they had no other choices.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" A serious expression appeared on Spirit's face, a rarely seen expression on her face, causing her to look rather adorable. Now that the problem concerning body structure had been solved, the next step was to look into the energy system. Chen Feng's awakened power was essentially an entirely different power than the devil expert's awakened power. The power displayed by the devil was a power capable of freezing space, whereas Chen Feng's power remained unknown. Under normal circumstances, Chen Feng would have to go through countless tests before optimizing this awakened power into something that was truly his.</p><br/><p>But now\u2026</p><br/><p>He looked at Spirit. \"Let's just do our best!\" Spirit nodded resolutely. At present, they had no choice but to force it. And thus, as the attack of the devil expert was about to land, when everyone was frozen, a shadow flashed out of Chen Feng's body. Suddenly, the entire world darkened. That flash was the only radiance in this world, so very dazzling.</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>The devil expert looked over in amazement. There, on Chen Feng's body, a translucent radiance flashed out and a beautiful figure appeared. In her hand was a red sword presently pointed at the devil expert.</p><br/><p>The devil expert sank into a solemn mood. \"What is this?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The red sword slashed downward. Instantly, an astonishing power erupted.</p><br/><p>The devil expert's expression changed greatly. \"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The space frozen by the devil expert started rocking.</p><br/><p>The devil expert was shocked. \"How is this possible?\" This was a power he had unleashed under his full power. That fellow\u2026 that Chen Feng still had this move up his sleeves? No, he could not be allowed to continue this.</p><br/><p>The devil expert moved. \"Kill him!\" His body flickered and instantly appeared before Chen Feng. Since he couldn't kill Chen Feng by freezing space, he would personally smash Chen Feng apart!</p><br/><p>\"Die!\" He smashed down ferociously. Right this instant, that translucent figure before Chen Feng solidified. Finally, the devil expert got a clear look at that figure. Instantly, his body shivered.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The red sword slashed down. Instantly, the terrifying power slashed through the devil expert.</p><br/><p>The devil expert stared at the figure with an unbelieving expression. \"You\u2026\" Blood flowed out of his body without stop.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>He stared at the figure, stared at the long sword in her hands and sensed that formidable power, his gaze focused on that beautiful face. His eyes were filled with shock, alarm, a speck of adoration, and disbelief all at the same time.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha.\" He let out a tragic laugh as his body slowly turned into ashes amid the flame. Even after being reduced to ashes, numerous odd expressions could be seen from the flame.</p><br/><p>Hey?</p><br/><p>Spirit blanked. She kept feeling like this fellow was looking at her with an odd gaze.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The devil expert's body transformed into nothingness amid the flame.</p><br/><p>Dead.</p><br/><p>Dead?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng blanked. He knew that something different would be the result when Spirit and Xiao Ying tried using his power. However, he had never expected that they would actually be able to kill that devil expert so easily. With a single slash, the devil expert had been killed. The devil expert had died way too easily. That slash\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"He feels weird.\" Spirit recalled that devil expert's final moments and said, \"Perhaps his energy was on the verge of total exhaustion? After all, he unlocked the seal through the ignition of his life force.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Perhaps.\" He gazed ahead. The flame turned into nothingness. Once again, darkness returned to this region.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Along with the devil's death, the frozen space was released. This region recovered to normal, and the president and the rest were able to once again move. They looked around. The devil was no longer there, only Chen Feng alone.</p><br/><p>They were all shocked. \"You have actually reached this level?\" When they had found out that Chen Feng was already an S class, they had been extremely shocked. But it was only now that they realized how terrifying Chen Feng was. This guy was far stronger than a regular S class. This was evident from the indignant look the devil had had in his eyes when he'd died.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was absolutely an S class that was different than the others. The S-class devil had been dealt with. This had been extremely difficult. However, different from what they had expected, there were no S-class genes left behind. The body of the devil expert had been reduced into nothingness amid the flame. As such, there was no hope of producing an S-class gene reagent.</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>The president sighed. They had been stuck at peak beyond A class for so many years. In the end, they still had no chance of stepping into S class.</p><br/><p>Li Lei looked at Chen Feng curiously. \"How did you enter S class?\" Everyone looked over uniformly as they heard the question. They wanted to know the answer as well, since the devil expert had mentioned that it was impossible for a new S class to appear here in this world.</p><br/><p>Even the president hadn't even touched upon the gates of S class after so many years of cultivation. How had Chen Feng broken through? They were curious.</p><br/><p>\"I broke through on a different world,\" Chen Feng told them truthfully. \"Previously, when I was being hunted, I landed in spatial current and accidentally arrived on a unique alien world. After breaking through there, I escaped back to this world.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence. If it wasn't for Chen Feng's serious expression when he was speaking, they would have thought that he was lying. Spatial current? Alien world? It wasn't that they did not believe that such things existed. Rather, the probability of that happening was so incredibly low. An alien world! The probability of that happening was as low as the probability of humans finding a world habitable for humans in the universe. No, it was even lower. Even if they could discover a suitable world, the probability of life-forms existing there as well was\u2026 terrifyingly low. There was also the probability of surviving the spatial current and the probability of actually returning again.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had not told them in detail and had only use a single \"escape\" to describe his return. This, coupled with the fact that even as an S class, he had still had to \"escape,\" signified how dangerous it had been. After experiencing all that, he had actually returned alive! This luck\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They will be able to handle it,\" the person beside him stated unhurriedly. The reawakening of the devil race, the reappearance of the ancient race, both of these had caused the Genetic Union to have way too many things to deal with. As such, they could only spare a small amount of manpower for the defense of Star City.</p><br/><p>\"There has been a new breakthrough in our research to counter the black rain. You might be required there\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"A powerful devil race has likely been reawakened at some unknown region.\"</p><br/><p>\"At a certain location, traces of the ancient race have been found.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>One update after another was received. As he saw these updates, he could only sigh.</p><br/><p>Star City\u2026 You guys have to rely on yourself now\u2026</p><br/><p>Presently, at Star City, the recently cleared sky was once again enveloped in darkness. The souls of the devil race members were all revived from the darkness as their corpses started moving again, akin to an undead army. This was precisely the effect of that pink diamond.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>All the devil race members were resurrected.</p><br/><p>They stared at the numerous devil race members in despair.</p><br/><p>\"How are we supposed to beat all this?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced at them. \"What are we afraid of? Barbarian squad, go deal with those huge devil beasts. Xu Fei, as usual, go deal with that meatball. Han Yula, you will have to deal with that tiger. As for you, Kong Bai\u2026 choose what to do accordingly.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the chaotic battlefield was reorganized clearly by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Among these resurrected devil race members, the trickiest ones to deal with were assigned to different people accordingly by Chen Feng. As for the rest of the ordinary devil race members, the remaining Genetic Union members should be sufficient to deal with them.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances and once again made their move. After resurrection, the bodies of these devil race members were much sturdier. They had higher endurance, as they were now essentially undead. However, their gazes were all empty, and their overall combat power was also obviously lower than it had been when they were alive. This was the single piece of good news. Everyone accepted their assigned task easily. As for Kong Bai\u2026</p><br/><p>He laughed wildly. \"Hahahaha! You guys are actually even uglier now?\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Next, with astonishment, everyone noted that Kong Bai appeared even stronger now. He was obviously a mere B-class genetic warrior, yet he was now capable of crushing those A-class devil race members. \"Come at me, you ugly bastards!\"</p><br/><p>Accompanied by his wild laughter, Kong Bai started wreaking havoc on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>Devil race members were slain by him without stop. Everyone exclaimed in admiration as they saw this. How powerful. Despite being a B-class warrior, he was actually able to unleash a combat power equivalent to a late stage A-class warrior. This guy called Kong Bai could very well reign high above all of them in the future. This was a person who would most certainly stand tall above everyone else in the future. Alas, his looks were truly somewhat lacking.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Thanks to Chen Feng's arrangement, the advance of the resurrected devil race members was stopped. Despite their increased durability, these undead devil race members were obviously somewhat weaker now when it came to attacking. As such, all their attacks were blocked. As for Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>A succession of abilities was stuffed right into the female ancient race member's mouth.</p><br/><p>\"You!\" She was furious. If these were abilities that were actually powerful, she would treat them as normal attacks, but these abilities of Chen Feng's were incapable of even damaging her hair. These abilities were no different than trash! In fact, Chen Feng's act of spamming these abilities at her was akin to someone spitting at her. Even more vexing was the fact that she couldn't do anything to stop him. Her killing intent surged. \"You have no idea what exactly is it that you are doing!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely chuckled calmly as a response. \"Hehe.\" From the initial release of his God Punisher until now, he had never stopped.</p><br/><p>Two hundred\u2026</p><br/><p>Four hundred\u2026</p><br/><p>Six hundred\u2026</p><br/><p>Through training, Chen Feng was already capable of unleashing 200 abilities per second. However, to unleash all his abilities, 32 seconds were still required. The reason for this was because he had built up his history of used abilities from the initial 2,300 abilities to the current 6,400 abilities.</p><br/><p>In fact, this was a rather easy feat for him. With Myriad Illusions and his unlimited Wind Blades, Chen Feng was able to unleash a huge amount of abilities each second. As long as he utilized a small amount of luck value, he could release a huge amount of abilities he had never used before, building up his history of used abilities.</p><br/><p>As such, discovering new abilities contained within his Myriad Illusions hadn't posed him many problems despite the fact that the majority of these abilities were actually rather useless abilities and were only there to make up the numbers.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>With 6,400 abilities and a firing rate of 200 per second, a total of 32 seconds was required for a full release. This was, in fact, an extremely unreliable cast time. It was truly fortunate for him that the three old men were blocking that female ancient race member for him without even realizing that they were doing him a favor. And now, from the start of the release, 20 seconds had passed.</p><br/><p>So far, a total of 4,000 abilities had already been unleashed by Chen Feng. Now, when his abilities were unleashed, the amplification had already reached 40 times. Alas, as the abilities he was releasing were still too low in level, they were still ineffective against the female ancient race member. For example, low-level abilities such as Wind Blade.</p><br/><p>With Chen Feng's present strength, even an amplification of 40 times wouldn't be of any use when it was applied to such an ability. Therefore, for everyone present, Chen Feng was still spamming trash abilities. Toward the end, 21 seconds, 23 seconds, slowly, time passed until the final few seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>All the support, defensive, and low-level attacking abilities were nearly done being unleashed. At this moment, Chen Feng's eyes lit up. It seemed like it was nearly time. He adjusted his posture slightly. This small detail went unnoticed by anyone. The three old men were thinking that Chen Feng was merely trying to distract the female ancient race member, while the female ancient race member was thinking that Chen Feng was purely trying to humiliate her. As such, nobody spared much thought to this action of Chen Feng's. After all, the difference in their strength level was too huge for Chen Feng to make any difference.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>As the full-scale battle erupted, that female ancient race member was no longer able to hold her anger in. This was especially true after some sticky and mucus-like abilities were spat right onto her face. Finally, she raged. \"You are all courting death!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Her pink radiance surged. In the sky, a huge eye flickered before vanishing. Next, the pink diamond on the female ancient race member's forehead started shining brightly as a power that caused one's heart to flutter began to appear. This power signified the descent of the main body!</p><br/><p>\"Not good!\"</p><br/><p>\"She is actually trying to summon her main body here into this clone of hers!\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, has this woman gone crazy?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's expressions changed greatly. The descent of the main body! Although this was not the arrival of the main body in the truest sense, this long-range forceful arrival of the main body into the clone was an ability that would damage even the user herself greatly. This signified that both the clone and the main body would both receive huge damage.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" She sneered. Despite the high price she had to pay, as long as she could kill these annoying bastards, everything was worth it. \"Die!\"</p><br/><p>The radiance around her hands bloomed. Her first target: the three clones of the superexperts in front of her that had yet to react to what was happening.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>A terrifying pink ray streaked past.</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Instantly, one of the clones vanished.</p><br/><p>The deputy president was horrified. \"You are crazy!\"</p><br/><p>This ancient race member had gone crazy!</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>She pointed once again, destroying the second clone. And now, among the three top experts of the Genetic Union deployed here, only the deputy president remained. Finally, the female ancient race member's gaze landed on him.</p><br/><p>The deputy president's scalp felt numb. \"It's over.\" He was clear that the moment all three of them were eliminated, the entirety of Star City would fall.</p><br/><p>\"Descend!\" He howled furiously. A terrifying radiance shone dazzlingly as the deputy president tried to summon his main body as well. Only by doing this would he stand a chance at stopping this female ancient race member. Alas, it was too late.</p><br/><p>\"Naive.\" The female ancient race member pointed midair.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the clone of the deputy president froze midair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

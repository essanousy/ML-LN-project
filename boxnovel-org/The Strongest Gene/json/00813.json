Why he had been hiding in outer space not doing anything and why he had been able to surpass gods with the body of a human, everything had been answered. If the wristband communicators he had created were capable of duplicating all abilities for his own use, Luo Yuan was able to copy everyone\u2019s abilities, including the gods\u2019.</p><br/><p>When Wu Hui had created the shadow, he had created it slowly. Only after leaving a deep impression in everyone\u2019s heart did the shadow become exceptionally powerful. How about Luo Yuan? He had not needed to slowly build it up; he had only needed to create an identical silhouette and everyone would imagine a similar level of strength based on the impressions Wu Hui had carved in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Ah, this is the silhouette. Ah, this fellow\u2019s strength should be similar to the shadow\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>And thus, they had failed. The same applied to Qin Hai\u2019s swordplay. Luo Yuan had reaped his hard work, unleashing an identical sword. However, this so-called \u201cidentical\u201d wasn\u2019t a pure duplication of the sword. What Luo Yuan had copied was in fact the very ability that generated the sword. This signified that\u2026 When Chen Feng thought of this, he had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He instantly retreated with the others.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, swirling radiance appeared around them. Next, a huge cube appeared out of thin air, locking them within.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound you guys\u2026\u201d Luo Yuan laughed lightly. \u201cDid you believe that I would be so childish as to play along with completely identical abilities? You guys are mistaken. I was merely delaying while looking for your position\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Luck Aura was ineffective against Chen Feng, he\u2019d had no choice but to manually search for them. Fortunately, he had succeeded in finding them.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The faint radiance condensed, completely sealing Chen Feng\u2019s group within.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is actually there. Hold on, he seems to have been trapped?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yuan is actually this powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods all exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>They had initially believed that this would be a battle where any side could win. Unexpectedly, the fight had just started, yet Chen Feng\u2019s group had been utterly defeated. Luo Yuan was truly too powerful, so powerful that it was suffocating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have no way out now,\u201d Luo Yuan said coldly. Finally, everything was over. That damnable 1% had been giving him a feeling of discomfort. Now that he had finally trapped Chen Feng\u2019s group, he would not allow Chen Feng any chance of victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to escape. This trap has been laid with no less than 12 of the strongest sealing godly powers,\u201d Luo Yuan said with a sneer.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried breaking the seal. Indeed, nothing worked. Using 12 types of sealing godly powers for this\u2026 All Chen Feng could say was that this man was indeed worthy of being Luo Yuan. His power was indeed exactly as he had guessed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \u201cSo such a terrifying power actually exists in this world?\u201d An ability capable of copying all abilities was truly too powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Luo Yuan smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s so powerful about this ability? At first, this ability was weak it was pathetic, to the point that the Genetic Union didn\u2019t even bother registering it in their list. You have no idea the path I threaded to reach this point. You will never know\u2026 what I have experienced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Name: Copy</p><br/><p>Class: F</p><br/><p>Function: Copy an ability, making it the user\u2019s own ability.</p><br/><p>Requirements:</p><br/><p>1. The copying process takes more than three days.</p><br/><p>2. During the copying process, this ability needs to be constantly touching the copy target.</p><br/><p>3. During the copying process, the copy target needs to be constantly using the ability to provide comprehension. After successful comprehension, the copy will immediately succeed.</p><br/><p>Limitations:</p><br/><p>1. Unable to upgrade.</p><br/><p>2. Only one ability can be copied per month.</p><br/><p>3. After a successful copy, the user will only obtain the target ability\u2019s initial form. The user need to cultivate and practice the ability himself to make it strong.</p><br/><p>4. After fusing with this genetic ability, the user will not be able to fuse with any other genes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014-</p><br/><p>Copy, an ability proven to be complete trash immediately after its discovery. The so-called \u201cthree days\u201d was in fact the minimum requirement. If the target did not use the copied ability with great frequency, much more time would be required.</p><br/><p>It could only copy once per month, and it could only copy the basic version of the ability, and this ability could not be upgraded. This, in turn, caused this ability to be labeled as trash. It was said that someone had once tried using this ability. That person had tried to copy the ability of a senior of his. Subsequently, that senior had gone out on a hunting mission and continuously used the target ability for half a month before Copy finally succeeded.</p><br/><p>That was the proof that three days was indeed the minimum requirement. Half a month? One was better off buying some gene reagents they could directly use. After all, that had been in the Genetic Era. Moreover, that test had been done on an ability of a similar class. What if it was used to copy an ability of a higher class? Mhm\u2026 More time was required. It was said that it might even take more than a year.</p><br/><p>So what was the point of obtaining this ability? Even scarier was the fact that after fusing with that genetic ability, one could not fuse with any other genetic abilities. This damnable ability had too great a rejection toward other genes. This signified that the moment one fused with this ability, one would never have any other abilities.</p><br/><p>All additional abilities could only be gained via copying. F-class abilities weren\u2019t too bad, but E, D, C, or abilities of an even higher class? Hehe, in any case, all those that had tried doing that had died. And thus, ultimately, this ability had become known as an ability that was good for nothing within the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>This had lasted until Luo Yuan obtained this ability. For Luo Yuan, who was starting anew after crippling himself, his success rate when fusing with other genes was already incredibly low. And thus, he selected this unique gene. With one attempt, he succeeded. Next, he started his journey of gene copying.</p><br/><p>Originally, this should have been to be a slow and arduous journey. However, on a certain day, Luo Yuan managed to copy an ability called Evolution. This ability granted his Copy a weak growth in strength. With that discovery, he started focusing on the more unique F-class abilities.</p><br/><p>Every ability capable of a weak enhancement or growth was copied by him. Ultimately, after many years, his Copy completely transformed from its original state, all its limitations reducing. With that, the Copy ability started gaining momentum. From that day onward, E class, D class, C class\u2026 While growing himself, he evolved his Copy ability without stop. All those abilities that were proclaimed to be incapable of coexisting with other abilities were copied by him.</p><br/><p>With this, his Copy ability became an extremely terrifying ability. Slowly but surely, Luo Yuan\u2019s strength became terrifying. With his newfound strength, he destroyed all the records the Genetic Union had on this ability. With his copied abilities, he altered everyone\u2019s memories, erasing the memories related to this ability.</p><br/><p>And thus, the Copy ability became unique to him alone. He went on to found the Stormtech Company, with his gaze set on the entire world. Nobody knew that he could copy abilities through the wristband. Nobody knew that each time they used their ability was equivalent to an increase in comprehension, which was subsequently transmitted to Luo Yuan through the wristband.</p><br/><p>Moreover, after the evolution of Copy, the newly copied abilities were no longer weaker than the original versions. Interestingly, on a certain day, Luo Yuan managed to copy a unique ability: Transmigration.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026 The source of this ability was Kong Bai. At that time, Luo Yuan was overwhelmed with joy. The combination of transmigration and luck was simply perfect. With excitement, he transmigrated to the past and once again saw that flower-like young lady. He was so happy that he forgot himself.</p><br/><p>He decided to stay there, to relive his life. Alas, he made the wrong choice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

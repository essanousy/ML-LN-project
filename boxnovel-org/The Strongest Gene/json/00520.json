Even after consuming more than ten bottles of beyond X gene reagent, they had yet to see any effect on their comprehension. The only effect the gene reagent had on them was the single second of gold radiance around their body.</p><br/><p>Some had mediocre strength, potential, and ability, yet with a single gene reagent, they directly comprehended the power of beyond.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was indeed some sort of aptitude when it came to comprehension of the power of beyond as well. At this moment, the Research Agency released their latest research at a cheap price: the beyond potential evaluator. This was a chip capable of detecting one's aptitude in comprehending the power of beyond.</p><br/><p>The moment this chip was released, it caused a great uproar. It was said that those who reached 100 points in the evaluation would definitely be able to comprehend the power of beyond in a single attempt. These people were geniuses in the truest sense.</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\"Your potential is rated 20 points. Evaluation: shabby, probability of comprehension very low.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\"Your potential is rated 90 points. Evaluation: perfect, probability of comprehension very high.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\"Your potential is rated 50 points. Evaluation: ordinary, probability of comprehension normal.\"</p><br/><p>Each time one evaluated oneself, a rough evaluation would be provided. As the currently available data on the power of beyond was still too low, only these simple descriptions were provided. However, this small description was already sufficient to be used as something for some people to show themselves off. Thus, the competition of one's points started being some sort of entertainment.</p><br/><p>In a certain rented room.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, I have a potential reaching 88 points!\"</p><br/><p>\"So what? I have a potential of 89 points.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, sorry, but my potential is 96 points.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, for real?\"</p><br/><p>They gasped in admiration at each other as they discussed. \"It seems like we are all geniuses at comprehending the power of beyond.\"</p><br/><p>\"True that.\"</p><br/><p>They lamented endlessly.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhao Tian, who had been working overtime for three days, finally returned. Zhao Tian had always been the strongest among them. As such, they were extremely concerned with his score.</p><br/><p>\"Zhao Tian, come, check your score.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thirty-six points,\" Zhao Tian stated indifferently.</p><br/><p>They were overjoyed. \"So low? This won't do. The rest of us all have high scores.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Tian shook his head, not bothered. \"There's no meaning in that.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean by no meaning? This signifies that we have better futures than you.\" They were all feeling proud.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Zhao Tian gazed at them like he was gazing at some idiots. \"What's the point of that? That gene reagent costs 100,000,000 yuan. Which of you can afford it? I seem to remember that you all only earn 6,000 yuan per month, right? How long do you need to save for this amount of money? Will your entire life even be enough? Since you can't even get enough money, what's the point of these scores? What difference is this from you guys comparing your penis length every single day? You, 28 centimeters. Him, 22 centimeters. He, 30 centimeters. How proud? So what? You guys are almost 40 years old now, yet which of you has a girlfriend? Apart from making your hands tired, what is the point of the length of your penises?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They all lapsed into silence. They exchanged glances, feeling extremely awkward. A similar scene played out everywhere. The competition of one's score was completely unrelated to one's present strength. Rather, one's potential in the power of beyond could be said to be something based on an entirely different system. It was rumored that even a certain beyond-A-class warrior only scored a pitiful 10 points when evaluated. It had truly been hard for him when he'd first broken through into beyond A class all those years ago.</p><br/><p>Presently, our dearest Chen Feng was looking at the screen with a worried expression as well, \"Your potential is rated at one point. Evaluation: idiot, almost incapable of comprehending.\"</p><br/><p>One point? Chen Feng's expression darkened. Even if the comprehension was unrelated to one's strength, wasn't one point too excessive?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He turned his communication tool on. The company that had manufactured this wristband was truly annoying. After the release of the evaluator chip, they had speedily added a column beside the names of the people in one's contact list to indicate their score.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>That's right. This score was now available for everyone to see. Moreover, there would be such a prompt: \"Congratulations. Your potential has now surpassed X% of genetic warriors worldwide.\"</p><br/><p>????</p><br/><p>This was too excessive. He had never expected that such a thing that was so common in his previous world would be implemented in such a well-practiced manner here in this world as well. Rather unfortunately, he had never surpassed more than 50% of other users in that certain game during his previous life, not even once. As he thought of it, he suddenly recalled that there was indeed a certain aspect where he had surpassed a lot of people. He had a record for time spent online in one sitting that surpassed 99% of other users. Time online: 98 minutes 24 seconds. A beautiful number.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A window popped up on his screen.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations. Your potential has now surpassed 0% of genetic warriors worldwide.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's face was expressionless.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei left a comment. \"Hahahahahahahahahaha!\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai left a comment. \"Hehehehehehehe.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Chun left a comment. \"66666666666.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai commented, \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"I truly have bad taste in friends.\" He checked their scores. Xu Fei had 88 points, Kong Bai had 99 points, and Wang Chun had 86 points, while Qin Hai only had 60 points, but that did not matter, since he had already reached beyond A class long ago. Perhaps he could research this.</p><br/><p>Perhaps by analyzing our similarity and attributes, I will obtain some results. Chen Feng sunk into contemplation. After a long time, by using an analogy, Chen Feng obtained his verdict, \"Could it be that the uglier one is, the higher the score?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it. The sample size is too small to reach a proper conclusion.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. Even if he was able to obtain a result, it no longer mattered much to him. He might as well let the Research Agency be the ones busying with this. What he should focus on presently was entering beyond B class. Despite the fact that everything seemed peaceful presently, something might happen at any time.</p><br/><p>The threat of the devil and ancient races was akin to a hanging sword that could fall on one's head at any time. As such, before that actually happened, he had become even more powerful. This was also why the humans across the globe were presently trying to increase their strength. It was still better to grasp one's own future in one's own hand. Now that the distribution of the beyond X gene reagent had stabilized, Chen Feng could finally start charging toward beyond B class.</p><br/><p>\"It's time.\"</p><br/><p>He inhaled. As the general manager of this Beyond X project, every single action of Chen Feng's was focused by a countless amount of people. The moment he prepared to start, all the preparations were already completed for him.</p><br/><p>The Genetic Union displayed the utmost sincerity when serving him. \"We have been waiting for you.\"</p><br/><p>The Research Agency joined in as well. \"If you require anything, please do let us know.\"</p><br/><p>The employees of the Gene Production Association prepared everything for him. \"The beyond X gene reagent is already prepared.\"</p><br/><p>\"Many thanks.\" Chen Feng did not comment much on all this. On that day, under numerous gazes, Chen Feng prepared to take the beyond X gene reagent.</p><br/><p>Naturally, before using the gene reagent, the evaluation of his potential was a must. After all, only by knowing his score could the Gene Production Association have an idea how many bottles of gene reagent they would need to prepare for him. With surety, when they saw Chen Feng's score, they were all alarmed.</p><br/><p>\"One percent?\"</p><br/><p>\"Idiot? What evaluation is this?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck. This was a never-before-seen evaluation. Even the Research Agency that had created the chip was rather dumbstruck as well. Wasn't such an evaluation reserved for those commoners who had never trained in the slightest? Why had Chen Feng been evaluated this way?</p><br/><p>The employee of the Gene Production Association probed carefully as he asked the person from the Research Agency, \"How many bottles of gene reagent do we need prepare for this, then?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" The person from the Research Agency wiped his cold sweat before stating hesitantly, \"How about\u2026 taking everything you have in the warehouse?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else: \"\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

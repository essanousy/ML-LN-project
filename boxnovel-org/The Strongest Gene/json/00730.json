As of this moment, any sort of superiority the Luck Goddess had was counteracted by the Misfortune Goddess. If her guess was correct, what Misfortune was using at present had been freshly absorbed from her, absorbed from the misfortune power she had been using to suppress the Forest Goddess earlier. This slut!</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess tried to flee repeatedly, but she was blasted back without stop.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess's attacks were unending. She was incredibly furious now. Initially, she was supposed to awaken quietly here in this land. She greatly enjoyed silence, but unexpectedly, the Luck Goddess had tried to awaken her early. Moreover, the Luck Goddess had even used that method to absorb her power, causing her core to be poked by that human\u2026 Toward the end, the Luck Goddess had even been trying to suppress her awakening! How hateful! The Luck Goddess had already crossed the line.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Slowly, the terrifying attacks come to a halt. On the ground was the Luck Goddess, covered in injuries.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess glared at the Forest Goddess. \"You\u2026 won't be able to kill me. The next time I return, I will teach you the terrifying consequences of betrayal.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another of the furious Forest Goddess's attacks landed.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Once again, the Luck Goddess was hit.</p><br/><p>\"I will not allow you to easily return,\" the tender voice replied. A green radiance glowed brightly. The green enveloped and permeated the Luck Goddess's body. Suddenly, the Luck Goddess's body became translucent.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's expression widened. \"This\u2026\" It was rumored that the Forest Goddess was capable of erasing the consciousness of all existences. He had always believed that this only applied to regular life-forms. Surprisingly, even gods could be affected.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 will not be able to truly erase me,\" the Luck Goddess coldly said. \"At most\u2026 this will\u2026 only\u2026 delay my return\u2026 There will be\u2026 a day that I return\u2026 yet again\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Slowly, her life force dimmed and vanished.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Her figure vanished thoroughly. Just like that, a god had been slain.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was shaken. \"Dead\u2026\" The Luck Goddess had ultimately died. Although this death was not eternal, the fact that her consciousness had been erased was shocking in itself, even if the Luck Goddess had still been able to converse clumsily. For her to recover both her physical body and consciousness, many years would be required, right? This was much more terrifying than the death of the pure physical body. The Forest Goddess was truthfully much more terrifying than she appeared to be.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The green shone, and from the darkness, a little girl walked out. Zhou Ye shut both his eyes as this happened. He realized what he had done. He was clear that he would most probably not survive this encounter.</p><br/><p>The girl regarded him coldly. \"Your name is Zhou Ye?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Lord Goddess,\" Zhou Ye answered in a dispirited manner.</p><br/><p>\"Very good. You shall temporarily be my spokesperson,\" the tender voice resounded.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye blanked. \"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>Her furious voice resounded throughout the entire forest. \"Help me\u2026 locate\u2026 that\u2026 damnable evil person called Chen Feng!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A green radiance swirled out. Next, Zhou Ye's body hovered in the air and his injuries started healing. On top of that, a brand-new godly power started echoing within his body. This was a power unique to the Forest Goddess.</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\" Zhou Ye was overjoyed. It seemed like the Forest Goddess was a person of reason after all, for her to be aware of who her true enemy was. With what Chen Feng had done to her\u2026 Mhm\u2026 Zhou Ye reckoned that it wouldn't be long before Chen Feng was dead.</p><br/><p>\"I will now go recover my strength. If you manage to find Chen Feng, call out my name,\" the Forest Goddess ordered.</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" Zhou Ye answered deferentially.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash, the Forest Goddess and her aura vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>Although she had awakened, because of what the Luck Goddess had done, she was greatly weakened. As such, she would have to go in search of other forests to recover her strength.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye looked around. \"Chen Feng\u2026\" Chen Feng had gone missing at an indeterminate moment in time. Perhaps\u2026 he should go out and take a look at the human world. Chen Feng was a human and possessed an extraordinary status. As such, Zhou Ye was confident that he would be able to locate Chen Feng in the human world.</p><br/><p>However, he still couldn't understand why Chen Feng had decided to do what he had. Was a hatred birthed from love truly so terrifying? He would rather awaken the Forest Goddess, would rather be the enemy of such a powerful goddess, just so he could kill the Luck Goddess? What was Chen Feng's true goal? Zhou Ye could not understand. Or perhaps one could say that he had not known anything from the start.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng, what exactly do you want?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye stood up and vanished in a green flash. At the forest's edge, only numerous patches of ruined forest were left behind. Apart from that, there were various godly powers lingering in the air and corpses sprawled everywhere. This place would henceforth be known as an ominous land. A cold breeze brushed past, blowing away the smell of death pervading this place and bringing forth a certain figure to this land.</p><br/><p>All gone? Chen Feng wondered as he walked about. Both the Forest Goddess and Zhou Ye had left. Around him were just the corpses of resonators.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"See? Is this not the cost one ought to pay for greed? If you guys truly hated her, you guys would never have died here like this.\"</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Goddess: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Well then. Time to start,\" Chen Feng indifferently said. Everything he had done had been for one single goal.</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Goddess: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I have no intention of listening to any objections,\" Chen Feng said coldly.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Goddess remained silent for a short while before answering, \"I understand.\"</p><br/><p>She did not want to do this, especially since she this was something she disliked doing. However, she dared not disobey Chen Feng, as she found that she feared the consequences. To be more accurate, she feared Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>She had personally witnessed everything Chen Feng had done. She was also the only person aware of exactly what Chen Feng had done. With a flip of his hand, he could create clouds or summon rain as he wished. Moreover, if it had been either her or the Luck Goddess with such a pitiful amount of misfortune power, neither of them would have been able to accomplish what Chen Feng had. The Misfortune Goddess had not felt the least bit of joy upon seeing the Luck Goddess get tricked, only fear.</p><br/><p>So it turned out that when a person gained such a thorough understanding of another person, things could be so terrifying? This should apply even to gods.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Pen trembled. Next, a faint power of misfortune started converting into luck. The Misfortune Goddess unleashed all her stockpiled power, transforming it into the power of luck and proceeding to pierce through space itself, blending into the very location the Luck Goddess had fallen into earlier.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Radiance swirled about. Chen Feng watched on as everything unfolded, waiting for all the preparations to be completed.</p><br/><p>He pointed at the air. \"And now, wake up, Luck Goddess!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, a terrifying power started converging there. A huge whirlpool appeared there, and a seemingly boundless power started gathering there. The earth where the Luck Goddess had fallen started trembling. Next, a translucent figure appeared. Surprisingly, this was precisely the Luck Goddess. However, the present Luck Goddess was a mere translucent figure. She had a blank look, and both her eyes were suffused with white. This flawless body of hers seemed more like an empty shell.</p><br/><p>\"Her consciousness has been erased,\" the Misfortune Goddess confirmed.</p><br/><p>\"Can it be reinstated?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. However, a very, very long time will be required. Perhaps even longer time than the time between the Primordial Era and now\u2026\" The Misfortune Goddess was sure.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was extremely pleased to hear this. \"Splendid.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A faint godly power started swirling about.</p><br/><p>Gently, Chen Feng pointed his finger at the Luck Goddess's forehead. \"Time to wake up.\" Suddenly, the figure trembled. Next, the blank expression started moving, and those empty eyes suddenly filled with emotion again.</p><br/><p>Slowly, a smile unfolded on her face. \"My little master.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Welcome back.\" The Luck Goddess had indeed been killed. Her newly regained physical body had been killed, and her consciousness had been erased. However, one particular consciousness had remained. That was the consciousness that had followed Chen Feng in his rise, the consciousness that had been sealed off by the Luck Goddess when she had sealed away her emotions. That was the part of the Luck Goddess that was Spirit\u2014the memories unique to Spirit alone. This had been Chen Feng's true goal, to resurrect Spirit! To resurrect that very consciousness that was completely unrelated to the Luck Goddess!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

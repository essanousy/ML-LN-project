Fortunately, Chen Feng's Luck Aura was still active, assisting them in avoiding the first round of searches. Despite that, their circumstance did not seem good. This was the Dream Recall Dynasty, where 90% of the races had already fallen under the control of the Dream Recall Bell. Only the races whose primordial fragments had been in Mysterious Town were still resisting stubbornly. Even so, they would not be able to last long.</p><br/><p>This was unlike the one-on-one battles that had happened in Mysterious Town. Rather, this was the concentration of all races conquered by Dream Recall Bell in a single era. Victory seemed impossible, even for the primordial fragments. They were all in their own respective locations in this primordial world, making it possible for the grand army of the Dream Recall Dynasty to eliminate them one by one.</p><br/><p>The primordial world had fallen into absolute chaos.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed into the distance. \"They won't be able to last long.\"</p><br/><p>As the primordial fragments were all powerful, they were still resisting in their respective locations. However, the moment the grand army of the Dream Recall Dynasty arrived, there would only be one conclusion for them.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai smiled bitterly. \"The moment the Primordial Era falls, the Genetic Era will vanish as well.\" Without a doubt, changing the Primordial Era would affect the future. What direction would a world completely united by the Dream Recall Dynasty take? It was unknown.</p><br/><p>\"True\u2026\" Chen Feng muttered. History was on the verge of being changed. Who could stop it? By fighting? That wouldn't work. This was the Primordial Era, where Chen Feng's strength as an awakened was nothing but the strength of cannon fodder. They did not dare to even get involved in any major battles. Even merely being discovered would result in their death.</p><br/><p>\"Right now, we can only do one thing.\" Qin Hai took in a deep breath. \"Seek reinforcements. Before coming, Master gave me a turtle shell. Even in the Primordial Era, I can still ask for reinforcements with it.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was astonished. \"It works even here?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai nodded. \"Naturally. The shell is here on me.\"</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took out the turtle shell. This thing had also followed his soul to the Primordial Era. In the present in Mysterious Town, there was still one on his physical body as well.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Qin Hai activated it. At the same time, both the shell in the Primordial Era and in Mysterious Town started shining with a faint light.</p><br/><p>\"Done.\" After sending the signal, Qin Hai said, \"Master told me that he found several strong helpers that might be able to help us deal with this. Although the Dream Recall Bell is undefeatable here, history has yet to be totally changed. We still have time. As long as we get rid of the physical Dream Recall Bell in Mysterious Town before that happens\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This was Qin Hai's plan. Although the Dream Recall Bell was undefeatable here in the Primordial Era, it wasn't undefeatable at the present time. Now, all its strength had been used to send everyone into the Primordial Era. If so, the physical body of the bell in Mysterious Town might be rather weak now.</p><br/><p>\"The more of its power that is focused here, the weaker it will be in the present,\" Qin Hai analyzed calmly. \"After those people receive the distress signal, they will most certainly enter the town. When they discover that something is odd with the bell, they will destroy it!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. Worthy of being Qin Hai indeed. His plan was indeed more reliable than Chen Feng's. Chen Feng himself had thought of some things, but none of them seemed reliable. As such, he had decided to give up on them.</p><br/><p>\"Now, we just need to wait for them to end everything.\"</p><br/><p>They waited silently.</p><br/><p>Far away, the grand army was still as terrifying as ever. Their powerful senses swept around, evidently searching for all abnormal life-forms. Chen Feng and Qin Hai both concealed themselves and watched on coldly, watching on as the Dream Recall Bell's confidence swelled and waiting for the moment of its death.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai counted the time. \"Soon\u2026\" Based on his guess, those people should be almost there\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around before them. A familiar figure appeared beside them.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, long time no see,\" Xu Fei said with a big smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Was this their reinforcements?</p><br/><p>Hold on\u2026</p><br/><p>Just like that, this fellow had entered the Primordial Era?</p><br/><p>Qin Hai was dumbstruck. \"Why have you arrived here?\"</p><br/><p>Xu Fei laughed heartily. \"Hahaha. Let me tell you, I departed immediately after receiving the signal. Just as I reached the town, I saw a little bell flickering without stop. At that time, I planned to first destroy the bell. However, since I couldn't see you two, I searched around cautiously first. However, I still failed to find you two. Next, I had an idea and activated the turtle shell to reach this place directly. Hahaha.\"</p><br/><p>\"Seeing you two, I know that my guess was correct. That damnable bell was definitely a trap. If I destroyed it, you two would probably have died. Tsk tsk, how lucky it is that I'm this smart.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Fei was immensely proud of himself.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he did not know what to say. What in the world? This unreliable bastard! He had originally thought that the reinforcements would be able to solve their predicament. Unexpectedly, the reinforcements were so unreliable during the crucial moment!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Don't you normally not use your brain at all?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Xu Fei scratched his head. \"But then, didn't you tell me previously to use my brain more? That is why I decided to use my brain this time.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He had indeed sinned.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's head ached. \"The bell can only be destroyed in the present world. Now that you are in here as well, you have successfully thrown yourself into the trap and are now completely useless. This is the Primordial Era, an era where awakened ones are everywhere.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Xu Fei was dumbstruck. With a wronged expression, he said, \"That old man Du merely told me to come help when I sensed the vibration of the shell.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry, we still have another helper.\" Qin Hai took in a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. \"Based on what Master said, this time, he found two helpers, and both are similarly powerful. There is still hope for us. I believe that the other person will most definitely\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Before Qin Hai could even finish, light swirled before him and an even more familiar figure appeared before them.</p><br/><p>\"You are all indeed here,\" Kong Bai said with a gratified expression.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xu Fei: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>We are indeed destined to meet everywhere we go, Qin Hai despaired. How had a fine plan progressed in such a direction?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai started speaking. \"By the way, the moment I laid my eyes on the bell in the town, I knew there was some problem with it. I could even feel a charming power from that bell. As such, I made the smart decision and activated the turtle shell before that power reached me.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave him a thumbs-up. \"How smart.\"</p><br/><p>What in the world? At most, the bell could only charm Kong Bai into the Primordial Era. Moreover, the physical bell in the present had been greatly weakened. Its charm power was possibly greatly weakened as well. How nice it had been for this Kong Bai to immediately follow Qin Hai's path and activate the turtle shell the moment he reached the town.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai rubbed his fist, eager for a fight. \"Well then\u2026 what should we do next?\"</p><br/><p>\"Await death,\" sounded Qin Hai's grudge-filled voice.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai blanked. \"What?\" When Xu Fei explained everything to him, he had a \"what the f*ck\" expression on his face. The four exchanged glances, thoroughly dumbfounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qin Hai had merely intended to call his senior apprentice sister to obtain some information; he had not expected to be presented with such a scene.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai rubbed his head. \"Your girl is so ferocious?\" Suddenly, he felt like him being undercover among the ancient race was an extremely dangerous act, as he might randomly be killed by this little girlfriend of Chen Feng's at any time.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Chen Feng was incredibly surprised as well. The only thing he had known was that Wang Yao had gone beyond A class, nothing more. Suddenly, Chen Feng's communication tool buzzed. He glanced at it and saw a simple reply from Wang Yao: Target dead, preparing to return. Please do send me the coordinates.</p><br/><p>After pondering it over, Chen Feng sent the coordinates over to her. As Qin Hai saw this, his mouth twitched. After all, he was extremely fearful of this young lady.</p><br/><p>\"Since you are already done gathering energy, I will leave first,\" Qin Hai stated with a low voice.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was surprised. \"You don't want to meet her?\"</p><br/><p>Qin hai shook his head. \"With my current identity, it's better to not meet her.\" The more people that knew about his identity, the more troublesome things would become.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Fine.\" Turning into a flash, Qin Hai left noiselessly. Only now did the big shots of the Genetic Union sense the aura of the ancient race slowly vanishing.</p><br/><p>\"Gone?\"</p><br/><p>\"He left?\"</p><br/><p>\"I can still feel the remains of the ancient race member's aura here. Damn it.\"</p><br/><p>\"In short, that fellow took a stroll in here before leaving without anyone even discovering him? Or perhaps he completed his mission here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Quick, check if we lost anything.\"</p><br/><p>Di!</p><br/><p>Di!</p><br/><p>Their scanning devices beeped without stop. All the employees started a crazy round of inspections, with the inspections being especially strict on their core secrets. Alas, surprising them, nothing was lost. What exactly had that mysterious and powerful ancient race member been trying to do?</p><br/><p>\"Have the reinforcement arrived?\"</p><br/><p>\"The deputy president will arrive soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>\"Maintain full alert. We can't allow anyone else to sneak in anymore. Even the area five kilometers around our headquarters must be fully monitored as well. Nobody must be allowed entry, you hear me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>The entire Genetic Union became frantically busy. The sudden arrival of that ancient race member had alarmed everyone present. Since he could come so easily, if he was actually planning to destroy this place\u2026</p><br/><p>Shortly after, the deputy president arrived in a rush.</p><br/><p>\"Where's the enemy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Left.\"</p><br/><p>\"Take me over to the remnants of his aura.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Through the remnant aura in the air, the deputy president confirmed that the enemy had already departed. Just as everyone was about to heave a sigh of relief\u2026</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Once again, the alarm blazed crazily.</p><br/><p>Enemy attack!</p><br/><p>On the screen of their sensor, a huge matrix was being formed. From the screen, it was concluded that this time, it wasn't the ancient race or the devil race. Rather, it was a human, a person in the legendary beyond-A-class realm. As for the position that the person had appeared at\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng! Instantly, all their expressions changed greatly. During the Star City battle, the contributions of Chen Feng alone had surpassed everyone else. Furthermore, as an excellent producer of the Gene Production Association, he was also one whose knowledge of gene productions far surpassed others. As such, he would be extremely helpful in their future research. Had those damnable enemies noticed the existence of such a person?</p><br/><p>Damn it! Wasn't the defense here too weak, then? When had their headquarters become like a public transportation vehicle, one where anyone could enter whenever they desired? The deputy president raged. \"Go!\"</p><br/><p>They rushed over hurriedly. They could not allow anything to happen to Chen Feng, not here.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the door of Chen Feng's laboratory was kicked open. The reinforced door capable of resisting an A-class attack was deformed by the deputy president. After kicking the door, they saw that a red streak was rushing toward Chen Feng at a high speed.</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's expression changed greatly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A weapon coalesced in the deputy president's hand. Instantly, a powerful killing move was formed as it slammed through the void to slash at that red streak.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Space cracked and the beyond-A-class power of the deputy president bloomed. Back then, during the Star City battle, he had been unable to go personally and had only been able to send his clone over. Due to that, the entire war had almost ended in a disaster. This time, he would not allow such a mistake. As he thought of this, he pushed his power to the maximum. Activating his trump card, his speed surged.</p><br/><p>Before the red streak could even reach Chen Feng, the deputy president arrived before him. Under his super fast movement speed, everything around him seemed so slow. Next, he saw an extremely awkward scene.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026 that red streak seemed to be a young lady? Eh? On her face was a smile, both her hands were outstretched as she was pouncing into Chen Feng's embrace. Due to her fast movement speed, it had been misconstrued as an attack.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>As he looked at her face, suddenly the deputy president recalled the identity of this young lady. As he looked at her flabbergasted expression, the deputy president felt incomparably awkward.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He forced himself to stop.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A huge force seemed to be rampaging within his body due to his abrupt stop. After the forceful stop of his power that had forcefully erupted earlier, he suffered a certain degree of backlash. Next, he stared blankly as the young lady landed within Chen Feng's embrace. Mhm\u2026 both of them were hugging each other now.</p><br/><p>\"You are back.\" Chen Feng immersed himself in the warmth that he hadn't felt for a while in his embrace. Next, he looked at those fellows that had appeared abruptly out of nowhere. \"What are you guys doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Deputy president: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances, not knowing what to say. In short, they had hurried over just to witness this scene?</p><br/><p>\"We sensed the aura of a superexpert\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"There must have been a mistake,\" someone stated awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Ah.\" Suddenly, Wang Yao came to a realization as she stated in a low voice, \"Sorry, I have been careless. I have grown used to moving in such manner and forgot that this is the headquarters of the Genetic Union.\"</p><br/><p>The rest waved their hands without stop. \"Don't worry about it.\" This was a misunderstanding, after all. However, shortly afterward, they all stopped. Hold on\u2026 \"Sorry\"? In short, this young lady was the superexpert?</p><br/><p>They all widened their eyes. \"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A flaming sword appeared in Wang Yao's hand. \"Do you remember now?\" Wang Yao asked with a gentle laugh.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all their hearts jolted furiously. This aura\u2026</p><br/><p>The flaming sword that had appeared suddenly during the Star City battle to kill that formidable ancient race female was the sword of this young lady? Chen Feng's girlfriend? Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president led everyone to leave awkwardly. If it was this lady Wang Yao, there shouldn't be any problems. With her by Chen Feng's side, not many people could actually hurt Chen Feng anyway. But then\u2026 even now, the flush on the deputy president's face still remained. This was too embarrassing! Chen Feng was somewhat speechless as he looked at the departing genetic warriors. His head lowered to look at the Wang Yao, who was embracing him silently. Instantly, he chuckled.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng poked her head. \"Do you think I can't see that you did this on purpose?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Wang Yao rubbed her face against Chen Feng's chest before shifting her body into a more comfortable posture to continue the embrace. She stated in a low voice, \"I want everyone to know that you belong to me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah.\" A warm current surfaced in Chen Feng's heart. With this, the sense of unfamiliarity due to them not meeting for a long time vanished. Wang Yao was still the same Wang Yao. He rubbed her head and asked with a smile, \"Are you interested in doing some tests in regards to the human body?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao blinked. \"Eh?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

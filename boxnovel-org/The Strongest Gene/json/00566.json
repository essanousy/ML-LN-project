A certain powerful devil expert with a body the size of a mountain was prostrating on the ground like a domesticated animal. An old devil was seated above his body and gazing at the starry sky.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the old devil muttered with his hoarse voice, \"I like the dark, because\u2026 the darkness is also our home ground.\"</p><br/><p>A faint smile formed on the old devil's face. He gazed down at this devil, this formidable S class that surpassed everything but could only prostrate under his feet at present. He deeply enjoyed this feeling of being the master of everything. The only source of discomfort for the present him was the faint scent of urine on the huge devil below him.</p><br/><p>\"Reporting.\" A little devil presented the latest news to the old devil.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng\u2026\" The old devil's eyes gleamed coldly. What the little devil presented was precisely the news of what Chen Feng had done recently in the human territories. It seemed like he had done something extremely amazing, causing the strength of humanity to rise greatly.</p><br/><p>The little devil's killing intent surged. \"Lord, should we\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The old devil shook his head. \"There's no need. This fellow called Chen Feng isn't easy to kill. At present, the ancient race should be the ones most terrified of him. Our present strength is rather limited. As such, our priority should be maintaining a low profile and increasing our strength silently. Besides, both the ancients and humans are constantly trying to increase their strength. As such, we must hasten our speed as well. The superiority we gained from this giant S-class devil will not last long. Before it ends, we must increase our strength as much as possible,\" the old devil stated with a resolute gaze.</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" all the other devils replied.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Slowly, the giant devil stood up. Standing on the head of this giant devil, the old devil gazed upon this piece of land in front of him. He vowed to use the shortest time possible to awaken those slumbering devils and transform them all into his puppets as well. Even if those devils he was thinking of were all stronger than him, the truth was\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" The old devil patted the head he was stepping on and said, \"Pipi Devil, let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>The giant devil replied with a loud roar. Bringing the old devil along, the giant devil charged into the darkness.</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>Ancient race.</p><br/><p>The present Qin Hai had a cloak draped on his back and his killing intent was surging. Behind him was an all-female army with all sorts of characters within. Even the previous emperor's harem members were included in this all-female army. Every one of them was gazing at Qin Hai tenderly.</p><br/><p>With their continuous consumption of that beyond X gene reagent, the present ancient race was much stronger. At the same time, they were also more feminine, and their figures looked even more perfect. Not a single trace of masculinity remained among the ancient race.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Raising his hand, Qin Hai slashed his blade downward. With a flash, several ancient rebels were slaughtered.</p><br/><p>Opposite Qin Hai, the rebels were so furious that their bosoms started trembling. \"You are too much of a bully!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Qin Hai sneered with a cold gaze. In order to prevent himself from having a protective feeling against the fairer sex, before the destruction of all of the information regarding the ex-males of the ancient race, he saved a copy of that information on his wristband. As the breath of the rebels quickened from their fury, resulting in their chests jiggling, Qin Hai gave his wristband a glance.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Original name: Zhang Dapao.</p><br/><p>Introduction: Once sentenced to prison for molesting the daughter of the mayor. Ultimately escaped during the chaos.</p><br/><p>What followed was this Zhang Dapao's wanted poster, a picture of a person with a lush beard on his face.</p><br/><p>At the sight of this, all protective feelings for the fairer sex vanished.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Decisively, Qin Hai killed this rebel with a flawless figure.</p><br/><p>\"Why must you kill all of us?\" a different rebel female cried. They were truly willing to surrender. In fact, when the entire population of the ancient race had become feminized, when Qin Hai had been crowned the new king, they had all been sincerely willing to surrender unconditionally. Alas\u2026 Qin Hai had issued a command to kill all rebels. As such, these rebels had decided to resist till the end, since they were going to die in any case. However, they truly had no idea why this guy here insisted on killing them all.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry. Your hands are filled with the blood of the ancient commoners. I do not trust you people,\" Qin Hai replied with a cold gaze. He issued his final command. \"Kill!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire ancient army moved out, and just like that, yet another army of rebels was eliminated. Even though the ancients had all been feminized, their strength had become even scarier than before. It was rather hard to decide if this was actually good or bad for humanity.</p><br/><p>\"Teehee. Unfeeling and decisive. This is our king,\" a playful-looking young lady stated.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent,\" stated a young lady with a splendid figure. \"The act of killing these rebels presented us with an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with this newfound strength.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed,\" another person answered. \"But then, it won't be long before all the rebels are killed off.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, it won't be long indeed,\" a gentle-looking young lady agreed tenderly.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This scene here with all these young ladies was supposed to be filled with allure. Unfortunately, whenever Qin Hai looked at his wristband, he saw the information and original pictures of all these young ladies.</p><br/><p>Third prince\u2026</p><br/><p>Marquis Ming\u2026</p><br/><p>Chancellor of Military\u2026</p><br/><p>And numerous senior ministers\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the original appearances of all these people, Qin Hai sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>\"How many rebels are left?\" Qin Hai asked.</p><br/><p>A sexy young lady licked her lips as, with her killing intent surging, she said, \"Two more armies. They are quite far from us. However, we should be able to finish them off within a month. After that, we will be able to start moving against the humans\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Oh.</p><br/><p>This particular person used to be the head eunuch.</p><br/><p>\"One month, huh?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai stared ahead toward the direction of the human territories. Even after doing everything he could, he could only delay the ancients this much. The moment the ancient rebels were eliminated, the ancient race could start attacking the humans. At that time, how was humanity supposed to face this feminized yet stronger ancient race? Worry filled Qin Hai's eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Lord. It's time to set off,\" someone reminded him.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai nodded before leading the army to the rebels. \"Let's go.\" Chen Feng\u2026 I won't be able to delay much longer\u2026 As for what happens next, it will have to rely on you.</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>Amid the boundless starry sky, numerous huge battleships were roaming the outer space.</p><br/><p>As the aviation industry of humanity had progressed rapidly, numerous wealthy people had been able to construct a \"battleship villa\" before moving from the planet into outer space. There in their ships, they lived the lives of true kings. A single huge battleship could fit a population of a hundred thousand people, equivalent to a small city. Here, the commander was the absolute leader.</p><br/><p>Some commanders led scientists and focused on research, some commanders led their underlings and focused on increasing their strength, and some commanders focused on building a promiscuous harem. Within a certain battleship, a certain commander around 60 to 70 years old with a huge belly was flipping the cards in his hands with a perverted expression. Within this huge battleship, not a single female could escape his grasp.</p><br/><p>\"Let me see. Whose turn will it be today? Hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. He pointed midair, and next, a petite figure appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>He gave the hologram a glance, and instantly, his body trembled.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! There is such a beauty on my ship? Hahaha. The age is somewhat young\u2026 Mhm\u2026 Well, it is understandable for me to have missed her before. After all, there are several hundred thousand people on my ship. Haha. Little sister, let me accompany you today\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The perverted commander drifted forward within the battleship. Suddenly, the air trembled. Instantly, a bright explosion erupted and a terrifying shockwave swept everywhere. In a split second, half the battleship was destroyed. Yet even as this happened, no news was able to be transmitted outward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

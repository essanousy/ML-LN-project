In a certain corner of this space, a unique aura could be found. This was the aura of a power that did not belong to this world. This thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Both Chen Feng's eyes became sharp. This space was too unique; it possessed everything an ordinary space would not possess. As a space, it had become an independent world, possessing all the conditions required for a world to exist. This remained consistent for the entirety of this world, apart from that spot at that certain corner. There, the aura of the outside world could be felt by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Finally, Chen Feng understood. \"This is an incomplete world.\" It was no wonder that Lu Hun had been so unwilling to deploy this world. This world was incomplete in the first place! Using countless years, he had gradually transformed this space into a real world. Presently, he was around 1% from completion. Only when this space reached completion would it be a true independent world.</p><br/><p>But right now, that remaining 1% was sufficient to collapse this world.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lu Hun's gaze landed on Chen Feng, and his heart thumped. \"Has he noticed it?\"</p><br/><p>This was why he had been unwilling to use this world of green. Prior to completion, this world would still be too weak. There was still a possibility of threatening the completion of this world. Indeed, Chen Feng had discovered it. One ought to know that any tiny damage this world suffered would be equivalent to several years of Lu Hun's hard work gone. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's eyes gleamed coldly. \"You guys are the ones forcing me to do this.\"</p><br/><p>Even at the cost of reducing the completion status of this world, he had to ensure the death of all these people. Since this world was already deployed, how would he hold his hand so easily?</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's cold voice waffled forth. \"All of you\u2026 deserve death!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying radiance erupted. A dazzling green flash appeared, increasing the speed of the cubes greatly.</p><br/><p>Defend! Everyone erected their defenses hastily.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Alas, the super-powerful defenses of beyond A classes were crushed instantly. In this world, nothing was capable of stopping Lu Hun, except\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pointed midair.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the entire world trembled. As for the cubes that were closing in toward them, they trembled before halting their movement as the green of the entire world dimmed. However, this only lasted a split second before the cubes started moving again. Lu Hun did not waste any time stopping. Once again, Chen Feng attacked. The completion status of this world was reduced by 2%, causing Lu Hun's hard work over several decades to go down the drain.</p><br/><p>Alas, the present Lu Hun was completely ignoring Chen Feng. He had calculated that before they were all killed, Chen Feng would only have the time to launch three attacks. Three attacks would only reduce the completion status by around 6% at most. This was still acceptable for Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's gaze became bitingly cold. \"Let me use this 6% to send you all to hell.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, Chen Feng attacked. Indeed, this time, just 2% of the completion status was reduced as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng could keenly feel that this wasn't good enough. \"This won't do.\"</p><br/><p>That was because he had suddenly noticed that he would only have one more chance to attack this world before the cubes reached them and started killing all of them. It was evident that Lu Hun had already calculated the gap between his attacks. This would not work at all.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at Spirit. If luck value was utilized\u2026 \"Spirit, do you have any other ideas?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit shook her head. \"No. No exploitable probability can be found. In this circumstance, if Luck Aura is activated, it will only solve this using brute force rather than manipulating probability.\"</p><br/><p>Forceful manipulation\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. He understood what Spirit was trying to say. This was also something Chen Feng was unwilling to do. What Spirit meant was the usage of luck in the truest sense. In fact, before Spirit had appeared, this method had been frequently used by Chen Feng. By burning all his luck value, he would leave everything up to fate, to see what fate could do for him with the luck value he had. As for the results of such a usage of luck value, it was unpredictable.</p><br/><p>\"Do I really have to use such a method?\" Chen Feng sighed. They had successfully forced Lu Hun's trump card out. Unexpectedly, this was the result. Lu Hun was indeed worthy of being an old monster that had been alive for countless years. With this world of green in his hands, Lu Hun was almost akin to an immortal. It was simply impossible to kill him using regular methods.</p><br/><p>World of green\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started sensing that one and only weakness of this world. This was a weakness that did not seem to exist when sensed regularly. Even Chen Feng had only sensed the position of this weakness with the help of Spirit. Initially, this world had been 99% complete. Now, it was only 95% complete. With Chen Feng's present strength, it was impossible for him to shake this world enough before all of them were killed.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like I have no other options.\" Chen Feng inhaled deeply. Since things were already this way, he had no choice but to gamble using his luck value.</p><br/><p>Right as Chen Feng was about to make his move, his gaze swept past the green strings. Suddenly, he came to a realization. In itself, this was not a regular world. Even if this space had already taken the form of a world, even if it was already capable of operating independently, it was still completely different from a real world. Apart from the laws here, everything here, even the form and the substance, was different.</p><br/><p>For example, those green strings. Each of these strings was in fact comprised of spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng realized, This is a spiritual world.</p><br/><p>Spiritual energy\u2026 Yes, this was indeed a world that operated on pure spiritual energy. Everything here, especially those green strings, was formed of spiritual energy. Pervading the air was spiritual energy as well. Thankfully, Chen Feng was very good at dealing with something like this.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ying,\" Chen Feng called inwardly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A red flash streaked out. Instantly, Xiao Ying left this world to reach the real world outside before once again entering this world of green.</p><br/><p>Lu Hun was obviously given a fright by this. \"What is this?\" Even if his world of green was 99% complete, it was still not a world any random thing could leave as it wished. Even these beyond A classes were trapped here. How had that red light\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely laughed sinisterly. \"Hehe.\" The only reason Xiao Ying had traveled outside before coming back into this world was to bring back an ordinary gene reagent.</p><br/><p>Lu Hun, even at your strength, I reckon you have never experienced what the true limit of spiritual energy is, right? What is the limit for you, a beyond A9? Do you want to find out? Chen Feng grinned. Well then, let me give you some help, Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>The gene reagent in his hand was crushed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying undulation swept out. Instantly, countless particles swarmed every nook and corner of this green world. Lu Hun widened his eyes.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he felt like he had suddenly become unprecedentedly powerful. Moreover, a feeling had also arisen within him that he would only require one more day to fully complete this profound world of his.</p><br/><p>This is\u2026 peak spiritual affinity?</p><br/><p>This was something he had never felt. Chen Feng had actually assisted him in entering such a state. What was that man thinking? Had he gone crazy? Lu Hun had no answer to that question. However, due to his spiritual affinity being pushed to the peak, he could clearly feel that he was inconceivably powerful now. The same applied to the cubes he was controlling. Earlier, he would still have required a single short instant before he could kill them all. Now, though, he could immediately send them all to their death.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. I'm sorry. It seems like Chen Feng is the one who has delivered death to you all,\" Lu Hun stated with a sinister appearance.</p><br/><p>Die!</p><br/><p>He waved his hand lightly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a terrifying speed, the cubes reached them.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

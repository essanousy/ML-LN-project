Even if you hadn't lifted the seal, it still wouldn't be that far in the future before the seal would have eventually been lifted. The Primordial Era is too old, so old that all life-forms have forgotten about the existence of gods. Naturally, it is also so old that the seal from back then was on the verge of disappearing\u2026 You are merely the person that was coincidentally at the right place and the right time and who did the right thing,\" Duma explained calmly. \"That's all.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng heaved a sigh of relief. So that's the case. Although possessing a pen so awesome that it was capable of solving everything with a single poke would be nice, Chen Feng had no intention of being the culprit for the incoming chaos. This responsibility was too heavy for him to bear.</p><br/><p>\"As for this pen\u2026\" Duma glanced at the pen. \"I don't quite know it. I have a vague impression of all the primordial remnants in existence, and this pen is definitely not one of them. Perhaps this pen was merely a container used to store power back then.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded his head. \"That is possible.\" He still remembered how, earlier, when he'd waved the pen, power had gushed into him.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>If this pen was a mere portable charger, it would be understandable. Perhaps this portable charger of a divine pen had stored some primordial power back then. Now that he had unleashed the stored power, the seal had been lifted. Mhm, this was an acceptable explanation.</p><br/><p>\"Can it still release any power now?\" Duma asked.</p><br/><p>\"Let me give it a try.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved the pen around, yet there was no reaction.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like the power has been exhausted.\" Duma was regretful, as he had been thinking of casting his senses about the stored power to gain more understanding on it. \"Just keep it around. After all, it is still a good item. Perhaps, in the future, you can use it to store power.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Mhm.\" This was quite wondrous. Perhaps this pen had some sort of karmic entanglement with him.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Distantly, the booming sounded without stop. Without a doubt, with the escape of these primordial remnants from Mysterious Town, the entire world would fall into chaos. Going forward, Duma and them would probably be extremely busy dealing with everything.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>The president, who was in seclusion, was pleasantly surprised when he suddenly felt his tightly stuck bottleneck loosening. After a long time, an astonishing aura erupted in the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>President, broken through! Formally entering the awakened realm!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the genetic warriors that had been stuck at beyond A class for a long time started breaking through one after another. Numerous powerful auras soared up into the sky, piercing straight into the clouds. The aura of the awakened engulfed the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Send the coordinates over to the Genetic Union.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>\"Regardless of whether anyone is dispatched over, each aura must be recorded. An era of chaos is coming. We must perform our tasks well and not be a burden.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>The detectors of the Research Agency remained as calm as ever as they continued transmitting all recorded coordinates over to the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>The deputy president sighed deeply. \"Looks like we will be quite busy.\" Duma had merely given a simple description to explain what had happened. That was already sufficient for the Genetic Union to figure out how heavy the burden on them was now. The awakened ones were way too powerful, so powerful that they could not afford to allow any of the awakened ones to be outside their supervision.</p><br/><p>\"The gods will not appear yet for now. Presently, our biggest issue is these newly awakened ones. Nobody knows if any of them will overstep their bounds. Therefore, we must establish contact with them as soon as possible. Our first option is to recruit them, to try and make them one of us as fast as possible. Any treatment we can afford them, we shall. The second option is to cooperate with them. If we can't make them one of us, we can propose a cooperation to first stabilize the counterparty. All is fine so long as they don't mess around.\" Without hesitation, the deputy president decided, \"If even that doesn't work, and we can't initiate any proper communication with them\u2026 kill!\"</p><br/><p>Although there were a lot of new awakened ones, a large majority of them were still rather clueless, and it was rather impossible for them to have any network with other awakened ones this early. As such, now would be the perfect time to deal with them.</p><br/><p>After all, the Genetic Union was the organization with way too many genetic warriors that had been stuck at beyond A class. As such, even in this new age, the Genetic Union still remained the organization with the highest number of awakened ones. This, coupled with the help of the ancient race, meant the Genetic Union would be able to control the general situation.</p><br/><p>\"Some of them are newly awakened ones, whereas some are those who have fused with a primordial fragment and are much stronger than the average awakened one. As such, we will be operating in teams of two. Everyone else shall temporarily act as support staff for the awakened ones, helping in teleportation, energy recovery, and so on. We must ensure that our awakened ones can always maintain their peak form.\"</p><br/><p>All the orders issued by the deputy president were implemented in an orderly fashion.</p><br/><p>\"At present, anyone can fall into confusion except us, the Genetic Union. Do you all understand me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>The Genetic Union started operating at their maximum capacity. Alas, the deputy president was also aware that this was the mere beginning of everything.</p><br/><p>At the same time, in numerous locations around the world, numerous phenomena appeared. Numerous multicolored streaks of light shot out of Mysterious Town before entering the bodies of different people and fusing with them, becoming a powerful yet mysterious force.</p><br/><p>A youth who had just been rejected by his bride\u2026</p><br/><p>A young master that had just been crippled\u2026</p><br/><p>A student who had just been dumped by his girlfriend\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone awakened.</p><br/><p>The primordial fragments seemed to be intentionally locating these peoples that had suffered setbacks yet possessed a strong will, selecting these hot-blooded peoples as their host, regardless of gender and age!</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>The Research Agency's alarm rang without stop. The equipment that had been used to detect primordial auras was presently flickering nonstop, generating coordinate after coordinate. Several thousands of locations had already been detected to have had primordial aura appearances.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain forest, by a certain lake, a black leopard was lying down lazily. Suddenly, the fur on its entire body stood on end. Its narrowed eyes gleamed with a sharp ray of light as it gazed at the lake surface. There, where only a crater remained of what used to be a lake, suddenly, lake water started gushing out.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>The entire crater was filled with the lake water. Once again, a mysterious yellow stone radiated on top of it.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A terrifying power pierced into the clouds. Starting at the middle of the lake, a terrifying undulation swept out, engulfing the entire forest. At this moment, all life-forms there could feel the emergence of a formidable and mysterious power.</p><br/><p>Within the lake, all life-forms mutated instantly.</p><br/><p>Those life-forms that had previously only been beyond A classes, A classes, or even B classes all mutated. Some of them even entered the awakened realm instantly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire lake started bubbling, and a dreadful aura emanated out, seemingly engulfing the entire world. As for that black leopard, thanks to its role as the guardian of this stone all this while, it was bestowed with a huge amount of power. Its strength increased without stop, instantly entering the apex of the awakened.</p><br/><p>Howl!</p><br/><p>It let loose a howl, an incredibly majestic howl.</p><br/><p>Boundless Sea.</p><br/><p>This sea that had remained still for countless years started raging. This domain that had remained unexplored by humans all this while was at this moment emanating an astonishing power.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous terrifying gigantic creatures appeared. These were gigantic creatures that were truly from the depths of the Boundless Sea. Compared to those mutated life-forms of the inland seas, these creatures were much more powerful. With their appearance, the entire sea trembled. In a certain fishing village by the sea, a white-haired old man was gazing at the sea as he let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\"Even these fellows have awakened. Looks like fishing will no longer be possible in the future.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

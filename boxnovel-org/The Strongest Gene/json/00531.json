Everyone glanced over and was greatly alarmed, as that person was precisely Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>A bellow could be heard. \"Chen Feng, go away!\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei was going to be killed. If even Chen Feng was killed as well\u2026 They could already imagine how much of a loss that would be for humanity. They still had no idea why the devil race was so persistently trying to kill Li Lei. However, Chen Feng absolutely could not die. In front of him presently was a devil race member with the combat power of a beyond A8, whereas Chen Feng\u2026 Despite Chen Feng being truly strong, he was still only a beyond B9. Between Chen Feng and this devil race member, there was a gap of nine ranks.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was anxious, hoping that Chen Feng wouldn't deliver himself to death.</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled. He was aware of his own strength. However, he was even more curious about the real reason the devil race was insistently trying to kill Li Lei. Why was that? Was it due to Han Meimei? Chen Feng laughed with self-mockery as he thought of a joke that nobody of this world could understand.[1] 1</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A piercing chill could be felt from the air. The devil race member's attack had finally arrived. Chen Feng's eyes became sharp and a full set of Energy Equipment appeared all around his body. Gazing at the powerful devil race member in front of him, his hand slowly stretched out.</p><br/><p>\"God! Punisher!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A dazzling radiance erupted. The eyes of the devil race member gleamed coldly as the power in its hand became even sharper. This was an ability that the devil race was aware of.</p><br/><p>Back then, during the Star City battle, the final defeat of the devil race had been due to this ability. Even though nobody had been aware of this back then, along with the spread of Chen Feng's name after that battle, this ability had become similarly well known as well. Moreover, this ability of Chen Feng's had been analyzed clearly, especially by the experts of the devil race.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>God Punisher</p><br/><p>Pro: Incomparably powerful. The longer the cast time, the more powerful it will be.</p><br/><p>Con: The strength of the attack during the first half minute is pitifully weak.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>The devil race member sneered as it recalled the description of this ability. Hehe. Was Chen Feng truly treating the devil race as some wild beasts? Did the humans truly believe that the devil race members did not know how to go online? For this devil race member to come here, it had already been ready to not return alive. As such, it didn't fear anything. If so, why would it be afraid of this ability of Chen Feng's that had a long activation time?</p><br/><p>\"Die!\" The figure of the devil race member vanished into nothingness. Its powerful attack merged with its body. The devil race member planned to kill both Chen Feng and Li Lei.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it!\"</p><br/><p>The expressions of the beyond A classes there changed greatly as they saw this. If something happened to both Chen Feng and Li Lei\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah!\"</p><br/><p>They struggled frantically. The imprints sealing the movement of their bodies were already tottering. Some cracks had even appeared. Alas, the imprints still remained. This was a forbidden sacrificial technique. The more enemies there were, the weaker the might would be. As such, the devil race member had only proceeded with sealing them after properly calculating the amount of beyond A classes here, just so they could have this single opportunity to kill.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The beyond A classes erupted with their final struggle, yet the imprints remained. They could only watch on with despair as that devil race member pierced through Chen Feng and Li Lei with a terrifying radiance. That pitch-black streak in the air\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>The pitch-black streak flashed forth. The expected piercing did not appear. Instead, that terrifying black radiance paused midair as a familiar figure appeared from amid the darkness. That was Chen Feng! Everyone's eyes widened as they noticed that Chen Feng was actually still alive.</p><br/><p>Even that devil race member was staring at Chen Feng with an expression of disbelief. None of them had expected that the mere peak B-class Chen Feng was actually capable of forcefully blocking a single attack from this devil race member. Moreover, this was an incredibly powerful attack, equivalent to a full-powered strike from a beyond A8. He was skipping ranks while battling? But how was this possible?</p><br/><p>This devil race member here did not have the strength of those beyond A1 warriors who had just broken through. Rather, it had the strength of a beyond A8, an expert nearly at the top of existence. How had this\u2026</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A terrifying radiance flashed in Chen Feng's eyes, causing one's heart to flutter. This sight was extremely unfamiliar yet familiar at the same time.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Chen Feng merely smiled but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>A mouthful of blood was spat out.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng cursed. \"Damn it.\" Currently, his entire body was aching, nearly collapsing, yet he forced himself to stood firm and upright. He could most definitely resist this. He was Chen Feng, after all, a person who, when he'd first entered B class back then, had already been capable of killing A classes. Now that he was a peak beyond B class and his strength had greatly increased, why couldn't he kill a beyond A class?</p><br/><p>What was there to be afraid of? Beyond A8? So what? did the devil race member believe that only the devil race knew about sacrificial battling methods?</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The veins all over Chen Feng's body ruptured. Even the Energy Equipment failed to protect these veins. At the instance of the rupture, a powerful energy condensed within Chen Feng's body, helping him block this formidable first strike.</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing shout from that devil race member resounded. \"How did you defend against that attack?\"</p><br/><p>The God Punisher here was truly excessively powerful. This was not supposed to be possible. If this was the same God Punisher from back then and it had truly been this powerful, wasn't Chen Feng someone capable of defying even the heavens? This ability\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>Two sounds erupted in succession. Once again, the devil race member charged at Chen Feng. The devil race member had to kill Chen Feng as soon as possible. That was because, based on the activation method of God Punisher, the longer one waited, the stronger it would be. As such, this devil race member would truly be dead in the hands of this ability if he waited.</p><br/><p>Kill! The alarmed devil race member pushed all its strength out and concentrated it on Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"Ah.\" Chen Feng sneered. \"You truly believe that the present God Punisher is still the same as the past God Punisher? The progress of half a year\u2026\" Chen Feng stated with melancholy.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, a terrifying radiance converged together.</p><br/><p>The speed of release and eruption of the present God Punisher was much greater than when Chen Feng had just broken through into B class back then. This was a God Punisher that was in a totally different league.</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>God Punisher erupted crazily. A terrifying radiance collided with the devil race member's attack.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright explosion erupted. Both of them were actually evenly matched.</p><br/><p>\"This, this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The devil race member was dumbstruck. How had this happened? It could clearly sense that this God Punisher was still increasing in strength. According to this, the devil race member was no longer Chen Feng's match. The memory of how the ancient race member had suffered from God Punisher back then was still vivid. What to do, then? This devil race member was obviously collapsing emotionally. They had made a huge amount of preparations and even prepared a suicide attack as their final trump card. Unexpectedly, their perfect plan was being stopped by Chen Feng alone.</p><br/><p>What to do? The devil race member panicked. The strength of Chen Feng's God Punisher was obviously increasing, and those beyond A classes were on the verge of breaking out of their imprints. One more second and this devil race member would die here. It would either be killed by those beyond A classes or by Chen Feng's God Punisher.</p><br/><p>It was not afraid of death. However, the mission had to be completed before that. The devil race member could not die pointlessly here. As long as Li Lei was still unconscious, the devil race member would still have a chance to kill him in the future.</p><br/><p>The devil race member made the correct decision. Depart!</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>Instantly, this final devil race member retreated rapidly.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Its body vanished into nothingness and was concealed after taking one more attack of Chen Feng's by force.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The air trembled, yet the devil race was already nowhere to be seen. And now, finally, those beyond A classes were free of the imprints sealing them. They wanted to pursue that devil race member yet had no idea where to start and could only look at the Chen Feng that was shining so dazzlingly there.</p><br/><p>However, for reasons unknown, the God Punisher that was supposed to be increasing in strength was actually becoming weaker, to the point the attacks were nearly nonexistent right now. Finally, with Chen Feng maintaining the same pose when God Punisher was first activated...</p><br/><p>Pop!</p><br/><p>A green wisp of smoke shot out.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that a particular ability was trying to be released yet had been stuck for a long time, failing to be released. Only some leftover energy was shot out before God Punisher stopped.</p><br/><p>Over?</p><br/><p>Everyone was somewhat dumbstruck as they saw this. Was this a fraud God Punisher? Right at this instant, Chen Feng's body collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone around him was greatly alarmed. Chen Feng was still sober and could only watch helplessly as his body collapsed. In order to block the first attack of that devil race member, his strongest trump cards had already been used: Virus Mode, God Punisher, and Energy Equipment. These three combined was already the strongest eruption he was capable of.</p><br/><p>How was it possible for this God Punisher to perform as usual, to grow stronger the longer it was activated? Chen Feng had merely used his Luck Aura to change the sequence of release and had released the final abilities first before letting the weaker abilities out. This time, the circumstances had truly been dangerous. As such, Chen Feng had forced the strongest ability out immediately after activation. For this version of God Punisher, only the first two seconds would consist of powerful attacking abilities. As such, Chen Feng had only been able to last for two seconds.</p><br/><p>The only reason it had still been so powerful was because of Chen Feng's Virus Mode. Indeed, Virus Mode. This was a unique ability Chen Feng had created early on. By using the aurora reagent, he entered Virus Mode, forcing the affinity of his spiritual energy to the peak. Next, God Punisher erupted, releasing this explosive attack. As for the aftereffects, Chen Feng could clearly feel that his entire body had been emptied of energy. This was also the reason he didn't dare to use the aurora reagent as he wished.</p><br/><p>At his present level, using this aurora reagent was nearly equivalent to suicide. The strength was too powerful and terrifying. If his normal energy usage was equivalent to unleashing a water pipe, using God Punisher was equivalent to releasing a flood dam, a supereruption. What of aurora reagent, then? The description \"the torrent rolls thunderously on for a thousand li\" would be the apt description for this.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng collapsed on the ground even as his body remained straight. Numerous cries of alarm resounded around him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

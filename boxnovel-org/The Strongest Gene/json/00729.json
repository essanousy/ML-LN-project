This person, the one who had led them all here, was the very one who was messing this up.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng!\" Zhou Ye howled. He had truly never expected that Chen Feng would betray them.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's unhurried voice drifted over from the edge of the forest. \"As I said... I want her dead. You guys might be willing to compromise; however, that does not apply to me. I am not a traitor to the cause. You guys are.\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess blanked. \"Chen Feng?\" She had no idea what Chen Feng wanted to do. But since the seal had been released\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>She could once again feel the surging godly power within her.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The earth started trembling.</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess is on the verge of awakening?</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess checked the amount of godly power she had. Next, she hesitated momentarily before waving her hand, forcefully suppressing the awakening of the Forest Goddess. It was still not the time for the Forest Goddess to awaken. The Forest Goddess, the moment she awakened, would definitely stop lending her godly power to the Luck Goddess. At that time, the Luck Goddess would be in a different sort of trouble.</p><br/><p>The only reason the Luck Goddess was even awakening the Forest Goddess was so she could obtain a helper, since the Forest Goddess was the most obedient one of them all. However, if the Forest Goddess's strength exceeded a certain level, this obedience would no longer be guaranteed. As such, she decided to first suppress the awakening before anything else happened. If things truly did not play out as she planned\u2026 The Luck Goddess's eyes gleamed coldly as she thought of a possibility.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>She started absorbing a huge amount of godly power from the Forest Goddess. This time, she would not allow any mishaps to happen. As for these people here\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Her eyes gleamed coldly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Godly power erupted. Since Chen Feng had taken the Misfortune Pen with him, the Luck Goddess was once again linked with the Forest Goddess and was once again filled with power.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>She waved her hand. Next, a huge number of resonators died one after another.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was furious. \"Luck Goddess!\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess merely snorted coldly as a reply. \"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>A terrifying godly power erupted. Even Zhou Ye, the son of a god, could do nothing but defend and watch on as the terrifying godly power engulfed him.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Resonators died one after another. Under the rage of the Luck Goddess, none of them were able to escape.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng\u2026\" Zhou Ye clenched his teeth. \"What do you want, exactly?\"</p><br/><p>He truly could not understand. If Chen Feng wanted to kill the Luck Goddess, why had he unsealed her source of power? Why would he allow the Luck Goddess to once again establish a connection with the Forest Goddess? He felt like Chen Feng's brain was damaged, to have come to such a decision.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng, the next person to die will be you,\" the Luck Goddess said, boundless godly luck power swirling around her. Earlier, she had been trying to restrict the usage of godly power to avoid damaging the Forest Goddess. But now, in her rage, she no longer cared and was instead absorbing the Forest Goddess's power without stop.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A formidable godly power bloomed. The huge group of resonators all died, leaving only Zhou Ye, who was struggling with great difficulty.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess sneered. \"Descendant of a god?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a single kick, Zhou Ye started coughing blood. It was quite clear that he was stronger than the other resonators. However, that was all there was to it. Facing the relentless Luck Goddess, he couldn't persevere much longer.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Yet another mouthful of blood was coughed up.</p><br/><p>\"I can't last any longer?\" His expression dimmed. \"It is unfortunate that I wasn't able to kill you.\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess sneered. \"That is because of your own greed for the benefits you stood to gain. If you guys had truly come after me due to the grudges we had, why would you guys even consider signing the contract?\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye smiled bitterly. \"I\u2026\" His hatred toward the Luck Goddess was indeed irreconcilable. However, when those people had decided to give up on revenge to obtain some benefits, he had decided to compromise for their sake, as those people had dedicated their lives to him.</p><br/><p>Alas, he had neglected Chen Feng. True, they had all agreed to sign the contract, but what about Chen Feng? After all, the biggest reason he had wanted to kill the Luck Goddess was probably the Misfortune Goddess, right? He did not blame Chen Feng. It was as Chen Feng had said: they were the ones who had betrayed him.</p><br/><p>However, since Chen Feng wanted the Luck Goddess dead, why had he released the Forest Goddess? Zhou Ye could not understand.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2026 what exactly are you planning to do?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A surge of godly power blasted forth. Once again, Zhou Ye was flung away. This time around, he remained on the ground for a much longer time. This time, he was probably going to die for real.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye gazed at the sky helplessly and watched on as the Luck Goddess approached him, as that terrifying attack neared him. Right at this instant, the forest suddenly trembled.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire edge of the forest started trembling furiously.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The seething godly power of the Forest Goddess increased in intensity.</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess couldn't believe it. How had the Forest Goddess resumed the awakening? She had obviously been suppressed. With the Luck Goddess's boundless godly power of luck, it should be impossible for the Forest Goddess to resume her awakening. It would be apt to say that as of this moment, awakening was an impossibility for the Forest Goddess.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Ye understood. \"Hahaha!\" He smiled. \"Chen Feng\u2026 So it turns out you are planning to kill her this way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you saying?\" The Luck Goddess's gaze was cold as she wondered how this could relate to Chen Feng. Hold on. Luck\u2026 And that pen of Chen Feng's\u2026 Why had it been able to seal the Forest Goddess's power earlier? Hold on\u2026 She had obviously absorbed all his strength\u2026 Luck\u2026 And that pen\u2026 Using Spirit's memories, the Luck Goddess was able to reach a conclusion: misfortune!</p><br/><p>That pen had been unearthed together with her back then! The Misfortune Goddess! Suddenly, all of her questions from earlier were answered. From the moment Chen Feng's group had entered the salt lake, all the accidents and coincidences that had happened were finally explainable. All of that had actually been the work of the Misfortune Goddess!</p><br/><p>\"Bitch!\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess's expression sank. She had initiated the awakening of the Forest Goddess with the power of luck. Subsequently, she had converted luck into misfortune to force the Forest Goddess to stop awakening. And all that had most likely been sensed by the Forest Goddess even in her slumber. This was even truer now, since she was still linked with the Forest Goddess. Her act of absorbing a large portion of the Forest Goddess's godly power, nearly one-fifth of her power, was sufficient to turn them both against each other, making them enemies!</p><br/><p>\"Not good.\"</p><br/><p>Ultimately, the Luck Goddess intelligent.</p><br/><p>After figuring out how everything was related to that b*tch, Misfortune, she was able to quickly deduce the truth and was figure out her only option as of this moment: fleeing! With that slut, Misfortune, absorbing the misfortune power she had been using to suppress the Forest Goddess, the awakening was no longer stoppable; she had no choice but to flee. And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a terrifying power erupted. Near the forest, a seemingly boundless patch of vegetation started growing madly. No longer were these regular trees. Around each tree was formidable godly power.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, the forest was sealed up.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The earth trembled, and a lush green started growing. Zhou Ye smiled at this sight. The Forest Goddess had finally awoken.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A green branch swept out, forcefully flinging the escaping Luck Goddess into the forest once again.</p><br/><p>A tender voice sounded, \"You\u2026 have been too excessive!\"</p><br/><p>Evidently, the Luck Goddess's actions had thoroughly angered the Forest Goddess. The entirety of the forest seemed to be going berserk. A violent power was surging from the forest. Who was the one who had absorbed her power? Who was the one who had suppressed her awakening? And who was the one who had ultimately allowed her to awaken? The Forest Goddess was clear on all these things.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess's expression sank. \"Not good.\"</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess was indeed the most obedient, but she was also the most stubborn. During the Primordial Era, when everyone had been cursing the Luck Goddess, the Forest Goddess had stubbornly stuck around. Yet now, the moment she saw what kind of person the Luck Goddess was, she naturally possessed the most intense hatred toward the Luck Goddess. As such, the Luck Goddess had no intention of trying to argue her way out of this.</p><br/><p>Flee! This was all she could do now. Earlier, when she had first had that bad premonition, she had been able to absorb a huge amount of power before the awakening. She believed that with this much godly power, she would have no problem escaping. Alas, right as her godly power surged out, a sense of oppression appeared around her, as if this was what the heavens had mandated.</p><br/><p>\"Misfortune!\" the Luck Goddess shrieked furiously. It was this b*tch yet again!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

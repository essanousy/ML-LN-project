All the cities at the border became nightless cities. Together, they were called the \"Dreamland of Love and Desire\" and became a place countless people yearned to be. These cities became known as the cities of the millennia, cities that, regardless of whether one was human or an ancient, numerous lonely males and females could find happiness. The blending of humans and ancients progressed slowly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, not everything that had happened was good. In this weekend itself, a rather vile piece of news was spread. This was also the first conflict the humans and ancients had, an incident that alarmed the higher-ups of both parties.</p><br/><p>According to the reports, a certain female that enjoyed reading novels had been too engrossed by the world of a novel called Godly Model Creator. Ultimately, she had headed toward the house of the author, Minus Ninety Degrees, and tied him up, forcing him to release more chapters. Toward the end, genetic warriors had had to be mobilized to deal with this.</p><br/><p>This had raised an alarm among everyone, both humans and ancients. The higher-ups of the ancient race had issued a prohibition, telling the ancients that when living in the human world, they needed to abide by human laws and were not allowed to cause harm to others.</p><br/><p>They had once studied human society. In human society, everything needed to be paid for, yet for the ancients, the humans were providing all these services for free. From this, the sincerity of the humans was apparent. Besides, after experiencing all the humans had to offer, they were no longer willing to return to their primitive ways, their barren culture.</p><br/><p>If a war broke out, based on what they knew, all the entertainment methods the humans had created would end up destroyed, right? They had once watched the \"records\" of the humans, those things the humans called movies. Those movies had shown that during wartime, anything not related to strength would collapse and be destroyed in an extremely short amount of time. This was something they did not wish to see happen.</p><br/><p>After all, their race had been focused on strength for several thousand years. It had truly been a boring thing. Now, this world where humans and ancients coexisted was a new era that they loved deeply, something the ancient race longed for.</p><br/><p>Somewhat surprisingly, this incident instead caused the blending of both sides to progress even further both physically and mentally.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the incident where the author was kidnapped was labeled as a joke by both sides before it had a chance to stir up more emotion among the masses. This incident was even mentioned in a humorous way as some sort of joke. Things seemed to be progressing in a manner smoother than they had imagined.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in a different corner of the distant unknown region...</p><br/><p>In that dark and cold world, above the head of a huge and terrifying devil was an old devil with wrinkles all over his face. Presently, he was staring deeply in the direction of the human territory. This place was precisely the territory of the devils.</p><br/><p>\"Reporting.\"</p><br/><p>The latest update on the war was delivered to him. After the old devil read the report, he sank into a long silence. The number of wrinkles on his face seemed to have increased. How had this happened? He could not make sense of this. He had been looking forward to the war between the humans and ancients for a long time, looking forward to them massacring each other, looking forward to the appearance of that final ray of hope for them, and yet...</p><br/><p>The war between the humans and ancients had ended just like that? From the initial close combat, it had involved into a different form of \"close combat,\" one conducted in bed? This was too excessive! The old devil couldn't understand the reason for this. Even if the ancients had to look for breeding partners, wouldn't the devils be the more suitable option? Considering their gene pool and the similar emphasis on strength\u2026 The devils were obviously the more suitable option! Why had the ancients selected the humans?</p><br/><p>The old devil was clueless. In any case, this \"war update\" had caused his heart to chill. He had initially been planning to let the devil race became the third party and reap the profit after both the humans and ancients destroyed each other, but what should the devils do now? Threesome with the humans and ancients? Was this a joke?</p><br/><p>\"Humans... Ancients\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, slowly settling the raging anger in his heart. He could not allow himself to remain enraged. At present, the future of the devils was all under his control. Now, he would have to expedite his initial plan. After all, they did not have much time left.</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully, the information I have received is not wrong,\" he muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A pitch-black radiance swirled around him, and the bodies of both devils vanished amid the dark night. The devil race was presently searching for the final lifeline for their race.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>Time passed quietly.</p><br/><p>Half a month passed, and humans and ancients were blending together rapidly. The cities where this was happening were developing more and more as well. At this time, suddenly, news appeared that alarmed everyone. A certain young lady of the ancient race had gotten pregnant!</p><br/><p>That's right, after only one month, this had happened!</p><br/><p>Seemingly due to the unique combination of human and ancient, this child seemed incomparably powerful. The young lady was only one month pregnant yet the child was already somewhat large. Based on their estimations, this child was the size of a child that had been conceived around three months prior.</p><br/><p>Both sides were overjoyed at this. The appearance of this child was the greatest news to both the humans and ancients. After some inspections, they concluded that this child was in perfect health. The blend of human and ancient was simply flawless; no abnormalities were found.</p><br/><p>Along with the appearance of this child, other young ladies started getting pregnant en masse, like spring bamboos sprouting after the rain. The first grand army of the ancient race was thus transformed into the grand pregnant army.</p><br/><p>To ensure better lives for their children after birth, all these ancients ultimately decided to remain in the human cities. The living conditions back in the ancient race's territory were truly too harsh. After they discovered that the living conditions of the ancient race were in fact equivalent to the living conditions of the humans during the humans' Primitive Era, they were no longer willing to let their child experience such a life.</p><br/><p>After discussion, the higher-ups of the ancient race concluded that this was acceptable. After all, for the future of the ancients, they needed to ensure their children grew up in a good environment. It was the natural course of things to let these humans serve the ancients! Allowing their children to stay in the human cities was the most proper choice to make. But they still had a nagging feeling that something was wrong, though they were unable to discover what it was.</p><br/><p>Afterward, numerous pregnant ancient females stayed in the human cities. It reached a point where after some of them returned to the ancient race to visit their families and were unable to accept the primitive lifestyle there and decided to once again leave their hometown, to once again return to human society.</p><br/><p>Playing their role, the human had specially gotten the Research Agency to install the best child-raising facilities in these cities.</p><br/><p>They had even provided services to help the fathers of these children who were willing to take up the responsibility after impregnating these ladies. They would help these people establish families here. Examples of the services provided include father-seeking service, family-building courses, and so on.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, these children indeed settled here in the human cities. Just like that, this plan of assimilating the ancients into human culture was completed!</p><br/><p>At present, those at the Genetic Union were also discussing this development.</p><br/><p>\"Have the traits of the ancient race been erased from them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, the water, the food... Everything in those cities has been mixed with chemicals capable of erasing the traits of the ancient race. Slowly, they will lose what makes them the ancient race, slowly becoming true humans\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, if the ancients and humans can truly coexist peacefully, for the sake of a better future, it is indeed better to erase those unique traits of theirs. For example, some of them have tails and so on\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\"</p><br/><p>This was their common goal. They had always been intending to eradicate the mutants of the human world and the special traits of the ancient race that made them seem less human. Only after doing all this, eliminating all discrimination based on one's appearance, would future progress be easier.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if in a class of 30 students, one of them had a tail, would that single person be treated like a regular person? That was not possible. As such, these special traits needed to be eliminated. This was something the Genetic Union, Gene Production Association, and the Research Agency were working hard at.</p><br/><p>At present, the humans and the ancients were still in a honeymoon phase, in complete harmony. Just as they were starting to believe that they could take a short rest and wait for the complete assimilation in peace, a new update was received from the Research Agency.</p><br/><p>Their research on the devil prince had borne fruit!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

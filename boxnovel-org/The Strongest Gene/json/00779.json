The god who had originally occupied the divine seat would be temporarily displaced. After all, if an occupied divine seat was successfully challenged, it proved how weak the god was. And naturally, the god deprived of a divine seat would no longer enjoy the power of faith.</p><br/><p>He would have to initiate a challenge of his own and succeed at the trial to retake the divine seat to once again enjoy the power of faith. This was how the divine seat trial used to work. However, Chen Feng\u2019s trial was an incredibly special one. Due to the unique circumstances and the deliberate doings of certain people, what had appeared this time was the incredibly rare resonator\u2019s divine seat trial. In this trial, only 1% of the original\u2019s god strength would be exhibited.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this trial had been approved by the original god himself, the Sin God. Therefore, the Sin God had completely fallen into this trap set for him. However, even 1% of the strength of this incomparably powerful Sin God was not something a regular person could ever hope to contend with, especially in this situation where, with the exception of Chen Feng, only apostles were taking part in the trial.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short\u2026 that fellow is also displaying the strength of an apostle.\u201d Chen Feng frowned. He could see that the newcomer was extremely powerful. However, the silhouette was still not necessarily more powerful than the Sin God. Moreover, Chen Feng also had a question. Who exactly was this fellow? Under the Sin God\u2019s control, nearly all the gods and apostles were subservient to him. If so, who was this that had dared to challenge the Sin God? There was only one possibility. This challenger was not a person of this era, the era of Sin God.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng thought of a possibility. \u201cA god that awoke during the Genetic Era?\u201d This situation was only possible if this god had awoken during the Genetic Era and had intelligently hidden his aura and not participated in any battles. However, after the Sin God had recovered, the entire world was transformed by him. As such, his senses should have swept past the entirety of the world. How had this fellow remained hidden from the Sin God?</p><br/><p>The only answer to that was outer space. Chen Feng gasped in shock at this realization. Suddenly, he recalled how, back then, numerous spaceships had headed to outer space, yet all of them had vanished without a trace. Toward the end, the Genetic Union had indeed deployed some people to investigate this. Alas, they had still been waiting for results when the Sin God recovered and conquered the world. In short, this god had hidden in outer space?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng\u2019s heart started palpitating.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a terrifying power emerged, seemingly trying to erase something. However, after encountering the miniature person within him, the power was noiselessly erased.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat power has appeared yet again.\u201d Chen Feng\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. This time, he had been able to clearly sense the existence of the power. Outer space\u2026 So long as one thought about it, that power would emerge to erase that thought? Why? Because of that god? It seemed like he had indeed been made a chess piece. Indeed, he was a chess piece. However, from the moment that god had started involving himself in everything that was happening, which of them was not but a chess piece?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cNow, let us see who shall be laughing in the end\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He strode forth into the alien world. Next, the entire alien world throbbed with godly power, signifying the official start of the trial.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the alien world, the moment the silhouette appeared, several apostles were killed in succession by him. This shocked the other apostles so badly that they all started getting out of his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that fellow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. Is he a newcomer like Chen Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is very strong. The apostles that have been killed were all level 15 apostles, yet not a single one of them was able to endure one of his moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the apostles had unsightly expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is heading directly toward the divine seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like we are nothing to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Those god\u2019s descendants will not watch on as this divine seat is stolen right before them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us go nearer as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>They followed along noiselessly. At this time, in the numerous crooks and corners of this alien world, something similar was happening. Even if the regular apostles had charged into this world the moment it opened, when the truly powerful apostles appeared, they were reduced to nothing but cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered everywhere. One powerful apostle after another revealed themselves. There was a certain apostle with extraordinary strength. The moment he entered this world, he started slaughtering everyone he encountered. Every apostle that dared to provoke him was ripped apart, showcasing his dreadful strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him! I have seen him once before. He is the descendant of a major god,\u201d a random apostle cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a different part of the alien world, a certain apostle had just entered.</p><br/><p>In his hand was a huge hatchet that was glowing with overflowing colors. A single wave was all it took to kill an apostle. Moreover, with a single wave, even a mountain was cut in two. His strength was evident.</p><br/><p>Yet another apostle cried out in alarm. \u201cI have seen that apostle as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood lord, he is the brother of a certain powerful god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI always thought that he was already a god. Unexpectedly, he has yet to participate in a trial.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Since the level of this trial was too low, all the apostles that had previously been unqualified to participate in such a trial were now here.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, so this I what a divine seat trial is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this your first time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I am but a mere level 8 apostle. Haha, don\u2019t worry. I will most definitely not enter deeply into the world and will only be staying in the outer region.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, let us bask in the light of these big shots as they ascend into godhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suppose it is sufficient for us to enjoy the soup when the big shots are eating the meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such words started appearing from the mouths of some of the apostles. Evidently, a lot of them were only here to join in the fun.</p><br/><p>A certain level 15 apostle frowned when he saw these apostles. \u201cThese people are clearly feeling suicidal.\u201d It was fine for them to be weak. However, were they not worried that the mere fluctuations of the battles here would injure or even kill them? After all, they were truly too weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They can do whatever they want. And to fish in troubled water, is this not how the world has always been?\u201d a friend of the level 15 apostle said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He chuckled before lowering his voice, \u201cWill you be participating in this trial as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The friend smiled bitterly. \u201cI am but a mere level 12 apostle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, who are you trying to trick?\u201d the other apostle said in a low voice. He started egging his friend on. \u201cYour combat power is different than your actual level. I can remember clearly how, when you were a level 1 apostle, you were already capable of defeating a level 13 apostle. Now that you are already a level 12 apostle, this trial\u2026 there is no harm in trying, right? Perhaps you might even succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The friend shook his head. \u201cNope, there is absolutely no chance of me succeeding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause this is related to the Sin God?\u201d The apostle appeared rather dispirited. There was nothing they could do about it. A trial like this was unprecedented, and some could already see that this was in some way related to the Sin God. However, they had yet to figure out what exactly was going on. Instinctively, they all believed that this was just a trial the Sin God had activated so that a certain person he had picked could ascend into godhood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Rather, I am not joining because of the trial-taker this time.\u201d He laughed and continued, \u201cChen Feng is not a person that will ever stay obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other apostle was filled with doubt. Chen Feng? That cannon fodder? Could he truly exert any sort of influence on an event at this level? He could not understand this reasoning. However, as he saw his friend\u2019s solemn expression, he instantly had a feeling that there was some profound mystery at work here. Perhaps this friend of his that had always been mysterious had once again obtained some secret information not known to anyone? It seemed like this trial would become interesting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

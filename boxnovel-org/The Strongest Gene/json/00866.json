Bang!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan attacked madly. His penetrated fist was healing rapidly. His powerful fists rained down, as he intended to punch Kong Bai to death. The difference in strength between them was too great. Even though these were merely physical attacks, the amount of energy within Luo Yuan was not something Kong Bai could compare to. After all, this was the difference between one at the peak and a beginner. This was a difference even quantity could not hope to match.</p><br/><p>And thus, Kong Bai received grave injuries. Alas, it was right in the midst of all the punches that Luo Yuan heard that damnable question again.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d Kong Bai asked with a hoarse voice unique to the elderly. He was still asking this question even though his face was already filled with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mom!\u201d Luo Yuan was truly infuriated. Even at times like this, Kong Bai was still role-playing?</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong answer,\u201d the elderly Kong Bai replied.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Two golden beams flashed out of his eyes, instantly penetrating Luo Yuan\u2019s body. To both the left and right of his heart were two huge holes, nearly choking Luo Yuan. This damnable ability! He thought that this effect might be related to the Demonic Mirror. In his memories, if the same person kept giving the wrong answer, the damage the mirror could inflict would increase. If the person continued to give the wrong answer, the mirror\u2019s attacks would become extremely scary due to the amplification effect.</p><br/><p>Naturally, this was only applicable to the Demonic Mirror of the past. Now that the attacks could be unleashed personally by Kong Bai, so long as Kong Bai decided to attack the same person without stop, the damage inflicted would only continue to increase. Therefore, Luo Yuan could not afford to allow Kong Bai to continue attacking. After all, at this point, this attack was already sufficient to injure Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>After making up his mind, Luo Yuan\u2019s attacks intensified. The might of a peak true god was fired right into Kong Bai\u2019s body with each punch. As of this moment, Kong Bai did not even look like a human anymore. His body had nearly been destroyed by Luo Yuan. And it was precisely under such a circumstance, when even Luo Yuan thought that it was time to stop, that that damnable question was asked once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d asked that elderly voice.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was utterly dumbstruck. Still asking? Was Kong Bai stupid or what? He looked at Kong Bai. Right now, Kong Bai\u2019s consciousness was hazy, and his physical body was already crippled. So why was he still asking this stupid question?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was infuriated. \u201cWho tells you to keep asking this question?\u201d He sent a punch to Kong Bai\u2019s head before digging Kong Bai\u2019s eyes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Come, ask me again,\u201d Luo Yuan said with a fierce gaze. Chen Feng had played him for several decades. And now, even Kong Bai dared to play around with him? How ridiculous!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His final punch scattered Kong Bai\u2019s final breath. It was finally over! Luo Yuan heaved a sigh of relief. Alas, right at this instant, he heard that horrifying voice waffle out from Kong Bai\u2019s body again. \u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes went wide. How was this possible? Kong Bai was already completely dead; not even his corpse was intact anymore. How could he still ask a question? Hold on, if that was the case, how about his attack?</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Radiance began gathering. Perhaps due to the beating delivered by Luo Yuan, his time, Luo Yuan was able to clearly see the whole process of the energy gathering for this attack. Kong Bai\u2019s eyeballs, which had been crushed by Luo Yuan, transformed into countless light fragments, which were presently hovering in midair. Every single fragment was gathering a resplendent radiance around it.</p><br/><p>All around Luo Yuan, the fragments were shining brightly.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was alarmed. Even after being crushed, his eyeballs could still gather that radiance? Moreover, from the scope of the radiance that was gathering this time\u2026 Luo Yuan\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This is not a power Kong Bai should be capable of! Kong Bai\u2026 Demonic Mirror\u2026 Question\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Luo Yuan understood. Kong Bai? No, there was no Kong Bai. This so-called elder here was in fact the incarnation of the Demonic Mirror. Luo Yuan\u2019s initial guesses had been correct, as Kong Bai had indeed devoured the Demonic Mirror. However, the final aspects of his guesses were wrong. After the fusion, Kong Bai and the mirror hadn\u2019t become one. Rather, the mirror had taken the lead in this fusion. This elderly Kong Bai was essentially the Demonic Mirror!</p><br/><p>That damnable Kong Bai had actually given up his own consciousness and handed everything over to the damnable mirror! Was it purely because the mirror was stronger? As Luo Yuan\u2019s thoughts reached this point, his heart chilled. He knew that this was a result of his neglect. He had assumed that common sense would apply here.</p><br/><p>After all, in normal circumstances, nobody would sacrifice themselves for the sake of their ability. To be precise, this sacrifice was for the sake of a piece of equipment. This was not something anyone would do. Definitely not Luo Yuan. Yet Kong Bai had done precisely that. Without hesitation, he had sacrificed himself, only leaving behind some memories for the Demonic Mirror, the memories saying that Kong Bai was the most handsome, before passing away.</p><br/><p>In short, the question he kept asking was in fact necessary! So it turned out that if one answered that Kong Bai was the most handsome, one would truly survive. After all, this was the Demonic Mirror\u2019s obligation. Those who answered correctly would be spared. But then, some gods had clearly been forced to disfigure themselves before being allowed to survive. Why was that?</p><br/><p>Some of the gods that hadn\u2019t opted to disfigure themselves had been killed. How had they died then? Hadn\u2019t their answers been correct? Those gods were the main reason Luo Yuan had been sure that Kong Bai had fused with the mirror. But now that he looked at it, that was probably just an unfounded rumor.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan clenched his fists tightly. \u201cI have been misled by those damnable fellows.\u201d The gods he had brought along were truly useless. Not only had they failed in their hunt, but they had even brought him false intelligence. This had resulted in his lapse in judgment. Those gods had indeed deserved death.</p><br/><p>Of course, Luo Yuan\u2019s main focus was not on those dead gods. Rather, he was focused on the flowing radiance around him. After transforming into particles, the power gathered by the eyes was becoming increasingly scary. Each of the fragments was capable of gathering power no weaker than what the entire eyeball had gathered previously. Now there were over 1,000 of these fragments here. Luo Yuan also finally got a clear look at these fragments. He found that these weren\u2019t eyeball fragments. Rather, they were the fragments of the mirror! That elderly Kong Bai was indeed the incarnation of the mirror.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The fragments began to shine brightly. Luo Yuan\u2019s body chilled as he sensed the killing intent taking form around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKong Bai! Kong Bai is the most handsome!\u201d Luo Yuan yelled out hastily. Alas, he received no response. His answer was late. Too late. The moment the Demonic Mirror proclaimed that the wrong answer had been given, the attack had to be delivered. This shattered Demonic Mirror\u2019s final attack was also the scariest one yet.</p></div>\n</div>"}

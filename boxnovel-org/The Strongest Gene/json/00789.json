A minor change had occurred in his plan. However, his plan\u2019s general direction remained unchanged. In his original plan, he would have been the one to ascend. He would have been the one to defeat all opposition and kill Ye, then release the human world, becoming a god like the Creation God of the past. Yet now, this position had been taken by Chen Feng instead.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Chen Feng was too weak. With his strength, even after ascension, he would still be a weakling. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. At the very least, Chen Feng wouldn\u2019t have much effect on the guy on the throne\u2019s plan. As for the matter of believers, it would be quite simple to make those humans his believers.</p><br/><p>The guy on throne pondered the matter but did not seem too bothered. \u201cWell, I shall let you have fun for a few days. Even if Chen Feng is able to transform all of humanity, I still have a way to make them all my believers. Therefore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking it through, he decided that his attention should still be focused on Ye. At present, his priority should be Ye, the one with frightening strength.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng has ascended.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sin God had also sensed Chen Feng\u2019s aura. Chen Feng\u2019s ascension came as no surprise to him, as he was the one who had personally handed the divine seat to Chen Feng. After all, handing it to Chen Feng was much better than letting that culprit have it. In any case, he had indeed felt a threat of some sort from that culprit.</p><br/><p>With Chen Feng\u2019s ascension, his believers in the human world would naturally be affected. However, it shouldn\u2019t be too major an effect. After all, the human population was extremely large. Moreover, the faith that these intelligent life-forms could provide was much greater in amount than that of the beasts. After a full 12 years of hard work, he had only been able to convert a small portion of humanity into his believers.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Feng? He would only have a few days worth of time to do as he wished with that world. Ye believed that he would only need to spend a day or two dealing with that culprit before he could retake the human world. With only a few days, Chen Feng would not be able to accomplish much. How many believers could he gain in such a short period? The population of the human world surpassed 100 million. The Sin God wasn\u2019t the least bit worried about what Chen Feng could do to a world with such a huge population.</p><br/><p>How many believers could Chen Feng gather in a few short days? It wouldn\u2019t be many. Even if Chen Feng was allowed free rein, he wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish much. This was common sense among gods. As such, this was what both the guy on the throne and Ye thought.</p><br/><p>Unknown to them, the instant Chen Feng appeared, the two godly powers that had been concealed within the human world became active. These two godly powers, which had been spread throughout the world, slowly returned, gradually flowing back into Chen Feng\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>These two were precisely Luck and Misfortune.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s mouth curled up into a smile. \u201cYou two have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Spirit\u2019s bright, wide eyes were filled with joy. They had been waiting for this moment for far too long.</p><br/><p>Spirit smiled gracefully. \u201cI have accumulated quite a bit of godly power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Misfortune\u2019s words were as concise as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Well then, let us begin.\u201d Chen Feng stretched out both his hands.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Boundless godly power rippled out. This was his very own godly power, the godly power of Luck and of Misfortune. And thus the entire world started to transform.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have returned. Humanity has returned. However, this is the era of the gods. The Sin God has yet to be defeated. There will be a day when he returns once again to challenge me, to make a move against you all. Therefore, I require your help,\u201d Chen Feng said in a sonorous tone. \u201cTogether, before the Sin God returns, let us become stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>His every word reverberated throughout the entire human world. The power of luck and misfortune rippled out noiselessly. Nearly everyone in the world heard his words. When they heard his words, seemingly under the effect of a certain power, they all happened to think of a certain issue, that this world indeed required an even stronger guardian.</p><br/><p>Evidently, Chen Feng needed to be stronger as well. They, the believers, would be able to allow Chen Feng to become even stronger. At this thought, some of them even became excited.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, numerous pillars of light shot into the sky. The radiance that was supposed to head toward the Sin God headed toward Chen Feng. Numerous weak powers of faith converged together, becoming a huge roaring ocean.</p><br/><p>One hundred\u2026</p><br/><p>One thousand\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten thousand\u2026</p><br/><p>A hundred thousand\u2026</p><br/><p>A million\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Faith converged, forming a torrential river of faith. This river of faith belonged to Chen Feng alone. It was a link between him and his believers. Slowly, this channel reached an extremely terrifying level. The boundless godly power traveled without stop, and like a Milky Way that had descended from the sky, it all poured into Chen Feng\u2019s forehead, entering the imprint there.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>His imprint shone with a resplendent radiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the apostles were stupefied. Chen Feng had just recently become a god. How could he posses this many believers?</p><br/><p>Even the gods were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That surging godly power had surpassed even a huge number of the major gods. It was so terrifying that it could cause one\u2019s heart to flutter. With such godly power, Chen Feng was growing at a rapid speed.</p><br/><p>The numerous life-forms were completely stunned. They had no idea where Chen Feng had obtained these believers. This lasted until some gods finally noticed the recently appeared world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis world seems to have just appeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat world is this? This seems to be the source of Chen Feng\u2019s faith. Since he can do it, we can get believers from this world as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give it a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCount me in as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>And thus, countless gods entered the human world. Surprisingly, they were indeed able to obtain quite a large number of believers. After all, for the humans, these gods were true deities. So what if they believed in one?</p><br/><p>With the arrival of these gods, apart from Chen Feng, the sinners that used to be the Sin God\u2019s believers found new avenues of belief. And thus, more and more gods entered this world. As for Ye, he was busy preparing for his battle with that silhouette, completely oblivious to the fact that his believers were being split among the various gods.</p><br/><p>All the gods exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll these life-forms are actually godless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, the speed at which we can gather believers is so fast that it\u2019s inconceivable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of world is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was but the beginning of what was to come. What surprised them more was the fact that the believers attracted to Chen Feng seemed to be those at the lower rungs of society. These were the comparatively weaker ones, the strongest of which were only awakened ones. Naturally, these awakened ones had now resonated with Chen Feng\u2019s godly power and become resonators. Yet in this world, the original powerful resonators all seemed to have ignored Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. These resonators have probably chosen not to believe in Chen Feng because he is too weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is certain. After all, these resonators are all at around level 9 or 10. They are nearing their breakthrough. Almost every one of them is a future apostle. How could they select someone like Chen Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, they are mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods started proudly fighting over these \u201cstrongest resonators.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, there were quite a lot of these powerful resonators in this world.</p><br/><p>It seemed like these people had originally been with their respective gods; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be resonators in the first place. However, after these gods entered the world, they found that these resonators were all currently godless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are godless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is excellent!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the gods were enraptured. In their world, even though the resonators of minor gods could be transferred to other gods, they still required the god in question\u2019s agreement. As such, a culture of extortion had come into being. Yet here, these level 9 and 10 resonators, so near the apostle realm, were godless. This was like a feast for the gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre their original gods dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps these life-forms are attached to the original god that occupied that divine seat? Since Chen Feng has obtained the seat, this world has thus reappeared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat must be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. If I had known this earlier, I would have gotten my son to give his best shot at obtaining this divine seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that? Look at how Chen Feng obtained the divine seat. Yet this world has still been opened for everyone to fight for. For all the gods, this world is filled with riches.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods were all overjoyed as they gathered believers without stop, making the humans their believers. Naturally, they were unaware that the believers they had obtained were in fact a minority in this world. The largest portion was tightly under Chen Feng\u2019s control.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Mhm\u2026 Chen Feng should have received her message already, right? After all, that was Chen Feng. If so, what should she do next? The young lady was softly drawing a painting when she suddenly chuckled as she saw what the painting was. So this was what was going to happen? In that case, this should end not far in the future.</p><br/><p>However, who would be the one to survive till the end? The young lady frowned as she started reflecting on this question seriously.</p><br/><p>At this time, Luo Yuan, who had just awakened from his resurrection, was searching for enemies crazily. Everyone seemed to have vanished. Luo Yuan, who was brimming with energy, had no way to release his pent-up energy and could only forcefully blast his accumulated energy at a nearby mountain.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire mountain crumbled.</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>Only now did Luo Yuan feel better. What followed next was a sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys think it will end if you flee? Hehe. Chen Feng, do you know that I am at my weakest presently? When my strength grows, what will you use to fight me? Escaping now was an idiotic choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was still furious. Those idiotic fellows believed that this would be the end? How naive. They must have believed that without the numerous life-forms supplying him faith, he would have no way of growing? Heh, he was Luo Yuan, the true number one person of this world. Even Chen Feng was not his opponent. Who could stop him? Since he was so powerful, he could once again regain what he had lost earlier by forcing those people to put the wristbands on again. The solution was indeed that simple.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He departed. He remembered that there was a city of ancients nearby. This city had a population of three million. This would be his first stop, Luo Yuan decided. This might be somewhat troublesome. However, he did not mind personally visiting all the cities worldwide to once again make them his believers. What was there to fear?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He moved like the wind. Shortly after, he reached the city.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying attack was unleashed on the empty air above the city. The originally tranquil city was suddenly engulfed by a boundless radiance, a radiance as bright as the sun itself.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Accompanied by that golden radiance, a majestic and divine aura descended upon this city.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was way too clear on what these so-called ancients and humans most lacked and feared. He was also clear on the most efficient method of completely forcing them to submission. It was precisely absolute strength.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying attack instantly blasted at the center of the city. Instantly, the place where the chief and the core figures of the city normally resided was disintegrated. A mushroom cloud soared as the bright explosion engulfed the entire city, a sight akin to the arrival of the apocalypse.</p><br/><p>Naturally, despite the showy and excessive effect, this attack only destroyed the city center. So long as the so-called chief, who was adept at inciting the feelings of the population, was eliminated, the rest could be easily dealt with. These people would ultimately still submit before him. Done with the show he intended the residents to see, Luo Yuan slowly headed toward the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSubmit or die.\u201d</p><br/><p>His ice-cold voice resounded throughout the city. From the void, he walked down toward the ground. Each step and each footprint was extremely casual and slow, yet with each step he took, a shiny gold radiance was left below his feet. His divine aura roiled out, seemingly boundless.</p><br/><p><em>This should do it. </em>Luo Yuan had a tranquil expression. Under his divine pressure, not a single soul dared make a sound in the entirety of the city. <em>Excellent. </em>Luo Yuan\u2019s mouth curled up, forming a smile. Finally, he landed. He had no choice but to land. After all, if he wanted them to wear his wristbands, he had to land so he could personally pass them the wristbands.</p><br/><p>However, when he neared the ground, he felt that something was off. Was there some sort of plot here? Was this the work of Chen Feng again? Yet another ambush? Instantly, Luo Yuan\u2019s vigilance rose. He forcefully stopped his descent.</p><br/><p><em>This Chen Feng\u2026</em></p><br/><p>He spread his senses around to confirm that there was no danger before slowly continuing his descent. When he finally landed, he understood the source of the earlier odd feeling. This city\u2026 was completely devoid of people! That\u2019s right, the city was completely empty!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was dumbfounded. Where were they? Where was the huge ancient race? In such a huge city, not a single one of those three million souls could be found?</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s going on? </em>Luo Yuan was thoroughly stupefied. Something had to be wrong. Luo Yuan spread his senses around once again, and his heart chilled when he confirmed that this city indeed empty. What had happened? He was horrified. Could it be that Chen Feng had sensed his arrival and had killed everyone first?</p><br/><p>No. Chen Feng was not such a determined person. Luo Yuan decided to take a look around. And thus, he roamed the city, targeting those items that the original owners had been unable to take away in time or that still had some warmth in them. Finally, he found the reason for all this.</p><br/><p>This city\u2026 and its people\u2026 hadn\u2019t died. Rather, they had all left. The instant the wristbands had been destroyed, everyone had immediately packed up and moved. Littered on the ground everywhere were broken wristbands.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan clenched his fists tightly. All gone\u2026 all gone! Since this city was empty, what was the point of his showy appearance earlier? Luo Yuan looked to the city center. The ruins of the destroyed building seemed to assume the form of an emoji sneering at him. This caused an inexplicable anger to rise within Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He attacked once again, destroying the ruins of the destroyed building.</p><br/><p><em>You all\u2026 actually decided to leave this city?</em></p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was filled with anger. His eyes flashed as scene after scene played in his vision. A powerful deduction ability activated. He wanted to see exactly where those fellows had gone.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Countless figures and scenes flashed past, unable to be joined together into a complete picture.</p><br/><p>Hmph!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan snorted coldly. Such a scene signified that someone was trying to mess with his deduction ability. Only gods were capable of this. In short, those ancients had not only packed up and left in haste, but they had also immediately begun to believe in a new god. With the blessing of their new god, they had all departed. They deserved death! Killing intent surged in Luo Yuan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Those damnable ancients would rather believe in some journeyman or elementary god than him, a true god surpassing even the major gods? How ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Slowly, some scenes became clearer in his vision. This allowed Luo Yuan a better view of what had happened. At present, the three million ancients were traversing a certain dangerous forest. At any given time, someone was dying or unable to keep up with the main party. This was, in fact, an incomparably bitter journey. So this was the life they had decided upon?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze burned. He couldn\u2019t believe that these fellows would rather live such a life. One ought to know that under his control, they would be able to enjoy a life with the greatest technology humans had to offer. Wasn\u2019t that better? How idiotic. He could hear the sounds of the scene he was seeing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep at it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people were encouraging their companions. Unfortunately, the deaths did not stop, and some were no longer capable of keeping up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t continue on anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people were on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiots.\u201d Luo Yuan was merely evaluating their choice coldly. Just look at them. Regretting their choice now, eh? Serves them right!</p><br/><p>However, just as Luo Yuan was thinking that they would finally give up, the leader of the group spoke. \u201cYou guys are giving up just like this? Have you guys forgotten your lives before? Do you guys not know that if you stop now, that demon king will come for you? Have you guys forgotten the fear of being controlled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>As these words resounded, these seemingly helpless people actually started moving once again. This was quite the astonishing recovery. The mere mention of that demon king could actually bring forth such an effect! Finally, the scene vanished from Luo Yuan\u2019s vision. He wanted to see clearly what was going on, but he couldn\u2019t see any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Serves you right.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt somewhat proud. Just look at those people. Due to their choice, they were now better off dead than alive. Forget about that casualty rate, they were even being hunted by some demon king? Hehehehe. But then, who exactly was the demon king they were speaking of?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan pondered this question for a long time. Suddenly, his complexion became extremely unsightly. He had suddenly thought of a possibility: could it be that this so-called demon king was actually him? What the f*ck!</p></div>\n</div>"}

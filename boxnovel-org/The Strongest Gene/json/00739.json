Infused with godly power, the raindrops soaked the earth, causing an uncountable number of gods to start slowly waking up. Every single day, powerful fluctuations could be felt from different corners of the world. These were the fluctuations caused by both gods and resonators awakening.</p><br/><p>Pressure unique to gods surged out without stop, causing the entire land to be subjected to a type of divine pressure. The darkest of the Primordial Era had finally fully descended, where resonators were everywhere and gods stood tall in every corner of the world. Millions upon millions of other life-forms were nothing but bugs.</p><br/><p>\"The gods have finally descended.\"</p><br/><p>At the summit of the ancient territory, Duma watched on silently. The humans would probably be in danger now. As for the reason? They were too weak, yet they occupied the largest portion of this world. Without a doubt, the moment the gods awakened, their attention would be on the humans.</p><br/><p>On top of that, there was a matter of faith. The act of worship and resonating toward a god served as an important foundation for the gods. Therefore, these newly awakened gods would probably have a rather intense struggle for believers among humanity. In such a situation, nobody could guarantee the safety of the human race.</p><br/><p>Duma would not be able to do so, nor could Chen Feng. Nevertheless, the complete annihilation of humanity was impossible. After all, they were the largest group of intelligent life-forms in this era. Even if the humans were reduced to slaves, the gods would definitely not allow them to go extinct. Despite that, humanity would not be able to avoid a calamity. Experts would die. Weaklings would die miserably. The only thing they could do was pray for the mercy of the Luck Goddess, hoping that nothing untoward would happen to them. Alas, even the Luck Goddess would not be able to protect them.</p><br/><p>\"Argghhhh\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Numerous bloodcurdling shouts could be heard. Within a pot of scalding green liquid, Xu Fei could be seen screaming. \"Duma, you old bastard. You are indeed thinking of eating me. Damn it, just you wait until I leave this place. I will cut your turtle head down and eat it as a stew.\"</p><br/><p>Duma's face darkened. \"Shut up.\" This bastard\u2026 Duma was helping Xu Fei increase his godly power, yet this was what he received? The human world\u2026 Forget it. Duma had ultimately decided to not tell Xu Fei about what was happening, since it would be pointless. If Xu Fei was told, he would probably be in a rush to leave this place. However, the only thing that would accomplish was giving his life away, and he would be of totally no help. As such, the only thing they could do now was wait, wait until Xu Fei fused with the godly power, until the moment he inherited the consciousness of the Turtle Spirit.</p><br/><p>Sorry, Duma said inwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Increase the temperature,\" Duma barked.</p><br/><p>\"Here, here.\"</p><br/><p>The little turtle bounced over and increased the temperature. With great joy, the little turtle watched on as Xu Fei was cooked. Tsk tsk, finally, this bastard Duma has changed his tastes.</p><br/><p>Yet another bloodcurdling scream sounded out. \"Ah\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Above the starry sky, an immense throne was faintly discernible.</p><br/><p>The man seated on the throne was still playing with the ring on his finger. His gaze swirled around, and once again, numerous battleships exploded just like fireworks. Done with that, his gaze landed on the planet before him. Godly powers were swirling about without stop as gods awakened one after another. Numerous formidable auras surged out. This initially ordinary-looking planet was finally no longer ordinary.</p><br/><p>The man watched on expressionlessly. After a long time, a tinge of disdain appeared in his eyes. Just like that, he watched on as this planet transformed, becoming unprecedentedly powerful. After a long time, his figure vanished once again. As for the huge throne, it slowly vanished amid space. Everything seemed the same as ever.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On a certain summit, a youth was smiling happily. \"Old man, is this your so-called calamity?\" With the rain, the awakening of all the gods had sped up, causing the gods that were supposed to slowly appear to all appear together. Suddenly, the entire world was in chaos. Mhm\u2026 The scene where all the gods were jumbled together like some dumpling\u2026 Tsk tsk.</p><br/><p>The old man blanked. \"I don't know.\" The future that had previously been readable had suddenly changed. The only thing he knew was that this land would encounter a huge calamity. But what exactly was the calamity? He had no answer to that. How could they deal with the calamity? He had no answer to that either.</p><br/><p>\"Pft.\" The youth curled his lips. \"If even this is not considered a disaster, what else can? Wu\u2014\" He stretched lazily. \"In any case, this is unrelated to us. Humans\u2026 Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within a certain high-rise building, a youth pulsing with faint godly power was sitting cross-legged. Interestingly, as the godly power pulsed, odd items flickered around him. Video games, computers, communicators, dolls\u2026 a certain odd-looking pink toy\u2026 and a pair of blue and white striped underwear still tinged with a certain smell\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Is this what you all require?\" the youth asked with a sigh. Kids nowadays sure had weird tastes.</p><br/><p>\"Go.\"</p><br/><p>He waved his hand. Next, those items pierced through the void, directly arriving beside the pillow of a certain someone.</p><br/><p>He could clearly feel that after doing this, his godly power had increased yet again. As for whether his gifts would bring that kid happiness or cause that kid to suffer a beating from his parents after waking up in the morning, it wasn't something this person was bothered with.</p><br/><p>The youth smiled proudly. \"After all, a price has to be paid for desires to be fulfilled.\" However, when his gaze landed on the rain outside, he sank into silence yet again.</p><br/><p>\"This situation\u2026 will bring Master worry, right?\"</p><br/><p>He was somewhat anxious. Since an unknown point in time, his master had transformed into humanity's only hope. By himself, he shouldered the responsibility of guarding the entire human race. Each step he took was so very arduous.</p><br/><p>He inhaled deeply. \"The primordial has descended\u2026 so what if you all are gods?\"</p><br/><p>\"My current strength is still far from sufficient. However, it won't be long before I become even stronger. Before you all have fully awakened, before you all have fully recovered\u2026 I will surpass you all! Then I can assist master and defeat you all!\"</p><br/><p>The youth raised his fist, filled with battle intent. Although the gods had awakened, they were still rather weak. After slumbering within nothingness for so many years, what strength they'd had should have already vanished. As such, they had no choice but to rebuild their strength. This would be a chance for humanity.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The youth took in a deep breath, then continued sitting cross-legged. His entire body turned translucent and appeared within the dreams of countless people, asking people what their desires were. World peace? Yes, I can help you. Hi, this engineer here, what is your desire? What? A girlfriend? Sorry, I truly can't help with that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the first place, his strength originated from others, regardless of dream or reality. Ever since he had gotten lucky and accidentally fused with a certain god, his ability had combined with godly power. This had started him on a unique path in his pursuit of strength. He would most certainly become stronger.</p><br/><p>Under the dark night, this youth's face was filled with battle intent.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The sky seemed so hazy, and the rain seemed to have become even heavier. Countless people gazed at the sky. From this tempo, it seemed like the rain was nearing its end. All of them knew that when this rain ended, this world would have completely transformed. Without the godly power enveloping the entire world, all the awakened gods would start appearing and fighting for their respective believers. The world would descend into chaos. However, just as the rain became heavier and neared its end, a terrifying piece of heavyweight news surfaced, seemingly related to the Sin God.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

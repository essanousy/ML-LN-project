In the past, when we saw one of them, the only thing we were able to do was flee hastily to survive the encounter.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was utterly distressed. The primordial dragon was a unique race so powerful that they did not even fear the gods. A life-form like this\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Why has it appeared here, then?\" Chen Feng asked with a thoughtful look. If this dragon was truly so powerful, why would it listen to the Luck Goddess? There was only one possibility.</p><br/><p>\"Luck,\" Chen Feng and Zhou Ye said at the same time. That's right. In truth, the Luck Goddess wasn't particularly familiar with this dragon either. She had merely used her godly power of luck to create coincidences, enabling this dragon to appear right here and awaken right at this instant. That was all there was to it. This was something Chen Feng had often done. Unexpectedly, when the Luck Goddess was the one creating coincidences, something like this would appear\u2026</p><br/><p>\"So much more powerful than I was,\" Chen Feng said with a bitter smile. See, the Luck Goddess had no need to even try saving up her godly power. Regardless of how efficient or optimal Chen Feng had been with controlling his luck value in the past, regardless of his tricks or techniques, he could not compare to the Luck Goddess's straightforward brutish method using her high amount of godly power. See, just like that, she had caused a primordial dragon to appear here. However, if it was still due to luck\u2026</p><br/><p>\"The release of the godly power of luck should be a one-off thing. The goddess has already used her formidable godly power to enable this dragon to appear here. However, this is where her influence stops. If my guess is correct, the Luck Goddess will not micromanage her godly power to influence this primordial dragon\", Chen Feng analyzed.</p><br/><p>\"Why is that?\" Zhou Ye asked instinctively.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. Why else? Because our Lord Goddess simply does not know how to micromanage her godly power.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng could only answer, \"Perhaps because she is of the opinion that it is unnecessary to do so.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye smiled bitterly. \"True. The primordial dragons have rather bad tempers, especially when they are awakened during cultivation. Their temper when they wake up is excessively bad. I suppose we will all die here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>The primordial dragon glared at them.</p><br/><p>Their hearts chilled. \"It's over.\"</p><br/><p>\"Pr... primordial dragon\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I don't want to face something like this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah ah ah, run fast.\"</p><br/><p>Some started fleeing in panic. As the dragon saw this, it flickered, and in a logic-defying manner, it quickly moved toward that person before chomping down on that person. Mhm\u2026 Cracking sounds could be heard as the dragon chewed on that person.</p><br/><p>\"Hiss\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Everyone took in a deep breath in shock. Indeed, even a resonator could not even last a single instant within this dragon's mouth. The gods had awakened, and now these primordial creatures had awakened as well. The primordial would probably fully descend for real now.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Dragon\u2026 luck\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Godly power started seething around him. That was the activation of his misfortune power. With the 1,800 points of misfortune he had, if he used them all to create a pseudo-luck effect, how powerful would it be? He was quite curious.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance surged out.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's eyes widened. \"What are you doing? You are wasting your godly power.\"</p><br/><p>\"We will never know without trying,\" Chen Feng said lightly.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye smiled bitterly. \"You are better off using that godly power to flee.\" He had initially planned to flee together with Chen Feng. Although this dragon was powerful, if they all scattered and fled, they would still have a chance to survive. In the midst of escaping, Chen Feng's misfortune power would prove especially useful. This was what he had planned, yet unexpectedly, Chen Feng was actually wasting his misfortune power here, converting misfortune to luck, to contend against the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Good gracious. Had he forgotten how the Luck Goddess had suffered when she had converted her luck to misfortune against him? All the misfortune had been absorbed by Chen Feng! And yet now he was converting his misfortune into luck against the Luck Goddess\u2026 This truly caused Zhou Ye to be speechless.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng suddenly asked, \"Are you familiar with the concept of deflecting a heavier force with a lighter force?\" [1] 1 </p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was puzzled. \"No. What's that?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke calmly. \"It's a martial arts technique from my hometown. Through timely and precise manipulation of energy, one can deflect or redirect a heavier force using a lighter force. Well, in simpler terms, it is an art of leveraging.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was still as confused. \"Leveraging? What's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026You will know soon enough.\" Chen Feng took in a deep breath. He knew that the conversion of misfortune into luck would raise his exhaustion rate. He was also aware that this would not work well against the Luck Goddess. However, one advantage he held over her was that he was more skilled in the technical aspect of controlling luck. When the Luck Goddess manipulated luck, there was no skill involved. She brute-forced through everything.</p><br/><p>This was a chance for him, since, after exhausting a huge amount of godly power to get the dragon here, the Luck Goddess would no longer waste her luck power on this dragon. The reason for that was simple. If she continued using her luck to influence the dragon, the exhaustion rate would be too high, so high that the Luck Goddess could not afford it. As such, at such a time when the Luck Goddess wouldn't do anything, he could try converting his misfortune power into luck and see what he could accomplish with it.</p><br/><p>At a certain region in the west, a certain mountain range started collapsing. From within the mountain, a huge head stretched out slowly. The brownish color and the cracks on the head gave it a rather vicious appearance.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Slowly, the head raised. Next, a huge body slowly separated itself from the mountain.</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>A booming howl sounded. Behind this somewhat clumsy-looking body, a pair of wings unfurled. A terrifying aura surged, causing all the nearby life-forms to shiver in fear. The aura of a dragon! These life-forms had all sensed the existence of a legendary aura, the aura of a dragon!</p><br/><p>\"I am back.\"</p><br/><p>That head raised high up in the air, its eyes akin to lanterns.</p><br/><p>\"I am back! What\u2026 you all\u2026 owe me\u2026 hehe\u2026 Chen Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>A sonorous howl echoed everywhere.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He locked onto Chen Feng's aura before shooting forth. At this moment, Chen Feng's group's situation was getting more and more dangerous. Some of them were already fleeing, but doing this in front of the dragon seemingly ensured their own deaths. In a short half minute, around four resonators had been killed. Everyone's hearts chilled at this sight.</p><br/><p>\"So where is your heavier force?\" Zhou Ye asked with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"No idea.\" His misfortune power was already fully exhausted.</p><br/><p>His 1,800 points of misfortune power, after the conversion, were roughly equivalent to only 300 points of luck power. Mhm\u2026 Based on his estimation using the misfortune pen as the basis, 300 points of the godly power of luck were equivalent to 30,000 points of luck value. This amount was rather similar to what he'd had when he had summoned the apocalypse back then.</p><br/><p>Naturally, that time, what he had ultimately summoned had merely been the shadow of an apocalypse, rather than a true apocalypse that would destroy an entire planet. This time, though, his 30,000 points of luck value were all concentrated right here and, as such, should work better.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the sky turned dark.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, shit.\" Chen Feng raised his head. \"Not again\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The apocalypse he had summoned in the past had been rather outstanding, as it had helped him scare off everyone. However, he did not think a primordial dragon would fall for the same thing. However, right as Chen Feng thought that the apocalypse was going to appear, a booming howl resounded from the gloomy and dark sky.</p><br/><p>\"Chen\u2026 Feng\u2026 hand over your life!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The sky was ripped apart. A dragon as huge as a mountain appeared, radiating killing intent.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Chen Feng uniformly. Another one? Zhou Ye looked at Chen Feng, astonishment on his face. So this was the so-called defeating a heavier force with a lighter force? No, this was more like defeating his very self.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

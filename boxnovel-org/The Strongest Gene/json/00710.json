He was clear how mighty his divine hatchet was. To obliterate these awakened ones, he had already unleashed the greatest of his strength. Yet this guy... This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed toyingly. \"Isn't that a tad bit too weak?\"</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Slowly, his right hand pushed up. That immense hatched was actually heaved up by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, the direction of the ever-so-terrifying hatchet was forcefully changed, slashing toward a certain barren mountain range nearby.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The mountain collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like we can save on the expenditures of clearing up the mountain for development,\" Chen Feng said after glancing at the mountain.</p><br/><p>The bodies of Wealthy Zhao and the rest chilled.</p><br/><p>God damn it! They had only decided to come here after hearing that Chen Feng had been crippled. They had never imagined that this Chen Feng was actually so scary! This level of strength\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled toyingly. \"It is natural for me to be this strong. I am the seed of fortune. Since I am the one who awoke the Luck Goddess, how could she cripple me for real? That was merely a lie to misdirect you all.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Liang shook his head. \"No, that is not possible! It is indeed possible for you to lie, but she is a god! The will of a god can never allow deceit! How is it possible for that to be fake?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wealthy Zhao and the rest came to a realization. \"Are you tricking us again?\" At long last, after being tricked repeatedly by Chen Feng, they were finally enlightened somewhat.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou calmly analyzed the situation. \"Way too many people sensed the process of the Luck Goddess crippling you on that day\u2026 It is not possible for that to have been fake. The will of a god cannot allow deceit! Therefore, you were indeed been crippled and are merely using some other power to trick us.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at him in astonishment. Wow. Tsk tsk, after getting tricked repeatedly, it seems like their IQ has increased. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"Fine. Let me change my words, then. At first, I angered her and was crippled. Next, I managed to butter her up nicely, resulting in her reinstating my strength. Mhm\u2026 It is this simple.\"</p><br/><p>Thomas's group looked at him like they were looking at a retard.</p><br/><p>Are you taking us for fools?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"See, even if I tell you guys the truth, you won't believe it anyway. Come, let me show you all something fun. I personally greatly enjoy looking at the expression of despair on the faces of my opponents\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's hand started glowing. The scene of him instructing Spirit in the little black room was played.</p><br/><p>Thomas's group inhaled a mouthful of cold breath. \"Hiss\u2014\"</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"The Luck Goddess, that is indeed her!\"</p><br/><p>\"The aura of good can be felt from this recording. That is something that cannot be forged. But this scene\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"They actually\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wu Liang and the rest were totally stupefied.</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao looked at Chen Feng with an expression of disbelief. \"You actually\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Sigh, I had no choice. At that time, I was merely trying to seduce a god. Unexpectedly, the Luck Goddess has such a bad temper. With the slightest displeasure, she started releasing her anger.\" Chen Feng chuckled joyfully. \"Fortunately, I have already recovered now.\"</p><br/><p>At this Wu Liang and the rest felt their bodies going cold.</p><br/><p>Shit, this time, they were truly in a deep shit.</p><br/><p>\"Can you feel the desperation?\" Chen Feng flashed them a wide smile. \"I truly enjoy the expression of desperation and helpless in the faces of my enemies. For example, our dearest Thomas here\u2026 tsk tsk\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed.</p><br/><p>Thomas opened his mouth, but he had nothing to say. \"I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you want?\" Wealthy Zhao asked with a heavy tone. Since Chen Feng had bothered to show them this, it was evident that he had no intention of killing them.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng regarded them with a wide smile. \"If I wanted to kill you guys, I would have done so already. However, it is exactly as you guys said earlier. The present Genetic Union is still quite weak. Therefore, if you guys can\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Thomas's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Ridiculous.\" He sneered. \"I do not believe you. Even if you are so intimate with the Luck Goddess, I still do not trust you! You have tricked us way too many times! Screw the Luck Goddess, screw your recovered strength. I refuse to believe that I can't chop you to death!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, he attacked once again. Wu Liang and the rest watched on, not bothering to stop him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The dreadful hatchet slashed down.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"What is the point of this?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A gloomy radiance flashed and instantly transformed the enormous hatchet into a wisp of green smoke before vanishing into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Thomas's expression changed greatly. \"How is that possible?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"What is the point?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, that is not possible!\" Thomas could not believe it. \"How is it possible for my godly power of war to fail? I clearly\u2026 No, I refuse to believe this!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He attacked once again.</p><br/><p>Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Slash after slash, appearance after appearance, disappearance after disappearance. Not a single one of his attacks was able to land. Not a single one succeeded.</p><br/><p>Thomas's heart chilled. \"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>The major trump card he was so proud of had completely failed. Even if his hatchet had been blocked by Chen Feng, he wouldn't be in such panic. However, what was happening only pointed toward a certain possibility\u2026</p><br/><p>For a resonator to borrow the power of a god, one would need to resonate with the god. Therefore, the success rate of their abilities would never be 100%. There would always be a possibility of failure in resonance. And now\u2026 Could it be that the damnable power of luck\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Wu Liang and the rest exchanged glances, their hearts chilling.</p><br/><p>They were not afraid of how strong Chen Feng could be, since there were four of them with four different godly powers among them. Regardless of how powerful Chen Feng's combat power was, they would be able to beat him. But if what he used was\u2026</p><br/><p>The ashen-faced Wealthy Zhao asked, \"This ability you are using\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was all smiles as he said, \"This ability? I call it 'The Smile of the Luck Goddess'.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The hearts of Wu Liang and the rest sank into utmost desperation.</p><br/><p>Luck\u2026 indeed! It was no wonder that Thomas kept failing! If they were to give some proper thought to what Chen Feng had said, his relationship with the Luck Goddess\u2026 But then, since everyone had personally witnessed the Luck Goddess crippling him, what was happening presently was in fact\u2026 Suddenly, a realization dawned upon them. Damn, that damnable bitch! Yet again, they had been tricked by the Luck Goddess!</p><br/><p>Thomas gnashed his teeth. \"Since you have not lost your strength, why did you create this misunderstanding where everyone thinks that you are now crippled?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng maintained the wide smile on his face. \"If I hadn't, would you guys have come? After all, the Genetic Union is still way too weak. Therefore\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shit!</p><br/><p>Thomas and the rest cursed inwardly. This bastard! They had already been very careful of Chen Feng's trickeries. Unexpectedly, they had still been tricked by him! They were now extremely certain that this damnable Chen Feng was definitely on the side of the Luck Goddess, as both were similarly dastardly, similarly without any sense of shame! This was especially true for the Luck Goddess! Even if she wanted to increase the strength of her boy toy, she did not need to use such a scheme, right? This was too much bullying!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Perhaps, as Luo Yuan\u2019s father, he understood his son the most. There was a saying that one\u2019s first love would always be their most beautiful memory. However, when one caused one\u2019s first love to die, that was unforgettable. His son had always kept that event dearly in his heart.</p><br/><p>Resurrect a human? The gods exchanged glances when they heard this. For gods, resurrection was extremely normal. They were too powerful, to the point they couldn\u2019t be killed. At most, they would fall into a deep slumber and awaken\u2014one could say \u201cresurrect\u201d\u2014sometime in the future. As such, they were very familiar with resurrection.</p><br/><p>As for humans? Resurrection did not seem too possible. If the human had died recently, perhaps they might be able to save her or something. But a human that had died way back then, before the descent of the primordial, during the early Genetic Era? That\u2026 was too far in the past. That human had long since thoroughly died.</p><br/><p>Even with their mighty godly power, they would not be able to resurrect her. Oh, yeah, some people had time-traveling abilities. Perhaps if one traveled back to the past to rescue that young missy\u2026</p><br/><p>However, if that truly happened, how would the future, the present timeline, be affected? If that young missy had been rescued, the Luo Yuan from back then probably wouldn\u2019t have crippled himself. The Stormtech Company that he had subsequently created probably wouldn\u2019t have come into being. Would that Luo Yuan still have the undying will he had displayed?</p><br/><p>This was a question nobody could answer. What about Ye? Returning to the past, back before Ye\u2019s death\u2026</p><br/><p>At present, Ye was indeed thoroughly dead. However, if one dared to travel through time as one wished and Ye somehow discovered the truth\u2026 It was quite terrifying to think about what he would do. That fellow\u2019s strength\u2026 If they met once again, perhaps even Luo Yuan himself would not have complete confidence in surviving his onslaught. And if one was unlucky enough to directly encounter the Ye of the past, they would probably directly die. As such, did he truly intend to rescue that young missy from the past? Everyone looked at Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan shook his head calmly. \u201cNo. Why would there be a need to rescue her? She does not belong to this era. All paths to the past have been sealed by me. It is no longer possible. From today onward, in this world, transmigration and time travel are impossible,\u201d Luo Yuan coldly concluded, \u201cregardless of the past or the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d Luo Yuan\u2019s father asked in a daze. He was of the belief that he knew his son well. Over the years, Luo Yuan had constantly been woken up by nightmares. Hadn\u2019t each of his nightmares been about that young missy?</p><br/><p>Had he not always wanted to return to that era, to once again return to the side of that young missy and make a different choice? Why\u2026 would he lock down all paths of time travel?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour insight is too narrow,\u201d Luo Yuan said calmly. How could these idiots ever hope to understand his plan? He, Luo Yuan, had fought his entire life. Could it be merely to relive history? To return to that era he both loved and hated? How ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Luo Yuan,\u201d he muttered.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He stood up, surrounded by boundless power. He stared into the distance. There, a certain god was standing and observing the happenings here. Yes, he was standing there rather than kneeling. This was one of the gods that had avoided his control by severing his own limb. However, he hadn\u2019t left. Rather, he had stayed behind hoping to know the truth. Only when Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze landed on him did his entire body turn cold.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan smiled. \u201cYou should have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>That god\u2019s face fell. He immediately turned around to flee. Alas, it was too late.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan flickered and reappeared behind that god. Next, blood splattered everywhere. That god couldn\u2019t even react before he died. Everyone went cold as they saw this scene. So was this Luo Yuan\u2019s true strength?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>After killing the god, Luo Yuan formally ascended to godhood. And thus, his already powerful strength went through another transformation.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan spoke softly. \u201cSubmit to me. You all, are after, my people.\u201d His faint voice was transmitted worldwide through the wristband communicators. Nearly every life-form heard his words.</p><br/><p>Plop.</p><br/><p>More people knelt down on the ground, including Luo Yuan\u2019s father. That voice seemed to be filled with a certain sense of majesty, a certain sense of awe that left nobody daring enough to not submit. At the instant those people knelt down, a boundless power of faith surged out. Instantly, the numerous life-forms of the world became the believers of Luo Yuan and Luo Yuan alone.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Boundless faith surged out. Under the control of the wristbands, these people did not have a choice.</p><br/><p>Even the believers of the other gods switched their belief. However, those gods could only smile bitterly. They couldn\u2019t say anything, as even they themselves had submitted to Luo Yuan. At this instant, numerous life-forms submitted to Luo Yuan. His majesty stretched out, enveloping the entire world. This newly awakened world had instantly entered the era of Luo Yuan after experiencing the eras of Ye and Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Now, this was Luo Yuan\u2019s world, Luo Yuan\u2019s era.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>He enjoyed the surging faith. The god had he killed earlier had just been a minor god. However, in a short period of time, he reached the elementary stage, then the journeyman stage, and he was still growing. After all, the amount of faith he was gathering now was terrifying. He was gathering even more faith than Chen Feng had back then.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s father sighed. \u201cI should have listened to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Some members of the senior generation shook their heads. \u201cWe made the wrong choice back then\u2026 and now we are again making the wrong choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we even have a choice now?\u201d a particularly powerful old man said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>A sigh resounded. \u201cWell, we can only atone for our crimes now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Astonishing everyone, the few people that had been conversing suddenly exploded, their blood splattering everywhere.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes widened. This\u2026 Luo Yuan was killing again! This was too excessive! Even scarier was the fact that even his father was among those killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some were furious. They had compromised, so why was Luo Yuan still killing? Could it be that he wouldn\u2019t let even those who had submitted to him off? If so, what was the point of submitting? And yet when they looked over at Luo Yuan, they saw that Luo Yuan was dumbstruck as well. He was drenched wet with blood, yet he stood there unmoving.</p><br/><p>He stared at the dead in a daze and suddenly lashed out in anger. \u201cI already have control of you all, yet you are still capable of suicide? Who gave you guys the courage to commit suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>He dared not believe this. Under the control of the wristbands, they shouldn\u2019t even be able to control their own bodies. How did they commit suicide? This should only be possible if they had prepared well in advance. They had long guessed that this would happen. And thus, something had been done in their bodies. They had been waiting for this single opportunity to die.</p><br/><p>However, how was that supposed to be possible? He had never allowed his plan to be leaked\u2026</p><br/><p>Hold on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan realized something. He looked at the various gods, the various races, and finally the humans before asking, \u201cHas anyone seen Chen Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>No response came. Not only Chen Feng, even Chen Feng\u2019s companions had all suddenly gone missing as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This slab looked completely ordinary. It was the words on the slab that were unsettling. These words seemed to have gone through countless ages, yet they were still as clear as ever.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 20 after the fall of the primordial, a hazy day.</p><br/><p>Where is the Sin God slumbering? Where are the other gods slumbering? Why has no one discovered the existence of the Sin God? This is unbelievable.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Some gods were horrified at this news.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn't the Sin God dead? How is it possible for him to be slumbering?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is fake news, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where was this slab found?\"</p><br/><p>\"From a mountain near where I awakened. I sensed the ancientness within and took the slab out to get a clearer look. Surprisingly, this is what I uncovered\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Is it possible that this is fake?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not possible. I have already inspected it. This thing has indeed survived since the fall of the primordial. Moreover, such slabs only existed during the Primordial Era.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026In short, what is written here is true?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\"</p><br/><p>The anxious gods flipped the slab around, trying to look for some clues. The contents were truly too astonishing. If the Sin God was truly still alive, as far as all the other gods were concerned, this was no different than a nightmare.</p><br/><p>Back then, the Sin God had attempted to conquer the entire world. In the end, he had been killed by the Creation God. Subsequently, the Creation God had been extremely dissatisfied with the fact that the world he had created had fallen under influence of other gods and had ultimately fused with the world itself.</p><br/><p>He had erased all traces of his existence and become one with the world. From that moment onward, this world had started operating by itself, thoroughly upgraded. During that war, both the Sin God and the Creation God had vanished. As for the other gods, they had gained true freedom and had started going independent, each proclaiming ownership over their respective domains. This was also what had caused the subsequent age of chaos.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the Sin God was actually still alive. This god had been capable of contending against the Creation God. It did not matter if he had only been able to do it through exploiting this world, nor did it matter that he had ultimately suffered defeat. The fact still stood that he had been capable of contending against everyone.</p><br/><p>\"This world has already been perfected by the Creation God. As such, the Sin God will not be able to exploit this world.\"</p><br/><p>\"But his strength\u2026\"</p><br/><p>All the gods sank into silence. The Sin God was truly way too powerful.</p><br/><p>Even back then, he had only been defeated after all the gods had worked together, with even the Creation God getting involved. If he was to return once again and he sought revenge, who could stop him?</p><br/><p>\"I do not trust this slab.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here.\"</p><br/><p>A lot of people refused to believe the contents of the slab. After all, apart from gods, all other existences were nothing but bugs. And with the trifling strength of those bugs, how could they have uncovered true clues leading to the Sin God? This was probably the creative imagination of some bug.</p><br/><p>\"That is quite possible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget about this for now, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, this still pertains to the Sin God\u2026 We should at least investigate it, right?\"</p><br/><p>Some gods exchanged glances. Everyone studied this slab without stop, and finally, someone discovered a vague symbol in the corner of the slab. This symbol was, in fact, part of an ancient numbering system used during the Primordial Era.</p><br/><p>\"It is numbered\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"There are more of these?\"</p><br/><p>\"Try searching.\"</p><br/><p>\"Try asking other gods as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>They started contacting other gods to ask about the slab. However, this questioning session caused all the gods to be thoroughly horrified. They found that, in fact, quite a number of gods had such slabs. The reason was that these slabs were truly too conspicuous. With the faint godly power pulsing off them, these slabs were easily discoverable by the gods. They also found that each of these slabs was labeled with a number. When all the slabs were gathered, a terrifying content was revealed.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Late night, hazy day.</p><br/><p>Today marks the first year of the fall of the primordial. Since the fall of the gods, this land has been much more peaceful. However, I discovered the true secret of the gods. They have yet to die for real\u2026 Rather, they all seem to be slumbering somewhere, awaiting the day of their awakening.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year six after the fall of the primordial, clear weather.</p><br/><p>I discovered an astonishing secret pertaining to the legendary Sin God. This powerful existence that once fought all the gods seems to have remained alive as well. Despite his grave injuries, he is alive and is slumbering somewhere, seemingly waiting for something.</p><br/><p>This is undoubtedly scary. Why is he still alive? Why did he stay behind? No answer\u2026 After searching through all the primordial vestiges, I still can't find the answer\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps some gods assisted him back then?</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 10 after the fall of the primordial, heavy downpour.</p><br/><p>The discovery of the Sin God is incredibly worrying.</p><br/><p>After several years of research, I failed to discover many clues. However, I am certain that he is indeed still alive. O heavens, what did the primordial gods do?</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 20 after the fall of the primordial, hazy day.</p><br/><p>Where is the Sin God slumbering? Where are the other gods slumbering? Why has no one discovered the existence of the Sin God? This is unbelievable.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 30 after the fall of the primordial, sunny weather.</p><br/><p>I found it! I have finally found the secret of the Sin God! Haha. He is indeed different than the other gods. He hid his godly power and inheritance on an alien world. It is no wonder that the other gods did not discover him.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 40 after the fall of the primordial, blood moon.</p><br/><p>So this is the secret of the Sin God? His godly power and inheritance were left on an alien world. On top of that, a spatial whirlpool was constructed there to attract people without stop. These people will be converted into his believers, replenishing his strength without stop.</p><br/><p>Hahaha.</p><br/><p>With this, how can the other primordial gods discover him? The moment the Sin God returns will also be the moment all the gods tremble and face destruction. This time, there will be no Creation God to help them. As such, no one can stop the Sin God.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 50 after the fall of the primordial, windy day.</p><br/><p>Throughout the years, I have searched every corner of the world. Unfortunately, with my strength, I was not able to discover it\u2026 My body is getting weak\u2026 If later generations find it, please do tell me of a way to go meet those fellows\u2026 I believe\u2026 the primordial gods will awaken first\u2026 With this\u2026 they can at least go and destroy the Sin God before he awakens.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 60 after the fall of the primordial, heavy snowfall.</p><br/><p>I am actually still alive. Heh. I have yet to discover any clues about the alien world\u2026 By myself, my strength is limited. I intend to establish a sect focusing on searching for things pertaining to this. I wonder if they can survive on\u2026</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 66 after the fall of the primordial, dark.</p><br/><p>Heh, I'm afraid I truly can't hold on any longer. This will probably be my final message. These slabs will all be hidden amid the mountains in hopes of preserving them as best as possible. I wonder if the gods will see these in the future\u2026 If you gods truly see these... please do go look for the Sin God. Naturally, all my findings will only be proven true if an alien world indeed exists. If there is no such alien world, there is no need to worry.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Year 103 after the fall of the primordial, hail.</p><br/><p>I am the third sect master of the Divine Sect. Based on the sect ancestor's request, I am leaving a message here. We have finally found clues about the alien world. As for their method of passage, it remains unknown.</p><br/><p>The only thing we know is that they are all believers of the Sin God. They are exhausting all means available to them to aid the Sin God's recovery. This is without a doubt extremely terrifying. As such, we will try our best to foil their plan.</p><br/><p>Who are they? Where do they originate from? We don't know. Our only clues are that they all have two horns on their head and that they call themselves the twin-horns race.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/>\n</div>"}

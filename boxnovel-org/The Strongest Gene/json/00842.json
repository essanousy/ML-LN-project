Chen Feng felt helpless. Everything had progressed as he\u2019d planned. Even if Luo Yuan sent another clone here, they could just imprison that clone as well, all with the actual Luo Yuan completely clueless about what was happening here.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had encountered another problem instead. This world was too small. After all, the world Wang Chun had selected back then was the world of The Crystal Palace. Here, the strongest existences were merely Ming Yue and Shen Wang. Just the fight between Chen Feng and Luo Yuan had been pushing this world to the brink of destruction. If he chose to become a true god here, this world would likely be reduced to nothingness.</p><br/><p>At this time, Luo Yuan, who was trapped in the cage, horrified, finally understood what was going on. Instantly, he howled with laughter. \u201cHahaha, this is too funny. So it turns out that this world is completely incapable of enduring your breakthrough. If you have the guts, why don\u2019t you return to the outside world? Do you want me to think of an idea for you? Hahaha. You don\u2019t even need to leave this world. You only need to join this world with the outside world, like what happened with the Twin Horns World back then. With that, you will be able to break through, as the pressure will be shared across this world and the outside world. After you finish your breakthrough, you can once again sever the connection between the two worlds. What do you think of my plan?\u201d Luo Yuan asked while laughing heartily.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely sneered. \u201cHehe.\u201d Indeed, this plan sounded wonderful. However, the moment he did that, this clone would be able to reestablish a connection with his real body. Instantly, the real Luo Yuan would figure out everything that had happened here. He would surely come here immediately to destroy Chen Feng and everyone in this world.</p><br/><p>At that time, Chen Feng would probably die before he could even break through. This was the scariest thing. What had Chen Feng relied upon against Luo Yuan all these years? He had relied on the unknown, his faked death, and spreading fake news to Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was simply unaware that Chen Feng was still alive. That was why he had been falling into Chen Feng\u2019s traps without stop. However, the moment he discovered the truth, Chen Feng would not be able to survive his onslaught. Over these 30 years, Chen Feng had not been the only one to grow stronger; Luo Yuan had grown as well. As such, Chen Feng had to be careful.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng fixed his gaze on the clone before him.</p><br/><p>The solution provided by this clone was in fact quite good. Although it had the risk of revealing this world to Luo Yuan, so long as they controlled the connection properly, they might be able to stay concealed. He could continue hiding within this world while allowing the outside world to endure the pressure of his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>With that, the only thing Luo Yuan could know was the fact that someone had broken through into the true-god stage. That was all he would know. Naturally, this plan couldn\u2019t succeed unless they first ensured Luo Yuan could not reestablish his connection with this clone.</p><br/><p>At present, this clone was locked into this world and was incapable of linking his consciousness with the real Luo Yuan. However, the moment a connection was established between the two worlds, everything here would be transmitted straight to the real Luo Yuan. This was something they had to deal with. Chen Feng sank into a deep contemplation, his gaze resting on the clone before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on the clone\u2019s face froze. This bastard Chen Feng had been staring at him for more than 10 minutes now. This caused a sinister feeling to rise within his heart. It couldn\u2019t be that, after figuring out that the clone couldn\u2019t be killed, Chen Feng was thinking of doing something else to him, right? Holy sh*t. Luo Yuan had always been straight!</p><br/><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Chen Feng answered his doubts. \u201cI have no interest in you. However, the plan you proposed earlier is indeed quite interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Luo Yuan laughed dryly. \u201cInteresting?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had merely been intending to shame Chen Feng by proposing an impossible plan. If Chen Feng actually tried to do what he had said, Chen Feng would die very shortly afterward. He had not believed that Chen Feng would be this stupid.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded seriously. \u201cMhm. Although I can\u2019t do what you said, the general angle of your solution is correct. I only need to somewhat alter it and I will be able to proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was curious. \u201cWhich part will you alter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at him emotionlessly. \u201cI shall first kill you before attempting to break through. So long as you are dead, you will not be able to establish a link with him. Next, I can do what you suggested earlier. There will be no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me?\u201d Luo Yuan was first stunned, and then he howled with laughter. \u201cHahahaha! Kill me? Hahahaha. Chen Feng, you are getting funnier. Oh my gosh, this is too funny. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>He truly found this funny. Kill him? If Chen Feng could truly kill him, would Chen Feng have wasted so much time talking to him here? In the first place, the very reason Chen Feng was trying to break through was to kill him.</p><br/><p>Even though this was a mere clone, Chen Feng was still incapable of killing him. Only after becoming a true god would Chen Feng be equipped with the capability to truly kill him. In other words, to kill him, Chen Feng had to first become a true god. However, to become a true god, Chen Feng needed to first kill him.</p><br/><p>Hahahaha. This was simply a dead end, was it not? An unsolvable puzzle. Chen Feng had told him this so seriously, yet Luo Yuan found this utterly funny. So that intelligent trickster Chen Feng had become so stupid now?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan looked at Chen Feng in disdain. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s this clone or my real body, you can\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \u201cNo. I indeed said that you need to be killed. However, I never said that I will be the one doing the killing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was doubtful. Who would be the one to kill him then? Ming Yue? Shen Wang? Chen Feng was already the strongest person here. Who could replace him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still someone else capable of killing you,\u201d Chen Feng said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan narrowed his gaze. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \u201cYou. To be precise, the real Luo Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes went wide. What exactly\u2026 was this fellow talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will know soon,\u201d Chen Feng muttered. Suddenly, he called Wang Chun over. \u201cWatch this fellow properly. I need to take a trip back to the outside world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside world? The caged Luo Yuan\u2019s heart throbbed as he heard this. Chen Feng was thinking of leaving? Hehe. So he was trying to seek an alternative in the outside world? Interesting. This was indeed a good idea. However, this world was presently locked down. If Chen Feng wanted to leave, they had to first establish a connection, right? That would be his chance!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan became excited as he thought about this. So these fellows thought that locking him in here would be sufficient? Hehe. They had no way of knowing that some abilities could not be blocked. As a clone, the connection between him and the real Luo Yuan was extremely strong.</p><br/><p>Only a tiny crack was required for a connection to be established between the clone and the real body. At that time, wouldn\u2019t things become interesting? Hehe. Luo Yuan was secretly delighted. Naturally, he still maintained his blank, expressionless face with as he stayed obediently in the cage.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wang Chun glanced over at Luo Yuan, seemingly not worried at all. The clone was locked in a cage like a dog and had zero destructive capabilities. In any case, even if he could escape the cage, he would not be a match for Ming Yue and Shen Wang. After all, this was their world.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this clone had indeed eliminated the other world of The Crystal Palace. However, the Ming Yue and Shen Wang of that world had definitely still been hostile to each other and had fought independently. Here, though, they were a couple. From the result of the short clash they\u2019d had earlier, Luo Yuan was simply not a match for the two of them. Therefore, Wang Chun had no worries about this world. He was only worried about Chen Feng.</p></div>\n</div>"}

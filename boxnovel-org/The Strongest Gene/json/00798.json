A problem had occurred with the plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d In front of him was a youth with a similarly distressed expression. This was precisely his disciple from a long time ago, Wu Hui. With the descent of calamity and the arrival of the era of gods, apart from Chen Feng\u2019s group of three, there were a few other unique existences that had also relied on their unique fortuitous encounters to free themselves of this crisis. It was obvious that Wu Hui was one of these unique individuals.</p><br/><p>He was now an apostle. He was also the guy who had planned the ambush on the fast guy with the various words carved out of mountains back then. After that incident, Chen Feng had resumed contact with him. This time, they were planning to eliminate the Sin God.</p><br/><p>Mhm, their plan was supposed to be very simple. They would first force Ye to fight the various major gods to exhaust his strength. The second step would be to force the exhausted Ye to fight the shadow\u2019s numerous clones, exhausting his trump cards. With that, when Chen Feng\u2019s group emerged in the end, they would be able to defeat Ye.</p><br/><p>This was quite a simple plan. After all, the so-called shadow and the various figures were creations of Wu Hui\u2019s ability that had combined with the godly power Wu Hui had obtained when he became an apostle. What he had unleashed was precisely Ye\u2019s imagination. Moreover, these figures had been created with Wu Hui\u2019s comparatively weak godly power. As such, the shadows were in fact quite weak.</p><br/><p>This was not a trick they could repeat, as Ye was not a fool that would endlessly fall to their tricks. As such, their plan had been to use these shadows to trick Ye once. Everything had progressed smoothly, successfully exhausting one of Ye\u2019s trump card with the \u201cclone\u201d before exhausting another of his trump cards with the \u201creal body.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was supposed to be the time for Chen Feng to step out and end this. However, surprising them, before they could do anything, an unforeseen circumstance had arisen.</p><br/><p>Just as Wu Hui was about to stop using his ability, his ability produced another figure. Chen Feng was stupefied at this sight. Wu Hui was the same. There were more?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s confidence vanished. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Holy shit, it couldn\u2019t be that their lie had transformed into reality, right? After all, the previous time he had lied to the gods, his lie had transformed into reality with the appearance of Sin God. And now, the so-called dark shadow and bright silhouette\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be, right?\u201d Chen Feng\u2019s hands shivered. If this truly became reality, it would truly be over for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not quite.\u201d Wu Hui laughed bitterly, \u201cIt\u2019s my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d <em>So it turns out that the figure was created by Wu Hui. That\u2019s fine, then. Hold on. </em>Chen Feng seemed to have realized something.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stop?\u201d Chen Feng was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I was about to stop, but this image appeared in Ye\u2019s mind, creating this figure before I could stop.\u201d Wu Hui\u2019s head ached.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying\u2026 this figure is the product of Ye\u2019s imagination?\u201d Chen Feng was astonished. He had initially thought that Ye would see through the lie after witnessing the \u201cclone\u201d and \u201creal body.\u201d Unexpectedly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShould I turn this figure off?\u201d Wu Hui asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Feng waved his hand. \u201cI am quite curious; what else his mind can create?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished his words, several shiny figures appeared. Chen Feng and Wu Hui witnessed the birth of this group of rainbow figures with their very own eyes. Or perhaps one could say that this was a group of RGB figures.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Hui: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What else could they say in response to this? Ye was worthy of his identity as a god, possessing such a rich imagination? Even the figures he imagined were so brilliant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe limit of my creativity is creating a dark shadow-like figure. Look at Ye\u2019s imagination\u2026\u201d Chen Feng lamented endlessly.</p><br/><p>Wu Hui: \u201c\u2026What should we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was somewhat anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait and see.\u201d Chen Feng focused his gaze ahead. At present, he too was clueless about what Ye was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the same time, when the figures appeared before Ye, he finally started going crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I knew it. It\u2019s impossible for you to be so weak! Since that bastard Creation God left behind some trump cards to deal with me, how can the trump cards be so weak? That bright silhouette was so strong. How is it possible that the shadow is weak? Hahaha, so turns out this is your actual trump card?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye was furious. He felt like the shadow was playing around with him. Real body? Indeed, all of these were real bodies. However, one could also have various real bodies. Clones were something one could create or destroy at any time. As for real bodies, they would exist forever. However, what if someone had numerous real bodies? Since this fellow had decided to face him, it was inevitable that he himself would also suffer damage from this encounter.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was prepared to sacrifice several clones, while this shadow was precisely a person whose ability was the creation of numerous clones that were also real bodies at the same time. So it turned out that this was the case. Ye finally understood clearly. If this shadow looked for him alone, there was a possibility of him dying. That was because, despite his numerous clones, his strength was rather unremarkable. He was not at all match for Ye. Therefore, he first had the bright silhouette exhaust Ye\u2019s strength, then sent the dark shadow over\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye finally understood everything. The plan was to send figure after figure at him to exhaust him.</p><br/><p><em>What a fine scheme, shadow. Unfortunately, since this plan has already been seen through by me, sorry, I will not give you the chance to defeat me.</em></p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye inhaled deeply as he decided to no longer retain any power, as it would be completely meaningless. If he continued retaining his strength, he would probably be exhausted to death by this damnable shadow\u2019s inexhaustible clones. Therefore, he might as well thoroughly eliminate this shadow.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A tremendous power started emerging from the deepest part of Ye\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance started converging around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d he howled.</p><br/><p>A wondrous-looking string of light appeared in his hands. This was the Karma String, a weapon capable of linking all the figures together and dragging them out. That\u2019s right, Ye was planning to use brute force to drag the enemy out. This was his final trump card, a power he had never dared use before.</p><br/><p>One\u2026</p><br/><p>Two\u2026</p><br/><p>Three\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ultimately, more than 200 figures were dragged out, each a different color. Around them, the various observing gods were already thoroughly stupefied. These figures\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye laughed. \u201cVery good. You guys have finally revealed yourselves. To be capable of forcing me to this extent, you are quite a terrific person. Remember that even that silhouette only managed to injure me, and the injuries were merely flesh wounds. Yet you\u2026. hehe,\u201d Ye muttered. \u201cWorthy of being the something the Creation God created. Unfortunately, this is the end for you. It is time to show you guys exactly why I was able to rebel against the Creation God back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power erupted and engulfed the entire area. The figures that were linked by the Karma String started shaking.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Next, something terrifying happened. Instantly, all the figures linked together transformed into ash and dust and waffled through the air, presenting quite a horrifying sight.</p><br/><p>Ye sighed. \u201cLet this end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Karma\u2026 Before the eyes of so many gods, the 200-plus figures turned into ash. Was this\u2026 finally over? Ye stood up and turned around in preparation to leave. Right at this instant, an astonishing radiance flashed. Ye turned around abruptly, and before he could even do anything, an immense force could be felt piercing through his chest.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Instantly, that massive force penetrated his chest and destroyed his entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s eyes went wide, unbelieving. Before his eyes was a person he was incredibly familiar with: Chen Feng.</p></div>\n</div>"}

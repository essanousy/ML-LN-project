Chen Feng was alarmed. This thing couldn\u2019t have been created by Xiao Ying, right? Xiao Ying couldn\u2019t have laid eggs in his consciousness, right? As Chen Feng thought of this, his line of thought seemed to immediately clear up. Even more terrifying was the fact that when this idea surfaced, he couldn\u2019t get rid of it.</p><br/><p>Answered! Everything had been answered! Since the fake nascent soul had appeared, Xiao Ying had constantly been in a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s thoughts cleared up. Could it be\u2026 This was truly\u2026 He felt a sense of discomfort as he thought of this.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Spirit\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cWow! So the fake nascent soul is your and Xiao Ying\u2019s child? He actually used your consciousness to give birth to a child. Awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Goddess was similarly awed. She always maintained a steady disposition, but now her eyes were glowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeculation! This is merely speculation!\u201d Chen Feng wiped his sweat. This was even more terrifying than facing Luo Yuan himself. Although various intelligent life-forms of various shapes and marriage between races were normal in this era, Xiao Ying was, after all, his bro! He saw Xiao Ying as a bro, yet Xiao Ying had gone and made a baby for the both of them? How excessive!</p><br/><p>Moreover, this wasn\u2019t an ability Xiao Ying was supposed to have. Something was wrong somewhere. Chen Feng took in a deep breath. He glanced over at Xiao Ying. Since a random day, this fellow seemed to have been deep sleep all the time. Occasionally, he would wake up. However, he would always return to sleep shortly, forever sleepy. Chen Feng knew that Xiao Ying was in fact a snake. However, Xiao Ying had nevertheless still evolved numerous times. Why was he in constant hibernation? Something was definitely wrong.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took in a deep breath, then forcefully woke Xiao Ying up. \u201cXiao Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ying awoke in a daze. Ah?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your present strength?\u201d Chen Feng asked. He had always known that Xiao Ying was growing in strength. There was no helping that. Xiao Ying was capable of absorbing even godly power and had long been no weaker than Chen Feng. If Xiao Ying hadn\u2019t been deep asleep all the time, Chen Feng would have dragged him out to help out with things long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu.\u201d Xiao Ying transmitted a series of thought to Chen Feng. \u201cNot sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>A clear thought was transmitted to Chen Feng. Xiao Ying\u2019s life was a simple one. Eat and sleep. That was all there was to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring this period of time, did you\u2026\u201d Chen Feng carefully probed, but he had no idea how he should pose his question. Holy sh*t. How was one supposed to even ask this question? <em>Have you given a birth to a baby recently? As my bro, how can you take advantage of me?</em></p><br/><p>How was he supposed to ask this question? This was way too awkward. Furthermore, Xiao Ying was a snake!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Ying, can you shift your form?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side, Spirit and the Misfortune Goddess were brimming with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop communicating with thought transmissions. Although it is the easiest method since this is the sea of consciousness\u2026\u201d Spirit shifted her wide eyes around and continued, \u201cSince you are already a god, can you talk now? Can you shift your form? You should be capable of both, right? Why not demonstrate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Goddess was also filled with expectation. This had so much potential for drama! If Xiao Ying\u2019s shifted form was a handsome and smart youngster, this drama would be even more interesting than that TV series they had watched not long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two\u2026\u201d Chen Feng gazed at the sky helplessly. So it turned out that even gods could be yaoi lovers?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ying transmitted a question mark to Chen Feng. After all, this was the easiest method to communicate in the sea of consciousness. Xiao Ying was inquiring if he should shift as requested.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \u201cDo it.\u201d He also wanted to see Xiao Ying\u2019s current level. After all, this was his bro, someone who had followed him from the very beginning. He could still remember the early days when Xiao Ying had still been hiding within his sea of consciousness and secretly eating spiritual energy just to grow. Unexpectedly, after so many years, he had reached such a level.</p><br/><p>Godhood\u2026 Perhaps.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swirled around. Xiao Ying began to transform within Chen Feng\u2019s consciousness. Spirit and the Misfortune Goddess watched on with expectation. Even Chen Feng was feeling somewhat expectant. This feeling\u2026 was not unlike the feeling of a father hoping that his son could soar like a dragon. Xiao Ying had finally grown up.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The swirling radiance converged, ending the transformation.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Spirit and Misfortune Goddess were dumbfounded as well.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 was completely different from their expectations!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Spirit\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at Xiao Ying, not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>They had imagined countless time what Xiao Ying\u2019s humanoid form would look like. However, this appearance, this form, was not one they had ever expected, not even in their wildest dreams. Xiao Ying had a height of 140 centimeters. That\u2019s right. Xiao Ying\u2019s was extremely short. Chen Feng had once imagined that this fellow would assume a form with a humanoid head and the body of a snake. After all, Xiao Ying was an illusory snake, right? And thus, he had prepared himself to welcome whatever form Xiao Ying assumed.</p><br/><p>Alas, this form he was staring at\u2026 Mhm\u2026 Xiao Ying wasn\u2019t just short. On Xiao Ying\u2019s forehead were two furry protrusions, resembling dragon horns as depicted in the legends. This was an evolution. The Xiao Ying from back then had evolved countless times and had absorbed a great amount of godly power. Finally, Xiao Ying had evolved to the strongest form, a draconic form!</p><br/><p>Compared to Chen Feng, Xiao Ying had the strongest bloodline in the truest sense. Naturally, Xiao Ying being a dragon now wasn\u2019t the main source of their shock. After all, although draconic evolution might seem weird, this was nevertheless an era of gods. Gods were everywhere; no specific race would be the subject of prejudice.</p><br/><p>The biggest source of their stupefaction was the fact that this shorty here had quite a stunning and incredibly beautiful appearance. Naturally, this wasn\u2019t the most surprising thing. After all, pretty boys were quite popular and trendy nowadays. However, what was truly shocking was what came when their gazes traveled downward\u2026 <em>What\u2019s the deal with those two clumps on Xiao Ying\u2019s chest?</em></p><br/><p>As Chen Feng\u2019s gaze reached this part, his gaze instinctively moved upward to note that\u2026 there was no Adam\u2019s apple there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, this might be a unique characteristic of his race,\u201d he comforted himself. After all, there were many races in this era. As the prince of snakes and having evolved into a dragon, it was nothing weird for Xiao Ying to have a somewhat larger chest. Next, Chen Feng\u2019s gaze continued downward.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>He sank into a long silence over what he saw. He heaved an extremely long sigh and sorrowfully said, \u201cWe promised each other to be bros for life. So where has that thing on your lower body gone to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Spirit glared at him ferociously. \u201cPiss off!\u201d Next, both she and the Misfortune Goddess helped Xiao Ying put on some clothes. That\u2019s right. Xiao Ying was a female as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Xiao Ying was puzzled. Evidently, she was clueless about what was going on.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng maintained his silence. He recalled his feeling of wishing for his son to sour like a dragon earlier before looking at the clothed Xiao Ying before him that was stunningly beautiful. Finally, his gaze landed on the distant fake nascent soul. A thought suddenly surfaced: perhaps there would be a sequel to the Oni Chichi series [1] <sup>1</sup> soon?</p></div>\n</div>"}

So poor was Chen Feng's talent that he couldn't force Chen Feng into the apostle realm even if he wanted to. Was Chen Feng a completely talentless person? That did not seem likely, as he had successfully become a resonator.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was clear that rather than being completely talentless, he simply had extremely poor talent. After all, he had required quite the effort on the god's part even when entering the resonance realm. With the higher difficulty posed by the apostle realm\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Failed?\" The huge monkey blanked. \"This thing can actually fail?\"</p><br/><p>Evidently, none of them had ever heard that the establishment of a contract of gods could actually fail. Theoretically, wasn't a god an almighty and omnipotent figure as far as a mortal was concerned?</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" As the god heard this, his face darkened. What could he say? Even as a god, this was the first time he had encountered something like this. Since he had encountered Chen Feng, he had felt like he was encountering one defeat after another. In order to prove that he was still a god, he decided to give it one more try even though he had exhausted a large amount of godly power in the previous attempt. Naturally, the target for this second attempt would not be Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he pointed at the huge monkey. \"Come.\" Although this huge monkey was much weaker than Chen Feng, he had still nevertheless reached the lowest requirements for becoming an apostle. As such\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He pointed at the huge monkey.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>His godly power surged out, and the apostle's contract appeared. Since this huge monkey was comparatively weaker, this process did not immediately succeed. However, as the godly power surged, a golden radiance appeared around the huge monkey's body, slowly converging within him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a loud boom, a shocking symbol flickered on the huge monkey's forehead. Apostle's contract: success.</p><br/><p>The huge monkey howled, \"Ao\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>He started smacking himself in excitement. As he sensed the formidable prowess he now possessed, he was so excited that he couldn't control himself and started yelling. Success! All the other herculean apes were endlessly excited as well. The god heaved a sigh of relief. Although the godly power he had exhausted was rather high, he had still succeeded.</p><br/><p>His repeated failures with Chen Feng had truthfully caused him to lose no small amount of confidence in himself. He had even believed that he was no longer capable of promoting someone to the apostle realm. Now that he looked at it, the problem was not in him; it was this Chen Feng fellow\u2026 And thus, as the god reached a new conclusion, he grudgingly looked at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\" Bro, can you not look at me like I am some impotent person?</p><br/><p>The god patted the huge monkey's shoulder. \"Henceforth, you are my apostle.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" The huge monkey was excited. He could feel a close connection between him and godly power. The moment he had become an apostle, his relationship with the god had started to feel much more intimate than it had in the past. As such, he was naturally happy with this development.</p><br/><p>\"As for you\u2026\" The god looked at Chen Feng with a distressed expression. \"Your talent when it comes to godly power is truly very poor. We can only take it slow.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng failed to become an apostle?\" The huge monkey finally realized what had happened, and he was suddenly excited. \"Can I challenge him, then?\"</p><br/><p>Among the herculean apes, strength was everything. As such, challenges were quite normal among them. Although they all respected Chen Feng greatly, they frequently had the desire to challenge him. This was especially true for the huge monkey, who had suffered numerous defeats at Chen Feng's hands. This time, with his successful promotion and Chen Feng's failure, his instinctive reaction was to challenge Chen Feng. However, the moment his words left his mouth, the god dragged him away. What kind of joke was that? Had he not seen the wooden apostle earlier? Had that apostle not vanished upon fighting Chen Feng?</p><br/><p>After giving it some thought, the god was still unwilling to give up on Chen Feng and, in a serious tone, said, \"I will think of a way to solve your issue.\"</p><br/><p>After all, the strength Chen Feng had demonstrated was truly too astonishing.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng could only smile bitterly. \"All right.\" Alas, this wasn't an issue that could be solved easily. His fake nascent soul, which had been absorbing all the godly power\u2026 He probably had to look for the reason behind this before he could solve it. However, right at this moment, Chen Feng's acute senses were able to detect a fluctuation.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The fluctuation noiselessly arrived.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng was alarmed. \"Who is it?\"</p><br/><p>It was the very first time he had sensed a fluctuation so clearly. The bizarre fluctuation flitted across before vanishing without a trace, as if it had never appeared. Chen Feng was startled, yet he could no longer find it. Earlier\u2026 With the turn of his head, he sensed something different, yet it vanished.</p><br/><p>The god looked at him curiously. \"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng asked, \"Did you not feel a fluctuation earlier?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" The god maintained his curious expression.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Even a god hadn't felt it? But that had clearly been a fluctuation\u2026 Was it a misconception on his part? Chen Feng looked over at the miniature person, whose complexion had improved once again. How could it be a misconception? That fluctuation that had rippled past had actually been absorbed by this miniature person, causing a drastic improvement in his complexion.</p><br/><p>That familiar feeling\u2026 That fluctuation had to have appeared before as well. However, the past him had been too weak and had failed to detect it. But with this miniature person, which had also grown stronger, he had managed to detect that fluctuation.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ying,\" Chen Feng said inwardly, \"observe him for me. The moment it appeared\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Xiao Ying flickered several times in response. Chen Feng was still wondering what that fluctuation had been. He felt like something had to have happened, even if this was just his intuition. Just as he was deep in thought, a loud boom carried over. It was akin to the rumble of ten-thousand peals of thunder. As it reached the mountain, the entire shrine boomed loudly, startling everyone present.</p><br/><p>The god was furious. \"Who is it?\" There were actually people daring enough to come mess around in his territory? He was truly furious now. It was fine for him to have lost his prestige in front of these monkeys, it was also fine to have lost his prestige facing Chen Feng, but now, the provocation had even reached his territory? He was an illustrious god, an almighty and majestic god! He would not tolerate this!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash, the god appeared at the entrance together with Chen Feng and the others. There, a group of people were shouting at the door.</p><br/><p>Hmph!</p><br/><p>The god snorted, \"Feeling suicidal?\"</p><br/><p>The huge monkey grinned. \"Let me deal with them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good. Capture\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Before the god could even finish his words, the huge monkey had already pounced forth. His huge size, his terrifying talent, and his present strength as an apostle caused him to shoot forth like an artillery shell.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>This \"artillery shell\" landed, and instantly, a huge portion of the group of people, who also possessed extraordinary strength, was killed off.</p><br/><p>\"Capture and question\u2026\" The god failed to complete his sentence.</p><br/><p>The huge monkey turned around and smiled. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>The god's body stiffened. \"Hehe, nothing.\" He had never killed an apostle. However, after giving it some thought, an apostle capable of reaching this place should be the apostle of the other minor gods nearby. In that case, it did not matter even if they were killed by the huge monkey. After all, he did not fear those minor gods.</p><br/><p>\"You... you all\u2026\" The only survivor of the group looked at the huge monkey in horror. He had evidently never expected that the huge monkey would truly dare to make a move. \"You guys are courting death. A mere minor god\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Bastard.\" The huge monkey slapped him without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\"I am an apostle from Mountcarve City\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The heavily injured apostle was transformed into mincemeat by the huge monkey's slap.</p><br/><p>Mountcarve\u2026</p><br/><p>The god had a bad premonition. His godly power surged out and landed on the forehead of one of the corpses. Next, an extremely familiar imprint appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Prison.\" This was the word on the imprint.</p><br/><p>At this sight, the god's pupils shrunk. This was the apostle of one of the almighty gods of Mountcarve City, a god called Prison. Why were they here? No, now was not the time to ask this question. Suddenly, the god noticed an even bigger issue. The apostle of Prison had been killed by the huge monkey using the apostle power he had just granted the monkey not too long ago\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

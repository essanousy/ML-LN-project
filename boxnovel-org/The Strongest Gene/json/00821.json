All those godly powers had been copied by Luo Yuan, and Luo Yuan\u2019s next goal would surely be Chen Feng. He would try to get the power of misfortune through force, or perhaps he would think of a way to make Chen Feng put on the wristband. The moment he succeeded\u2026 the world would rewind.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng, Kong Bai, Qin Hai, all these people would cease to exist. Everything would be gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is getting troublesome,\u201d Chen Feng muttered. However, he soon thought of something. Was it truly possible for one to rewind this world after obtaining full control? After all, Chen Feng remembered that, among the 3,000 core powers, time was not included.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Controlling the world is exactly what it says, controlling the world. Everything can be controlled apart from time itself. After all, even the world itself exists in the river of time. As such, even the world itself cannot control time. Unless\u2026 the Time God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duma was certain. After all, he himself had once touched upon the power of time. Naturally, the power of time he had touched upon was an incredibly low-level one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI once obtained a small amount of the power of time by fluke. I am able to recover a short duration of time. My daughter is capable of the same. However, there is a price for that. My life span is the price\u2026\u201d Duma lamented. Life span?</p><br/><p>\u201cYet you still dare to use it?\u201d Kong Bai exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my life span is 90 million years\u2026\u201d Duma stated calmly.</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I almost forgot you\u2019re a turtle,\u201d Kong Bai lamented. Suddenly, Duma gaze, filled with killing intent, landed on him. \u201cOh, a majestic turtle,\u201d Kong Bai added hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Duma snorted before continuing, \u201cThe law of time is mysterious. However, others have stumbled upon some extensions of the law of time before, such as my recovery of time or Kong Bai\u2019s transmigration. However, making use of such low-level time powers requires a cost for each use. My ability requires payment in the form of my life span. As for your transmigration\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should rejoice in the fact that you have never messed with the past. Although your time travel involves true body moving through time, transmigration is actually a projection into a different point in time, a projection that is in incomplete disharmony with the entire world. Your aura when you transmigrate is like a bright shining lamp, easily detectable,\u201d Duma said with a sneer.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was dumbfounded. It was no wonder that they could transmigrate easily without receiving many effects. Hold on, this did not seem right either.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai suddenly recalled something. \u201cBut Qin Hai clearly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duma rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy else would I have accepted him as a disciple? I sensed an intense power of time from him. That was why I forcefully kept him with me so I could study him. To accomplish that, I exhausted 5,000 years of my life span. And thus, the Qin Hai you people see now came into being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hai\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI thought you accepted me because of my astonishing talent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duma coughed awkwardly and added, \u201cYes, that was one of the reasons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So this was the actual reason he had been kept behind in the past? U.pdated b.y </p><br/><p>Chen Feng brought them back to the main topic. \u201cTherefore\u2026 If Luo Yuan wants to rewind time, he has to first control this power of time, which is independent from the 3,000 core powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Duma was sure. \u201cSuch a power is something that one can only gain understanding of through transmigration and reincarnation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Transmigration\u2026</p><br/><p>Reincarnation\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng realized something. Wang Yao! So the reason Luo Yuan had taken Wang Yao was so he could train her into the Time God! So\u2026 that was why. Hold on. If that was the case, why had he suddenly transmigrated after his death back then? Even with Luck Aura\u2026 could that be the work of Luo Yuan as well? After all, Luo Yuan, who wanted to control all 3,000 core powers, would not allow the godly power of luck to be left on an alien world.</p><br/><p>If so, had that been the work of Luo Yuan? There was also Wang Yao\u2019s reincarnation\u2026 When Chen Feng recalled Luo Yuan\u2019s capability to erase one\u2019s memories imperceptibly, this was quite possible. Now that Chen Feng thought about it, was reincarnation something a mere organization could accomplish? Perhaps even that organization had been assisted by Luo Yuan! Everything seemed to click together. That experiment\u2026 had in fact been Luo Yuan\u2019s tool for filtering possible candidates for the position of Time God.</p><br/><p>Countless people were allowed to reincarnate. Only the one who was able to return alive would be entitled to receive his assistance to ascend to the position of Time God. This was the only logical explanation for that experiment. In Luo Yuan\u2019s search, numerous talented boys and girls had died just like that. Their only goal had been to return alive because the act of reincarnation contained the complexities of time as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and the others had believed that destruction of the experimentation ground would be the end of it all. Never had they expected that the destruction of the experimentation ground was but the beginning. Perhaps that was also the moment that those eyes from outer space started paying attention to Wang Yao.</p><br/><p>They were all incomparably shocked. So it turned out that everything was the work of that Luo Yuan. So it turned out that the final keys deciding the fate of this world were in the hands of Chen Feng and Wang Yao. Suddenly, Chen Feng laughed. \u201cIn short, Wang Yao is safe for now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Duma was certain. Since she needed to be made the Time Goddess, she was most definitely concentrating on cultivation. Luo Yuan would not dare to interrupt her cultivation. Naturally, regardless of whether she could successfully comprehend the power of time, she would remain imprisoned in outer space, being forced to contemplate the power of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if she fails?\u201d Kong Bai asked suddenly. If Wang Yao failed, wouldn\u2019t Luo Yuan have done all this for nothing?</p><br/><p>\u201cNot possible.\u201d Duma shook his head. \u201cSince Wang Yao has already obtained the seed of time, it is only a matter of time before she obtains full comprehension. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to obtain comprehension, the passing of time will drill the comprehension into her being.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the case. Chen Feng finally understood. As far as Luo Yuan was concerned, Wang Yao was nothing but a time machine. After he obtained full control over the world, he would return to outer space to retrieve his time machine. Then he would rewind time, returning to the era he longed for.</p><br/><p>As such, for the sake of this world and for Wang Yao, Chen Feng had to survive this. He could not allow Luo Yuan to obtain the power of misfortune as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you thought of what to do?\u201d Duma asked softly.</p><br/><p>Based on their understanding, Luo Yuan would probably arrive soon.</p><br/><p>After losing the faith of the various life-forms, this fellow with terrifying strength had decided to forget everything and focus purely on gathering the 3,000 core powers, then rewind time. They were completely incapable of defeating this fellow who presently had 2,999 core godly powers under his control. Chen Feng would not be able to, nor would any of them.</p><br/><p>They were aware that Luo Yuan was strong. However, they had never imagined that he was this strong. Back then, if Luo Yuan hadn\u2019t been willing to give up on his believers, consisting of all life-forms, he would have been killed by misfortune alone. That had been their one and only chance to defeat him. Unfortunately, Luo Yuan had indeed been willing to let go of his faith. Luo Yuan was now even more terrifying, to the point they had no hope of contending against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no other way?\u201d Chen Feng looked at them.</p><br/><p>Everyone maintained their silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yuan has an undying body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from the 2,999 core godly powers, he also has the unique abilities of the various life-forms under his control, including the genetic abilities of humans and the unique bloodline abilities of some other races.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was sure that there was no chance he could defeat Luo Yuan in a direct confrontation. And the moment Luo Yuan arrived and got ahold of him would be the end for this world. Everything would come to an end.</p><br/><p>Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng raised his head.</p></div>\n</div>"}

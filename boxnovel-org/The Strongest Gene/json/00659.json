Not far away, from the car Chen Feng couldn't see through, a black-clothed man appeared. He was carrying a bazooka that still carried a trace of warmth. Mrs. Chen was incredibly alarmed as she hugged her child. That guy had actually shot at them with a bazooka!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stood before the two. \"Retreat.\"</p><br/><p>\"Evaded?\" The black-clothed man was astonished. After all, this was a bazooka\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was even more astonished than that person. Why was it a bazooka? He was an awakened! If one wanted to do something against him, a bazooka would be completely useless.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. Interesting. I heard that you possess a certain level of superpowers. Surprisingly, such people exist in real life.\" The black-clothed man sneered. \"Unfortunately, facing our mercenary group, your so-called superpowers are but a joke. Let me show you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hand casually. Next, the black-clothed man collapsed to the ground. Chen Feng curled his lips. This guy was way too weak.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked over. \"That middle-aged man\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"My friend.\" Chen Jianguo smiled bitterly. \"I never expected that he would betray me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Kill him?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo shook his head. \"Forget it. Perhaps he is being threatened with his family. After all, I am the one who implicated him in this whole incident.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"All right.\"</p><br/><p>\"What to do with the child, then?\" Mrs. Chen was anxious.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Give him to me, then. When you two reached the location of your assignment, I will personally send the child over. This way, it will be safer.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" The Chen coupled exchanged glances before saying, \"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>Only a superhuman like this person could protect their child properly.</p><br/><p>\"This is the address. Just leave him to the old granny next door.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"I know.\"</p><br/><p>The granny next door. Mhm, he could still vaguely remember seeing that old granny when he had been young. Naturally, not long after, the old granny had passed away and he had been sent to the orphanage.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen was astonished. \"You know?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 It's nothing.\" Chen Feng shook his head. \"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>After this little crisis, they changed to a different car before continuing on. However, Chen Feng never stopped frowning. Since the enemy was trying to kill him, why were they using something as low level as a bazooka? After all, the enemy was aware that he was here\u2026 Hold on, was that fellow not aware that Chen Feng had appeared here?</p><br/><p>That wasn't possible. If the enemy primordial item had an independent consciousness, the enemy had to be capable of knowing that he had already arrived here as well. If so, why had the enemy used a bazooka, then? Perhaps that was the only thing the enemy could use at present?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. Although the enemy was capable of altering history in a major way, the enemy was still restricted to following the laws of the world and could only make use of whatever originally existing in said world.</p><br/><p>If so\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes gleamed. He had been able to perfectly descend upon this world without having to worry about being repelled by this world, and he was able to use all of his abilities, including his awakened abilities. This signified that he was god-like in this world.</p><br/><p>\"If so, things are going to be much easier to deal with,\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>\"What's up?\" asked the concerned Mrs. Chen.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"Don't worry. We will send you two to your destination first.\" Since the enemy was restricted by the laws of this world, Chen Feng's mission had become much easier. He only needed to send the Chen couple to their destination and then send the child back to the urban district and this would end. Next, he could return to the genetic world. He was certain that he hadn't interfered much with the affairs here in this world.</p><br/><p>He had disguised himself as an employee hired to protect the couple. At present, everything seemed to be progressing smoothly. No other special feelings had been triggered from the Chen couple.</p><br/><p>This was rather fine. Along the way, Mrs. Chen inquired about his well-being without stop. This caused Chen Feng to felt somewhat pressured. In the afternoon, finally, they arrived at their destination, Qinghe Mountain, the location where some ancient tombs had been discovered. With a single glance, Chen Feng noticed that this mountain was indeed on the verge of a landslide.</p><br/><p>If it rained\u2026 something would definitely happen. Should he tell them? Chen Feng pondered the matter and could only smile bitterly.</p><br/><p>Yet again, Mrs. Chen looked at him with concern and asked, \"What's the matter?\" She felt like along the way, this guy's complexion had not looked too well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"I'm fine.\" This was the easiest of missions for him. In this modern society of technology, he was simply god-like. However, for an unknown reason, this mission was also one that caused his heart to accumulate a great amount of fatigue.</p><br/><p>\"Come in and take a rest,\" Chen Jianguo said with a smile. \"Let my wife feed the child more.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Chen Feng followed him in.</p><br/><p>\"Yo, Old Chen is back,\" said several smiling employees that had arrived earlier. \"Huh? Old Chen, why did you bring your relative to a place like this?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo rolled his eyes. \"What relative?\"</p><br/><p>\"What the hell, you too look so alike. If he's not your relative, who could he be?\" they grumbled. \"If this child was a few years younger, people would believe it even if you claimed that he was your son.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Jianguo was stunned.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\" He glanced at the Chen Jianguo's strict-looking square face before rubbing his handsome face and concluding that these archaeology employees were all blind.</p><br/><p>One of them frowned as he said, \"By the way, I feel like he looks more like your wife.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have the same feeling as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Weird\u2026 Why does this kid resemble both you and your wife so much?\"</p><br/><p>The more they talked about it, the more astonished they were. \"Old Chen, is this some secret child of you and your wife's from back when you two were 14 years old?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo's expression darkened.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had an ominous feeling. Why had the plot suddenly progressed in such a direction?</p><br/><p>\"How are we even alike?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo retorted grudgingly before glancing at Chen Feng. After focusing on Chen Feng momentarily, he was somewhat stunned. Now that he looked at Chen Feng, Chen Feng truly resembled Mrs. Chen.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen entered as well. \"What's the matter?\"</p><br/><p>\"Look properly\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo whispered and told her all that had happened.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen's eyes flashed as she stared blankly at Chen Feng. After a long while, she smiled suddenly, \"Are you all stupid? This kid is already over 20 years old. At most, he can be my little brother. How can he be my son? Be careful lest you guys focus so much on archaeology that your brain suffers from it.\" Mrs. Chen grudgingly said, \"Why are you guys still not working? We have delayed this project for way too long. We must start it today. You guys are not allowed to look for excuses to further delay the project.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, they all dispersed.</p><br/><p>\"Stop thinking too much.\" Mrs. Chen smiled and said, \"Thank you for your help. You can leave with the child after he's full.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"All right.\" After looking at Mrs. Chen entering her room, he heaved a sigh of relief. What had happened earlier? Why had the topic switched to the topic of him being their son so suddenly? Perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was alarmed. Perhaps, this was the mysterious enemy's true goal? Suddenly, he thought of the enemy that had never appeared after the bazooka incident. He had been on guard against assassinations and attacks all this time yet had forgotten the enemy's true goal.</p><br/><p>That's right, who said that killing was the only way of erasing an enemy? Since the enemy knew that Chen Feng's combat strength was unequaled here in this world, the enemy would certainly not act rashly. Just imagine the scene where the enemy managed to successfully cause his parents to doubt him, or to recognize him, or perhaps cause him to be unable to bear not telling them the truth. Regardless of which of these happened, the timeline would most certainly change as a result. This might affect even the future! This was the enemy's true goal!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

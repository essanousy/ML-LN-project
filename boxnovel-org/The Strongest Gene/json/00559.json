Where was their face? Chen Feng had only recently created this spirit art capable of both making money and helping the public at the same time. Now, those fellows were using such a method to force Chen Feng to sell it to them. This was too excessive!</p><br/><p>\"Stay calm,\" Chen Feng stated unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>\"Are you not angry?\" grumbled Li Lei. Why did it look like he was the one being forced by the Genetic Union instead of Chen Feng here?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stretched lazily. \"Will being angry help?\"</p><br/><p>\"You have such good temper.\" Li Lei was still feeling extremely indignant. After all, he had once promised to give Chen Feng a better environment, yet unexpectedly, here at the Genetic Union, Chen Feng was actually being pushed to such an extent.</p><br/><p>\"Come on, it's just some points, yet those guys\u2026\" Li Lei was greatly disappointed in the Genetic Union. Just some points\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng turned around and looked at Li Lei with an amazed expression and concluded that Li Lei was truly in the dark about how much Chen Feng had earned from this new spirit art.</p><br/><p>How could those points he had earned be described with the word \"some\"? If he had been allowed to continue, the entire Genetic Union would have been his before long. How could those big shots have possibly remained calm? Chen Feng wasn't surprised at this, though. If he was one of those big shots, he would try to think of something as well when encountering something like this. He would never watch on as the Genetic Union become the private property of a lone individual.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng checked online and noted that at present, specialists were already appearing, analyzing and figuring out who should be the one to hold the ownership of spirit art. There were also some specialists saying that since Chen Feng was such a kind guy, he would most definitely hand the spirit art over. Some analyzed that with the present state of humanity, where they were constantly being threatened by the ancient race and the devil race, Chen Feng had to put his personal benefits aside and so on.</p><br/><p>\"Tsk tsk.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was amused as he read all this. From the sounds of things, it seemed like if he refused to hand the spirit art over, he would be the greatest sinner of all of humanity.</p><br/><p>Li Lei sighed. \"If we were in a peaceful time\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He shook his head.</p><br/><p>He could remember that the last person who had created something this miraculous was Luo Yuan. That had happened during peacetime. With the wristband Luo Yuan had created and the Stormtech Co. Ltd. he'd founded, he had become a legend. Yet now, when Chen Feng created something miraculous\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry.\" Li Lei felt extremely guilty. If his position in the Genetic Union were higher, he might be able to stop all this.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"You are not to blame.\" He was still clear on the identity of his friends and enemies. Since he had long ago seen this coming, how was it possible for him to not have prepared for this at all?</p><br/><p>A smile formed on Chen Feng's face. \"Don't worry. I believe that the Genetic Union will most definitely give me a perfect explanation for this.\"</p><br/><p>The next day, a new announcement was released, which shocked the entire world.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>I heard that the Genetic Union is willing to sacrifice to better help humanity. I hereby announce that I am willing to hand over Master Spirit Trainer to the Genetic Union for free, just like what I did previously with the beyond X gene reagent I created. I sincerely wish that the Genetic Union will give humanity an even better future.</p><br/><p>Regards, Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>This shocked the entire world. Free? That's right, Chen Feng was handing over Master Spirit Trainer to the Genetic Union for free. Everyone was stupefied. The Genetic Union was stupefied. They had imagined countless scenarios, such as a high price, a low price, or unwillingness to sell. They had even drawn numerous plans to force Chen Feng to sell it. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng would directly give it to them for free.</p><br/><p>Only now did they recall how back then, Chen Feng had seemingly given the beyond X gene reagent to the Gene Production Association for free as well. That was similarly a heaven-defying deed, a contribution capable of altering the fate of humanity. At this instant, countless people felt ashamed of what they had done to Chen Feng previously.</p><br/><p>These were the ones who had wished dearly that the price would be reduced from 100 points to five points. They had even used the internet to use public opinion to force Chen Feng to relinquish his grasp. Unexpectedly\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng is truly a great person.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the perfect example of a selfless human.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a moment that deserves to be carved into the annals of history.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. The entire internet was filled with information regarding Chen Feng. This was a day where Chen Feng alone was honored. At present, the people of the Genetic Union were looking at each other. After their Trade Department confirmed that the Master Spirit Trainer given to them was the stable version, they formalized the takeover and, at the same time, started running this Master Spirit Trainer. Everything seemed perfect. Chen Feng had even performed numerous optimizations to the numerous functions of this Master Spirit Trainer before handing it over to them.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Even the higher-ups of the Genetic Union were feeling ashamed now. Had they been viewing the actions of a noble person through the lens of a scoundrel? Chen Feng hadn't even attempted to keep the Master Spirit Trainer for himself.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026 What now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Leak the news about how Chen Feng helped optimize it before the handover. Rain praise down upon him.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>This was the only thing they could do to reduce the guilt they were feeling. Soon, this news was spread, and once again, praises were rained upon Chen Feng, skyrocketing his reputation.</p><br/><p>On the next day, Master Spirit Trainer started operating. This time, the Genetic Union was the one running it. For five points, one could remove their weakened state once. This attracted countless people, kick-starting an era of rapid growth. Without a doubt, the strength of humanity as a whole had once again been greatly increased.</p><br/><p>As for the one who the masses felt endless gratitude to, it was without a doubt Chen Feng. This act of Chen Feng's, of handing over Master Spirit Trainer for free, had an extremely huge impact, so much that even the losses Genetic Union took to sell the weakened-state remover to the masses at a cheap price remained unmentioned. All the honor and glory belonged to Chen Feng alone.</p><br/><p>\"Sigh.\"</p><br/><p>When those of the Genetic Union's Operation Department checked online, they noted that not a single speck praise had landed on them. Almost everyone was expressing their gratitude to Chen Feng alone.</p><br/><p>\"No matter what, we deserve some praise as well, right?\" The person from the Operation Department felt extremely wronged. Yes, Chen Feng had indeed contributed greatly. However, the Genetic Union was the very party operating at a loss presently. Yes, the production materials of this gene reagent cost only three points. As such, selling them at five points seemed profitable. However, after deducting the cost of manpower, the Genetic Union was in fact suffering a loss.</p><br/><p>The higher-ups comforted them. \"Forget it. At least we were able to solve the crisis involving the authority of the Genetic Union. We are well aware of your contribution. Just wait a while. When the impact of what Chen Feng did has diminished, we will arrange for you guys to be featured in the news as well. All your hard work will be properly reported.\"</p><br/><p>With this, this incident reached its end. The entirety of humanity entered a phase of rapid growth, increasing their strength greatly. As for the Genetic Union, despite the losses they had suffered, they had managed to solve the crisis regarding their authority. To be able to obtain a certain degree of positive publicity, such a small loss wasn't something they were bothered with.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Feng, even though he hadn't been able to earn as much as he should have, he had received the greatest of glory and become a legend among the masses, obtaining supreme honor. But then, was this truly how things were going to end?</p><br/><p>In the second week after this incident, when the media was still talking about this without stop, suddenly, the Genetic Union discovered something. Something seemed to be off.</p><br/><p>\"This number\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The higher ups of the Genetic Union sank into contemplation when they saw this month's financial report. For an organization of their size, to occasionally suffer some losses for the sake of humanity was something acceptable. That was why they found the losses they suffered from running Master Spirit Trainer to be acceptable. However, the actual losses they were seeing in their financial report seemed much higher than they had anticipated?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

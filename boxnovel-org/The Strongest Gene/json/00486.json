And now, within the entirety of this huge Star City, there was no longer any superexpert in existence. Yet what they faced was this terrifying female, a person who far surpassed an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>A cold smile appeared on the female ancient race's face. \"Next, it's your turn\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Alas, she was only halfway through her sentence when, suddenly, a current of seven colors flashed past with a resounding bang. Instantly, a chaotic mess of abilities were all stuffed straight into her mouth before exploding loudly.</p><br/><p>Chi\u2014</p><br/><p>Chi\u2014</p><br/><p>Numerous bizarre liquids of differing tastes erupted within her mouth. At this instant, the entire world had seemingly lapsed into silence. Everyone's jaw was left hanging as they disbelievingly watched this scene unfold. They were especially shocked by the sight of that seemingly undefeated female receiving that shot right on her face.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei remained dazed for quite a while after seeing this. \"Wow.\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was incredibly alarmed as well. \"How ferocious.\" Someone actually dared to do this to a person who had insta-killed their deputy president? How brave! What could they say toward that person? By the side, Chen Feng merely shrugged helplessly. This truly wasn't something he had planned. The moment God Punisher has been activated, he had become unable to control the spammed abilities. The only thing he could do was stop the ability\u2014nothing else.</p><br/><p>It was not possible that he would stop it willingly, since now, God Punisher was his only hope. He checked the time and noted that the God Punisher release had already reached the final three seconds.</p><br/><p>From now on, all of the remaining abilities that his God Punisher was going to unleash were extremely powerful abilities. After the amplification effect, they would be even scarier. Instead of being the end, this was the mere beginning of his true attack.</p><br/><p>\"You dare!\" the female ancient race screeched sharply.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Her pink aura surged as numerous rays of light swept toward Chen Feng. In their path, space itself was ripped apart, demonstrating the unordinary strength of these rays. It seemed like this female ancient race was planning to rip Chen Feng apart instantly without giving anyone a chance to block her attack.</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\" Xu Fei's eyes gleamed furiously as he calculated if he could take this attack on for Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>As for Kong Bai, his gaze remained cold as he stood silently, analyzing if his transmigration ability was capable of transmigrating this attack out of this place\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at this instant, facing that attack, Chen Feng merely aimed forward with his hand.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Another group of abilities shot out.</p><br/><p>\"You still dare to keep throwing out that trash?\" The female ancient race was so angry she started laughing instead. Previously, due to the three old men blocking her, she hadn't been able to do anything to Chen Feng. Now that those three were no longer here, this guy still dared to act so rampantly? Alas, she failed to notice that this time, the attacks released by Chen Feng were somewhat different from what he had released earlier.</p><br/><p>\"This trash\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Her pink energy clashed with these trash abilities. Right as she was expecting that she would kill this annoying bug easily, she was surprised to find that those trash abilities actually pierced through her pink energy.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The multiple layers of pink energy were destroyed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a bright explosion, those abilities even pierced her defensive barrier and landed on her body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>She was smashed backward, smashed to the point her head became dizzy.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>She was now dumbstruck. What was going on?</p><br/><p>She had actually been smashed away? Smashed away by those trash abilities that hadn't even been able to break through her defenses earlier? She lowered her head and studied her body. Her initially neat clothes were now torn, and on her originally spotless white jade-like skin were now numerous scars. She had actually been injured by this damnable human? How was this possible? She couldn't believe this.</p><br/><p>She had been injured by this guy who had been firing nothing but trash abilities? One ought to remember that previously, the abilities that person had unleashed had been incapable of even leaving a scratch on her skin. Was this sudden eruption his trump card? Her gaze became gloomy as she felt like she had underestimated this fellow.</p><br/><p>\"Fine. Since you can still mount some sort of resistance against me, I can properly enjoy this feeling of crushing you.\"</p><br/><p>Once again, she made her move. This time, she was not moving frivolously like she previously had when she'd believed that she was merely killing a bug. Rather, she was prepared to utilize her full power, to teach this fellow who did not know what was good for him a proper lesson.</p><br/><p>Having decided, she raised her head only to notice that the guy was still throwing trash at her like usual. Indeed, he was still throwing out those trash abilities. That guy did not even realize that it was now time for him to release some truly powerful abilities and had instead stuck with spamming that current of trash abilities with bizarre colors. If one had to describe the current Chen Feng, he was akin to a mobile hose, with her being his target.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The ray of myriad colors shot straight at her.</p><br/><p>She inhaled deeply. Although she had no clue what this fellow was firing at her this time, due to the previous injury she suffered from him, she decided to face this person like she would an opponent at her level.</p><br/><p>\"Starworld Defense!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A huge defensive barrier appeared. The same moment her defensive barrier was erected, that bizarre attack of Chen Feng's arrived as well.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>With two loud sounds, this barrier that had never failed her started wavering.</p><br/><p>\"!\"</p><br/><p>This time, her expression changed completely. This ability she had been regarding as a trash spammer was actually capable of such might?</p><br/><p>Hastily, she replenished the energy supporting her barrier. \"Condense!\" She did not intend to allow an attack capable of threatening her barrier to land on her body. Naturally, even now, she still couldn't understand what damnable ability this was, exactly. Unknown to her, she was not the only one who had been alarmed by the attack earlier. Everyone in Star City was similarly shocked.</p><br/><p>Such an attack\u2026 Was this truly Chen Feng? Earlier, even the trio consisting of their deputy president had only been able to reach a forceful stalemate facing this female. Now, Chen Feng was actually capable of smashing her away? This Chen Feng fellow was actually so powerful?</p><br/><p>With their own eyes, they looked at that chaotic ray of various colors before looking at Chen Feng, the person responsible for firing that ray out. All of them were submerged in a feeling of deep shock, wondering what exactly was it that Chen Feng was firing.</p><br/><p>Even the boss of these genetic warriors couldn't figure out what ability this was, exactly. At least, as far as they knew, this was an ability they had never seen. Presently, Chen Feng was still silently counting down.</p><br/><p>Earlier, when there had still been three seconds left for his release of God Punisher, a huge bunch of powerful attacks had been unleashed. Each wave of his attacks consisted of 200 different abilities. On average, each of these abilities had been amplified 50 times. After 200 such abilities slammed down, even that woman's strongest defensive barrier had started wavering.</p><br/><p>Now, there were two seconds left. Every single second, his next wave of attacks would grow stronger than the previous wave. Those abilities that had been kept toward the end were all the strongest attacking abilities he had in his repertoire.</p><br/><p>Presently, his God Punisher required 32 seconds to fully unleash all his abilities. However, the first 29 seconds essentially consisted of abilities that were as good as nonexistent abilities. One could say that the initial 29 seconds was no different from a cast time, a mere prelude. The true eruption of God Punisher would happen during the final three seconds. From Chen Feng's current ability history that contained around 6,000 different abilities, the strongest abilities were all kept toward the end. Along with the amplification, these abilities would erupt with an explosive might.</p><br/><p>As he saw the defensive barrier erected by that female ancient race, Chen Feng merely smiled.</p><br/><p>Time to end this!</p><br/><p>It was now the final two seconds of his God Punisher release.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>From Chen Feng's hand, a huge amount of attacks erupted.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>The Starworld Defense of the female ancient warrior failed to last even one second before it shattered entirely. As this happened, God Punisher reached its final second as well.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying attack bloomed. The strongest abilities Chen Feng had were instantaneously unleashed. The seemingly endless attacks all landed on the female ancient race, instantly inflicting a serious injury on her. Just as everyone thought that this was the end of Chen Feng's attack\u2026</p><br/><p>Both Chen Feng's eyes started gleaming with red, signifying the arrival of the final attack of God Punisher, Chen Feng's strongest attack, Nethergaze! This was the attack Chen Feng had taken one whole day to condense when facing the head of the Wild Saint family back then. Now, this terrifying attack was unleashed with a terrifying amplification of 60 times.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The red shone dazzlingly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

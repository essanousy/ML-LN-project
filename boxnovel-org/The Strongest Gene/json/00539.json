In the second minute, they started repairing their defensive barriers frantically. In the fifth minute, all of them had exhausted their energy. At that moment, the defenses of all the beyond A classes burst apart after losing their energy supply. The final defensive line remaining was immediately smashed apart with a single punch.</p><br/><p>Right now, they were left with no defenses.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The devil expert's punch descended.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, Lu Hun, are you done yet?\" Li Lei howled. He could see that even Lu Hun's energy was near exhaustion as well.</p><br/><p>\"One more. Hold on.\" Lu Hun gazed resolutely at the dropping fist, seemingly calculating the amount of energy required to teleport the last of them. He counted down, \"Three, two, one\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Right before the punch landed on them.</p><br/><p>\"Done!\" Lu Hun exclaimed in joy.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Light flickered. The descending fist landed on the ground instead, creating a huge crater there. As for those people that had been standing there, they had all vanished without a trace. Near the end, Chen Feng and the rest had indeed been teleported out.</p><br/><p>In a certain unknown region, numerous figures appeared out of thin air. Escaped! As they took in the fresh air, they were all overjoyed. Finally, they no longer had to inhale air perverted by that intense smell of urine. The scariest part of that huge devil had in fact not been his strength. Rather, it had been the odor on his body. Moreover, since the urine was the source of the unique energy completing the summon, that summoned devil would most probably be stuck with that smell forever.</p><br/><p>At this thought, they started wondering, would that devil expert actually feel joyful after fully awakening, or would that devil, in a fit of anger, murder all who had summoned him? Mhm, this was quite the question.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha. This father here survived.\"</p><br/><p>Some were ecstatic. As for the rest, they also smiled in a gratified manner.</p><br/><p>Next, one of them turned around to see a flash of green. At that, that cheerful mood seemed to freeze. Right, there was that Lu Hun fellow here.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They started gazing at each other as their killing intent surged. Their cooperation had been a forced one in any case. Now that they had already escaped successfully, there was no longer any need to show any considerations for the other side.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>From one of their hands, a cold flash shot forth toward Lu Hun. Lu Hun merely watched on coldly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That attack was interrupted midair. Surprisingly, the one blocking the attack was actually a companion of the attacker, the spatial specialist of the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>They were all alarmed. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the spatial specialist smiled. \"What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>This seemed rather bizarre.</p><br/><p>\"You are trying to kill me with only this much strength?\" the spatial specialist stated coldly.</p><br/><p>It was still the original voice of this spatial specialist. However, the tone and manner of speech were instead\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Lei's expression changed greatly. \"Lu Hun! You're actually Lu Hun?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" The spatial specialist smiled toyingly. \"Isn't it too late for you to only be discovering this now?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Finishing his words, his body shuddered as his gaze went blank momentarily before recovering. \"I\u2026 what?\" With a confused expression, he looked at his companions. Everyone's heart chilled.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 do you still remember what we did earlier?\" Li Lei asked while his voice shuddered.</p><br/><p>\"Earlier?\" That person appeared puzzled. \"Weren't we talking about joining hands earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>All of them paled. Joining hands\u2026 In other words, as early as that, he had already been possessed by Lu Hun. If so, when Li Lei had been asking him about the teleportation coordinates\u2026</p><br/><p>They started looking around them. This was a place surrounded by a primal and chaotic aura.</p><br/><p>Li Lei tried contacting the Genetic Union. He indeed managed to contact them. However, this place was too far away for their reinforcements to arrive in time. Even if they were to rush over using special abilities, they would still take several minutes to arrive. In these few minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>From the dusky chaotic aura, numerous powerful existences appeared. Ancient race. All of them were ancients.</p><br/><p>\"Dear sirs, I'm afraid you lot will have to stay here forever,\" Lu Hun stated with a cold gaze. \"As for you\u2026\" His chilly gaze landed on Chen Feng. \"I'm afraid you will have to come with me.\"</p><br/><p>He believed that as long as Chen Feng was captured, he would be able to make up his own truth for his wife.</p><br/><p>\"I'm feeling rather shy,\" Chen Feng stated bashfully. \"I will be nervous when doing a threesome.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's expression greened. He laughed sinisterly. \"I will ensure your satisfaction.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The ancient experts behind him walked out. Even if everything proceeded according to his plan, even if the Genetic Union would require several minutes to arrive here, Lu Hun would still not allow any mishaps. As such, he absolutely had to deal with this within the shortest time possible.</p><br/><p>He barked out his final command coldly. \"Kill!\"</p><br/><p>The hearts of Li Lei and the rest chilled. During the battle earlier, they had all exhausted their energy. At present, they were simply defenseless. Looking at the ancients before them that were no weaker than beyond A classes, they despaired. They had indeed prepared themselves to be stabbed in the back, yet it was truly beyond their expectations that Lu Hun would pull something like this off.</p><br/><p>What was that, exactly? Soul control? Body possession? But then, Lu Hun was clearly standing right before them. The diamond on Lu Hun's forehead flickered without stop, seemingly laughing at their ignorance. Indeed, humanity's knowledge of the ancients was still rather limited, after all. This limitation was especially pronounced in regards to the fellow apprentice brothers of Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>What to do? The humans exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>Li Lei sighed. \"Seems like we can only do that.\" The rest exchanged glances and nodded. They no longer had any combat power. As such, they could only do that. Using their final trump card, they would perish together with Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint glimmer appeared around their bodies.</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>With a slap, Chen Feng stopped them all.</p><br/><p>\"???\" Li Lei felt doubtful.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely smiled as he regarded Lu Hun, who was having a good time watching them. \"A suicide attack will be ineffective against this person. This Lu Hun here has numerous clones everywhere. As such, it is not possible to know which is the true body and which is the clone.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun merely sneered as a response. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>The attacks of his underlings continued. Dragging out the time? He would not allow it.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The several ancients pounced at them furiously.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head and sighed. \"Is there a need for this? Lu Hun, do you think that you are the only one who has called for reinforcement?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Lu Hun did not even bother looking at Chen Feng. He was sure that Chen Feng was trying to drag this out. Reinforcements? What a joke. He was the one who had decided the teleportation coordinates. How could Chen Feng have called for reinforcements to such a place in advance? Back then, he had still believed that this Chen Feng was a rather smart person. Now that he looked at it, hehe, this Chen Feng was only someone capable of some idiotic methods of dragging out the time\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Hun sneered.</p><br/><p>Alas, right at this moment, numerous cold flashes of light suddenly flashed through the air.</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>Several bloodstains bloomed in the air. The ancients that had been about to reach Li Lei and the rest were suddenly split in two, and their bodies crashed to the ground. Blood splattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"?!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's eyes widened abruptly. These\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Who is it?\" Lu Hun bellowed. Around them, numerous flickering figures appeared suddenly.</p><br/><p>Someone walked out from the left side. \"Gou Li.\"</p><br/><p>Another person walked out from behind Lu Hun. \"Guo Jia.\"</p><br/><p>Someone walked out from the right side. \"Sheng Siyi.\"</p><br/><p>The three stood together, their killing intent surging.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

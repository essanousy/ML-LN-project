This was what had ensured that Luo Yuan could surpass all living beings, maintaining all the abilities he gained from everyone at peak proficiency rather than them all being stuck at the primary level. Now, it was his greatest weakness. The setbacks that all of the life-forms were experiencing were being shared with him, causing his entire body to ache in pain, and he had lost control over his body as well.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng punched out. Instantly, a powerful might erupted. Chen Feng\u2019s power as a god went through the usual amplification and blasted at Luo Yuan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>With a punch, Luo Yuan was beaten into the ground.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not stop attacking. He stepped forth as terrifying power converged in his hands. Each punch landed on Luo Yuan, blasting the power into his body. The attacks never stopped, not even when Luo Yuan was already sprawled on the ground, not even when he was already bloodied all over.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence. The various gods gulped, not daring to say anything. This\u2026 Chen Feng was actually wiping the ground with Luo Yuan? This truly surpassed even their wildest imaginings. This was too astonishing. After all, this was Luo Yuan, a person that possessed every ability. This\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The sound of Luo Yuan being beaten up echoed without stop. Chen Feng\u2019s attacks were truly landing, and a terrifying shockwave was spreading all over. Luo Yuan\u2019s body was on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not giving up?\u201d Chen Feng\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. This fellow\u2026 had much greater endurance than he had imagined. Was this due to the numerous unique abilities he had copied in the past? This fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, Chen Feng erupted with strength. As for Luo Yuan, he was already covered with injuries, and his consciousness was getting blurry, to the point that he couldn\u2019t even see Chen Feng clearly anymore. Damn it. What power was this, exactly? He had no idea. He did not know how Chen Feng had obtained such a power.</p><br/><p>In the past, Luo Yuan had been successful in all his endeavors thanks to Luck Aura. As such, as time passed, he had formed a strong reliance on Luck Aura. Everything had always progressed as he wished. Yet now that his Luck Aura had been neutralized by Chen Feng, with his luck even taking a bad turn, he was thoroughly dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with this. In fact, this was something Chen Feng had experienced before. Therefore, Chen Feng knew exactly how Luo Yuan was feeling.</p><br/><p>This reliance on luck used to be Chen Feng\u2019s greatest weakness as well. Because of this, he had nearly lost everything. When Luck Aura had been taken away from him, he had nearly given up on everything. Now he was letting Luo Yuan experience the same thing. He knew very well what Luo Yuan would feel, since Luo Yuan was similarly reliant on Luck Aura. Luo Yuan was completely clueless when it came to how to deal with this sudden change.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s punches rained down. He could feel that Luo Yuan\u2019s body was getting weaker and weaker. This body, which had been strengthened countless times, was now incomparably frail, mainly due to the excessive blood loss.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan coughed up another mouthful of blood, his face deadly pale. He was truly on the verge of collapse. The strength Chen Feng had erupted with far surpassed that of an ordinary god. One could say that his strength had surpassed even that of a major god. However, he was clearly an ordinary god.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was feeling extremely hateful. Did he have no options left? Luo Yuan clenched both his fists tightly. He had spent so many years arranging everything so as to reach this point. How could he allow his plan to fail now? However, he truly had no options.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there was indeed a way out of this. Unfortunately, due to his reliance on Luck Aura, Luo Yuan hadn\u2019t solved anything with his wits for a long time. As such, he was presently incapable of thinking of any way to deal with this sudden attack. He tried to think.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A punch landed on his now bun-like face.</p><br/><p>He tried to think again.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another punch came, interrupting his thoughts. He truly couldn\u2019t even think properly under pressure anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng would not give him a chance to think deeply. As for his body, under the relentless attacks, he wouldn\u2019t be able to last any longer. Soon\u2026 If Luo Yuan couldn\u2019t counterattack, he would probably be beaten to death just like this. Moreover, this would be a total defeat.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another punch landed. It was at this moment that Luo Yuan lost control over his emotions.</p><br/><p>He raged. \u201cChen Feng! I hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another punch landed on his face. Was there any way he could deal with this? Yes. Quite a simple way, in fact. How did one deal with a virus-infected computer network? Sever the connection! In this network of connections set up by Luo Yuan, when someone died or lost one\u2019s ability, the connection would be severed. Luo Yuan would then be able to keep the abilities he had stolen from those people, even after they had died.</p><br/><p>This was a precautionary method he had prepared long ago. However, to do this when it involved his entire network? He was still hesitating.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! / update by </p><br/><p>A punch landed on his nose. Even with his constitution surpassing that of a god\u2019s, he was still badly wounded.</p><br/><p>No! I can\u2019t give up just like this! There must be another way! he howled inwardly. He was unwilling to accept this. He would not give up. There had to be some other way. He possessed countless abilities and unimaginable strength. Moreover, all of the abilities he had copied were comparatively powerful. With so many abilities at his disposal, he was the strongest existence. Surely there was a way out of this.</p><br/><p>Is this an invasion of my network? Is this a virus? Or something else? It does not matter how Chen Feng did it. There ought to be a solution\u2026 Let me think\u2026 I will definitely be able to think of something! If Luck Aura still worked, what would Luck Aura have me do?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Another punch landed.</p><br/><p>What angle would Luck Aura tackle this problem from?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A kick landed on his crotch.</p><br/><p>Oh, this angle\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A powerful force seemed to be eroding his organs.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s thought process was interrupted without stop. With despair, he found that, without Luck Aura, he required much more time to process his thoughts. After all, it had been way too long since he had last used his brain. Chen Feng had no intention of giving him a chance to think. Time after time, Luo Yuan\u2019s thoughts were interrupted. His body became weaker and weaker; he was now bordering death. Finally, Luo Yuan gave up trying to think of a different solution.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah ah ahhhhh! Sever!\u201d he howled. Under Chen Feng\u2019s intense beating, he finally countered with an intense burst of fury.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>All over the world, at this instant, all the wristbands in existence burst apart.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Finally, the connections to Luo Yuan were severed, and instantly, Luo Yuan\u2019s body started recovering rapidly. Previously, he had been unable to heal as he had been simultaneously receiving all the damage that all the living beings in the world were suffering. And now\u2026 without the simultaneous damage, his body was healing at a speed fast enough to surpass Chen Feng\u2019s damage.</p><br/><p>However, there was no trace of joy on Luo Yuan\u2019s face. That was because, for survival, he had given up on something incredibly important to him! The millions upon millions of life-forms and abilities! He had gained those things after many years of bitter planning. Everything was now gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was filled with hatred.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The strongest person Chen Feng had ever encountered was only a peak beyond A class. With the appearance of the beyond X gene reagent, the time at which one could reach A class from F class had been greatly reduced. However, for those that were already at the apex of existence, this gene reagent did not change much. What these people required was a way to break through the bottleneck, the bottleneck known as S class.</p><br/><p>There was an S class among the devil race. This fact had yet to be verified, but based on Chen Feng's guess, the old man who had never made his move was probably in S class. This old man Chen Feng was thinking about was Qin Hai's master, who had been known as Sage back in the ancient era.</p><br/><p>This was also why humanity had such fear toward the ancient race. The ancient race was already in such circumstance yet that old man still remained unmoved. What exactly was that old man planning to do? Nobody knew. The only thing humanity could do was pay close attention to the ancient race for fear of anything unexpected happening.</p><br/><p>From this, the deterrence power of an S class was apparent. However, regardless of how powerful the ancient race's S class was, it had nothing to do with humanity. After all, it wasn't like the S class would teach humans how to breakthrough or something like that. However, now that there was an S class among the devil race as well\u2026</p><br/><p>This fact truly alarmed everyone. In truth, the devil race's system was quite similar to humanity's genetic system. As such, an S-class devil race definitely possessed a seventh ability, a seventh powerful gene. As long as humanity could obtain this gene\u2026 Everyone was tempted.</p><br/><p>\"S class is too strong. We are totally not that devil race member's match,\" one of them said after shaking his head. They recalled the scene earlier when that devil aura had pervaded the air. The strength of the S-class devil race member was simply too scary. It wasn't something they could deal with.</p><br/><p>Li Lei shook his head. \"No, no. If that was really the case, why would the devil race be so desperate? The reason they are so nervous is because that powerful S class has yet to fully awaken.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes widened. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"That devil race is too strong.\" Li Lei sneered. \"But the devil race's remaining energy supply is too low. As such, they have to slowly awaken that expert, which will require a huge amount of sacrifices. This is also the reason the devil race hasn't appeared for half a year. They have been busy doing this. Unfortunately for them, I was able to accidentally discover this. We only need to interrupt their sacrifice ceremony and that expert devil race will be an empty shell akin to a puppet. What we want is its corpse and blood essence.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes shone. If that was the case, it was doable.</p><br/><p>\"When should we do it?\" someone asked.</p><br/><p>\"Now!\" Li Lei answered without hesitation. \"The earlier, the better. When I discovered them, the ceremony was already in progress. Even if the ceremony duration is rather long because the gap between their strength and that expert's is too huge, if we delay this, some unwanted variables might appear. Perhaps the devil race might have some other methods to speed this up.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged glances. \"That's possible as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"If so, let's go now.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up. The deputy president looked at Li Lei anxiously. \"Are you fine?\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei shook his head. \"I'm fine. I have merely overexerted my energy. As for the other injuries, they are merely external. I will allow them to slowly heal while on the way.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president nodded. \"That's good to hear. Let me know if there's anything you need.\"</p><br/><p>Now that humanity had once again stumbled upon hope, they had to grab it. If they could produce a sufficient amount of S-class gene reagents, human society would\u2026</p><br/><p>S class! The mere thought of this caused their hearts to tremble. It might finally be possible for humanity to truly contend against the ancient race and devil race.</p><br/><p>\"The devil race is, after all, not some pushover. Even if the amount that have reawakened is rather low, all of them are exceptionally powerful. As such, I need 10 beyond-A-class warriors.\" Li Lei stated his requests without hesitation. \"As for the remaining support warriors, the Genetic Union can arrange as they deem necessary.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president agreed. \"All right.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for gene production\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei looked at Chen Feng, \"Just as I mentioned previously, Chen Feng is the most optimal choice for this. However, to go or not, or whether he can go or not, or whether he can actually produce it or not, he will have to consider it himself. After all, this is an S-class gene reagent. This is something no producers have ever encountered.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone's gaze landed on Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"I'm going,\" Chen Feng answered without hesitation. Since this was related to S class, he had to participate. This was about the future of humanity, about the direction this world would take. As such, he had to personally partake rather than stay a spectator like he had been previously.</p><br/><p>Li Lei was overwhelmed by his emotions. \"Very good. Let's depart now, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"Gene materials\u2026\" Chen Feng was somewhat worried about the materials.</p><br/><p>However, the Genetic Union had directly deployed 10 beyond-B-class genetic warriors to join them, each of them carrying a huge bundle containing materials. Any material that might be required was now here.</p><br/><p>\"You guys will be carrying them like this?\" Chen Feng wiped his sweat. Were there no spatial abilities or spatial storage systems?</p><br/><p>They laughed. \"Our spatial storage is already full. The rest of the materials will have to be carried physically.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless. It was apparent that this time, the Genetic Union and Gene Production Association were contributing everything they could. That was understandable, though. After all, this pertained to the legendary S class. As such, proper preparations were required.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed off into the distance. Would the ancient race allow this to happen?</p><br/><p>At the present moment, in a certain location at the ancient race's territory, a green radiance covered everything. Lu Hun gazed at the sleeping lady beside him, and his expression was so unsightly it was scary. He had spent an entire year to change her mind. He had been kneeling to his master requesting for help to let her know that she was his wife. By way of memory recall, which wasn't as real as one experiencing it personally once again, more akin to a movie being played in one's mind, the lady had finally understood that she was the wife of Lu Hun. Only with this had Lu Hun gained the chance to get near her.</p><br/><p>After a year of begging, he had finally managed to persuade this lady to return to him. However, this lady had also put forth her requests. He was not allowed to touch her or do anything improper to her. All this he could accept. After all, the both of them had been together for countless years, and what was even more precious for him was the feeling between them. However, what Lu Hun couldn't accept was the fact that\u2026</p><br/><p>He raised his head, looking at the framed picture by the lady's bed. Within the frame was a picture of a youth whose laughter seemed rather cheerful. Mhm\u2026 this was a picture of Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>Lu Hun clenched his fist in anger to the point that he crushed his own bones. Was rebirth truly something so difficult? He had returned to the past, taking her to the future. Alas, her memories seemed problematic. Regardless of how many times he replayed the memories of their life together, in her heart, the hero on rainbow clouds that had saved her was still Chen Feng rather than Lu Hun. He had even tried erasing traces of Chen Feng from this lady's memory, yet he'd failed.</p><br/><p>This scared him greatly. This was because he had tried erasing memories of others before. With a simple tap, the memories of anyone would vanish without leaving a single trace behind. However, when it came to Chen Feng, regardless of how many times he attempted, he failed.</p><br/><p>\"Is it because Chen Feng's existence is too great, or is it my ability that's still not strong enough?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun felt doubtful, yet he did not linger much on these thoughts. It wouldn't matter. He only needed to kill Chen Feng before once again attempting to clear the memory. He was planning to personally make a move using the most direct method: killing Chen Feng before erasing all traces of Chen Feng's existence.</p><br/><p>He stood up and glanced at the sleeping lady. He was tempted to give her a kiss, yet from the corner of his eyes, he noted that the Chen Feng in the picture seemed to be smiling in a perverted fashion. Instantly, his expression darkened and he nearly smashed the picture.</p><br/><p>Hold it in, hold it in, Lu Hun warned himself. He was aware that the moment he did that, this lady would most definitely leave him resolutely. This tiny spark of hope he had obtained after one year of begging was not allowed to be spoiled in such a fashion.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He left the room. With an ugly expression, the diamond on his forehead shone green. At the door, the people from the ancient race were already waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\"Has the information been confirmed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. The traces of a big battle between the humans and devils is too obvious. Based on our investigation, among the humans heading toward the devil race is Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Very good.\" It was about time he dealt with this.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng, I shall be waiting for you!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

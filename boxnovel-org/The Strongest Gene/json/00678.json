The Genetic Union should be able to get this under control, right?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"Only for now\u2026 Presently, a lot of people have only just obtained strength. This is a period where everyone is still somewhat lost. There are also a bunch of people who are still focusing on training and fusing with their newfound strength. Those we have gotten under our control are merely those that are easier to find, those that do not know to conceal themselves. Those awakened ones that have hidden themselves are the actual terrifying ones.</p><br/><p>\"The moment they are done fusing with their new strength, the world will truly descend into chaos. Do not look down on awakened ones. Mysterious Town is not the only place with primordial fragments. There are also those experts in the resonance realm\u2026</p><br/><p>\"This world is laden with danger. The Genetic Union? They are incapable of putting everything under their control. Therefore, before these fellows start creating trouble, we must increase the number of experts in the Genetic Union and allow them to enter the awakened realm, to suppress those fellows by attacking first, ending any potential trouble in its infancy. Otherwise, if we truly wait until the world is plunged into chaos before acting, everything will already be too late.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was clear on what was to come. As part of the management for both the Genetic Union and the Gene Production Association, he possessed a complete intelligence report, helping him better deduce what was to come. That was also why he had to complete the production of this new gene reagent, even if the process would be laden with danger.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai sighed. \"We might not be able to even return.\"</p><br/><p>The idea Chen Feng had proposed to him was an extremely unreliable one: transmigration.</p><br/><p>That's right, transmigration. By transmigrating into the past, he would reactivate his Luck Aura. If this was the previous Chen Feng, they would have been able to transmigrate easily with the assistance of his Luck Aura. However, presently, Chen Feng's Luck Aura was not working at all. As such, they had no way of knowing where their transmigration might take them.</p><br/><p>The biggest flaw in Kong Bai's ability was the fact that he couldn't control the destination of his transmigration. Who could know where they would arrive by transmigrating randomly this way? Back then, he had drifted about numerous worlds for numerous years before he had finally been able to return. His heart ached at the mere thought of that experience. And now\u2026 Chen Feng intended to have him do that again.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai noticed the dilemma they seemed to be in. \"If you have had Luck Aura, we could transmigrate easily, but you do not. We can't control the transmigration. Yet this time, the very reason we even want to transmigrate is to recover your Luck Aura\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"Nevertheless, we still have to give it a try, right?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled bitterly. \"Fine.\" Now that the world was in danger, they had to do something. Wasn't it just transmigration?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai gnashed his teeth. \"Let's do it, then!\"</p><br/><p>\"I will take a trip to the Gene Production Association first.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng returned to the association immediately and gathered all the problems the masters there had encountered when researching the awakened gene reagent. These masters were truly extremely skilled, much more than Chen Feng was without his Luck Aura.</p><br/><p>Presently, after a period of bitter research, they were all stuck on some energy-related problems for the awakened gene reagent. They also required data from experiments that would require several hundred thousand attempts. If they continued researching normally, more than a hundred years would be required to complete this undertaking. Unfortunately, humanity could not afford to wait that long.</p><br/><p>After obtaining the data, Chen Feng and Kong Bai returned to the Genetic Union and selected several training rooms with the highest energy intensity to be used as the venue for their transmigration.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Kong Bai's blue ball appeared and hovered there, replenishing their energy without stop.</p><br/><p>\"Let's begin.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai inhaled deeply. He felt like this was the craziest thing he had ever done in his entire life. One ought to know that in the past, each time he had transmigrated, he had been near death, he'd had no other choices. But now, it seemed like he was taking the initiative to court death.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai sighed. \"What a crazy life.\"</p><br/><p>Light swirled around, and instantly, they vanished.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>At a certain unknown space, Chen Feng and Kong Bai appeared noiselessly. They didn't have a chance to get a clear look at this mystical alien world before they felt an intense killing intent engulf them from the darkness. This killing intent\u2026 contained a power far surpassing even an awakened one.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" Kong Bai howled in grief.</p><br/><p>Transmigrate!</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The two vanished once again.</p><br/><p>\"What was that?\" Chen Feng asked in astonishment by way of transmitting his thoughts directly to Kong Bai.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai felt helpless. \"How am I supposed to know?\"</p><br/><p>Based on his past experience when transmigrating, the first thing he had to do upon encountering such a powerful existence was immediately escape. Otherwise, if they delayed, they wouldn't be able to escape at all.</p><br/><p>\"Transmigrating is truly so scary?\" Chen Feng found this agreeable. He was certain that the aura they had felt earlier was far more powerful than that of an awakened one. Perhaps that was a realm above even the resonance realm, something that existed only in legends.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai shook his head. \"That's not the case all the time. Transmigrating to alien worlds will often lead to the appearance of numerous bizarre occurrences. Since each world has its own laws, at times, we will be the ones that are weakened instead. For example, in some worlds, your strength will be lowered ten thousand times. With that, the enemy only needs to be a B class to easily kill us both,\" Kong Bai explained helplessly.</p><br/><p>So that's the case.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng finally understood. There were indeed a lot of things to learn regarding transmigration.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled bitterly. \"In short, transmigration is a unique experience. It is much more bizarre than everything you have experienced\u2026 Therefore, the moment your Luck Aura recovers, you must immediately inform me. We will use Luck Aura to select a proper transmigration destination.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Understood.\" In the first place, this was their goal: to transmigrate without stop until they reached somewhere that Luck Aura was reactivated.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around as they transmigrated once again. This time, they felt their bodies reduce in size. Around them were numerous booming sounds and some oppressive sounding shouts, causing anyone listening on to feel repressed. Fortunately, they did not feel any sense of danger this time.</p><br/><p>When Chen Feng saw the familiar environment, he was shocked. \"Have we transmigrated into the belly of some animal again?\"</p><br/><p>\"I doubt it.\" Kong Bai shook his head, yet he felt somewhat doubtful as well. He had only transmigrated several times with Chen Feng in the past and had never entered the belly of an animal. Why had Chen Feng used the word \"again,\" then? Was there someone else capable of transmigrating? Just as Kong Bai wanted to voice his question, he felt an intense oppression rushing at him. When he looked around, he was instantly horrified.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes widened. \"Holy shit. This is\u2026\" They had obviously transmigrated into a certain organ of a certain female life form, transmigrating into a certain embryo, with the female life-form coincidentally giving birth at the same time as well.</p><br/><p>\"Leave, quickly!\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai activated his transmigration ability without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They vanished instantly.</p><br/><p>The same instant they left, the meatball-looking things around them gushed out along a certain tunnel before the howl finally settled down.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Chen Feng and Kong Bai were in the midst of transmigration, still shaken from their earlier experience.</p><br/><p>\"Has your Luck Aura activated yet?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nope.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why do I feel like without Luck Aura, you are totally a bringer of bad luck?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled bitterly. \"Hopefully, our next destination will not be dangerous.\"</p><br/><p>Right at this instant, white light appeared before them. Once again, they arrived on a new world. However, surprising them, the instant they completed the transmigration...</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Both Chen Feng and Kong Bai felt the world before them tightening. Their bodies and strength were still there, yet their physique became extremely weird, like they had both been flattened perfectly.</p><br/><p>This feeling was especially vivid for Kong Bai. His flattened face looked like the poster of some horror movie.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng blanked. \"Have we transmigrated into some cartoon world?\" He had never seen such an astonishing world. Could this truly be a cartoon world?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai shook his head. \"How is that possible?\"</p><br/><p>Cartoons were something created, not something that existed in real life. He had transmigrated countless times in the past and had never seen something like this. But then, the world before them indeed looked rather bizarre\u2026</p><br/><p>He tried looking up but couldn't see anything. He tried looking down, yet he couldn't see anything there either. No, he couldn't even raise or lower his head. No matter how he tried, he could only see his front, back, left, and right. The two exchanged glances before looking around. Suddenly, a terrifying thought surfaced. This place\u2026 was a two-dimensional world!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

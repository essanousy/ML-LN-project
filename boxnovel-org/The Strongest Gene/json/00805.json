From when they first met to when they finally fell in love with each other, slowly but surely, this young lady was imprinted upon Chen Feng\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart throbbed.</p><br/><p><em>Why did the memories about you suddenly go missing? Why did you suddenly go missing? Could it be\u2026</em></p><br/><p>The feeling known as fear suddenly surfaced. Those companies had all died, all traces of their existence vanishing with them. What of Wang Yao?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai seemed to have realized something as well. \u201cChen Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng maintained a calm expression. \u201cContinue watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The scene continued. The story of Chen Feng and Wang Yao continued. Both of them had their respective missions and goals. They were both sufficiently powerful, and thus, no problems ever emerged. This continued until one day when some companies vanished. These were the companies that had dispatched spaceships to outer space.</p><br/><p>It was also at that moment that the memories of the masses were influenced. Nobody else seemed to really remember the missing companies. The only exception was Wang Yao, who remembered everything clearly.</p><br/><p>One, two\u2026 and slowly, more and more companies vanished. In everyone\u2019s memories, only a couple companies had gone missing. However, Wang Yao knew that several dozen companies had actually gone missing. At one point, the missing companies surpassed a hundred. And thus, she decided to investigate this abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too dangerous for you to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are still needed here. Going to outer space will take too much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen get someone else to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. They will lose their memories as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Fine, how about this.\u201d Chen Feng decided to compromise. \u201cLet me open a case with the Genetic Union and deploy the strongest genetic warriors to go together with you. With all of you going together, I won\u2019t worry as much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Yao agreed with his proposal even though she herself was the strongest. Finally, she departed with the squad. She had to go, as she was the only one capable of keeping her memories intact. Thus, the squad was led by Wang Yao. Chen Feng had absolute faith in her.</p><br/><p>He was clear that his memories regarding these events were getting blurry as well. As such, he knew that this was something that had to be investigated. However, he had never expected that after Wang Yao\u2019s departure, his memories regarding this would gradually vanish as well. Slowly, he even forgot about Wang Yao\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng watched on silently, somewhat spellbound. Kong Bai wanted to comfort him but did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His Luck Aura operated and told Chen Feng the truth: Wang Yao was still alive. Due to that existence, his Luck Aura was incapable of determining Wang Yao\u2019s location or obtaining any specific information about her. However, Luck Aura indeed confirmed that Wang Yao was still alive. So long as she was alive, everything was fine.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s gaze intensified. So long as she was still alive, there was still hope.</p><br/><p><em>Outer space?</em></p><br/><p>His gaze shone with murderous intent as he thought of this. Everything he had, he had obtained from nothing, ultimately killing even the Sin God. Would he be afraid of this fellow? What he needed to find out now was that fellow\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, he focused his gaze on the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue playing. I want to know everything,\u201d Chen Feng said with a cold gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was as shocked as Chen Feng by what they saw next. So it turned out that the mysterious existence had even learned to make use of the companies and organizations of the human world to serve as his very own faction? He was too intelligent and scary. When facing the primordial existences, who would have guessed that the companies created by humanity would become this fellow\u2019s tools? Unfortunately, they were unable to see much.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to see.\u201d What they saw could only prove that the disappearance of the various companies might be related to that existence. How were they related was unknown.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng discovered an abnormality. \u201cSomething seems odd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai frowned. \u201cI feel the same.\u201d Everything seemed to be progressing too smoothly. After Wang Yao led a team to investigate, something happened. In short, this was the progression: Initially, they were of the opinion that accidents were the cause of all the disappearances. As such, they went ahead to investigate. Unexpectedly, they encountered an extremely powerful existence surpassing all beings. And thus, they all perished. This seemed to be a logical progression. However, they couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng asked, \u201cThe entire team similarly vanished abruptly, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kong Bai was sure of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf so\u2026 they must have used the communicator prior to disappearing, right? They would have been maintaining contact with the people of the Genetic Union as well, right? Even though everyone\u2019s memories regarding them slowly vanished after they went missing, prior to that, they were absolutely communicating with the Genetic Union, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly, Chen Feng\u2019s line of thought became clearer and clearer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Kong Bai confirmed. Outer space was too dangerous, after all. As such, they had maintained communication at all times with those on the planet. For this expedition, the Stormtech Company had even opened up a special communication channel for them. They had been able to broadcast their entire journey without stop. Everything should have been recorded.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was extremely satisfied with this answer. \u201cVery good. I want all that data, all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Kong Bai understood clearly. That\u2019s right. All those people had vanished, as had all the memories about them had vanished. However, whatever had happened prior to their disappearance should still be preserved in the form of data. By investigating the data, they could very well find out what exactly Wang Yao\u2019s team had encountered before their disappearance. Perhaps they could get a glimpse of the culprit as well.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The scene moved again. Rapidly, it rewound to the time before their disappearance at the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Wang Yao\u2019s team departed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the real-time connection been established?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the assistance of the Stormtech Company, a perfect connection had been established that would guarantee a flawless connection at all times. However, the instant Wang Yao\u2019s team left the atmosphere, the communication equipment and screens vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. Seems like everything has been influenced by something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell them to return immediately. The connection can\u2019t be maintained anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t contact them anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was going crazy. Just as they were about to send someone to bring Wang Yao\u2019s team back by force, suddenly, a boom resounded within all their minds. And then they forgot everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A blank expression was plastered on all their faces.</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Their communicators buzzed, updating them of a certain catastrophic event happening somewhere that required their support.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, something happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>And just like that, they busied themselves with the emergency request. As for Wang Yao and her companions, they were cleanly forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Kong Bai watched on silently. Everything seemed to be progressing logically, yet they still had an odd feeling, as if something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince everything vanished the instant they left the atmosphere, replay the scene from Wang Yao\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Kong Bai began operating his ability.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai frowned. \u201cWang Yao was influenced by some unique ability. I am unable to detect her.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, each time he had found Wang Yao previously, it had been through the memories of Chen Feng or others. As Wang Yao was alive, a unique power shielded her from his detection.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, detect Wang Yao\u2019s team members,\u201d Chen Feng said after giving it some thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Kong Bai tried to detect them. Alas\u2026 he failed. Some unique power seemed to be influencing those people, to the point that his powerful new ability and Chen Feng\u2019s Luck Aura failed to detect even Wang Yao\u2019s team members. They both exchanged glances, immediately realizing what the problem was. Those team members had been specifically shielded as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they all still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they are already dead, why are they still being shielded? The only way this scenario can happen is if the culprit is intentionally deploying the shield,\u201d Kong Bai said with a sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about their communicators?\u201d Chen Feng asked. As a human of the Genetic Era, it was impossible for there to be no data pertaining to those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai started investigating.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The scene jumped around. The data they were searching for finally appeared. Alas, it was completely blank. Before and after, everything was gone.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy this feeling. I feel like whatever we do, the opponent is always ahead of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the same feeling as well,\u201d Kong Bai agreed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng smiled. \u201cUnfortunately for him, everything is too flawless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled as well. \u201cYeah. He cleaned up too thoroughly.\u201d</p><br/><p>What if\u2026</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t come back into the past to investigate this, hadn\u2019t found out about Wang Yao and her team members, hadn\u2019t found their memories, hadn\u2019t found any news or data about them, they wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything wrong. The only thing they would have felt was fear toward this unknown enemy, fear toward his prowess, which left them with no chances.</p><br/><p>However, this was the past, and they had arrived here via Kong Bai\u2019s ability. And yet in the past, at a point in time even before Wang Yao\u2019s team disappeared, their data was already no more. Why? What was the single inconsistency here? The answer was very simple. Someone had deleted everything about them.</p><br/><p>This was quite an interesting clue. Because the opponent had cleaned things up too thoroughly, he had instead revealed quite a number of things. And thus, Kong Bai was able to keep investigating until they reach the origin of all this.</p><br/><p>Truthfully, investigating the truth by going back in time was extremely simple. So simple that they did not even dare to believe the truth they uncovered. And when they found out the truth, all their questions were answered.</p><br/><p><em>So it is actually you?</em></p><br/><p>What primordial powerhouse? What god from antiquity? No, it was none of those. The mastermind, the culprit behind everything, the one plotting everything to reach this step was actually a mere human, a human everyone knew!</p></div>\n</div>"}

Next\u2026</p><br/><p>\"You have failed your challenge and are currently in a weakened state. To maintain the stability of your spirit, we suggest that you stop continuing your challenges for now.\"</p><br/><p>Only now did that person realize that a weakened status effect had been applied to him.</p><br/><p>\"If you wish to continue the challenge, kindly proceed to the Illusion Paradise to temper your spiritual energy. Challenge attempts will be rewarded in accordance with the stability of your spirit.\"</p><br/><p>Illusion Paradise? And only now did they realize that the blue ball of light beside the first ball had been unlocked. That seemed to be the so-called Illusion Paradise.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go take a look.\"</p><br/><p>They stepped into the Illusion Paradise.</p><br/><p>Howl!</p><br/><p>Numerous howls resounded in the air.</p><br/><p>\"So it's these fellows?\"</p><br/><p>They gained understanding. The so-called Illusion Paradise was in fact an area filled with regular mutated beasts. This species of beasts existed in huge numbers everywhere. This species had strong reproductive capabilities and was hard to kill while also being noisy; they were hated by all. The only function of these beasts was to stabilize one's spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>\"This so-called illusion seems to be a mere tunnel.\"</p><br/><p>\"True. All these beasts are actual beasts rather than illusory beasts. We will have to stabilize our spirit here first.\"</p><br/><p>\"We can continue the challenge after stabilizing our spirit?\"</p><br/><p>\"That seems to be the case.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious. Having arrived at this place, everything was really happening rather than just happening in an illusory world. After all, this spirit art of Chen Feng's was merely forming an illusory world of light. The hunting of these beasts was the actual method of stabilizing their spiritual energy. Soon, after around 10 minutes of hunting, some of them recovered the stability of their spirit and were rewarded with a single challenge attempt.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm done.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm nearly done as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's go back and take a look, then.\"</p><br/><p>Once again, they resumed their challenge. Like they had previously, the opponent this time was one whose strength was similar to the challenger's. The opponent was still a crude silhouette of light. After failing the challenge, the user would still be inflicted with the weakened status effect.</p><br/><p>As for those who obtained victory in the challenge\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations, you have completed your challenge.\"</p><br/><p>\"Present access level: F class, 10/100.\"</p><br/><p>\"Once again, your spiritual energy is increased by one point.\"</p><br/><p>\"Present overflowed energy: \u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Distance from promotion into E class: \u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"After reaching E class, each victory will grant an increase of\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A row of data appeared, subtly tempting the user to continue the challenge.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like an unlimited increase is indeed possible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hold on, there seems to be a user manual here as well?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Someone opened the user manual.</p><br/><p>Within the user manual, the complete process for promotions from E class and beyond were listed. The higher the level, the more the increase would be. This seemed to be a system filled with temptation.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on. The level in the illusory world of the spirit art is different than one's level in the real world?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right.\"</p><br/><p>\"Since that's the case, if an E-class warrior were able to achieve a D-class access level in the illusory world, the amount of spiritual energy increase per victory would be\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At this thought, their hearts shuddered with excitement. Shortly afterward, they got a rather formidable F class warrior to test this out. Ultimately, this F-class genetic warrior was able to obtain an E-class access level in the illusory world. There, this person defeated his opponent. With the victory, he obtained an increase that was seemingly off the charts. Only several attempts were required before he was able to break through into E class for real in the real world as well.</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit!\"</p><br/><p>\"One's progress will be so excessively fast after one's access level has exceeded one's actual level in the real world?\"</p><br/><p>\"Good gracious!\"</p><br/><p>\"If everyone does the same\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They trembled in excitement. They now realized how heaven-defying this spirit art of Chen Feng's was. From F class, the user's improvement would be guided without stop, with the reward upon promotion serving as the unending temptation that triggered one to attempt the challenges without stop. Moreover, it seemed like such a method of improvement would not bring about any side effects or losses. The only exception was the so-called weakened state for failing a challenge.</p><br/><p>After some tests, they noted that this weakened state would be carried forward to the real world as well. However, one could get rid of this weakened state by battling and killing a mutated beast of a certain level. It seemed like this method of improvement truly had no side effects? The only thing one needed to waste was their time, nothing else. For genetic warriors, who thirsted for strength, this was not an issue. Therefore, nearly everyone immersed themselves within the world of Master Spirit Trainer.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, I have been promoted to E class.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Heh. Just you wait until I reach A class. At that time, I will be able to dominate everywhere.\"</p><br/><p>Countless people clamored without stop. Now, this Master Spirit Trainer became a must-have for everyone.</p><br/><p>Warriors of all classes, from F to A, started crazily grinding their level in the illusory world for the sake of obtaining a higher level in the world of the spirit art, to obtain greater increases in their spiritual energy. Everyone was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>\"This is truly deserving of the name 'spirit art'.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng is actually capable of creating an ability like this. How amazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"I heard that back then, he also gave a formula he created to the Gene Production Association for free. This person is honestly too kind. I only hope that he still has sufficient resources to research a new ability.\"</p><br/><p>\"True. I do not wish to see Chen Feng finished either.\"</p><br/><p>\"We all owe Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>Countless people rained praise upon Chen Feng. At present, the deputy president of the Genetic Union was filled with doubt. This did not seem like what he had been expecting. He had initially believed that for something this useful, Chen Feng would sell it at an extremely expensive price. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng had actually released it for free\u2014he wasn't accepting anything at all. Had he gone crazy?</p><br/><p>For an ability like this, it wouldn't be excessive to classify it as a beyond-A-class ability, yet Chen Feng had actually classified it as an F-class ability? What was he thinking? Nobody had any idea what Chen Feng was thinking. Even the deputy president started doubting himself, wondering if he had been too prejudiced against Chen Feng due to his history at the Gene Production Association. After all, Chen Feng was a person who had contributed greatly to humanity\u2026</p><br/><p>\"That's right. How could I think of him as such a person? Even if Chen Feng has that dark history, even if he has scammed countless people, even if he turned the Gene Production Association into his private property, his contributions to humanity are something one cannot erase. Perhaps I have truly misunderstood him.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president felt ashamed of himself. With the release of this super-powerful ability for free, he truly couldn't bring himself to continue blaming Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Lei found Chen Feng in his laboratory.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Even if you are performing charity, you don't have to do this, right? Do you have any idea how many points you could have earned if you sold this new spirit art? If you are too lazy to deal with the sales, you can get us to do it for you. Even if I'm only paid a 10% commission, you would still earn much more than what Time Quicksand made,\" Li Lei stated bitterly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.\"</p><br/><p>\"I really can't understand you.\" Li Lei sighed. \"You released this for free just to become famous? To obtain the praise of the public?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Chen Feng shook his head and asked, \"Have you heard of that saying?\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei blanked. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Free things are in fact the most expensive of all,\" Chen Feng stated calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Free\u2026 the most expensive of all?\" Li Lei was puzzled. He failed to understand the meaning of this saying, yet suddenly, a chill went down his back. This Chen Feng fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, as everyone was challenging the Master Spirit Trainer without stop, the first batch of users fully entered E class. With this, they noted with astonishment that one particular ball of light that had previously been sealed in grey was unsealed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Worthy of being the lord president indeed. With only a few minutes, he had been able to see clearly every aspect of Chen Feng's Master Spirit Developer. This strength of his was something they could only exclaim in admiration toward.</p><br/><p>The deputy president frowned. \"Is that really the case?\" At present, he still lacked understanding of this spirit art, since some time would be required for him to gain more understanding. However, he had a clear understanding of Chen Feng. That scammer\u2014oh, no, that fellow, would his methods only go this far?</p><br/><p>\"We still need to pay close attention to this,\" the deputy president reminded them.</p><br/><p>The president shook his head. \"Don't worry. After all, this is merely a child's toy.\"</p><br/><p>Deputy president: \"\u2026\" He had no choice but to have his underlings continue paying close attention to this. Would Chen Feng be so simple?</p><br/><p>Indeed, on the next day, after a group of people started getting a clearer understanding of all aspects of this Master Spirit Developer, they were all disappointed. That was because they had discovered that in essence, this thing was worthless. It was simply incapable of developing a true ability of practical use. In short, this was nothing but a toy.</p><br/><p>More and more people realized this. After the popularity of the Master Spirit Developer reached its peak, it stopped increasing. As for those who had placed high expectations on this Master Spirit Developer, their hearts chilled. Was this thing truly a mere toy? They had been hoping that this thing here would change their lives. For people in the lower rungs of society like them, this was akin to hope.</p><br/><p>Alas, their hope had only lasted one single day. They despaired, \"Why?\" Some even started scolding Chen Feng online, feeling like their dreams and hope had been mocked by Chen Feng. Unexpectedly, this negative promotion attracted more attention and managed to bring a short burst of popularity for this Master Spirit Developer. However, that was as far as it went. Everyone was aware that soon, the popularity of Master Spirit Developer would decline rapidly.</p><br/><p>\"This thing is going to die soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"There's no helping that. Since no proper abilities can be developed with this spirit developer, who will make purchases through this platform? Who can sell without buyers? At present, everyone is merely trying it out for the novelty of it\u2026 Once the novelty wears off\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The people of the Genetic Union watched on happily as all this happened. Something they had expected to be extremely frightening surprisingly died before it could even start posing a threat to them. Furthermore, Chen Feng's reputation was suffering as a result as well. After all, this spirit developer was being viewed as a scam. After this incident, would the masses still purchase Chen Feng's next spirit art the moment he released it? Mhm\u2026 this was quite the question. The Genetic Union enjoyed the show that was unfolding.</p><br/><p>At present, Li Lei contacted Chen Feng immediately after he realized what was happening, \"I'm afraid you are in trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was curious. \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>\"This Master Spirit Developer you released.\" Li Lei rolled his eyes. \"Even if the popularity of your Master Spirit Developer is still rather high presently, the popularity of this thing is like an arc. Soon enough, it will start dropping rapidly. Don't tell me you're not aware of this?\"</p><br/><p>The popularity of Master Spirit Developer had reached its limit at present.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled. \"I am aware of that.\" This Senior Li Lei was still as energetic as ever. For Master Spirit Developer to have reached its present height, it had truly relied on the curiosity of the masses and the sliver of hope it had brought the commoners. Naturally, the abuse he was receiving couldn't be forgotten either. At present, all the potential for this Master Spirit Developer continuing to grow in popularity had been exhausted.</p><br/><p>Without abilities of high quality on this platform, nobody would be purchasing anything. With that, the number of users would drop. With the drop in users, the number of developers would start dropping as well. Slowly, nobody would be using this platform anymore. Chen Feng was the clearest of all on how this all would work.</p><br/><p>He remembered how in his previous life, there had been one particular operating system he'd liked greatly, called Windows Phone. Just like that, the system had died. Naturally, he was quite curious about whether his bad luck during his previous life had had anything to do with the death of this system that he had liked so very much. That shouldn't be the case, right? In any case, Chen Feng would most definitely not follow in the footsteps of Windows Phone. After all, in this world, there were no competitors for this platform he had created.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit. Are you ready?\" Chen Feng looked at Spirit. Spirit was analyzing everything that had happened these two days.</p><br/><p>\"No problem,\" Spirit confirmed.</p><br/><p>\"Excellent.\" A smile formed on Chen Feng's face. \"Let's start, then.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light flashed past.</p><br/><p>At this time, just when the popularity of Master Spirit Developer had reached its limit and was about to drop, suddenly, the developer interface popped out. A new module was being installed.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Ability module</p><br/><p>Able to add on abilities that you already have.</p><br/><p>Requirement: Mastery over the ability one wished to add.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>They were all confused.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>\"What does this mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. Let me give it a try.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Someone attempted to add a basic fireball technique.</p><br/><p>Next, after the fireball combined with a certain dosage of the spatial module, the initially ordinary fireball technique was now able to teleport a short distance.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit, this is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Let me try the time module\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>As the fireball combined with the time module, suddenly, the fireball that was about 1.2 seconds away from reaching its target appeared right in front of the target. This seemed even more terrifying than the spatial version.</p><br/><p>Naturally, proper control was required to make use of this new ability effectively. Otherwise, if the module was applied too fast, the fireball would disappear immediately instead.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The entire world was in an uproar. Those with a clear understanding of how this Master Spirit Developer worked understood clearly what this new update signified. This signified that all abilities would have the potential to be transformed.</p><br/><p>\"Insane! This is insane!\"</p><br/><p>Their eyes became red.</p><br/><p>\"Good gracious!\"</p><br/><p>\"Spatial Fireball. I remember that for one to obtain this ability, one must have both spatial and flame genetic abilities, with both similarly trained to a certain extent before they could be fused in B class. But now\u2026 even an F class will be able to use this ability?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was going crazy. What was the concept of reducing the requirements of an ability from B class to F class? And this was merely a basic function of this Master Spirit Developer.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Master Spirit Developer started increasing in popularity yet again. Once again, it became the hottest topic, even hotter than when it had been first released.</p><br/><p>The reason for this explosive popularity? Those trash abilities that had been sold at 10 points per ability had all been cleared from the store. In their place, a bunch of genuine, powerful, and valuable spirit arts had appeared. For example, Spatial Fireball, Time Fireball, Devouring Waves, Tadpole Transformation, and so on. Numerous mystical and powerful spirit arts appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit arts! This is what real spirit arts should be like!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha, I knew Chen Feng wouldn't scam us.\"</p><br/><p>\"Future\u2026 this is where my future lies!\"</p><br/><p>Countless people immersed themselves in the world of spirit-art development. As for those headstrong and wealthy big shots, all of them waited with their purses ready for those brand-new and powerful spirit arts to appear. Once again, the system used by all of humanity underwent a change. The entire world changed.</p><br/><p>At present, the Genetic Union, who had been waiting for the death of Master Spirit Developer, was stunned. This seemed to be progressing differently from what they had expected.</p><br/><p>\"Let me take a look.\" The president, who was resting, entered the interface of Master Spirit Developer.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His eyes widened.</p><br/><p>This thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That moment when the president combined a minor E-class ability of his with the time module, when he saw the might of the developed ability\u2026</p><br/><p>The president left the world of Master Spirit Developer and said with a sigh, \"Prepare yourselves.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>They all blanked. Prepare for what?</p><br/><p>\"The entire world\u2026 is about to be transformed,\" the president muttered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Theoretically, as long as he had sufficient luck value, Chen Feng might be able to complete this research easily. However, theory was, after all, just theory. It was different from reality. In his previous life, Chen Feng had believed that as long as he had sufficient money, his bad luck wouldn't be that bad. With sufficient money, wouldn't he still be able to do as he wished? Alas, the reality of things was him being dirt poor even when he died. As such, in his present state, where luck value was a limited resource, he had to put in more effort as best as he could.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Name: Xu Fei</p><br/><p>Class: B</p><br/><p>Specialty: High endurance.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Before the test subject Chen Feng had invited arrived, he managed to get Xu Fei to join in the fun for a bit. In any case, due to the previous Star City battle, this fellow had been hanging around nearby at all times. Xu Fei's energy had only a single characteristic, yet with him, Chen Feng was still able to conduct numerous tests on a single type of energy. Presently, Chen Feng was trying to figure out how to make Xu Fei's energy lively.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng passed Xu Fei a pill. \"Eat this.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Fei was flabbergasted. \"What is this?\"</p><br/><p>\"A stimulant,\" Chen Feng answered honestly.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei swallowed the pill without hesitation. \"Fine.\" Shortly after, he became excited from the stimulation. As for Chen Feng, he was silently observing Xu Fei's state through the devices around him. The stimulant had indeed stimulated Xu Fei's physical body, turning his body lively, yet his energy still remained unmoving. This was a failure.</p><br/><p>Silently, Chen Feng recorded the data of this first test. No. 1, using RB stimulant to provoke the energy to become lively: failure. Test results as follows\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng continued with the second test. \"Take this.\" This time, a shiny blue pill that had been reinforced was given to Xu Fei. After taking it, Xu Fei's body indeed changed. Unfortunately, it still failed to change the state of his energy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng wasn't discouraged in the slightest. \"Again.\" Numerous stimulants, hormone injections, and even estrogen injections were given to Xu Fei. Everything Chen Feng could think of, he used.</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that Xu Fei had a unique physique with a high endurance and that he was able to resist such tests from Chen Feng. If it were someone else, that person would have begun suffering some negative effects long ago. Alas, all the attempts failed. Every gene reagent capable of provoking any sort of reaction from one's physical body only worked on one's body rather than one's energy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Indeed, it doesn't work.\" Since all drugs and gene reagents related to the physical body had failed, his next step was to conduct tests on the energy itself. However, the subsequent tests weren't something Xu Fei could help with.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's wristband buzzed. He glanced at it and smiled. He's finally here! Soon, an employee led a person to Chen Feng. As Chen Feng saw him, he was overjoyed and gave the newcomer a firm hug. With a smile, he said, \"Long time no see, Wang Chun.\"</p><br/><p>Indeed, the person Chen Feng had called over was Wang Chun.</p><br/><p>\"Oh. I heard that there was an important project to join. Therefore, I'm here.\" Wang Chun was rather excited as well. He had been training hard without stop, and finally, he had now reached B class. Unexpectedly, he was actually able to join an important project. This was, after all, the headquarters of the Genetic Union. This was a project concerning the survival of humanity itself! \"So, what can I help with?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Chun was filled with expectations.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng put on a grateful expression. \"Just summon all the ladies and that will do.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Wang Chun's expression darkened. In short, this experiment required the ladies rather than him?</p><br/><p>Wang Chun was somewhat distressed. \"Is there nothing that I can do?\"</p><br/><p>\"There is. Your job is to summon the ladies,\" Chen Feng stated righteously.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>No matter what, he was still a B-class warrior. He was not some lady summoner!</p><br/><p>\"Quick. My Xiao Ying is missing his wife already,\" Chen Feng stated playfully.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng!\" Behind Wang Chun, there was a flash of red. Next, a figure appeared, and a gaze filled with killing intent landed on Chen Feng. \"If you continue spouting nonsense out of your mouth, I will chop you down right this moment!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hand. \"It has been a while, my dear adorable Lady Ming Yue.\"</p><br/><p>Ming Yue: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This guy's face seemed even thicker nowadays.</p><br/><p>\"Here.\"</p><br/><p>A red blur flashed out of Chen Feng's hand, and Xiao Ying pounced at Ming Yue directly. Between Xiao Ying and Ming Yue, there was a rather bizarre connection.</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ying started swirling around Ming Yue cheerfully.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Although technically they were married, in truth, Xiao Ying was more like an adorable child. As such, Ming Yue couldn't bear to actually do anything to Xiao Ying. If it was Chen Feng pouncing at her instead, she would have given him a kick long ago.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right, where's Shen Yi and Shen Wei?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"Here.\" The two sisters appeared and greeted Chen Feng with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gasped in admiration. \"Wow, you sisters have gotten even prettier.\"</p><br/><p>Shen Yi smiled happily. \"Thanks.\"</p><br/><p>To the side, Wang Chun felt extremely sour. This was the reason he had been avoiding Chen Feng all this while. Why were his summons so friendly with Chen Feng? Wasn't he the actual master here?</p><br/><p>\"Eh, there's only three?\" Chen Feng was somewhat surprised. \"You are already B class, right? Aren't you supposed to\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light started assembling together.</p><br/><p>Two young ladies in maid outfits appeared. Both of them had the same appearance, the only difference being their hair. One had red hair, while the other had blue hair. Similarly, both were astonishingly beautiful, dream-girl material for nerds worldwide. Presently, the two were gazing lovingly at Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Indeed, after entering B class, Wang Chun had obtained two new summons. Mhm\u2026 another pair of beautiful sisters. Wang Chun's life was truly too good! Eh, hold on\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng sensed that something seemed off. Shouldn't these sisters be gazing lovingly at Wang Chun instead? He turned around and saw that Wang Chun had a bitter expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\"These two are\u2026\" Chen Feng asked curiously. Carefully, Wang Chun pointed in a certain direction. Chen Feng looked over and noted that it was Ming Yue he was pointing at.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue sneered. \"This palace master here is the master of the Demonic Palace. Therefore, it is natural that I have my imperial concubines.\"</p><br/><p>Im... imperial concubine? Chen Feng was dumbfounded. Only now did he recall that The Crystal Palace was a world where no males existed. But then, who said that females couldn't marry among themselves? This was especially true for a major boss character like Ming Yue. In a world where there were only females, it was extremely normal for females to marry each other. Even the characters in the book thought this way as well.</p><br/><p>If so, what was Wang Chun to them, then? An alien? Animal? Toy? Mhm, this was indeed a question worth contemplating. In short\u2026 mhm\u2026 Chen Feng looked at Wang Chun in sympathy.</p><br/><p>In other words, this fellow's harem had fallen into the enemy's hands? All the chicks he had painstakingly cultivated could very well fall into Ming Yue's hands? How lamentable. This harem-building youth that had once seemed so very amazing had indeed officially transformed into a lady summoner.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng patted Wang Chun shoulder with sympathy on his face. \"It has been hard on you.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Chun: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What could he say? He was very helpless as well. Now that all the ladies had been summoned, those Chen Feng required could be considered to have all arrived. Now, Chen Feng could start preparing for his tests. Xu Fei had helped complete the primary and also the hardest physical tests. The remaining energy tests would have to rely on these ladies with different energy characteristics. Only they could complete this part of the test.</p><br/><p>After being summoned into this world, regardless of what abilities they used, the energy used was the energy of this world. More importantly, they wouldn't die for real here in this world. This one point alone was already something nobody could compare with.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had been aware that the structural makeup of the energy would most certainly be different than before. He was also aware that the new energy had to have a structural makeup that was steadier and more complicated than before. But he had truly never expected that\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He looked at the energy. Under the device, it could be seen that some energy particles were assembled together. Occasionally, they would assume an S shape. At times, they would assume a B shape. These particles would move unendingly. Astonishingly, the new energy actually consisted of mobile energy particles. This was completely different from the particles of regular energy, which were immobile. These new energy particles were actually alive.</p><br/><p>Are you kidding me?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was dumbstruck. How was he supposed to study this?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng tried consulting Spirit. \"Spirit?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Spirit widened her eyes, evidently surprised by this as well. Both of them looked at each other; they were at their wits' end. The makeup of this new energy had evidently far surpassed their initial estimation. This was a makeup that they couldn't even begin to start analyzing. Even if Chen Feng was capable of dissembling the energy to assemble the particles into a certain makeup, he still wouldn't be able to create this new energy. That was because there was no fixed makeup for the new energy, as the particles were seemingly alive.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something. \"Perhaps these energy particles all share a common characteristic?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He started studying again. And next, after several minutes of observation, even his eyes started hurting. Several thousand completely different structural makeup were seen. Some were flat, some were three dimensional, some were mystical\u2026 and the only shared characteristic was that these particles were mobile. It seemed like, in the structural makeup of this new energy, all the particles were mobile. What to do, then? Chen Feng sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Our primary analogy is totally wrong. Although the analogy of gaseous substance and liquid form is rather similar to the case of the new and old energy, the essence of the new and old energy is completely different. Perhaps, 'beyond' merely signifies the transformation of the energy particles into something mobile.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, this idea surfaced in Chen Feng's mind. Naturally, he had only been studying Wang Yao's energy so far.</p><br/><p>\"Let's take a look at Qin Hai's energy.\"</p><br/><p>With excitement, he checked Qin Hai's energy. Shortly after, he sank into complete silence. If Wang Yao's energy was equivalent to a lively ocean, Qin Hai's energy was equivalent to a dead ocean. All the particles appeared dead. Let alone being mobile and lively, not a speck of vitality could be sensed from his energy particles.</p><br/><p>In short, the earlier hypothesis where energy particles needed to be made mobile was also incorrect? Chen Feng frowned. A regular person's energy particles were calm. As for Wang Yao, her energy particles were lively. As for Qin Hai, his energy particles were dead. But then, both of them were similarly beyond A class.</p><br/><p>If so, what did \"beyond\" entail, exactly? Chen Feng was unable to make sense of it. He required more beyond-A-class warriors for his research. Beyond A\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. This was too rare a resource. With the several tens of teams researching the concept of beyond at the same time, nearly all of the beyond-A-class experts available were already recruited to help. As such, the amount of beyond-A-class warriors available were definitely not sufficient.</p><br/><p>Therefore, their current situation was akin to the situation where the wolves were many but the meat was little. Chen Feng glanced at the numerous research projects that had been launched. Beyond A class's blood, body, semen, everything about them was being studied.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. \"How is this research on the power of beyond? This is clearly a human experiment. The only thing lacking is the test subjects being chopped into parts for testing.\" He was sure that the only reason these experts had been cooperating was because this was a project launched by Genetic Union. Otherwise, they would have started raging long ago. They had no choice but to do this, for humanity\u2026 Mhm, that had to be how they were rationalizing this.</p><br/><p>As such, these beyond-A-class experts could only hold their anger in and work with the researchers. However, Chen Feng was also aware that to guarantee the integrity and accuracy of the research, regardless of whether it was blood or other types of liquid, all had to go through tests. That was because, essentially, the body of said expert was a body that had formed the power beyond A class. As such, the body of the test subject would most certainly be the most important thing.</p><br/><p>For Chen Feng, thanks to Luck Aura, he had avoided wrong directions from the start of his research. With only several points of luck value, he had already ascertained the general direction the research should be heading: energy!</p><br/><p>Should he inform them, then? Chen Feng gave it some thought, but he shook his head in the end. Since he had no proof and could only tell them this was his guess, they would probably believe that Chen Feng was merely messing around with them. Perhaps they would even think that Chen Feng was trying to misdirect them.</p><br/><p>He was better off thinking about how to get more beyond-A-class experts to help him. One or two teams sharing a single beyond-A-class warrior was essentially something logical to do. However, if he wanted to analyze the energy of beyond-A-class warriors properly, that wouldn't do. A single beyond-A-class warrior would only have a single type of energy. With that, how was he supposed to progress in his research?</p><br/><p>As such, in the spirit of friendly cooperation, Chen Feng started requesting help from other research teams, requesting to borrow some beyond-A-class warriors for his energy research. As he had heard that a certain team had two beyond-A-class warriors for their research, Chen Feng went to them for help.</p><br/><p>They rejected him without any hesitation. \"No. Impossible. We don't even have sufficient research time for ourselves. How is it possible that we lend them to you?\" They were firm in their rejection. \"We will only agree if you trade your beyond-A-class warrior with us.\" The other person chuckled.</p><br/><p>Trade?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at their research subject and noted that the majority of their tests would involve the private parts of a genetic warrior. Instantly, his leg kicked out. \"Screw you!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The researcher was flung away by Chen Feng's kick.</p><br/><p>Although Chen Feng's strength was nothing special, he was certain that among all researchers, he was the strongest fighter! And among all proper genetic warriors, he was also the best researcher! And now, these folks were thinking of taking advantage of Wang Yao?</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Complain! I am launching a complaint against him!\" The researcher was furious. This was too excessive! Pressing his hand on his belly, he scrambled up with difficulty. He was truly exasperated at Chen Feng's action. Why did there exist such a person that resorted to physical actions immediately after a disagreement? Was this fellow still a researcher? How was he different from a thug?</p><br/><p>Alas, if even fights between researchers was something the Genetic Union needed to moderate, they would be truly too busy. As such, so long as nobody was killed, it was likely that nobody would be bothered with him.</p><br/><p>\"Calm down, Old Xu. Calm down. That's Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"So what if he's Chen Feng? What, he thinks he's amazing just because he participated in the Star City battle? Which of us here is without any contributions? The amount of contributions I made in the form of research is no lower than his. What gives him the right to kick me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026 calm down. This isn't anything serious anyway.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean this isn't serious! Don't look at my appearance that looks fine. You have no idea how hard he kicked earlier. My belly is in great pain now.\"</p><br/><p>\"His identity is not so simple.\"</p><br/><p>\"Which of us selected to be here has a simple identity? Which of us has no backers?\"</p><br/><p>His entire body was still aching. From Chen Feng's kick, a bizarre energy had been transmitted into his body, causing a great vibration within his body that made him feel incredibly awful. Furthermore, his teeth suddenly felt like they were loosening up and were about to fall.</p><br/><p>He raged. \"Chen Feng\u2026 I shall remember this.\" Unfortunately for him, nobody cared about him. Presently, Chen Feng was still busy thinking of a solution for his dilemma.</p><br/><p>He pondered. \"Seems like asking the teams directly won't work.\" If this was a normal research, it would be rather normal for different teams to exchange their test subjects to prove their theories. But then, this wouldn't do for him. First, the test subject was his little wife. Second, the other teams were not extracting only energy for research like him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. \"Well, looks like I have to think of something else, then.\" Perhaps\u2026Old Man Hou could be of some help? Chen Feng thought.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

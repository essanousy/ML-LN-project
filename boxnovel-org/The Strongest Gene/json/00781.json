Put your clothes back on,\u201d the god\u2019s descendant spat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Rong hurriedly put her clothes back on. Alas, a huge portion of her clothes had been torn. She had no choice but to form a new set of clothes with her godly power. Even now, she was still stupefied. During the process of the deed, she had not even been able to react. If not for the disgusting fluid on her, the lingering smell in the air, and the searing ache she was feeling, she wouldn\u2019t even know what had happened.</p><br/><p>That fast guy\u2026 As she thought of what had happened, she was filled with regret. Why had she decided to use her charm on him? What had happened here had been witnessed by a huge number of people. At present, they all had odd expressions, especially the other gods\u2019 descendants. Almost immediately after, they told their female followers to conceal themselves.</p><br/><p>What kind of joke was this? That was too excessive. There was actually such speed in this world? However, after this incident, they had truly recognized the severity of such a thing. That fast guy was approaching the end extremely quickly speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow must be stopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is too scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this speed, he will most certainly be the first to arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe entered this world later than us, yet he is already at the very front of the race. Apart from some of the gods\u2019 descendants and their followers that are still ahead of him, there is no longer anyone capable of stopping him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this divine seat be given to him just like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was making all the apostles uncomfortable. They had to stop that fast guy, yet how were they supposed to stop him? This was quite the thorny issue. There were a few gods\u2019 descendants with female followers who were gifted with charm or similar abilities. However, after the previous example, not a single one of them would be willing to do so even if they were beaten to death. How about control-related abilities? It was rather unfortunate that none of them could get near enough to use such abilities on the fast guy.</p><br/><p>The apostles were all concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>A youth who appeared to be 14 years old stepped out. \u201cHow about I give it a try?\u201d He looked scarily young, yet he was without a doubt a level 15 apostle.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the other apostles shone as they heard what he said. \u201cYou have a way to deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, the young apostle said, \u201cI do have some ideas. However, I will have to try to know if they will work. Carve out some words for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other apostles were curious. What was the point of carving out words?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all will know soon enough,\u201d the young apostle said in an enigmatic manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other apostles started to help him. Naturally, the so-called \u201cword carving\u201d was not carving in a regular sense. Rather, this was the act of carving immense words on the mountains, guaranteeing that the fast guy would be able to see the words being carved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was still filled with doubt. Not a single one knew what his plan was. As all this was happening, the fast guy, who had already traveled far ahead, was feeling extremely refreshed and comfortable.</p><br/><p>Earlier, when he had been charmed, he had believed that that would be the end of him. That was why he had decided to throw caution to the wind and go \u201cenjoy\u201d himself with the lady. Unexpectedly, he had been met with a pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it turns out the power of charm fills the target with the flame of desire. Mhm\u2026 Therefore, so long as the desire is satisfied, one will return to normal.\u201d The fast guy was overjoyed at this discovery. He had never expected to solve the riddle of countering charm abilities by complete accident. One ought to know that, as the fastest apostle, what he feared most was falling under another\u2019s control. Therefore, he normally did his best to avoid everyone. Now, though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in the future, I can be considered to be somewhat immune to charm abilities. Whoever has galls to charm me, I will do her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was joyfully satisfied. As for whether what he had done was an act of provocation toward those gods\u2019 descendants, he had no fear. So long as he could ascend to godhood in this trial, with the rule put in place by the Sin God that forbade gods killing each other, they would not be able to do anything to him. At most, they would only be able to restrict the amount of faith he obtained.</p><br/><p>Even so, so what? Even the lowest of gods was better off than an apostle.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>With a flash, he vanished. His target was still the same: the end of this world. However, after only a short while, he saw numerous words being carved on the huge mountain range before him. Even with the speed he was traveling at, he could not ignore the words, as they were directed at him.</p><br/><p>The cold words could be seen clearly: \u201cDo you think you are truly immune to the power of charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fast guy\u2019s heart trembled as he saw these words. So some other people were trying to intercept him? Moreover, it seemed like they were going to use the power of charm on him? Hmph. What was there to fear? With his speed\u2026</p><br/><p>The fast guy laughed with a perverted expression on his face. \u201cSince you guys insist on inviting the wolf into the group of lambs, do not blame me for what I am about to do.\u201d The pleasure he had enjoyed during that half-second deed was still fresh in his memory. However, after a step forward, he saw another row of words. \u201cDo you think that only pretty ladies can use the power of charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>The fast guy\u2019s heart thumped violently as he saw these words. All pretty ladies? Evidently, that was not the case. In fact, there were quite a few believers of charm-related godly powers that possessed rather ordinary looks, and there were some that were quite ugly as well.</p><br/><p>The fast guy clenched his teeth. \u201cIt does not matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, after the power of charm took effect on him, whoever he saw, that person would appear unprecedentedly beautiful. This was the essence of the power of charm, a power that would bring one into the land of fantasy uncontrollably. So what if the user of the power was an ugly person? With a clench of his teeth, it would already be over.</p><br/><p>However, when he reached the next mountain range, he hissed in horror. That was because the words carved here were thus: \u201cDo you think only females will use the power of charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, the fast guy was horrified. It couldn\u2019t be, right? No, no way. Among the apostles that were participating in this trial, those equipped with the power of charm should all be female. Furthermore, it was said that the god that presided over the domain of charm was extremely strict when accepting believers. The physical appearance, voice, and body shape of the believers had to be of top quality to be accepted.</p><br/><p>Therefore, that god would most certainly not select ugly and scary-looking fellows as believers. This had to be the case. Whoever had carved these words, that person had to be trying to deceive him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no way. Absolutely impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>As he reached the next mountain range, yet another row of words appeared: \u201cDo you think that only those of a single race can use the power of charm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>The fast guy\u2019s expression changed drastically. Race? True. Not all races had resembled the gods. Even though the large majority of the apostles resembled gods, some races were rather different. For instance, the giant-elephant race, or the spirit-snake race. What if the charm user happened to be from one of these races?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Horror was plastered on the fast guy\u2019s face. On the next mountain range, a figure could be seen floating in the air. An oddly shaped figure could be vaguely seen, seemingly waiting for his approach. So long as he approached, he would most definitely be charmed by this figure. However, this was the only path forward.</p><br/><p>That figure\u2026 The fast guy was extremely alarmed. At this point, he was already clear on what exactly it was that was waiting for him. This was most certainly an odd-looking, ugly male apostle of an unknown race with a terrifying body. And this person was also a user of the power of charm.</p><br/><p>The fast guy did not even have the courage to imagine what would happen if he advanced forth. But\u2026 he was already so near to godhood. Did he truly have to stop here?</p><br/><p>As the fast guy approached, the figure\u2019s appearance became clearer and clearer. He could already picture how scary this person was. He had already started imagining how terrible his fate would be upon his arrival. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do it.\u201d He clenched his teeth and decided to continue charging forth. \u201cI will just close my eyes. It will be over in the blink of an eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He streaked forth. Indeed, as soon as he entered the effective range, he started to lose consciousness. He could feel the boundless godly power of charm engulfing him. This was exactly as he had guessed. As for the person before him, it was most certainly an extremely ugly one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarling, here you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the fast guy could even focus, an immense force could be felt pulling him into an embrace. After half a second, after the fast guy had \u201cleft his seed,\u201d he fled in horror. Only after he was free of the power of charm was he able to see clearly what exactly he had encountered earlier. That body\u2026 and that ugliness\u2026 nearly caused him to vomit up everything he had eaten from his birth until now. This feeling was especially pronounced when he recalled the sight of that person lying on the ground with a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cUrghhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fast guy sped forth while he vomited. Far away, the observing apostles were completely stunned. Instinctively, they all looked at the young apostle. At this moment, that young apostle had a stupefied expression as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that\u2026 he would stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the other apostles heard this, they focused and took a good look at the charm user. The moment they got a good look, they all started to vomit as well. The fast guy\u2026 would even do it with this fellow?</p><br/><p>The young apostle sighed. \u201cI have underestimated his desire for godhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>At present, he held the deepest respect for the fast guy. After all, that person was willing to do that deed even with such a person. The other apostles had a similar feeling as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man has never admired anyone, yet this time, I truly can\u2019t stop myself from admiring that fast guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, nothing is impossible in life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone even patted the young apostle\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYou tried your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young apostle: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The speed with which it moved was so fast that even the beyond A classes weren't able to react to it in time. They were given a fright by this sudden attack.</p><br/><p>\"Who is it?\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions changed. All the experts arrived at the crash site and surrounded that clump of light that had descended. However, when they arrived, the clump of light was no longer there. Instead, a familiar silhouette could be seen.</p><br/><p>Their eyes widened abruptly. \"Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>\"You are still alive?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president was overjoyed. Since Chen Feng was still alive, things might not take a turn for the worse. No matter what happened, even if Chen Feng had indeed killed Qian Chen and Si Fan, so long as he made up some random excuse, the Genetic Union would dare to stand by his side in full force. Chen Feng's existence was much more important for humanity than some random families.</p><br/><p>Alas, the deputy president wasn't the only one who started having second thoughts at the sight of Chen Feng. The families of Qian Chen and Si Fan exchanged glances and shivered. If Chen Feng was still alive\u2026</p><br/><p>A shout resounded. \"Chen Feng, you dare kill the heir of our Qian family?\" Instantly, the people of the Qian family moved against Chen Feng. Regardless of the reason for what had happened, so long as they killed him\u2026</p><br/><p>The deputy president raged. \"You dare?\" He had never expected that the people of the Qian family would dare make a move here.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power erupted. The deputy president made a move but was held down by some other person. Numerous cold flashes streamed toward Chen Feng. Each of the flashes contained the power of a peak beyond A class.</p><br/><p>The deputy president's heart chilled. \"It's over.\" He had never expected that Chen Feng would appear here directly before the people of the Qian family. This was no different than delivering his own head to them. At this time, from Chen Feng's point of view, he had just returned to this world together with Kong Bai. Next\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bunch of attacks smashed right into his face.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Everyone: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"This is too excessive.\" With an ashen expression, Chen Feng threw all those attacks off.</p><br/><p>The beyond A classes around were staring dumbstruck at Chen Feng as they saw that those attacks that were supposed to insta-kill Chen Feng failed to even pierce his face. What was going on? They had no idea. This did not seem right.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at a certain expert of the Qian family. \"Are you the one who sent that attack?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\" That person frowned. He believed that there had to have been some sort of mistake earlier. Without hesitation, he unleashed his trump card. Once again, a powerful force erupted and streaked at Chen Feng. Next\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a single sudden kick, that person was flung away and smashed into the wall of the Genetic Union, his body embedded deep in the wall.</p><br/><p>!!!</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Holy shit!</p><br/><p>This time, even the deputy president was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>The people of the Qian family raged. \"You\u2026 seize him!\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president wanted to help, but he was stopped by other Genetic Union members because they had noticed that something did not seem right. Chen Feng's strength\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Chen Feng's movement speed was off the charts. He wasn't even using any techniques or abilities. Rather, he only casually sent out some random kicks, and with that, numerous figures were flung away, all embedded in the wall. Everyone lapsed into silence. At this time, the legs of the people from Si Fan's family went limp. Their instinctive response was to make their escape.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>With a kick from Chen Feng, even they no longer had the chance to escape.</p><br/><p>Beyond A1?</p><br/><p>Beyond A2?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even beyond A5 warriors were sent to the wall with a single kick from Chen Feng. The only person among the family that hadn't moved was watching on while both his legs shivered as Chen Feng sent one member of his family after another into the wall. Finally, as he saw that Chen Feng was heading toward him, he howled abruptly, \"Hold on.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stopped and looked at him coldly.</p><br/><p>He gave Chen Feng a deep gaze and sorrowfully said, \"I... shall do it myself.\"</p><br/><p>Finishing his words, he turned around, faced the wall with his back, and pushed backward with his foot.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He was embedded onto the wall as well.</p><br/><p>At this point, on the other side of the wall, the young lady on duty in the Genetic Union noticed with horror that presently, a hole had appeared in the Genetic Union's thick wall.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What an astonishing way of doing things. Kong Bai gave the hole a glance and clicked his tongue in wonder. \"This length\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president gulped. \"Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Hello. Sorry, we were late.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president pointed at the \"mural\" on the wall, Chen Feng's masterpiece. \"Your strength\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not say much. \"Somewhat increased.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng?\" One of the characters of the \"mural\" in the wall dug himself out of the wall, leaving a \"\" shape. With dust all over his face, he glared furiously at Chen Feng. \"After killing the heir of our Qian family, you are still so unbridled? Do you really think that the Qian family is a pushover? Heh. Seeing how you can defeat all of us, it seems like you broke through at the training camp? Let's see. As a mere B class, you were actually able to reach A class so easily, and to be such a powerful A class at that, all this should be thanks to the training camp, right? Hehe. Yet Qian Chen and Si Fan, who should have similarly broken through at the camp as well, did not return alive\u2026 With your improvement being so great\u2026 hehe. It seems like you had all the valuable resources there for yourself. Everyone says that you are a selfless person; from the looks of it, you are instead a selfish person. To hog all the resources for yourself, you killed the two of them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He glared resentfully at Chen Feng. The others around them gave this some thought and concluded that this was quite possibly what happened.</p><br/><p>Instinctively, they all looked at Chen Feng. Surprisingly, Chen Feng did not bother explaining himself. He merely looked at that person, a faint smile on his face. \"To throw such accusations at someone who is also part of the Genetic Union's management, where's your proof?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the truth. What proof do I need?\" that person howled.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved casually. \"Is that so?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous red flashes appeared in midair. Xiao Ying started traveling constantly between the illusory and physical world, playing the scenes of what happened with Qian Chen and Si Fan back then.</p><br/><p>\"Do you want to experience the devotion of your heir?\" Chen Feng asked with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>That person's heart chilled.</p><br/><p>As for the deputy president and the rest, they were furious. So it turned out those two were the ones who had caused trouble? The people they had sent to protect Chen Feng had turned out to be followers of the ancient race!</p><br/><p>\"Damn it.\" The killing intent of the deputy president surged. \"Start an immediate investigation on everyone. The person in charge of the training camp, the people who sent Qian Chen and Si Fan, and those who recommended them, investigate all of them!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for you guys\u2026\" The deputy president's gaze swept past those people. \"Actually daring to attack a member of the Genetic Union's management here at the Genetic Union? You deserve death! Kill!\" the deputy president spat coldly. Previously, the Genetic Union had only been holding their hands for the sake of the bigger picture. Did these people believe that the Genetic Union was a pushover?</p><br/><p>That person was alarmed. \"You dare?\"</p><br/><p>Alas, the experts of the Genetic Union had already taken action.</p><br/><p>A shout resounded from the empty air. \"Please hold your hands.\"</p><br/><p>A powerful aura appeared, ripping apart space and creating a hole in the air. Next, an immortal-like figure stepped out of the hole one step at a time. This was the strongest expert of the Qian family: Qian Liexian.</p><br/><p>The deputy president's face became gloomy. \"He has actually come as well.\" This person was a peak beyond A class. Unexpectedly, this person had also arrived here.</p><br/><p>\"Please have mercy.\" He stepped forth on the empty air, a remarkable aura about him. Alas, at the last instant before he fully left the hole, Chen Feng's figure flickered and reappeared near the hole. With a big kick, before Qian Liexian could even react to it, he was kicked back to where he had come from. Next, a gush of energy surged out of Chen Feng's hand and forcefully blocked the spatial hole.</p><br/><p>Qian Liexian: \"???\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else was dumbstruck. This worked?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

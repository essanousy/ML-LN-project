This thing was already so powerful by merely attaching to a random life-form. If it is able to once again latch on to a life-form, I suppose we will all be finished here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Destroy it.\"</p><br/><p>The rest were in agreement with this. None of them were idiots. They were naturally aware that this leopard was a life-form of the Genetic Era, yet it had been able to reach the resonance realm. Why was that? Due to the stone, obviously. This stone would at first seduce others by promising strength, but in the end, others would be controlled by it. This was truly what one could call the devil's seduction. The victim would still innocently believe that after their strength increased, they would still remain themself, but in fact, the victim was already under the stone's control.</p><br/><p>Thomas inhaled deeply. \"We have seen way too many similar situations in the past.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Liang had a resolute expression as well. \"This thing\u2026 must be destroyed!\" Charming was one of the most terrifying abilities in existence, even back in the Primordial Era.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The both of them moved at the same time. Alas, right as their attacks were about to land, a figure flashed past and snatched the stone away. That person was actually Sakata Chuunibyou!</p><br/><p>Everyone was furious. \"Have you gone crazy?\" None of them had expected that Sakata Chuunibyou would make a grab for the stone. Due to the scary nature of the stone, none of them coveted it anymore. Shouldn't everyone be avoiding that stone instead? Why had this Sakata fellow gone and grabbed the stone? What if the two were to fuse? Their hearts chilled; they were unwilling to face the new Sakata after fusing with the stone.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou smiled. \"Don't worry. I'm not that stupid.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He stretched his hand out. Only at this did everyone see that although he was holding the stone, there was a thin layer of energy shrouding the stone. That was dimensional godly power!</p><br/><p>Their expressions became unsightly. \"For you to still have so much strength left in you.\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou sneered. \"Does the same not apply to all of you? A mere leopard, despite its high realm, it will still be a trash after its godly power was sealed. Killing it will definitely require some effort, but not so much. You guys have secretly preserved so much of your strength.\" Sakata Chuunibyou stretched his hand out toyingly, showing the stone shrouded by a faint radiance and said, \"Is it not for the sake of obtaining this stone?\"</p><br/><p>Thomas laughed dryly. \"Hehe. Why would I even want this stone?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why else?\" Sakata Chuunibyou said with an amused expression. \"Although this is an evil item, it is, after all, still the item of a god. If its consciousness is erased, it can still be used. Or perhaps it can also be used to directly awaken a god. I reckon Lord God will be able to deal with the evil being residing within, am I correct?\"</p><br/><p>The rest exchanged glances. Instantly, the mood became tense.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What the hell. This plot seemed rather wrong?</p><br/><p>In his initial plan, everyone should have worked together to kill the leopard and destroy the stone before leaving. Perhaps they could even exchange their contact details or something. Perhaps a close friendship could be developed. But now\u2026 Indeed, Chen Feng had been too naive in his thinking. He smiled bitterly as he realized this.</p><br/><p>Thomas stopped hiding his intent. \"Do you believe that you are actually capable of taking it away? Although we can't physically touch this thing, if preserved and used as an offering to Lord God, he would most certainly like this gift.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ceh.\" Sakata Chuunibyou sneered. \"Yeah, I will not take it away. Would you dare take it even if I gave it to you?\"</p><br/><p>He tossed the stone to Thomas.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Thomas avoided the stone immediately, afraid of coming into any sort of contact with it.</p><br/><p>In an unhurried manner, Sakata Chuunibyou recollected the stone. \"See. At present, I am the only person capable of holding this thing. Your respective powers are only suited for battle. They are not capable of taking this stone away. Do you all truly believe that this thing will stay here obediently and wait for you guys as you leave and return after fully preparing\"</p><br/><p>The godly power of the Sword God swirled around Wu Liang as he said, \"What do you propose, then? Since we can't take it, the only option is to destroy it.\"</p><br/><p>\"What if we split it evenly?\" proposed Sakata Chuunibyou.</p><br/><p>\"Split?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Do you guys still remember the forest we passed earlier? There, leaves capable of blocking godly power can be found. We can wrap leaves around the stone after splitting the stone evenly, each of us getting a chunk. What do you guys think of this?\" Sakata Chuunibyou proposed unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>The rest exchanged glances. \"That's feasible.\" Rather than continue fighting here for an uncertain result, they might as well split it evenly. After all, they were merely the first batch of resonators here. If after this, some other resonators reached here, things might get even more chaotic.</p><br/><p>Finally, they decided to split the stone evenly. Chen Feng heaved a sigh of relief, as this development was acceptable for him as well. The moment the stone was destroyed and split into five, the consciousness would vanish as well. At that time, the one-fifth of the stone he got would be able to help increase his strength. This could be considered a perfect closure for him as well.</p><br/><p>Alas, beyond his expectations, at this time, everyone's gaze landed on him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at them curiously. \"What's up?\"</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao looked at Chen Feng with an odd gaze. \"I thought of something. How strong is the power of luck, exactly, for it to be able to seal the godly power of others? Since you are able to seal the power of others, you can naturally seal our powers as well, right?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Chen Feng uniformly. This was the problem they were thinking of as well. Sealing\u2026 was an extremely terrifying ability. Why had that leopard died so fast? Because its godly powers had been sealed. Throughout the fight, they hadn't seen the leopard's godly power once.</p><br/><p>In this battle, who had played the crucial role? Chen Feng! His power was way too powerful, so powerful that they were all fearful of him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at them all, dumbstruck. \"Ah\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hold on\u2026 these guys are now all fearful due to me being too strong? Dang, I have been lying all along, okay? The leopard's godly power was the power of luck. Why else was it able to evolve continuously? It used its godly power to increase its strength! For an ordinary leopard to reach the resonance realm, it was all thanks to godly power, right? This has nothing to do with me! I am truly only lying here! The reason you guys were able to defeat that leopard is that you guys are indeed amazing! For real!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng realized something: he had gone overboard when acting tough!</p><br/><p>What was it that these resonators all prided themselves in? Their godly power! They were capable of borrowing the power of a god!</p><br/><p>At this time, if someone capable of sealing godly powers were to appear, this would be sufficient to alarm all of them, even if Chen Feng had not done anything thus far. His previous performance alone was sufficient to cause them all to be on alert.</p><br/><p>Naturally, if he told them the truth now, he would probably suffer a miserable death.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into contemplation. Let me think about it\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"How is it that easy to seal godly powers? It only worked because the opponent's power is related to charm, which has probabilities of success and failure.\" He tried to downplay the power of luck. \"Such a power is countered by the power of luck. That's all there is to it.\"</p><br/><p>\"All godly powers have a possibility of failure during release, as a mere lack of concentration will be sufficient to cause failure. In short, you only need to use your luck power to cause us to stop paying attention, and next, you will be able to seal any godly power you wish to?\" Wealthy Zhao said pensively.</p><br/><p>The rest were immediately on high alert.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"How are things so easy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Are things really not so easy?\" Sakata Chuunibyou had a faint smile. \"Yet earlier, despite how powerful that leopard was, you had it completely sealed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, to seal it, I exhausted\u2014\" Before he could finish his sentence, he stopped.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At this time, Wu Liang and the rest started smiling.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"So you guys were waiting for me to say this.\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou gazed at Chen Feng. \"That's right. At the start, everyone was vigilant toward each other, not daring to pry into others. Now that the battle has ended, after studying you with my godly power, I noticed that you don't have any godly power left. Therefore, I suspect that during the earlier battle, all your godly power was exhausted.\" Sakata Chuunibyou looked at Chen Feng with a proud expression. \"Indeed\u2026 my guess is correct.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng calmed down. \"Therefore\u2026 there is no longer any worth for me to further exist?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your power is way too terrifying\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"That major war only erupted during the Primordial Era due to the godly power of luck pushing toward it happening in secret. Otherwise, a war between the gods would not result in both sides being eliminated together\u2026 From this, the prowess of the power of luck is apparent. If we can destroy you right now\u2026 hehe. The Luck Goddess will appear much later due to that. Do you understand now?\" Sakata Chuunibyou licked his lips.</p><br/><p>The rest looked at Chen Feng with burning gazes.</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Chen Feng finally understood everything.</p><br/><p>First, they would be able to obtain a bigger share after killing him.</p><br/><p>Second, his ability to seal powers truly frightened them.</p><br/><p>Third, he had seemingly exhausted all his godly power during the battle earlier.</p><br/><p>Fourth, due to the events of the past Primordial Era, they were all rather fearful of the godly power of luck.</p><br/><p>Fifth, they wanted to delay the appearance of the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Each of these reasons to kill Chen Feng were rather weak, but when all five were combined, killing Chen Feng became a must. Therefore, these old foxes had decided to act on it with no hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

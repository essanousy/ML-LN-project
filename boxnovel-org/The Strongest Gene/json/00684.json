Perhaps this template was the true self, the true form of a person after awakening. If so, things were much more understandable.</p><br/><p>Well then\u2026 if genes were produced for that miniature person instead, perhaps there would be a brand-new world? This would absolutely be a brand-new domain.</p><br/><p>Shall I try it out?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng regarded the miniature him. This miniature person was not an energy body, nor was it the body of flesh from before. Rather, this was a unique body of consciousness. Perhaps one could regard this body as something that came into existence after a person's consciousness surpassed the realm of the fleshly body. Chen Feng contemplated. If things continued this way, perhaps the next realm would be godhood ascension.</p><br/><p>Spirit was puzzled. \"What is godhood ascension?\" She felt like this master of hers had way too many bizarre and unknown terms in his brain.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Chen Feng did not explain. \"Come, Spirit. Help me research a new gene production techniques.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Spirit paused and asked curiously, \"If we are researching something that can be used on an awakened one, it will be completely unrelated to genes, right? This should be a brand new discipline rather than gene production, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Chen Feng was naturally aware of that. Truthfully, this new research would be unrelated to genes. However, looking at all those old and gray-haired gene producers, Chen Feng had decided to retain the word gene and called this a new gene production technique.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"We have to give them hope, right? These master producers are all extremely experienced and strong. As such, the development and meticulous study of this new discipline will still rely on them. If so, should we tell them that in fact, this new production technique is no longer related to genes? Telling them that the gene production techniques they have spent their entire lives dedicated to are on the verge of extinction? They will not be able to face this fact, nor will they want to face this fact.\" Chen Feng sighed. \"Therefore, calling this new discipline a new gene production technique is the best choice, for both them and me.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded. \"Wu.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then let us begin.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Spirit started studying this miniature person.</p><br/><p>This was supposed to be an extremely difficult process. However, thanks to the illusory world Chen Feng already possessed because of his Luck Aura and Spirit's assistance, the research wasn't particularly hard for him.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Spirit could even touch the miniature person directly. After all, they were both similarly bodies of consciousness. As such, it wasn't a problem for Spirit.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had an odd expression. \"Cough, cough. Don't touch around.\"</p><br/><p>Every place Spirit's tiny hand touched, he could feel clearly. As such, this body of consciousness was in fact another him.</p><br/><p>\"If this is another me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng tried controlling the miniature person.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His consciousness moved, and it instantly moved into the body of the miniature person. No, the word \"return\" would be more apt in describing this act of moving into the miniature person. At the instant he entered, he could clearly feel that this was indeed his main body. He tried moving\u2026</p><br/><p>Pat!</p><br/><p>He fell down, and his nose hit the ground.</p><br/><p>Spirit: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wobbling, he crawled up and smiled bitterly before leaving the miniature person. After losing Chen Feng's consciousness, the miniature person slowly hovered and assumed its previous position once again.</p><br/><p>\"This fellow seems to be somewhat uncontrollable.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into contemplation. It seemed like he would only be able to gradually gain control over this miniature person after he had become even stronger. Fortunately, he was not currently in a rush to control the miniature person. All he needed to find out were ways to either stimulate or improve this miniature person.</p><br/><p>Since this was a body of consciousness, if gene reagents in the form of consciousness were to be produced\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng immediately acted upon his thoughts. He gathered a bunch of gene reagents capable of stabilizing one's consciousness from the warehouse of the Gene Production Association and started his production.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, his production was complete. He gulped it down.</p><br/><p>Next\u2026</p><br/><p>Nothing.</p><br/><p>\"The traditional method is indeed unusable,\" Chen Feng muttered to himself. What if he tried exerting control over them with his consciousness?</p><br/><p>He pondered.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Suddenly, some of the materials before him started floating. The consciousness of an awakened one was already powerful in the first place. As such, moving these materials with his consciousness was quite an easy feat. He crushed these materials with his consciousness. Next, the crushed materials transformed into countless light particles that drifted toward the miniature person. The miniature person proceeded to absorb those particles. At this instant, Chen Feng could feel the miniature person stabilizing.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was astonished. \"It can actually absorb the materials directly\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right.\" Spirit's eyes were wide open as well. She had seen clearly earlier. \"The strength of an awakened's consciousness seems capable of transforming all materials into energy form.\"</p><br/><p>\"All?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started his attempts.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>After crushing numerous materials, Chen Feng discovered some trends. For pure individual materials, some were able to transform into energy form while others could not. The same applied to mixed materials. However, materials that were mixed correctly were obviously much better than individual materials, especially when the mixing ratio was correct.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gained understanding. \"In short\u2026 by selecting different materials and allocating a proper ratio to them before refining them with the consciousness of an awakened, a reagent that can be used by awakened ones will be produced.\"</p><br/><p>This was a brand-new discipline. As such, Chen Feng did not even require luck value to help him. By randomly mixing materials together, he was already able to come out with some formulas, since there were no other such formulas in existence. Some of these formulas were rather weak, though. Even so, this was already sufficient.</p><br/><p>For example, this particular awakening stabilizer reagent he had just come up with.</p><br/><p>It could be produced by simply mixing three materials capable of stimulating one's consciousness. After refining it with the consciousness of awakened, it would turn into a clump of energy, an energy with an effect much more concentrated than their previous physical form.</p><br/><p>Naturally, even if it was much more concentrated, it would only have a feeble effect on an awakened one.</p><br/><p>However, for aspiring producers, this would be a good beginner reagent for them to learn.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, Chen Feng produced a clump of energy before forcing the clump into a reagent bottle.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The bottle started shining with a blue light.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. \"Seems like the reagent bottles can store energies as well.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was bewildered as they saw this. \"What is this?\"</p><br/><p>They had watched on as Chen Feng had fallen into deep contemplation before busying himself without stop. They were aware that he had gained some understanding and had not dared disturb his line of thought. As such, they had merely waited on him until, finally, this thing was created: a bottle containing some light in it.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng passed it to a random master producer. \"Get an awakened one to try this out.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, an awakened one that was stationed here was called over. After consuming the reagent, his eyes widened and he said, \"I feel like there has been a slight increase in my strength.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>All the producers were startled.</p><br/><p>Increase!</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>They looked at Chen Feng joyfully, feeling anxious at the same time. \"You discovered something?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course,\" Chen Feng said with a smile. \"I have named this thing 'awakening stabilizer reagent,' the most basic of gene reagents. In fact, its production is rather simple. I will pass on the formula to you guys later. However, one single premise for a person to be able to engage in such research is that the person must be an awakened one. Therefore, dear master producers\u2026 I'm afraid the time has come for you guys to increase your strength. Since this new discipline is somewhat different than the gene productions of the past, I am calling it 'new gene production techniques'.\"</p><br/><p>\"The awakening stabilizer I created earlier is but a mere fragment of the possibilities this new discipline entails. For master producers like you all, you will be able to create even more gene reagents. However, I suppose you will all have to work hard to increase your strength for now.\"</p><br/><p>\"That does not matter.\"</p><br/><p>All the master producers were overwhelmed by their emotions. What they feared most was the end of gene production. Now that Chen Feng had given them a beautiful future, what was there to fear? As for breaking through into the awakened realm\u2026 that was not a problem whatsoever.</p><br/><p>As master producers, since they were capable of helping genetic warriors break through, they were naturally able to help themselves break through as well. Although gene producers normally had rather weak combat power, their actual realms were in fact never too low. As such, they were all confident that they could enter the awakened realm before long.</p><br/><p>Next, Chen Feng passed on what he had learned to them. Looking at all of them studying this new discipline seriously, he felt rather gratified. The amount of time and energy one had to spend when conducting research was incredibly high. As such, only these master producers here that had given their entire lives to gene producer could study this new discipline with such enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng believed that with their experience and qualifications, they would most certainly be able to come out with more and better gene reagents. As for him\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I suppose it's time for me to increase my strength.\"</p><br/><p>He inhaled deeply. The primordial had descended, and awakened ones were walking everywhere. The resonance would reappear soon, and the ultimate trump card Chen Feng had once relied on to stand tall above all others might no longer remain so powerful in face of all this. Therefore, he had to increase his strength as soon as possible. After all, in this era, strength was the most important thing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

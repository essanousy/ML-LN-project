Due to the relationship between Xiao Ying and Ming Yue, he trusted Ming Yue more.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue laughed heartily. \u201cAnd you think that the other person will agree to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, the other party would arrive at the same conclusion as Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had boundless godly power, I would probably kill that person before helping you resurrect the two goddesses,\u201d Ming Yue said without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only now did he realize the crux of the issue. These girls\u2019 relationships were way more complicated than he had imagined. Ai, this trashy Wang Chun couldn\u2019t even manage his harem properly. This should have been simple\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grudges\u2026\u201d Chen Feng could only try to tackle the issue from this angle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehehe.\u201d Ming Yue sneered as she looked at Chen Feng. \u201cThis is a grudge that has accumulated for ages. It would be better for you to be smarter. I remember a certain saying from your world: do not force a kind husband like me to do a bad thing, and do not force that slut to become a good wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was dazed for a long time. \u201cSuch a saying exists?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you her address,\u201d Ming Yue said politely. \u201cIf you can persuade her, I will agree to your request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cFor real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ming Yue looked over at the naive, cute, and obedient Xiao Ying to the side before sighing. \u201cAfter all, my life is already tied to this fellow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Chen Feng agreed. Wasn\u2019t it merely persuading a different big shot of The Crystal Palace? That shouldn\u2019t be too hard. This was a very unique world, a world with only women. Moreover, this world was based on The Crystal Palace. As such, the other party was most definitely a beautiful young lady as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng seemed to remember that, in the story of The Crystal Palace, no one true villain existed. Thus, Chen Feng followed the address and found the so-called Divine King. In fact, she was truly the Divine King, as she was the ruler of the Shen faction, the faction the Shen Yi sisters were in. Her name was Shen Wang. [1] <sup>1</sup></p><br/><p>Beautiful, young, and bright. This was the Shen Wang that Chen Feng saw. She was a beautiful young lady that caused one\u2019s heart to flutter. She appeared to be quite amicable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Chen Feng went forth and greeted her, then told her his request. The beautiful young lady agreed cheerfully. Her sole condition was that Ming Yue accompanied her for one night.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng thought he had heard incorrectly. Did she mean to have Ming Yue play with her for a bit?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you heard correctly. I want her to accompany me for one night,\u201d the beautiful Shen Wang said, a big smile on her face. In her eyes was an expression that Chen Feng was extremely familiar with. This\u2026 He breathed in a mouthful of cold air. In short, this beautiful Shen Wang was a girl lover?</p><br/><p>Hiss\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart leaped. In his memories, Ming Yue seemed to have a rather normal sexual orientation? It was no wonder she had been so angry when she found out that Xiao Ying was female. Hold on, did this not mean that their relationship was in fact not as he had imagined?</p><br/><p>He immediately went to Wang Chun to find out more. Instantly, he was horrified by what he learned. In the past, the two had been best friends. This had lasted until the day the beautiful Shen Wang went over to Ming Yue in her sleep and did something improper to her. Chen Feng was quite curious about the improper thing she did.</p><br/><p>In any case, Ming Yue was utterly disgusted by that act and defected from the Divine Palace immediately. Bringing along a bunch of her underlings, she went to the other side of the world and ultimately conquered half this world for herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat damnable plot is this?\u201d Chen Feng was somewhat stupefied. This stupid plot, even Qidian wouldn\u2019t dare to write something like this, right? In his memories, this didn\u2019t seem to be the plot of the original The Crystal Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the plot my world is based on is not the original plot,\u201d Wang Chun said meekly. \u201cMy world is based on some fan fiction I read somewhere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In short, to fulfill his dream of having a harem, this bastard Wang Chun visited some NSFW fanfiction websites just so he could have a different version of The Crystal Palace? Holy sh*t. What useless nerd.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \u201cIn short\u2026 the essence of this world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Wang Chun said meekly. \u201cIt\u2019s a world of fan service.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What in the world?</p><br/><p>Wang Chun coughed somewhat awkwardly. \u201cThat is why the girls of this world are so easy to conquer. If this were the original world\u2026 I think I would have been torn apart by them long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At least Wang Chun was not entirely stupid. Chen Feng glared at Wang Chun. Fine. This was a piece of fan fiction. No wonder the plot had developed so weirdly. When he thought back, he seemed to recall that the gaze Shen Yi looked at him with was indeed somewhat odd.</p><br/><p>Hold on. If this was a world of fan service, who did they service? Wasn\u2019t this a female-only world? Chen Feng was filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe.\u201d Wang Chun raised his head and puffed his chest out proudly. \u201cI am the main character.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, he knew exactly what world this was. So it turned out that this wasn\u2019t just an all-female world. This was a world where all the females were extraordinarily beautiful and had zero concept of the relationship between different genders, allowing Wang Chun to roam free and brainwash them as he wished. In short, this so-called The Crystals Palace was the true harem of Wang Chun.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Chen Feng rubbed his aching head. Mhm\u2026 Subsequently, his lips curled up into a smile. He looked at Wang Chun sinisterly. \u201cWhat if I try my hand on Shen Yi and the others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hiss\u2014</p><br/><p>Wang Chun\u2019s hands trembled. \u201cBro, please don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was truly terrified now. He had been brainwashing these girls here because there were no restrictions regarding contact between different genders. He had been absolutely unrestrained because he used to be the only man in this world. If Chen Feng messed around in this world\u2026 Shen Yi and the rest would probably accept his advances without any hesitation. How terrifying. Of course, that wasn\u2019t true of Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun smiled bitterly. \u201cBro, it\u2019s my bad.\u201d He had constructed this harem with utmost care. He did not want to have a competitor. He did not wish for the plot to develop with him wearing the green hat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t have the time for that,\u201d Chen Feng said grudgingly. So it turned out this fellow was aware of exactly what he had done. Truly\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it. After all, this was his private matter.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a sudden melancholic feeling. \u201cDo you have any way of helping them reconcile with each other? Or just reach a temporary compromise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun shrugged. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you the male lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Erm\u2026\u201d Wang Chun appeared to be somewhat at a loss. \u201cIn the original plot, these two were supposed to be the final bosses. If I try to make advances on them, it will have to be at the very end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the setting of this world, the two of them have independent thoughts and aren\u2019t susceptible to brainwashing. As such, my protagonist aura has no effect on them. Moreover, based on the original setting, the story will end after the conquest of the final bosses. I don\u2019t even know if this world will continue on after that.\u201d Wang Chun shrugged. \u201cAs such, I have never intended to conquer the both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was why he had never bothered with those two. In any case, those two were existences he couldn\u2019t hope to touch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do, then?\u201d Chen Feng\u2019s head ached. He had never expected this to happen. He had to now think of a way to persuade to female lead of a piece of fan fiction. Fan fiction that was supposed to be fan service. What were the characteristics of this female lead? What were the differences between her and the original work? He had no idea.</p><br/><p>At present, Shen Wang was an unknown factor. Nobody knew how this fan edition of Shen Wang would behave. What a scam!</p></div>\n</div>"}

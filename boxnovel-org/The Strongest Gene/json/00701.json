What those resonators were looking for was godly power. As for Chen Feng, a commoner without godly power, he appeared the same as those wild animals whenever those resonators scanned his area. As such, it was natural that they all completely neglected him.</p><br/><p>\"I have profited greatly this time.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the tightly wrapped stone as his heart thumped wildly. With this tone\u2026 hehe\u2026</p><br/><p>After returning, he would have to find a way to erase the consciousness within this stone. Just by extracting the power of luck contained within, he would no longer lack luck value in the future. Thirty thousand? Perhaps he could even get thirty million luck value in the future.</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>He took in a deep breath and first returned to the Genetic Union and entered a training room. Then he carefully took out the wrapped stone, which was glowing faintly.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026 obtained.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The stone was glowing with a mysterious radiance.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit. What is this fellow's condition?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Spirit momentarily cast out her senses, then answered, \"Half dead. We can use some gene reagents or other items to temporarily block it out so we can extract the luck value within.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. \"Excellent.\"</p><br/><p>Extracting luck value\u2026 Hehe\u2026 He had been waiting for this for way too long. But before that\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, come.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Let us do something interesting.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, the reason for this is to temper your consciousness.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"To allow you to control even greater strength.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit couldn't quite understand what Chen Feng was getting at. Just like that, half a month passed quietly.</p><br/><p>During this half month, Chen Feng helped Spirit temper her consciousness before producing a gene reagent capable of sealing the stone's consciousness.</p><br/><p>\"Let us begin.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng let out a long breath. A huge number of translucent ice-blue gene reagents were gathered, and the stone was soaked in them. The stone emanated with a gold radiance without stop, giving off quite a wondrous scene as the gold interwove with blue.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>One of his hands pressed onto the stone, with the blue liquid in between.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Numerous rays of light shot out.</p><br/><p>The consciousness of the stone spoke in horror. \"You dare?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Spirit snorted and suppressed the stone's consciousness. After the previous battle where the stone had been weakened several times by the resonators, it didn't have much strength remaining.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Soon, the luck value within Chen Feng started transforming.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart trembled. \"Here it comes!\" He knew that he did not need skin-to-skin contact with this stone. Previously, the mere act of approaching this stone had lifted the deactivated state of his Luck Aura. As such, this time, he only needed to be near this stone to be able to absorb its power. His guess was indeed correct.</p><br/><p>Having skin contact with this stone posed too great of a threat. As such, doing things this way was the perfect choice. The stone struggled as it glowed without stop, but it was unable to do anything thanks to the blue liquid. At the same time, its consciousness was suppressed by Spirit. It was unable to budge and could only watch on blankly as its luck value dropped.</p><br/><p>One point\u2026</p><br/><p>Two points\u2026</p><br/><p>Three points\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The absorption of luck value progressed slowly. Chen Feng merely waited on silently, waiting for his luck value to increase in amount. Soon, after the initial hardship passed, Chen Feng started trying to use his own power of luck for the absorption. The moment he activated his Luck Aura\u2026</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The amount of luck power he was absorbing increased dramatically.</p><br/><p>Ten points!</p><br/><p>A hundred points!</p><br/><p>A thousand points!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A terrifying amount of luck power surged into Chen Feng's body.</p><br/><p>\"It's here.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was overwhelmed with emotions. He knew that the greatest upgrade he had ever experienced thus far was coming.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>His luck value soared.</p><br/><p>A thousand points was merely the beginning. As luck value entered his body without stop, he reached 10,000 points, 100,000 points, 200,000 points, 300,000 points\u2026 The luck value within Chen Feng's body surged dramatically.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power converged within him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was shocked. \"How powerful.\" Finally, his luck value surpassed one million points, reaching a rather terrifying height. Alas, alarmingly, even at this level, luck value still endlessly surged out from that stone at a terrifying speed.</p><br/><p>One million.</p><br/><p>Two million.</p><br/><p>Three million.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Mhm?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was startled. Could it be that his initial guess was completely correct? This stone contained more than 10 million points of luck value? Soon, his guess was confirmed. In a short period of time, his luck value surpassed ten million points. Even so, his luck value was still increasing.</p><br/><p>\"There's more?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng narrowed his eyes. How much luck value did this stone contain, exactly?</p><br/><p>Ten million? No, he had already surpassed 10 million, yet he was still growing. From the momentum, there were no signs of it stopping anytime soon\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>His luck value surged. Chen Feng tried activating his Luck Aura once again. With the present luck value he had, the activation of Luck Aura was an extremely terrifying act.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the speed of absorption went through another sharp increase. Shortly after, he started absorbing tens of millions of luck value in one go.</p><br/><p>Ten million points.</p><br/><p>Twenty million points.</p><br/><p>Thirty million points.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes widened.</p><br/><p>With an expression of disbelief, he watched on as his luck value surged. In a short period of time, it reached a brand new height: One hundred million points!</p><br/><p>For the very first time, his luck value had reached a hundred million. And yet\u2026 his luck value was still growing.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng sensed something wrong. \"I have a bad feeling.\"</p><br/><p>A hundred million? If this stone truly possessed so much luck value, it would definitely not have been so weak! Chen Feng had first deduced that this stone would possess around ten million luck value based on its prowess and the might of that leopard. But now\u2026 a hundred million? If this stone was truly ten times more powerful than that, why had it not displayed its strength?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instinctively, Chen Feng tried stopping the absorption. Alas\u2026 he found that he could no longer stop it.</p><br/><p>His expression sank. \"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, stop it!\" Chen Feng roared inwardly.</p><br/><p>Spirit's expression sank as well. \"I\u2026 it is no longer listening to me.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart jolted. \"What?\" It was not listening to Spirit? How was that possible? One ought to know that the only feature Luck Aura had gained after its previous upgrade was granting Spirit the ability to independently control it.</p><br/><p>\"Let me try sensing it.\" Spirit smiled bitterly. \"At present\u2026 looks like it is once again the time for luck to clash against luck.\" The stone was obviously using its power of luck at this moment as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng clenched his teeth. \"Bring it on, then.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>For the first time, he put his greater than one hundred million luck value to work.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>He could feel the terrifying amount of luck value being put to work. Alas, alarmingly, even with so much luck value, things were still not changing. He was still absorbing luck value!</p><br/><p>His eyes widened. \"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Spirit's expression became odd. \"There\u2026 There\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was greatly startled as well. \"This is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He did not need Spirit to tell him about it, as he himself had felt it as well. Before him, for the very first time, the stone fully unleashed its power of luck. That terrifying power\u2026 If this one hundred million luck value Chen Feng had was a pebble, then what this stone was unleashing at the moment was a huge mountain! The power within\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The terrifying power of luck flooded Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"How\u2026 is\u2026 this possible?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not dare to believe this. The power contained within this fellow surpassed even tens of billions? This\u2026</p><br/><p>If that was the case, why had it been so miserable previously? Right at this instant, the consciousness within the stone appeared once again. Easily, it broke free of Spirit's suppression and transmitted an extremely clear thought to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. Chen Feng\u2026 I told you, you are the chosen seed of heaven!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

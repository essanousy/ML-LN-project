The president stepped forth, his hand holding Tianyu Liming's only remaining hand. Since things had come to this point, everyone was already prepared to die. Faint energy condensed around their bodies. This time, they would put their lives on the line and fight it out! Whether they could pull this devil from S class or not would depend on this final struggle.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Radiance condensed around them. Everyone had a resolute expression. The storm closed in, and just as they were about to charge forth toward the storm, a familiar voice resounded: \"Let me deal with the rest.\"</p><br/><p>A casual yet satisfied voice. </p><br/><p>Who?</p><br/><p>Before they could even react to it, a figure appeared before all of them. It was Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng?</p><br/><p>They were all somewhat dumbstruck. Before them, Chen Feng lifted his hand lightly and tapped on the storm. Instantly, a terrifying power started to circulate.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the power of the storm erupted. Alarming everyone there, that power capable of freezing everything, that power capable of destroying everything, was seemingly nothing before Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The storm roared. It had seemingly sensed Chen Feng's power. A faint radiance swirled around as the storm tried to freeze Chen Feng's power. That hand of Chen Feng's that was touching the storm started to freeze\u2026 And then\u2026 his hand recovered in a split second.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. \"Is this your power? In that case\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the storm pulled back.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng slammed his hand down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With Chen Feng as the center, a faint radiance formed a circle. Just like that, at its peak power, that storm was blocked by radiance emitted by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The ground shook, yet none of them suffered any damage. In the middle of the storm, amid all the dust, everyone was safe and sound.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The president was alarmed. The ancients were alarmed.</p><br/><p>All of them were stunned. None of them had expected that with a single hand, Chen Feng could so easily block this seemingly unequaled storm. This fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>They were all shocked. Right at this instant, Chen Feng opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled toyingly. \"Leaving just like this?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The dust settled. Not far away, the devil expert, who had been about to leave, stopped.</p><br/><p>\"You are actually able to stop my power?\" The devil expert could not believe this. Even during the Primordial Era long gone, very few had been able to block this attack of his, yet now\u2026 This was not supposed to be possible. Apart from that fellow of the ancient race, nobody should be able to block this attack even though, presently, 90% of his power was sealed. This was unrelated to whether he was sealed or not. Rather, this was a power in an entirely different realm, a power that could not possibly be blocked by the power of a beyond A class. This person called Chen Feng\u2026 The devil expert narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Is it not simple?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He waved his hand. A familiar power surged out of his hand. He wasn't too skilled at using this power, yet clearly, this was the power of an awakened one. A true S-class power! The president and the rest were shocked. They exchanged glances, finally realizing the source of Chen Feng's confidence.</p><br/><p>So it turned out\u2026</p><br/><p>As they thought of this, everyone moved away silently, giving Chen Feng sufficient space. At a time like this, they had no intention of dragging Chen Feng down.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a faint smile as he said, \"The power of an awakened? You are not the only one with it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" The devil expert did not seem bothered. \"It is impossible for you to be an awakened. If you were truly an awakened, this battle would have ended long ago and would not have required so much effort from your side. From how you ruined the formation of that treacherous devil and your earlier state, I can guess that you are probably borrowing a certain power\u2026 You must have obtained some inherited items, right?\" The devil expert sneered. \"Hehe. Unfortunately, the power of an awakened is not something a person like you can control.\" </p><br/><p>Some remnants of the Primordial Era had survived. Those fortunate enough to obtain these items would be able to obtain some special power from these items, such as the power of the awakened. This was not a power that the user would truly possess. Rather, the user would be temporarily borrowing the power. As such, the users were normally incapable of controlling such power and could only use it in a crude manner.</p><br/><p>It was akin to a three-year-old holding an immense hatchet: childish and ridiculous. The present Chen Feng resembled such a person. Although the power of an awakened flowed about his body, his method of control and the wasting of power\u2026 Wasn't it comparable to a child holding an immense hatchet?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"Is that so? Why not give it a try?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A torrent of formidable power surged out of his hand. This was the power of an awakened! After observing this devil expert for a long time, after comprehending this power for a long time, with Spirit's assistance, he had finally gained true understanding of the true power of S class.</p><br/><p>He did not know the function of this power of his. He did not even know the difference between his power and the devil's. He did not know of any abilities exclusive to himself. But he could feel clearly the might of this power. This alone was sufficient.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A simple punch. Instantly, the power of an awakened erupted from it.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The devil expert waved his hand, sending out a slash. Their powers clashed, creating a huge shockwave. They were actually evenly matched.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled faintly. \"You still refuse to believe it?\" He did not mind wasting his power together with this devil expert. If his guess was correct, it was precisely as the president had said. Any power this devil exhaust now would be forever lost. He had been sealed. At present, he had no way of unleashing his true power. Therefore, dragging this out and wasting their power together was the best option. Besides, fighting this devil was also the best chance for Chen Feng to gain further understanding of the power of an awakened. Chen Feng became excited. \"Come!\"</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous punches were hurled out, each of them possessing astonishing might.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's grasp on the power of an awakened was rather weak. He couldn't even use it effectively. However, it was sufficient to face this devil expert who had 90% of his power sealed.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous punches were sent out, creating numerous shockwaves. Slowly, the devil expert started frowning. He had initially believed that this awakened power Chen Feng had obtained would be fully exhausted in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>He was astonished. \"It can actually last this long?\" Even if the opponent was unaware of the proper methods for using this power and was thus unleashing a pitifully weak might from it, if this continued, he might truly be exhausted to death. This wouldn't do! He sighed.</p><br/><p>Ka!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he pulled out one of his own arms.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The arm ignited.</p><br/><p>A huge amount of bizarre power transformed into swirling light before surging into his body. His power, which had been near exhaustion, recovered somewhat. His feeble power was now somewhat stronger. The seal had been weakened.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>The president was stupefied. This works?</p><br/><p>\"He ignited his arm to recover some of his power.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was horrified. Igniting his arm\u2026</p><br/><p>This was not as simple as severing his arm. For ordinary people like them, even if they severed their arms, they could still regrow their arms with gene reagents. But his action of sacrificing his arm for power with a body at this level was equivalent to eternally losing this arm. This guy was indeed cruel even to his own self!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

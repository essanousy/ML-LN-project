The effect of his luck power was to summon yet another dragon? Was one not enough? Now they had two here? Hold on\u2026 Suddenly, Zhou Ye recalled that when the new dragon had arrived, he had shouted, \"Chen Feng, hand over your life\"?</p><br/><p>\"You know this dragon?\" Zhou Ye asked as he looked at the mountain-like dragon.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was utterly stupefied as well. \"Nope.\" Since when had he known this dragon? Chen Feng comforted Zhou Ye. \"Don't worry. Maybe my godly power has yet to come into effect. As for this dragon, it must either be a coincidence or something that slut Luck Goddess summoned.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This did not sound convincing at all.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye inhaled deeply. \"When will your godly power come into effect, then?\" He looked at these two dragons, feeling like he would die in the next second.</p><br/><p>\"Soon\u2026 I guess?\" Chen Feng guessed. He had initially believed that his power of misfortune would bring forth another dreadful creature to fight this dragon. Surprisingly, it had brought forth another dragon instead. Moreover\u2026 Chen Feng raised his head and looked at the new dragon, which was getting clearer and clearer. When he finally got a clear look at that dragon, he finally understood why that dragon knew him.</p><br/><p>\"Shit,\" Chen Feng cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye sighed. \"You finally remembered this dragon?\" Since the dragon had called out Chen Feng's name, they obviously knew each other.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"Yeah.\" He had still been wondering when he had ever offended a dragon, but when he had finally gotten a clear look at the dragon's appearance, he had finally remembered who this fellow was. Long Yue! This was one of the so-called descendants of a dragon, the Long family. What a distant memory\u2026</p><br/><p>Back then, when he had been still a weakling, he had once crossed paths with this fellow. If he remembered correctly, Long Yue had obviously died. Why was he still alive? Furthermore, this body... and this aura\u2026 He had actually transformed into a dragon for real.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. Back then, the so-called descendant of a dragon and dragon bloodline had been berated endlessly by everyone, as everyone had been of the opinion that the Long family had gone crazy. There had also been that incident with the seadragon blood. Surprisingly, this fellow was still alive. Even more surprisingly, he had truly transformed into a dragon. In short, one had to have a dream, regardless of how unlikely it seemed, in case the dream would come true?</p><br/><p>\"What is the point of revising your memory at this time?\" Zhou Ye felt like choking Chen Feng to death right here. He was starting to regret making an agreement with this Chen Feng. Why in the world would the luck converted from the power of misfortune screw with the user himself? Was this the so-called \"defeating a heavier force with a lighter force\"?</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\" Chen Feng was truly at a loss for words this time. That was because his godly power was no longer seething, indicating that his luck had indeed worked. From how things looked, it seemed like his luck had indeed brought forth this dragon, Long Yue. Why had this happened? Chen Feng was completely confused. Mhm\u2026 Perhaps this Long Yue was not the Long Yue of the past? Even though there was a grudge between them, it was better than total strangers? That was possible!</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Long Yue,\" Chen Feng cheerfully greeted Long Yue.</p><br/><p>Long Yue's killing intent surged. \"Come and die!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A dreadful power erupted. The terrifying might unique to dragons descended. Immediately after his arrival, Long Yue charged at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"Shit.\" Chen Feng was so shocked that he fled backward while trembling.</p><br/><p>\"How he hates you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye and the rest inhaled deeply in shock. This Chen Feng fellow\u2026 was probably going to die here.</p><br/><p>\"I have been looking for you for a long time\u2026\" Long Yue laughed sinisterly. \"Hehehehehe, for me to become this, it is all thanks to you. Hehehehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed dryly. \"Hehe, does this not count as your wish being fulfilled?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Long Yue became agitated. \"Wish fulfillment? What do you know? This is completely unlike what I imagined\u2026 The dragon bloodline\u2026 Hahahaha, how could bugs such as you understand it?\"</p><br/><p>Long Yue appeared deranged and angry at the same time.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, he charged at Chen Feng. His mountain-like body started descending.</p><br/><p>\"Not good!\"</p><br/><p>The hearts of Zhou Ye and the rest thumped furiously. Instinctively, they wanted to help Chen Feng. But with great sorrow, they found that they couldn't help at all. A dragon's speed and strength were too terrifying\u2014a regular person could never hope to catch up. And yet, surprising everyone there, just as Long Yue was about to reach Chen Feng, a terrifying power flashed past. Just like that, Long Yue's mountain-like body was smashed away.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Long Yue smashed into the salt lake, nearly bleeding from the attack.</p><br/><p>A furious roar resounded. \"Who?\" Long Yue charged out of the salt lake, furious. In the sky, the primordial dragon that was even larger floated lazily. His huge head stretched out and gazed at Long Yue coldly.</p><br/><p>\"Pr... primordial dragon?\" Long Yue trembled, as if he had seen something extremely horrifying. Earlier, when he had seen Chen Feng, his eyes had become bloodshot with anger and had not noticed anything else. This was especially true since the other dragon was so huge, like he was part of the topography rather than a life-form.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" The primordial dragon regarded Long Yue coldly. The salt lake sank into absolute silence.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The primordial dragon's eyes flickered with a faint surging power. After a long time, the primordial dragon's ice-cold eyes became even colder. He seemed to have finally seen through the body of Long Yue, seen through everything contained within.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the primordial dragon locked his gaze upon Long Yue. \"Disgrace\u2026 Lizard\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Long Yue trembled. \"No, that's not the case.\" His body was only slightly smaller than the primordial dragon. However, the terrifying aura unique to a primordial dragon was sufficient to plant fear in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"I am also a descendant of the dragons! I possess a true dragon bloodline!\" Long Yue explained anxiously. \"Arghhh, a damnable old man transformed me into a damnable lizard. Only after accidentally obtaining a primordial fragment when the primordial descended did I transform back into a true dragon. I am telling the truth! I truly possess the dragon bloodline!\"</p><br/><p>And yet the primordial dragon ignored everything he said, merely staring at him coldly while repeating what he had said earlier. \"Disgrace\u2026 Lizard\u2026 Obligated to kill!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the primordial dragon raged.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it!\"</p><br/><p>Long Yue's expression changed as he sprung backward and fled in panic.</p><br/><p>Howl!</p><br/><p>A dreadful dragon aura erupted. And thus, two terrifying dragons left the salt lake, one at the front and the other behind it, leaving behind Chen Feng and others, bewildered.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like\u2026 it worked?\" Zhou Ye said thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>\"I guess so?\" Chen Feng was unsure as well. His emotions today had truly been like a roller coaster ride, up and down. Nevertheless, this incident with the dragon had finally ended. Even if a few of them had died, the remaining resonators were still terrifying. At the very least, they were terrifying enough for the present weakened Luck Goddess. They all lifted their heads. Distantly, the forest was already within reach.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" Chen Feng commanded.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess, here we come!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

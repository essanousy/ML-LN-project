Sorry, with Time Quicksand applied at the appropriate moment, the explosiveness will vanish. You have an unrivaled defense? Sorry, with Time Quicksand, the active duration of the defense will disappear. After all, when activating an ability that required casting, if a single second were to go missing, the entire process would need to be restarted.</p><br/><p>The more they researched, the more they noticed how terrifying this ability was. This new ability created by Chen Feng became the most popular and powerful ability. As long as one put it to use in an appropriate manner, this ability could counter any ability. This was a super-powerful interruption ability. This was what Time Quicksand was. It was not a powerful attack. Rather, it was the strongest support ability.</p><br/><p>Those people who had still been wondering whether they should buy it suddenly noticed that this ability was something everyone had to have. Oh, one refused to buy it? Well, one's opponent would buy it. And then\u2026 well, what would happen next was something one should be able to guess. At the very least, Time Quicksand would render one major ability useless. More importantly, one could never guess when exactly would Time Quicksand be used, when exactly one's ability would be suddenly disabled, giving one's opponent the initiative in the battle.</p><br/><p>In a battle where both parties were evenly matched, the one without this ability would be the disadvantaged party. With great sadness, after all the beyond A classes purchased this ability, they noted that the only use of this newly bought ability was to counteract the opponent's Time Quicksand, since both parties similarly had the same ability.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026 when one activated it, the other would activate it as well. As such, everyone would take one second from the other's side. Apart from this, this ability did not seem to have any other use.</p><br/><p>Of course, when facing the devil race or ancient race, Time Quicksand would still prove extremely helpful, something equivalent to an additional life. Ultimately, it was decided that this was an ability not to be used among fellow humans.</p><br/><p>\"I keep feeling like something seems off.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, my combat power is still ranked 88.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here. Even though I have bought Time Quicksand, nearly all the beyond A classes have purchased it as well. As such, ultimately, there are no changes in the overall combat power among us fellow humans.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What a scam!\"</p><br/><p>\"I knew it! This Chen Feng will never come out with something good.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone felt too powerless to even begin berating this. Due to this, the rating of this Time Quicksand dropped from the initial 10 points to three points. Moreover, people were leaving the word \"scam\" in the reviews of this ability. Alas, they noticed with great grief that even with that low rating of three, they still had no choice but to buy it. It reached a point where every newly advanced beyond A class had to purchaseTime Quicksand as their first beyond-A-class ability.</p><br/><p>At a certain location within Genetic Union, Li Lei was watching on helplessly as the sales of Time Quicksand increased. God-freaking-dammit . At first he had believed that he would be able to bully everyone after obtaining this Time Quicksand, but now this ability had become a must-have for all beyond A classes. Chen Feng, what a scammer!</p><br/><p>\"This is the reason you asked me to leave that 'savior of all middle-aged men' comment anonymously?\" Li Lei sighed at this realization. That's right, he was precisely the anonymous reviewer.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled playfully. \"Of course.\" Sex was the easiest marketing method. In his previous world, regardless of whether it was via video, CD, computer, or even virtual reality, sex was something that had always sold extremely well. The same applied when it came to the dissemination of news. By spreading the news about his Time Quicksand as gossip, it was able to spread through the market at a rapid speed.</p><br/><p>Li Lei was speechless. \"Where's your integrity?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely laughed it off. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>Li Lei raised his brow. \"Anyway, are the points you have earned this time sufficient for you to enter beyond A class?\"</p><br/><p>Since Chen Feng was already at peak beyond B class, his next step of advancement was to enter beyond A class. The points he had earned would be helpful in that. Regardless of abilities or materials, all of them could be purchased using points.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, the points are already enough. But I'm afraid it's still not sufficient to enter a training camp,\" Chen Feng stated faintly.</p><br/><p>\"There's no helping that.\" Li Lei shrugged. \"When it comes to the transformation to beyond A class from beyond B class, nobody will concede. Among those on the waiting lists, a large majority of them are the children of the various big shots of the Genetic Union.\"</p><br/><p>\"I am aware of that\u2026\" Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"Therefore, I have no choice but to think of something myself.\"</p><br/><p>\"With your talent and the points you have, if you use a regular method to break through, at most, you will be able to break through in a year,\" stated Li Lei.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"One year is way too long.\" He had been stuck in beyond B class for far too long. The trip to the devil race territory back then had also increased his thirst for power. No matter what, he had to break through into beyond A class this time.</p><br/><p>\"If so, you can only wait for it. If you need help, I can help you farm some contribution points,\" Li Lei stated with a forced smile. This was the only way he could help.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"There's no need for that. I already have an idea for what to do about this.\"</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Genetic Union was holding a meeting. The higher-ups of the Genetic Union were discussing something extremely important.</p><br/><p>The deputy president was somewhat anxious. \"Chen Feng's points are so high it's borderline scary now.\"</p><br/><p>Generally, it was extremely rare for a single person to create such beyond-A-class ability. Normally, this would be a group project. After all the earned points were divided, what a single individual stood to earn wasn't much. As for the occasional cases where a single individual had succeeded in creating a new ability, those had normally been some minor abilities that weren't particularly expensive.</p><br/><p>But now, this Chen Feng had created Time Quicksand, a beyond-A-class ability. The price of this ability was extremely high, and in this circumstance where all beyond A classes had no choice but to purchase this ability so they didn't fall behind, Chen Feng's points had instantly reached a scary level.</p><br/><p>\"What's there to worry about that?\" One of them felt doubtful. \"At present, he is merely a beyond B class. I reckon he will most probably use all these points just to breakthrough into beyond A class. I remember how the last time someone earned such a huge amount of points, that person did the same. With Chen Feng's talent and the resources he could purchase with these points, he will be able to enter beyond A class in a year.\"</p><br/><p>This was the steadiest method of breaking through. Despite the somewhat lengthy process, it was still much safer than joining a training camp.</p><br/><p>\"If that were the case, it would be excellent.\" The deputy president smiled bitterly. \"Alas, your understanding of Chen Feng is too low.\"</p><br/><p>\"What about him?\" That person felt doubtful. Even if Chen Feng was a person with a respected identity, that was still a Gene Production Association identity. In the Genetic Union, with Chen Feng's strength, he wasn't that high up the ladder.</p><br/><p>\"Previously, Chen Feng was also merely a regular producer in the Gene Producer Association.\" The deputy president slowly narrated, \"This remained until one day when he created a research paper. Next, he started selling it. Next, he became part of the management of the Gene Production Association.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone in the meeting lapsed into silence. Only now did they realize what exactly this deputy president was worried about. That was because according to a certain provision in the laws of the Genetic Union, if one possessed a certain amount of points, one could start purchasing authority in the Genetic Union. Granted, the amount of points required was excessively large. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\"That's not possible.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone shook their heads. Even if such a provision indeed existed, in their history, only a single person had ever managed to do it.</p><br/><p>That was Luo Yuan, the founder of Stormtech Co. Ltd., the creator of the wristbands all of humanity used, the senior who had also created numerous mystical technologies. That was the first person who had accumulated sufficient points to start purchasing authority within the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>However, even with the amount of points he had gathered, the scope of authority he had managed to purchase was only 0.1%. In order to truly have a say in the Genetic Union, one would need to have an authority of at least 10%.</p><br/><p>\"You are thinking too much,\" one of them stated, as if this was utterly ridiculous. \"What joke is this? This is the Genetic Union. Have you spared a thought for how many points would be required to purchase authority here in the Genetic Union? Even Luo Yuan only managed to purchase 0.1%, an amount only sufficient to have his name listed, before he gave up. If one truly wishes to gain enough authority through this method to control the Genetic Union... That is impossible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry.\" Everyone started comforting the deputy president. \"Regardless of how powerful Time Quicksand is, one must not forget one point: the amount of beyond A classes among humanity is still rather limited.\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\" At this, the deputy president lapsed into contemplation. Even if all beyond-A-class humans were to purchase Time Quicksand, the accumulated points would still be insufficient to purchase the authority required for one to actually assume any form of control over the Genetic Union. However, why did he still have this uncomfortable feeling? \"Perhaps I have truly been overthinking things,\" the deputy president muttered.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

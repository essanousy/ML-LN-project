At this, the Genetic Union finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>The people of the Material Department smiled bitterly. \"Our losses are rather immense.\" In this incident, the Gene Production Association and Chen Feng had profited greatly and all of humanity had been blessed; the Genetic Union was the only party that had been scammed ruthlessly, yet they still had to feel grateful for this conclusion. At the very least, that was the attitude they had to display. When facing the Chen Feng who had given the Master Spirit Trainer to them for \"free,\" the Genetic Union had to display their gratitude when in public.</p><br/><p>The people of the Finance Department were furious as well. \"I am grateful to his mother.\"</p><br/><p>However, the deputy president was feeling relieved. \"Finally, this is over.\" Even if they had been scammed ruthlessly by Chen Feng, at the very least, what Chen Feng had gotten from them was some money rather than points. As such, the management authority of the Genetic Union wasn't under threat by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"What if he continues and researches something similar?\" The people of the Material Department were extremely anxious. As the others heard this, their hearts chilled as well. They thought about it and\u2026 Mhm\u2026 apart from Master Spirit Trainer, what if Chen Feng continued developing spirit arts? How should the Genetic Union respond to that?</p><br/><p>\"I heard that Chen Feng is in seclusion yet again,\" someone muttered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The deputy president shook his head. \"Don't worry. As long as this incident is dealt with, all will be fine. As for other spirit arts, we won't fall for the same scam twice.\"</p><br/><p>After all, they were the Genetic Union. This time, they had indeed been scammed. However, based on the way in which Chen Feng did things, their Strategy Department had already come up with a counter. If Chen Feng really dared to come out with a similar development, they would most certainly ensure that he would end up suffering a great loss instead.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2026 we shall be waiting for you.</p><br/><p>On the next day, all the departments of the Genetic Union prepared themselves. At present, Chen Feng was already labeled as the highest-level threat. They had entered a phase of total war against him. Naturally, this so-called war was not an actual war of force. Rather, this was a war of wits.</p><br/><p>The absolute counter had been put in place and was waiting for Chen Feng's next spirit art.</p><br/><p>\"Are you certain?\" the deputy president asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. We have already divined it. Although what we saw was still somewhat fuzzy, we are sure that Chen Feng's next spirit art will be launched in a few days. Based on the contents of what we divined, it will similarly be named Master XX as well,\" an old man stated calmly.</p><br/><p>The deputy president expressed his gratitude. \"Many thanks.\" Indeed\u2026 yet another Master XX series? A smile appeared on the deputy president's face. After all, the Genetic Union was a huge organization. The only reason they had fallen for Chen Feng's scam previously was because they had never expected him to come up with something like that.</p><br/><p>Now that the entirety of the Genetic Union was ready for it, Chen Feng would be helpless against them. Divining, forecasting, visions, and so on were all done. Every single action of Chen Feng's was in their grasp. Even the day of sale and part of the name of the product had been divined. How could Chen Feng still hope to scam the Genetic Union? It was no longer possible.</p><br/><p>\"But then, this name\u2026\" The deputy president blanked as he saw the Master XX given to him. Generally speaking, when those experts divined something, the information would most certainly be complete. This time, only Master XX had been divined. Was there some peak beyond A class protecting Chen Feng? The deputy president contemplated.</p><br/><p>In any case, it did not matter. Even with this incomplete name, it was sufficient for them to make their preparations. What would it be this time? He looked forward to it. Three days later, Chen Feng ended his seclusion with success in his research of a brand new spirit art. At present, he was preparing his information for the official announcement without knowing that the Genetic Union had already fixed their eyes on him long ago.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng is out of seclusion.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, I saw that. He is registering the data.\"</p><br/><p>\"True enough, it's a brand new spirit art.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Time, venue, type, everything is exactly the same as what the senior foresaw earlier.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What this kid scammed from us previously, we shall earn it all back this time.\"</p><br/><p>The Genetic Union rubbed their fists, anxious to start their revenge on Chen Feng. Countless people eyed Chen Feng secretly.</p><br/><p>\"We don't have to be too ruthless.\"</p><br/><p>\"After all, Chen Feng is still contributing toward humanity. Cut him some slack. Only with that will he continue developing other spirit arts.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, that's natural.\"</p><br/><p>After all, they were simply competing in business rather than being in an actual war. They discussed secretly, figuring out a way to earn the most they could while at the same time leaving Chen Feng some face. As all this happened, Chen Feng finished his registration. Chen Feng's third spirit art was released. Instantly, all the Genetic Union members worldwide that had been paying attention to Chen Feng received the latest announcement.</p><br/><p>The higher-ups were filled with anticipation. \"Here it comes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, what will be the training this time? Strength? Agility?\"</p><br/><p>Instinctively, they opened the announcement, yet the instant they laid eyes on the name, they were stupefied.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Name: Master Spirit Developer</p><br/><p>Classification: Spirit art.</p><br/><p>Function: Through suitable combinations, one can develop new spirit art unique to oneself.</p><br/><p>Exhaustion: Similar to the energy exhaustion of regular abilities.</p><br/><p>Conversion Rate: Free.</p><br/><p>Right Holder: Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Genetic Union: \"???\"</p><br/><p>All genetic warriors: \"???\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck. What damnable spirit art was this? None had any idea. But then, from the name of this thing here\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Buy!\"</p><br/><p>The first thing they did was purchase this spirit art. This was what was good about Chen Feng's spirit arts\u2014he always released them for free.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled before their eyes. An illusory world appeared before them. Similarly, this was a rather crude illusion formed of simple shining lines.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>1. Developing spirit arts</p><br/><p>2. Editing spirit arts</p><br/><p>3. Selling spirit arts</p><br/><p>4. Purchasing spirit arts</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Amid the light, only several simple options were available. Curiously, everyone took a look and noted that the final three spots were temporarily empty. However, when they tapped on the first option, a complete user manual appeared.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Spirit arts development options:</p><br/><p>1. Spatial module, range of adjustment: 0% to 1%.</p><br/><p>2. Time module, range of adjustment: 0 seconds to 1 second.</p><br/><p>3. Energy module, range of adjustment: 0% to 1%.</p><br/><p>4. Pending</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>\"This thing\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The eyes of some people who were tech-savy opened wide. Could it really be as described here, where they could develop brand new spirit arts?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Someone tried using it. With astonishment, they found that the time module could truly be controlled. That's right, these modules such as time, space, and energy weren't something the users could use previusly, since these were the core abilities of the spirit arts. However, Chen Feng had now provided them an interface with which they could make use of these abilities.</p><br/><p>By only inputting the corresponding energy, they could now use these modules. Naturally, based on the amount of energy poured in, the effect would be different, such as 0%, 0.5%, 0.6%, and so on. The stronger one needed it to be, the higher the energy exhaustion would be. With this unique method, Chen Feng had provided them with an ability unique to each of them.</p><br/><p>\"This works?\"</p><br/><p>Some tried developing something.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Content of development</p><br/><p>Selected module: time module. Range: adjusted to the maximum. End.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>That's right. Some of them started using the simplest development option.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A brand new spirit art was formed.</p><br/><p>Unnamed, undefined, unedited.</p><br/><p>After testing it out, they found with great astonishment that this was precisely the Time Quicksand Chen Feng had developed earlier on. This thing here was truly capable of taking away one second of time.</p><br/><p>\"I have actually developed Time Quicksand by myself?\"</p><br/><p>That person was stunned, even though he had only developed this Time Quicksand through the interface provided by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit, this is too amazing,\" that person exclaimed in admiration. \"Let me try selling it.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had initially believed that he would be requested to accept some missions involving subduing newly awakened ones or something similar, but unexpectedly, the deputy president had instead insisted that he return to the union.</p><br/><p>The deputy president smiled. \"Subduing awakened ones is a task for ordinary people like us. You have an even more important task.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's curiosity was piqued. \"Oh?\" In this chaotic era, what could be more important than subduing awakened ones?</p><br/><p>The deputy president gave Chen Feng a set of information. \"This.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave it a glance, and his heart chilled.</p><br/><p>Shit, it's actually this\u2026</p><br/><p>What the deputy president wanted was quite simple: at present, apart from stabilizing the general direction of the Genetic Union, they had also created a department that was focused on helping the masses increase their strength as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>From genetic warrior to a beyond genetic warrior and, finally, to awakened.</p><br/><p>To be precise, from A class to beyond A class to awakened.</p><br/><p>The beyond gene reagent Chen Feng had produced previously had enabled everyone to reach beyond A class at a speed much shorter than before. It was a godly gene reagent. With the cooperation and supply of the Research Agency and Genetic Union, at present, this was a gene reagent everyone could use. It had caused the overall strength of the masses to increase rapidly.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 this method would only help them reach beyond A class.</p><br/><p>From beyond A class to awakened was quite a distance, and for this distance, there were no gene reagents capable of providing any sort of assistance.</p><br/><p>\"Now that the seal has been lifted, it is natural that one can become an awakened through regular improvement. However\u2026 it's too slow! Throughout the world, awakened ones are appearing. Moreover, there are also the masters of the primordial fragments, as well as those hidden primordial experts that are recovering their strength. The time left for humans is way too short. If we wait until the experts that have attained resonance appear, or until the gods have all reappeared, it will be too late. Hence\u2026 we need to break through as fast as possible. We also need more awakened ones!\" The deputy president earnestly requested Chen Feng's help: \"Only by having more awakened ones will the Genetic Union be able to stabilize the situation. As such, your gene production skills are required here.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's status and strength were both too terrifying, resulting in no human being capable of ordering him around. As such, the deputy president could only request his help, that he use his production skills to once again upgrade all of humanity.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\" He rubbed his aching head. \"Gene production?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president cautiously said, \"All the master producers are extremely willing to assist you in this undertaking.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"I know. But this realm is one nobody has entered previously. Entering this realm, even with the seal lifted, is still extremely hard. I can't guarantee success.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand,\" the deputy president agreed. \"However, there is still such a hope, right? Even if the probability is only one out of ten thousand, this will still be able to save more people!\"</p><br/><p>With each awakened one that the Genetic Union obtained, the odds would tilt further in their favor. The snowball effect from obtaining an awakened one was extremely terrifying. Moreover, with the high population of humans, so long as something like this was created, there would be hope for humans, even if the probability of success was extremely low.</p><br/><p>\"I beseech you to accept this task,\" the deputy president said.</p><br/><p>\"I will try my best.\" Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"However, I can't guarantee success.\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president was overjoyed. \"Understood. I will make the arrangements for you immediately.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What could he say?</p><br/><p>\"Truly\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He smiled bitterly. This time, it would truly be quite hard. Although gene production had been his career all along\u2026</p><br/><p>He looked at his inactive Luck Aura and his heart chilled. This thing had seemingly completely stopped working.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed deeply. \"Spirit. Will you even be able to finish this upgrade?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Spirit felt wronged. \"I don't know either.\"</p><br/><p>She was a mere consciousness that had come into being during an upgrade of the Fate Stone, not something that was capable of controlling the stone.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's head ached. \"This will be quite troublesome, then.\" He knew from experience how hard researching a gene reagent could be. Moreover, this time, the gene reagent they were trying to produce was something of an extremely high level, something no one had seen before, something capable of helping humanity enter the awakened realm.</p><br/><p>This would be the strongest gene reagent Chen Feng had ever researched in this entire life.</p><br/><p>Naturally\u2026 this could also be his single biggest failure. Although countless masters of the Gene Production Association were ready to provide assistance to him, Chen Feng was still not confident in this. He personally believed that with his present production skills, even without Luck Aura, he would still be comparable to a master. However, so what? There were a whole bunch of masters in the Gene Production Association. This time, their target was the awakened realm!</p><br/><p>To create such a gene reagent, what they required was not only capability, effort, or perseverance. They also needed luck!</p><br/><p>Yet now\u2026 what he lacked most was luck.</p><br/><p>\"Are there any ways I can trigger Luck Aura?\" Chen Feng pondered.</p><br/><p>\"Wu.\" Spirit pondered shortly and said, \"Mhm, if we can find some Spirit Sea wood, it will be possible.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"Spirit Sea wood\u2026\" Now that he did not have his Luck Aura assisting him, how was he supposed to locate Spirit Sea wood?</p><br/><p>Hold on\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he thought of something. Miss Xiao Yue seemed to possess an inconceivable ability. She was capable of drawing a scene that would happen for real.</p><br/><p>The moment this thought crossed his mind, he acted on it. \"I will go look for her now.\" Shortly after, he reached Miss Xiao Yue's home.</p><br/><p>\"I will give it a try.\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Yue was obviously rather distressed as well. The way in which she tried drawing the location of Spirit Sea wood was quite similar to how Chen Feng had done it previously. By speculating and guessing, she tried drawing a map that indicated the location of Spirit Sea wood. Surprisingly, she completed the drawing smoothly with no interference whatsoever.</p><br/><p>She shook her head, somewhat sad. \"Looks like there is no longer any Spirit Sea wood in existence.\"</p><br/><p>That's right. There being zero interference in her drawing process signified that all the places she had drawn had no Spirit Sea wood. Spirit Sea wood seemed to have completely disappeared from this world.</p><br/><p>\"Many thanks.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng left after thanking her. The disappearance of Spirit Sea wood surprised him. It seemed that what he had used at the Mysterious Organization back then was all that had been left.</p><br/><p>\"Why not try researching the gene reagent with your own ability, without relying on Luck Aura?\" proposed Spirit. \"After all, you are also a master producer nowadays, right?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"So what if I am a master producer? A long time ago, when I first entered the awakened realm, the masters of the Gene Production Association tried researching a gene reagent capable of achieving this feat. However, even after a long time, there was no progress. Earlier, I checked with them. Even their research in the lifting of the awakened seal was stuck.\" Chen Feng explained, \"My production level is more or less the same as theirs. Even if I go over, I will be doing nothing but wasting my time.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit sunk into silence.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"Therefore, the only hope is Luck Aura. We must think of a way to trigger it. Even if it is for only a single moment, it will be sufficient.\" He had a feeling that something seemed odd with this upgrade of his Luck Aura, since it had remained inactive for way too long. It had been behaving too oddly, especially when he had been at Mysterious Town previously. When he had returned to the Primordial Era, Luck Aura had recovered for no apparent reason. If it was truly upgrading, how could it suddenly recover?</p><br/><p>There had to be a problem somewhere. Chen Feng contemplated deeply. However, as he thought of this, he blanked. True, when he had returned to the Primordial Era, Luck Aura seemed to return to its optimal state. What if he returned to the Primordial Era once again? Chen Feng was extremely tempted to try this. Suddenly, this seemingly hopeless undertaking of creating an awakened gene reagent had a sliver of hope.</p><br/><p>\"Kong Bai, please come over.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

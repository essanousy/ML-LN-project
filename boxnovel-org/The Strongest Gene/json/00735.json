Based on what Duma had said, his old friend had spent a lifetime researching healing and regenerative abilities. As such, the lizard bloodline he had left behind had an incredibly powerful fleshy body. So long as the potential of the body was unleashed, it would be sufficient to defeat even a dragon. Therefore, so long as Long Yue was transformed into a lizard and stayed transformed long enough for his body to adapt to the bloodline, all would be fine. This sounded so simple.</p><br/><p>Alas, a mishap had still happened in this seemingly fool-proof plan.</p><br/><p>\"Ao\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The furious Long Yue, with his bleeding chrysanthemum, leaped up, pounced on the stage, and destroyed the cannon there. Along the way, the entire building collapsed. Everyone sank into silence. This did not seem to be part of their plan?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"You guys have attacked too viciously.\" Those guys had fired the cannon straight at his chrysanthemum. How was that even a fake attack? That was definitely a fatal attack. In fact, Chen Feng wouldn't have been surprised even if Long Yue had been killed by that single attack. After all, he had yet to fully activate his lizard bloodline.</p><br/><p>One of the staffers there pointed at the screen in a flustered manner. \"Look.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over, and instantly, their expressions sank. On the screen, it could be seen that Long Yue had soared up and was charging toward the local Genetic Union branch. Evidently, he was planning to kill them now. The East Coast branch wasn't too far from the battlefield. If Long Yue's attack reached them\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone paled. With the cannon gone, they had no way of contending against Long Yue. However, surprisingly, it was at this instant that a huge figure appeared right before Long Yue arrived at the East Coast branch, blocking Long Yue's attack that was aimed toward the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>That was precisely the primordial dragon.</p><br/><p>\"Howl\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The dragon seemed rather pleased with the Genetic Union's performance thus far. He glanced over in the direction of the Genetic Union, a praising look in his eyes, evidently rather interested in the Genetic Union's previous chrysanthemum-blasting attack.</p><br/><p>\"Piss off!\" Long Yue shouted furiously.</p><br/><p>After the fatal attack he had received, Long Yue was now consumed by anger. With the combination of his past hatred and the new grudge he had with them, he vowed to eliminate the Genetic Union. Whoever dared get in the way of his revenge, he would eliminate.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the gene reagent he had been injected with started working. A never-ending source of power was given to him. However, the primordial dragon did not care and stopped Long Yue's attacks without stop, smashing Long Yue onto the ground without stop. At this moment, the terrifying strength of the dragon was revealed.</p><br/><p>The people of the Genetic Union were rather dumbstruck at this new development. This plot did not seem right. Their initial plan had been to help Long Yue fight the dragon. How had it changed to the dragon helping them against Long Yue?</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" When Duma heard about this, the first person he doubted was Chen Feng. \"Have you been using your godly power again?\"</p><br/><p>After all, he was clear on Chen Feng's identity.</p><br/><p>\"How is that possible?\" Chen Feng was truly innocent here. Since the primordial dragon was so powerful, the moment he used the godly power of the weakened Misfortune Goddess or Luck Goddess against the dragon, he would definitely be discovered. As such, Chen Feng dared not use them on the dragon. Even if he used them, he would only use them on Long Yue. His initial plan had indeed been to help Long Yue a bit with luck after Long Yue's recovery. Unexpectedly, things had developed this way instead.</p><br/><p>\"Can you still control the lizard?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Duma smiled bitterly. \"I don't know. I originally had rather great confidence in it, but due to the intense provocation the lizard has suffered, his emotions are very unstable now. I can't be sure if I can still control him or not. You guys\u2026 attacked too viciously.\"</p><br/><p>Duma felt rather helpless.</p><br/><p>Unstable?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced over at the lizard. The hatred emanating out of this fellow's eyes indeed seemed real. He had a deep hatred toward the Genetic Union, Chen Feng, Duma, and even the entirety of humanity. A person like this would be too difficult to control. Moreover, even if they were able to control him, after he fully awakened his lizard bloodline, would everything truly be fine? Not quite. Therefore, they might as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes gleamed coldly, and he didn't hesitate. \"Kill him! The primordial dragon is much intelligent than we imagined. Moreover, it has kindly reciprocated our attack toward Long Yue. This alone is sufficient. Rather, this Long Yue is the one incapable of separating friends and enemies\u2026 Since that's the case, let us change the plan: kill him first.\"</p><br/><p>\"How about the dragon?\" Duma was anxious. It was way too dangerous to allow this fellow, who was in fact equivalent to a god, to roam around during the Genetic Era.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"What is there to fear? So long as he leaves the East Coast, he can go roam about anywhere he wants. In any case, the times are changing. Let alone these primordial beasts, it won't be long before you can find gods everywhere as well. Can you even kill them all?\"</p><br/><p>Duma sank into silence. True. And thus, the Genetic Union's plan changed. The initial plan of assisting the lizard against the dragon had changed to assisting the dragon against the lizard.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng believed that with sufficient sincerity, with the intelligence the dragon had exhibited previously, he would be much more cooperative than the lizard. Chen Feng had confidence in this.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stood up. \"Let me help him.\" After all, Long Yue was not one to be killed off so easily. The dragon had been trying to kill him off for so long yet he still remained. Now that the Long Yue had absorbed the gene reagent, he could probably last even longer. This offered no benefit whatsoever to Chen Feng and the rest.</p><br/><p>\"Did you not say that the dragon will notice immediately if you use your godly power?\" Duma warned. The only reason they had even planned all this was because they had been afraid of having their godly powers detected by the dragon.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"That was in the past. To bait the fish, we naturally had to avoid the dragon's detection. However, now that we want to cooperate with him, we have to demonstrate a sufficient level of strength. I intend to show the dragon that us humans have access to godly powers as well!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stretched his hands out.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>From his left hand, faint misfortune power rippled out.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>From his right hand, faint luck power rippled out.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not have much godly power left. He had been slowly recovering his godly powers. Therefore, Duma was shocked by his display of using both godly powers at the same time. \"What are you planning to do? Don't you know that using luck and misfortune at the same time will cancel each other out?\" Duma reminded Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. \"Do you think I'm that stupid? If I were to use both on the same target, they would indeed cancel each other out. However, what if I use them on different targets? Heh, the effect will be quite surprising, especially when I use both concurrently.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He waved both his hands.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>His godly power waffled out. Without attempting to hide it, his luck power instantly enveloped the primordial dragon. The dragon that was in the midst of battle suddenly looked over at the Genetic Union. Clearly, he had detected this mysterious yet familiar power that caused a certain power within him to grow stronger. At the same time, he had also detected a rather sinister power enveloping the lizard.</p><br/><p>Luck caused the dragon to become even more valiant while misfortune caused the lizard to become even more miserable. These were two completely different powers. On top of that, in this situation, the lizard's misfortune was in fact the dragon's luck, and the dragon's luck was similarly misfortune for the lizard. As such, when both powers were used concurrently, a unique amplification and cycling effect was reached.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the dragon erupted with a terrifying strength in an incredibly momentous manner.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the lizard, Long Yue, was blasted away.</p><br/><p>Duma was alarmed. \"This\u2026\" He had personally witnessed how Chen Feng had merely lazily and slowly waved both his hands, causing godly power to ripple out. Just like that, the entire battlefield had been transformed. This\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Alas, he discovered that the clone did not die. Even after forming a new clone, the old clone was still not dead. That damnable clone was still staying in the so-called new kingdom.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cIs it because of the mud?\u201d So it turned out that this thing from the alien world was capable of truly severing their connection. Since that was the case, the only option left was a battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare for a war,\u201d Luo Yuan said coldly. He was aware of how strong he was, just as he was aware of how terrifying he could be in the future. As such, he would not give this clone of his a chance to grow. He had to immediately kill the clone. He could not afford to let his clone stay alive for too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan walked out of his palace. The entire Kingdom of Luo Yuan began operating as per his wishes. All the gods gathered together and followed behind Luo Yuan as they headed forward to conquer the so-called new country. An all-out war was about to erupt. Once again, this planet, which had enjoyed many years of peace, was shrouded in the fogs of war. Naturally, the half of the world not under Luo Yuan\u2019s control watched on with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard? There is an internal conflict in Luo Yuan\u2019s country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some did not believe this. This kingdom was centered around Luo Yuan, after all. Who would dare mess around?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you must not know of this yet. I heard that the rebel has already established his very own kingdom. Moreover, he possesses terrifying and unrivaled strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStronger than Luo Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. However, it is said that the rebel resembles Luo Yuan greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great resemblance in their voice and appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? In any case, a great show is about to unfold,\u201d that person narrated sneakily.</p><br/><p>As for the others, everyone was filled with joy. It seemed like this war was a result of Luo Yuan\u2019s mistake. Tsk tsk\u2026</p><br/><p>However, that was understandable. In this world, Luo Yuan was unrivaled. If there was an enemy, that enemy could only be himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how it feels to fight oneself?\u201d someone asked while sneering.</p><br/><p>Someone laughed wildly. \u201cWell, only our exalted Lord Luo Yuan will know this feeling. Hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were looking forward to this war. Perhaps, Luo Yuan would perish together with his other self? That would be the perfect ending. This was what many people were thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, within the new kingdom, the Lord Clone was calculating his current combat power. Countless underlings of him were trembling in fear. The reason? They had simply blindly followed \u201cLord Luo Yuan\u201d out to establish a new kingdom as he wished. They believed that this was just a new project of Lord Luo Yuan\u2019s. Unexpectedly, they had followed a bogus Lord Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>On that day, when Luo Yuan himself descended here, they had nearly collapsed from despair. So it turned out that they had followed a faker? And yet something scarier had happened. This lord here had actually blasted Lord Luo Yuan back whence he\u2019d come. What did that signify? That signified that this lord here wasn\u2019t any weaker than Luo Yuan was.</p><br/><p>Moreover, his appearance and voice\u2026 Everything was exactly the same as the other Luo Yuan. Confusion had started to arise about who the real Luo Yuan was. This confusion had lasted until rumors about the clone started spreading. Only then did they discover that this Lord Luo Yuan here was actually a clone. However, this was a terrifying clone that wasn\u2019t any weaker than the real body. Moreover, what they cared most about was the fact that this new lord here had not subjected them to any sort of monitoring. Rather, he had granted them the freedom to do what they wanted.</p><br/><p>That unique mud was capable of blocking the signals from the wristbands they wore. From that day onward, they had been free of the monitoring. They had become truly free.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can do what you want. Those willing to fight by my side, stay. Those unwilling, leave as soon as possible. In any case, if you guys hide in the various corners of the world, Luo Yuan will be too lazy to search you out one by one. Do take care if you select this option.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were the words of their new master. They who had been used to being unfeeling and obeying without question had actually been somewhat moved by these words.</p><br/><p>However, their feelings being moved was an entirely different matter. Despite that, they were still likely to flee at any time. That\u2019s right, this Lord Clone had been molded by the original Luo Yuan, possessing even the same memories. As such, even if he emerged victorious from this war, he might eventually make the same choices as the original Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>This was a battle between two Luo Yuans. If possible, they would not stay behind. And thus, news of something was spread. This clone was busy helping people flee and wasn\u2019t the least bothered with whether these people stayed behind to help him or not. This resulted in more and more people fleeing here from the Kingdom of Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>The clone easily liberated these refugees from Luo Yuan. After being moved by his actions, these refugees decided to leave quietly as well. And just like before, only the clone alone was left here. In the entirety of this new kingdom, there was only the clone himself.</p><br/><p>Everyone exclaimed in admiration. \u201cWhy is he even doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy else? To weaken Luo Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk. Luo Yuan weakening Luo Yuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suppose he has no choice. After all, nobody understands the real Luo Yuan better than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never cultivate cloning abilities in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is truly way too scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>As time passed, more and more people headed toward the clone to seek their freedom. The original Luo Yuan was naturally aware of this. However, he could not do much about it. His injuries were rather grave. After losing two clones in succession and forcefully forming a third, the power he had left wasn\u2019t much. As for the people that had defected to his clone, there were simply too many of them.</p><br/><p>There were so many of them that killing them all was somewhat impossible. As such, he could only watch blankly as they defected. Those damnable gods that had clearly been nurtured by him also headed to the clone to seek for freedom. They were truly seeking death!</p><br/><p>The number of people around Luo Yuan dropped without stop. Ultimately, by the time he finally reached the new kingdom, nearly 90% of his gods had defected. Those defectors had all been liberated by the clone.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan walked into this new kingdom. Everything appeared brand new in this country, yet it did not carry the aura of any living beings. In this huge country, only the clone himself remained. \u201cWhat is the point of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are also me, you should also know that it does not matter whether these gods live or die. The only one I care about is you. My only opponent is only you. After killing you, I can reinstate everything to how it was before,\u201d Luo Yuan said emotionlessly. So long as this traitor was killed, he would still remain the almighty king.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too idiotic. You are also too arrogant. Don\u2019t bother thinking of escaping. Since I am already here, the surroundings have naturally been sealed off. Don\u2019t bother thinking of killing me either. A new clone has already been formed. This time, I will not allow him to step foot on any alien worlds. I will make him stay here and kill you. Perhaps you have grown in strength somewhat, resulting in the misconception that you can actually contend against me. However, ultimately, I am still your master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash, a shiny silhouette appeared beside Luo Yuan. This was precisely the clone Luo Yuan had recently formed. Moreover, the aura emanating from this clone wasn\u2019t any weaker than Luo Yuan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this. I shall retrieve you. Let me see clearly what kind of ideas have formed in that brain of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan stepped out. He wanted to retrieve this defective clone. Alas, when he grabbed forth, a blank piece of nothingness welcomed his hand. That defector had transformed into countless particles and dissipated into the air. The defector that Luo Yuan had been talking to, the one seated atop the throne, had in fact been a corpse formed of purely energy particles. That was why, when Luo Yuan had grabbed forth, he hadn\u2019t been able to feel anything. So this clone had already been dead? Luo Yuan was stunned. What was going on now? He was truly at a loss now.</p></div>\n</div>"}

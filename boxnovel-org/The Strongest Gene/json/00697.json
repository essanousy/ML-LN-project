Thomas and the rest fully entered their resonator modes. Facing such an enemy, they had to give their all.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Layers upon layers of resonant power appeared.</p><br/><p>Battle!</p><br/><p>Thomas's battle intent surged.</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>The leopard dashed at them, incomparably savage with its formidable strength that caused one's heart to flutter. Thomas, Wu Liang, and the rest started fighting with the leopard.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou's entire body started blazing with flame. \"Dimensional lockdown!\" His godly power swirled around the leopard and everyone else, constantly weakening the leopard's attack and defense akin to a \"buffer.\" As for Wealthy Zhao, lots of illusory money was hovering in the air around him.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone could feel the energy within their body becoming boundless with a never-ending supply. Wealthy Zhao was also buffing these combatants.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The four started fighting with the leopard. Only Chen Feng was staying far away from the battlefield, staring at the leopard while his mouth mumbled without stop.</p><br/><p>Swish! Swish!</p><br/><p>Numerous rays of light shot out of his hand toward the battlefield. Thomas's and the rest waited patiently for Chen Feng to work his miracle.</p><br/><p>One minute.</p><br/><p>Two minutes.</p><br/><p>Three minutes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time they were all exhausted, they found that Chen Feng had still yet to come out with anything. Getting impatient, they asked, \"Chen Feng, where's your godly power?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm using it.\" Chen Feng vaguely explained, \"I am forcefully using the power of the Luck God to seal its godly power! Did you guys not notice that your opponent is not using any godly power at all?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances and realized that this was indeed true. So that was the case. It was no wonder that this leopard wasn't using any godly power. It turned out that this fellow's godly power had been sealed by Chen Feng? The Luck God was truly terrifying!</p><br/><p>Speaking with great difficulty, Chen Feng said, \"Hasten the battle. I don't know how long I can keep up the seal.\"</p><br/><p>The rest inhaled deeply. \"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Godly powers bloomed. Once again, they erupted with power. Once again, the stone in at the leopard's forehead started glowing. Perhaps the stone was finally feeling threatened, or perhaps it was simply too angered by these four idiots\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, the strength of the leopard underwent a transformation.</p><br/><p>The stone's thoughts: Seal my ass. Chen Feng is tricking you guys because you guys are all so gullible!</p><br/><p>In fact, the leopard had been using its godly power, the power of luck. Otherwise, where had the strength of this leopard originated from? Why had it evolved without stop? Alas, the power of luck had always been formless, causing them all to be unable to detect it. Did they not realize at all that the battle was getting more and more desperate?</p><br/><p>Indeed, they had not realized this. One could say that even if they did realize this, they would not relate this to godly power. When they saw the leopard's power increasing, they could only lament inwardly: Wow, this leopard is truly strong!</p><br/><p>Thomas was shaken. \"This leopard is actually so strong?\"</p><br/><p>It was so powerful even with its godly power being sealed by Chen Feng. If it had been allowed to use its godly power, perhaps they would have all been defeated long ago? It was no wonder that this stone had dared to lure them all here. How ruthless! How powerful!</p><br/><p>Wu Liang sneered. \"Looks like we have to put our lives on the line.\"</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao maintained his calm expression. \"Come at us, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know how much longer Chen Feng can hold on. Let's hasten this,\" Sakata Chuunibyou said.</p><br/><p>Standing not far away, Chen Feng was still mumbling without stop, an expression of utmost struggle on his face. His face somewhat pale as he seemingly unleashed the power of luck to seal this opponent's godly power with all his effort.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Once again, the four erupted with another bout of power. They knew that they had to deal with this leopard as soon as possible. Otherwise, the moment it broke free of the seal, they would surely die.</p><br/><p>Mysterious Stone: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The leopard's forehead started shining intensely. Finally, the stone had decided to show these idiots exactly how strong the godly power of luck was. It wanted to see how long Chen Feng would be able to continue pretending.</p><br/><p>The leopard howled.</p><br/><p>Ao\u2014</p><br/><p>Once again, it bathed in the radiance of luck. Once again, it evolved. Its level-five resonator realm increased once again.</p><br/><p>Thomas and the rest were overwhelmed with shock. \"How\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it!\" Chen Feng had an unsightly expression. \"Its godly power actually ignored my seal. The godly power of luck is only capable of sealing any powers with a probability of failing, even if the probability is only 0.001%. However, it is presently using a power with a 100% success rate. As such, even my power of luck is incapable of sealing it.\"</p><br/><p>\"I see.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's expression became solemn. True, Chen Feng's explanation of the usage of luck was indeed acceptable. But\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I reckon this will be a bitter battle.\"</p><br/><p>Thomas was no longer as arrogant as he was. This leopard had evolved two times thus far, truly exceeding their expectations. Even if he had the godly power of the War God, the present him was already at his limit. If this continued\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Liang was similarly frowning deeply as well.</p><br/><p>He was in a similar situation as Thomas. Even after using his godly power, this was already his limit. Yet this damnable leopard seemed to be capable of unending evolution.</p><br/><p>A similarly unsightly expression was on Chen Feng's face. \"Finish this as soon as possible. I feel like... my seal is not able to last much longer. \"</p><br/><p>\"I still have a trump card capable of increasing of all your godly powers by 30%,\" Wealthy Zhao said with a bitter smile. \"However, it can only last three seconds.\"</p><br/><p>Thirty percent? Everyone's heart trembled.</p><br/><p>A thirty percent increase in godly power? One ought to know that this was not a mere increase in strength. Rather, this was an increase in their origin, their godly power! Thirty percent of godly power would be able to dramatically increase their strength. But the limitation of three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>They all frowned. Could they truly deal with this leopard with just three seconds?</p><br/><p>\"I... I have a way of reducing this fellow's strength by half.\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou said anxiously, \"However, I don't know how long it can last.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a good chance.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes shone.</p><br/><p>\"If all this is used in conjunction with our trump cards\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Thomas and Wu Liang exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\"Let us begin!\"</p><br/><p>\"Condense!\"</p><br/><p>Illusory money flashed through Wealthy Zhao's hands as the power of the Prosperity God glowed, instantly increasing the strength of all of them.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou howled. \"Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Gold radiance shone around him, akin to a raging flame. His hair stood up, and in his right hand, an intense golden ball of light appeared.</p><br/><p>He pointed.</p><br/><p>\"Seal!\"</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>A godly power pierced through space and landed directly on the leopard. Instantly, the terrifying power of the leopard declined steeply. As for Thomas and Wu Liang, who had been waiting for an opening, they both unleashed their trump cards at this moment.</p><br/><p>With a hatchet, shattering space.</p><br/><p>With a sword, piercing the heavens.</p><br/><p>Instantly, they both unleashed their strongest trump cards for this one single instant of vulnerability.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A dazzling radiance shone upon the world, and a split second later, it dimmed.</p><br/><p>On the ground, two deep gorges were left. This was the aftermath of the godly power attacks, akin to the work of nature itself.</p><br/><p>\"Dead?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over.</p><br/><p>At the spot where the two gorges interwove stood the leopard. On its body were two injuries.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered around. The leopard collapsed loudly. Ultimately, it was still a mere regular leopard. Even with the power of luck increasing its realm dramatically, the resonance realm was its limit. As for its combat power\u2026 in truth, without the assistance of the power of luck, this leopard would have been killed instantly. Its main body was too weak.</p><br/><p>\"Done!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was ecstatic.</p><br/><p>They had succeeded! With Chen Feng's godly power of luck's sealing, Wealthy Zhao's godly power of wealth's buffing, Sakata Chuunibyou's godly power of dimensions' weakening the leopard, and the full eruption of the godly powers of Thomas and Wu Liang, this leopard that was much stronger than them had been finally defeated. Godly powers were indeed powerful.</p><br/><p>At this time.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The stone glowed with a weak radiance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

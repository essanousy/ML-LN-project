This was absolutely the most ordinary gene reagent Chen Feng had ever produced in his career. It had not been produced with the best or a unique blood essence, nor had the formula been improved by luck value. This giant-elephant fusion gene reagent was so ordinary one couldn't even hope to find anything special about it.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai sighed. \"Are you really going to fuse with this gene reagent?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Mhm.\" This gene reagent was already produced with the best giant elephant blood essence he could find. This fusion gene reagent didn't have any major functions. After using it, the gene would merely fuse with Chen Feng's body, improving his body quality greatly.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai smiled bitterly. \"You\u2026\" This thing was rather simple to understand. Chen Feng's previous efforts had been skewed toward spiritual energy. Nine-tenths of his specialization was spiritual energy, while one-tenth of his specialization was body quality. After fusing with a body-related gene reagent instead of a spiritual energy-related gene reagent this time, the ration would become 6:4 between energy and body. Naturally, 5:5 might be the end result as well. More importantly, selecting this gene reagent might signify that Chen Feng could never use a 6-star secret art.</p><br/><p>One ought to know that every single 6-star secret art was something that centered around a certain gene. A huge factor influencing one's choice in one's core gene was due to the 6-star secret art that person decided upon. Since this giant elephant gene had been obtained from this alien world, it was possible that this gene would be incapable of working together with other genes to form 6-star secret arts. The difficulty would be further compounded by the fact that all the other genes Chen Feng had fused with in the past were energy based.</p><br/><p>After selecting this gene, Chen Feng would never be able to use secret arts. Naturally, since Chen Feng was already powerful, this disadvantage might not be immediately obvious. But what about in the future? When everyone was in peak beyond A class, when everyone had reached the limit of humanity, the bottleneck of humanity, the only way one could hope to obtain an advantage over others was through one's genetic abilities.</p><br/><p>At that time, the gap between a 5-star secret art and 6-star secret art would be as huge as the sky and the Earth. Even if Chen Feng had been focusing on individual abilities, with him lacking a core ability to rely upon\u2026 Kong Bai shook his head at the thought.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swirled around. Chen Feng completed his fusion. This fusion was so ordinary that nothing special could be found from it. Such a breakthrough was so ordinary that not even a special phenomenon was generated upon breakthrough. Everything seemed way too bland.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng cast his senses inward and sensed the power within him. Mhm\u2026 the quality of his body had roughly tripled.</p><br/><p>His body quality, which had originally only been B class, had successfully improved to A class. Even if it wasn't much among A classes, at the very least, his defense had increased greatly compared to before. He was able to take more of a beating now.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><br/><p>The dangers of the forest remained. Kong Bai and Chen Feng continued dodging wave after wave of attacks upon them.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked at Chen Feng. \"What do we do next?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the distant giant elephant. \"Kill! Since I have fused with the giant-elephant gene reagent, I will fully make use of it, pushing the gene-strengthening process to the end.\"</p><br/><p>Gene strengthening was a process where one selected a mutated beast with higher attributes than the genetic warrior and then plundered the attributes of the mutated beast that were higher than the genetic warrior's. This was the process of improvement most familiar to most genetic warriors.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai nodded. \"All right.\" This was most certainly the reason Chen Feng had decided to give up on his future and focus on the present, to increase his strength as soon as possible before escaping this dangerous and damnable place. However, Kong Bai failed to notice that the giant elephants they faced seemed to be becoming stronger and stronger\u2026</p><br/><p>Beyond A1\u2026</p><br/><p>Beyond A2\u2026</p><br/><p>Beyond A3\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, eventually, Kong Bai realized that something seemed off. The mutated beasts seemed endless in this damnable forest, and their strength was increasing constantly as well. Regardless of how many beasts they killed, it seemed to serve no purpose.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was alarmed. \"How many of these fellows are there?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\" Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"But then, isn't this the best opportunity to increase my strength?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another giant elephant was killed, and once again, Chen Feng completed the gene-strengthening process.</p><br/><p>One time.</p><br/><p>Two times.</p><br/><p>Three times.</p><br/><p>As the mutated beasts appeared without stop, Chen Feng's strength increased without stop as well. This was a rapid improvement in the truest sense. Regardless of where one was, one would never be able to see such a huge number of mutated beasts, and mutated beasts that would actually increase in strength at that. This seemed like a perfect strength-increase service prepared especially for Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Beyond A5\u2026</p><br/><p>Beyond A6\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Now, even Kong Bai was no longer able to deal with the appearing enemies.</p><br/><p>Despite that, Chen Feng, who had previously been beyond A1 class, had actually managed to forcefully reach beyond A5 from gene strengthening alone. This was indeed a frightening speed, a speed that caused Kong Bai to be speechless. For the very first time, he wondered if Chen Feng's choice of fusing with the giant-elephant gene wasn't the wrong choice after all.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The battle in the forest continued. Numerous giant elephants died in battle as Chen Feng's strength increased without stop.</p><br/><p>Beyond A7!</p><br/><p>Beyond A8!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's strength increased constantly. After half a month of this, Kong Bai alarmingly noticed that Chen Feng had actually reached the peak of beyond A class. That's right, in half a month, Chen Feng reached the peak of beyond A class.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai was dumbfounded. He gazed blankly at the corpses of the giant elephants that were sprawled everywhere. It seemed like this was the actual reason Chen Feng had decided on this gene? Because these giant elephants were everywhere? The process of reaching peak beyond A class, which would take someone around 30 or even 50 years, had been shortened by Chen Feng to a mere 15 days. This speed was so fast that no words could be used to describe it aptly.</p><br/><p>One ought to know that in the genetic world, in the genetic era, beyond-A-class mutated beasts were rather rare. It was basically impossible for beyond A classes to improve by way of gene strengthening, as suitable mutated beasts were basically impossible to find. As such, they had no choice but to grow in strength slowly.</p><br/><p>To reach beyond A2 from beyond A1, around three to five years would be required. To reach beyond A3 from beyond A2, an even longer period would be required. As such, reaching beyond A9 was a long process. That was why even with the huge amount of beyond A classes appearing thanks to beyond X gene reagent, they were still unable to catch up to the older, original beyond A classes.</p><br/><p>The gap between the new and the old was extremely huge. Yet when it came to Chen Feng, his speed of growth had truly alarmed Kong Bai.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Distantly, a peak beyond-A-class giant beast appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Let me deal with it.\" Kong Bai took the initiative to attack.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A bizarre vibration flashed out.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai's attack was ineffective. Instead, he was directly flung away by that giant beast. This was a beast whose Kong Bai had no hope of matching. This beast was way too powerful for him.</p><br/><p>\"Let me do it instead.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took wide steps forward and easily beat that giant beast up. He had already been someone capable of challenging those of a higher rank before this. Now that he was a peak beyond A class, it was an extremely simple affair to deal with a beast at this level.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The giant beast collapsed loudly.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it.\" Kong Bai was filled with envy. \"I feel like fusing with a giant elephant gene myself as well.\"</p><br/><p>Future? Screw that. Such quick growth\u2026 Even if a part of this speed had to do with Chen Feng's existing prowess, this rapid growth was something Kong Bai had never witnessed before. If all of humanity could grow at such a speed\u2026</p><br/><p>What was a mere ancient race? What was a mere devil race? Both could be eliminated easily.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stretched. \"Finally, I have reached the peak.\" He could sense the powerful strength contained within his body. Even if this giant elephant gene didn't have a powerful genetic ability, the gene-strengthening processes Chen Feng had spammed without stop had pushed all his attributes to an unimaginable height.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a single wave of his hand, a force so powerful that it was akin to an explosion could be felt. With one proper genetic ability as a cost, Chen Feng had amassed such high attributes and reached the peak of the food chain.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Well then\u2026 it's time to start.\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai blanked. \"The start of what?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled mysteriously. \"You will know soon enough.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

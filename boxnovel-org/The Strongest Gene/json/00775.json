As the others around heard this, they felt somewhat ashamed. True, he only wanted to become stronger. They shouldn\u2019t have assumed that he had poor talent just because they had failed to push him into the apostle realm. How could his heaven-defying talent be considered poor?</p><br/><p>At this time, the minor god who was looking on from a distance was also thoroughly stupefied. He had known that Chen Feng was rather strong. However, he had never expected that Chen Feng was so strong that he could even defeat a veteran apostle with a single punch. This Chen Feng\u2026 The minor god\u2019s heart trembled as he thought about this. He knew that after this battle, Chen Feng\u2019s name would be known far and wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what all the apostles there were thinking. Even Shi Yong, a veteran apostle, had failed to receive a single attack from Chen Feng. This fellow was much more terrifying than they had initially imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d a certain apostle suddenly said, \u201cif you can\u2019t break through even with this, then there is no hope for you to break through, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone was startled from their reverie. True, if even this many gods couldn\u2019t help him break through, what hope did he have? Was Chen Feng strong? Yes. However, this was already his limit. As for apostles\u2026 The apostle realm was a unique stage, as it was the strongest realm below godhood. Theoretically, an apostle could increase his strength without limit. So long as the apostle was strong enough, there would be no limit to their growth. The apostle could continue pressing on toward the realm of the gods, pushing on without limit until, one day, they became a god.</p><br/><p>This was the ultimate dream of nearly every apostle. As for a resonator? This would be impossible. Level 10 resonance was the peak of the realm, their limit. Apart from that, only their talent could grant them some extra strength beyond this limit. However, to continuously improve in this manner would be too difficult. This was probably the furthest Chen Feng would ever reach.</p><br/><p>At this thought, for reasons unknown, the apostles present all heaved a sigh of relief. The future strongest apostle? The number one existence below the gods? No, that would not happen. It was quite probable that there weren\u2019t any gods capable of helping him break through.</p><br/><p>Today, more than a hundred major gods had come here. This was a gathering of nearly all of the comparatively powerful gods in existence. However, not a single one had succeeded. How could this Chen Feng have any sort of future?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the thought of a lot of the gods there. If so powerful a resonator were to become an apostle\u2026 The gods sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a cold voice resounded. \u201cCan I give it a try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instinctively, everyone turned around. When they saw the owner of the voice, their expressions changed greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Zero?\u201d they all cried out in alarm. Zero was a major god with formidable strength. Furthermore, he was a subsidiary god of the Sin God. For him to have appeared here\u2026 Could it be that this Chen Feng had even attracted the attention of the Sin God? The mere thought caused them all to be incomparably shocked.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Zero tried inserting his godly power into Chen Feng. However, it only persisted shortly. After sensing his godly power vanishing, he stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour power is very weird.\u201d Zero gave it some thought and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that no gods are capable of helping you break through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua\u2014</p><br/><p>Everyone clamored as they heard this. Not a single god could help him? As a representative of the Sin God, these words were no different than the death penalty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, so what if you are strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yong appeared elated. Even though Chen Feng was stronger, he had no future. He would be forever stuck at this stage. Eventually, he would die of old age.</p><br/><p>\u201cPitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some apostles took joy in this. Toward this excessively stunning counterpart, a lot of them held no small amount of envy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is how it should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the heavens are still fair. At the same time he was granted his freakish talent, his future was also severed, haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>These were the thoughts of many of the people there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chen Feng replied after taking in a deep breath. With this fake nascent soul, it was impossible for him to become an apostle. Moreover, the nascent soul had seemingly reached its limit. Earlier, when he had been absorbing Zero\u2019s godly power, he had been able to clearly sense that the miniature person within him no longer was no longer improving in any way. He had already reached his limit. Physically, he was at the peak of the resonance realm, and inwardly, his fake nascent soul had already reached the great-circle stage.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng found that he was indeed stuck at some sort of limit. As such, he had no choice but to ascertain whether he could still improve. He was not willing to stop here. How, exactly, was he supposed to continue improving?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed inwardly. \u201cMy plans have crashed with the reality after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>His initial plan had been to trick the gods into supplying him with godly power. Yet now, having reached the limit of the godly power he could absorb, his lies had transformed into reality. He had indeed become as strong as the strongest of apostles. This was initially a lie he had spread. Yet now, he was truly stuck at this level.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this my retribution for all my lies?\u201d His heart ached. Had he tricked way too many gods, to the point that his fate was now tricking him as well? Without Misfortune and Luck by his side, his future was unclear. He could only try progressing with his own effort. However, this was predicated on his path forward not being a dead end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will be stuck here,\u201d the apostles around him said in low voice. After being sure of this, their gazes when looking at Chen Feng were filled with sympathy. All the jealousy and competitiveness vanished like puffs of smoke. What purpose was there in competing against a person without a future?</p><br/><p>Some prepared to leave. \u201cLet us disperse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods also prepared to leave. Since Chen Feng\u2019s future was already fixed, there was no point in staying behind. However, just as they were about to leave, Zero suddenly said, \u201cWith your present strength, are you interested in taking on the trial of godhood ascension?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>This sentence was like the loudest of peals of thunder as it rumbled in the minds of all the gods here. Trial\u2026 Godhood ascension? This little fella? This\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d the apostles cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>One ought to know that only the strongest of apostles, those widely known, those experts with reputations reaching far and wide were qualified to take on the trial of godhood ascension, to try to become a supreme god. Regardless of success or failure, the act of participating in a trial of godhood ascension was in itself the greatest glory an apostle could ever have. And now Chen Feng would be participating in such a trial?</p><br/><p>The apostles collapsed emotionally as they thought of this. A short while ago, they had still been looking down on Chen Feng due to his lack of a future. Never had they expected that this resonator that could not be an apostle would actually reach such height. Suddenly, they felt like they were the jokes rather than Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Chen Feng could not be an apostle. However, it was never a fixed fact that only apostles could try their hand at godhood ascension. So long as one was sufficiently powerful, any life-form could try. Chen Feng had proved with his own hands that he was not lacking compared to any of the apostles. This signified that he was only one step away from godhood. He did not need to try to resonate with other gods. The moment he succeeded in his challenge, he would directly skip past the apostle realm and ascend to godhood!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

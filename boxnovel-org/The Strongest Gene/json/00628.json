This was the information the Research Agency had obtained from the ancient Land of Legacy. The information was rather blurry, yet the verdict pointed to something dreadful.</p><br/><p>\"That Duma is actually\u2026\" Fear appeared on the deputy president's face as he suddenly asked, \"How long ago did they leave?\"</p><br/><p>\"Half a day.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026Got it.\" The deputy president sighed. Anyone who entered the Land of Legacy would lose contact with the outside world. New information was obtained, yet they had no way of transmitting it to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"What should we do?\" The assistant was anxious. If something happened to Chen Feng and the president in there\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Trust him.\" The deputy president forced himself to calm down. \"This child, Chen Feng, has created so many miracles throughout his rise. I believe he will be successful this time as well. After all, he is humanity's sole S class. Even if this guy is his opponent\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He flipped open the information in his hand. There, a picture of a huge life-form could be seen, and by the right side of that life-form was detailed introduction on that life0form.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng\u2026 Both you and the president must return alive,\" the deputy president muttered.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At present, in the distant Land of Legacy, Chen Feng and Qin Hai were engaged in a huge battle against the president and the rest. These opponents were very powerful. Regardless of whether it was the president, Tianyu Liming, or Qin Hai's apprentice brothers, they had originally been peak beyond A classes. After fusing with the pink power, their strength had increased dramatically. Alas, it was a pity that regardless of how strong they got, they were still not S classes, not awakened.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pointed midair. \"Destroy!\"</p><br/><p>A formidable power of disintegration bloomed, instantly destroying all abilities. This was his present strength. Even though when facing an opponent of his level, only spatial abilities could be destroyed in this fashion, these lower-level abilities used here were in a completely different league than him. A power below the awakened realm was too weak next to him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng hovered up. \"Let this end.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power erupted. By himself, he faced everyone yet was still able to maintain absolute superiority. Apart from peculiar abilities like what Master Mu had, he did not fear these people.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, the battle escalated. Qin Hai was thinking of giving him a hand, yet with astonishment, he found that there was no need for his assistance. The present Chen Feng was too powerful.</p><br/><p>The president and the rest were all peak beyond A classes. Coupled with the power of pink that they had fused with, they were already pseudo S classes. Therefore, their strength was not something one could underestimate. Yet Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>With a single punch!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The president was flung away.</p><br/><p>Regardless of what attack he faced, what ability he faced, or how strong the attack was, before Chen Feng, nothing could escape that single fist of his. His fist appeared extremely normal, yet every single punch brought about an astonishing effect.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai was shocked. \"Is this the power of an awakened?\" But then, how was this possible? Chen Feng, who had almost fallen under Master Mu's control earlier, was so powerful now? One ought to know that the strength of all these people combined was much greater than that of Senior Mu earlier.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The battle ended shortly after. By the time Chen Feng stopped, the president and the rest were already lying on the ground. From the start, Chen Feng hadn't used many abilities or technique as he had delivered them a one-sided beating.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai sighed. \"Awakened\u2026\" He had still underestimated this realm after all.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed heartily. \"Back then, before I gained an understanding of how to control awakened power, I received quite a lot of beatings as well. Now that I have grasped a certain level of control over the awakened power, it is natural that it's my turn to beat others up.\" This was what one could call suppression from a higher realm. Even those pseudo-awakened ones were still unable to use the awakened power, similar to the previous Chen Feng who had been clueless in terms of how to control awakened power.</p><br/><p>As such, facing Chen Feng, these people here were simply delivering themselves to Chen Feng on a silver platter. The awakened power Chen Feng had comprehended was sufficient to disintegrate all their abilities, rendering everything ineffective. The premise for this was that the attacks first had to have some weakness he could exploit. As long as it was a traditional attack, regardless of whether it was a spatial attack, elemental attack, or some other ability, anything Chen Feng could actually see, he had no fear of facing it with brute force alone.</p><br/><p>His present power of disintegration, the power he had gained by becoming an awakened, was something that gave him confidence even when facing people at his level. What Chen Feng feared most were those abilities that couldn't be seen, those with no actual form or shape. Facing those abilities, even if it was unleashed by someone of a lower realm, it might still pose him a threat. An example was the ability of that Senior Mu.</p><br/><p>That Senior Mu was obviously a mere peak beyond A class, yet with his white diamond and the pink energy, the unleashed power had nearly caused Chen Feng to fall.</p><br/><p>\"You shouldn't have any other apprentice brothers with those abilities, right?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>\"Nope.\" Qin Hai shook his head and looked at the collapsed apprentice brothers of his, who were all lying on the ground. \"Those of the Land of Legacy were already low in number. And back then, some of them were killed off by you as well. At present, these are the only ones left here. In there, I reckon only Master is left.\"</p><br/><p>Master\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled something. Duma?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He raised his head abruptly. In front, around 100 meters from them, was the center of the Land of Legacy. A trace of a dangerous aura was already leaking out as an alarming power spread out of it.</p><br/><p>Duma\u2026</p><br/><p>That old man?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took a deep breath. He had no idea if he was an opponent of that Duma. Yet from the enemies they had encountered thus far, the enemy seemed to be worried that they would intrude upon the center, right? If so, it was certain that the enemy was not capable of insta-killing him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. After all, if that Duma was truly excessively powerful, he could easily insta-kill them both. There was no need to use such methods to stop their advance. Either Duma was too weak\u2026 or he was presently occupied with something else and couldn't deal with them. Chen Feng and Qin Hai exchanged glances, both agreeing with this possibility.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng lacked any hesitation. \"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai nodded. \"Mhm.\" He was also curious about what exactly his master was planning by doing all this. The two of them advanced prudently. This time, nobody else appeared to stop them.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>They pushed the immense pink door open and finally entered the depths of the Land of Legacy. Yet the scene they saw gave them an immense shock. Before coming, they had prepared for numerous possibilities. Perhaps they would have to fight it out with this Duma, whose condition was unknown, putting their lives on the line. Regardless of what conspiracy was waiting for them, they were prepared to face it. They were already fully prepared for a bitter battle.</p><br/><p>And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Not even in their wildest dreams had they imagined that this would be the Duma they would see. The old man appeared as kind as ever, seemingly appearing exactly the same as before. Yet from the pink beard, pink eyebrow, and pink clothes\u2026 it was clear that even Duma had fallen under the control of the pink power.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai's eyes widened. \"Master?\" He did not dare to believe this. He could understand his fellow apprentice brothers and sisters falling; however, how could an existence like his master\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hiss\u2014\" Chen Feng took in a deep breath in shock as well. He had truly wished dearly that all this was the doing of this Duma. Perhaps his cultivation had gone astray, or perhaps he had gone crazy from dressing up as a female, or for any other reason. It would be fine if all this had been the doing of Duma.</p><br/><p>Why? Because if Duma wasn't behind all this, that signified that behind Duma\u2026 there was be an even more terrifying existence!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

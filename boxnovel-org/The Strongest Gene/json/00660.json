As Chen Feng thought of this, his entire body became drenched with cold sweat. He had nearly fallen to this trick. Fortunately, when Chen Jianguo had been on the verge of doubting him, Mrs. Chen, who should have been feeding the baby in the room, had arrived outside and solved this crisis for him.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. This Mrs. Chen perfectly fit the image of a perfect mother in Chen Feng's heart. All along the journey, she had displayed great concern for his well-being. Chen Feng couldn't help being moved by the concern she had shown. If he truly had such a mother by his side\u2026</p><br/><p>Alas, he had to endure it. He could not be the one to change the past.</p><br/><p>\"Hu\u2014\"</p><br/><p>He shut both his eyes, trying to calm his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he frowned. The instant he had shut his eyes, with his powerful senses, he had noted that on his neck was a faint purple dot, so small one could easily miss it.</p><br/><p>\"Weird\u2026 when did this appear?\" Chen Feng shook his head. After casting his senses toward it and finding that it did not seem harmful and was merely a faint coloration, he shook his head and forgot about it. Perhaps this was a side effect of descending upon this world. At present, he had no intention of courting unnecessary trouble.</p><br/><p>He should wait calmly as Mrs. Chen finished feeding the baby before leaving. After a while, Chen Feng's senses were cast everywhere. With vigilance, he observed every single person in the vicinity. He paid great attention to what they were saying, as he could not allow them to further the previous discussion.</p><br/><p>There's also Chen Jianguo. Since Mrs. Chen was feeding the baby, it would be inconvenient for Chen Feng to cast his senses toward her. However, he ensured that his attention was fully on this fellow, especially since this guy was once again talking about his son.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng watched on silently. Suddenly, someone called out to him. \"Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes?\" Chen Feng opened his eyes and found with astonishment that it was actually Mrs. Chen that had appeared beside him. At present, she was gazing at him with deep emotions.</p><br/><p>Hold on\u2026</p><br/><p>She seemed to have called him Chen Feng?</p><br/><p>Damn it! Chen Feng cursed inwardly.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Just as Chen Feng was about to say something.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen pointed at the baby in her embrace and gently said, \"Chen Feng. I'm saying his name is Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" At this, Chen Feng heaved a sigh of relief, realizing that Mrs. Chen was here to pass him the baby. \"You are done?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen nodded, yet there was still a trace of worry about her.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry. The baby will definitely be delivered safely,\" Chen Feng promised.</p><br/><p>\"I have no doubt about that.\" Suddenly, Mrs. Chen said, \"What I'm worried about is, do you think this baby will be very ugly when he grows up in the future?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng felt somewhat awkward as he answered, \"Oh, I doubt it.\"</p><br/><p>\"After all, his dad is somewhat ugly.\" Mrs. Chen was anxious. \"If he resembles his dad, it will be troublesome.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What the hell? Wouldn't it be even more troublesome if the baby instead did not resemble the dad? Mrs. Chen was being somewhat excessive here! Instantly, Chen Feng felt the image of a perfect mother collapsing. This mother... was too mischievous!</p><br/><p>\"Do you think that this child will be able to find a wife in the future?\" Mrs. Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" Chen Feng was stupefied. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen was very anxious. \"I heard that the imbalance of the numbers in both genders is increasing. I wonder if it's because I haven't been feeding this baby much milk for the past two days, but I feel like he hasn't been fed well enough, stunting his growth somewhat. How is he supposed to find a girlfriend in the future with stunted growth?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's face darkened. What stunted growth? Dear Mom, this is your son you're talking about here!</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry.\" Chen Feng gnashed his teeth. \"He will grow into a fine young man.\"</p><br/><p>\"If so, I won't be worrying that much anymore,\" Mrs. Chen said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Was this truly his biological mother? Chen Feng rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\"If so\u2026I will pass him on to you.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen passed the baby to Chen Feng carefully.</p><br/><p>\"Feng Er, please do take care\u2026 in the future,\" Mrs. Chen said to the baby in Chen Feng's embrace. Instantly, Chen Feng's body stiffened. From this angle, from this direction, these words caused great waves in his emotions.</p><br/><p>\"Goodbye.\" With the baby, Chen Feng's body flickered and vanished. Just like that, Mrs. Chen watched on blankly until she could no longer see them.</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo walked over and sighed. \"Has the baby been given to him?\" He was still somewhat anxious. He knew that if this \"Qin Hai\" actually wanted to snatch his child, it would be way too easy for him.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen nodded. \"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo sighed. \"Hopefully he can safely deliver the baby.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen glared at him and ignored him. Instead, she directly returned to the room.</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Why had this pen been taken out?\" Chen Jianguo asked as he saw the cinnabar pen on the table. This had been excavated during their previous archaeology assignment and was seemingly useless. The pen's only function was to leave a mark on a human body, a mark that could not be erased no matter what. Apart from that, this pen was useless.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, I merely found it accidentally when rearranging the luggage earlier,\" Mrs. Chen said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Is that so?\" Chen Jianguo muttered. He looked at the pen before saying, \"Even the lid wasn't put back on. Who used the pen this time?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Mrs. Chen smiled and continued looking at something.</p><br/><p>\"What are you looking at?\" Chen Jianguo glanced over curiously and noted that she was looking at the weather forecast.</p><br/><p>\"What's so interesting about this? The Weather Bureau chief is my ex-classmate. Before coming, I already checked with him. The following month will be a dry season,\" Chen Jianguo said proudly.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, it's your ex-classmate,\" Mrs. Chen grumbled, and she continued reading.</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo glanced over and noticed that this time, she was looking at the topography of Qinghe Mountain.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you looking at this?\" He was feeling curious. \"Why are you behaving oddly today? Is it because of that kid called Qin Hai? His superpower? We who dabble in archaeology should be much more receptive toward the existence of superpowers, right?\" Chen Jianguo curled his lip. \"It's only that we never expected that such a thing actually exists for real, and for us to even have such a person protecting us. Seems like they are looking quite highly upon this project of ours.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen merely sneered. \"Hehe.\" She continued flipping past the book in her hand until she reached the page detailing the disaster caused by a heavy downpour at Qinghe Mountain 50 years ago.</p><br/><p>\"How far are the nearest reinforcements from here?\" Mrs. Chen asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo chuckled. \"There's no reinforcements. We are so far away from civilization. If something truly happens, only helicopters can reach this place to mount a rescue mission.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that so?\" Mrs. Chen shut her eyes and said, \"In that case, I finally understood.\"</p><br/><p>She shut the book in silence. Chen Jianguo placed his hand on her forehead, appearing somewhat anxious. \"Do you have a fever? You are behaving so oddly. Do you want to see a doctor?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Mrs. Chen ignored him and suddenly said, \"Jianguo, I have a question. You must answer me seriously.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo blanked. \"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"If\u2026 the past is changed, will the future change as well?\" Mrs. Chen asked softly.</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo was dumbstruck. \"What kind of a question is this?\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen spoke solemnly. \"Answer me after thinking thoroughly. This is a very important question.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\" Chen Jianguo pondered for a while before saying. \"Definitely.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Mrs. Chen shut her eyes and said, \"I understand now.\"</p><br/><p>Can't change, huh\u2026</p><br/><p>She recalled the first time she had seen \"Qin Hai,\" the complicated expression in his eyes, the anticipation, the pain, the melancholy, and the conflict\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Jianguo, I feel like our child will be an amazing person in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"Keh, can he be even more amazing than me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>\"What kind of a response is this? But then, why are you suddenly happy? Earlier, you were still mumbling incessantly. What's going on, exactly?\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't have to worry about this.\"</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026 forget it. Oh, right, earlier, Old Zhang suddenly went crazy. He said that we don't have to start working today and can go have a meal at the foot of the mountain instead,\" Chen Jianguo said suddenly.</p><br/><p>\"Have a meal? Sudden suggestion?\" Mrs. Chen's eyes widened. \"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\" Chen Jianguo was curious as well. \"I keep feeling that Old Zhang is behaving oddly today. Previously, he was the one who mentioned that the kid looks like my son\u2026 and then he suddenly suggested we go down the mountain to have a meal\u2026 But since he has requested it, we have to give him face. Let's go down together,\" Chen Jianguo said, not too bothered about it.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen seemed to have thought of something, as suddenly she shook her head. \"No.\" With a resolute gaze, she said, \"We must start our work today. This is the assignment given by the higher-ups. If we want to celebrate\u2026 we shall do it by having a good meal after the completion of this project.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Jianguo looked conflicted. \"But\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen was resolute. \"I said, today, we must start our work!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fine, today then.\" Chen Jianguo smiled bitterly and took out a case from his bosom. \"This is something the Qin Hai fellow gave me earlier, telling me to give it to you. He even mentioned that you can only open it near dawn.\"</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen's eyes shone. \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shall we take a look at what's inside?\" Chen Jianguo urged.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Chen shook her head. \"Since he mentioned that we should only open it at dawn, we will do as he wishes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why must we listen to that kid?\" Chen Jianguo said sourly.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you being jealous of some kid?\" Mrs. Chen chuckled. \"Don't worry. I will not open it without you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who cares?\" Chen Jianguo curled his lip and mumbled, \"Why are you all behaving so oddly today?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Mrs. Chen gazed into the distance, a smile on her lips.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

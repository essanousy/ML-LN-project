Since the secret was already out, he had to face what was to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already finished our preparations,\u201d said Ming Yue. \u201cAt the very least, they won\u2019t be able to enter this world through other channels.\u201d</p><br/><p>This alien world had been completely sealed off. When Ming Yue and Shen Wang joined hands, their strength had increased greatly. Even Xiao Ying, who shared a contract of life and death with her, had benefited from this, greatly growing in strength as well. Working together, Ming Yue and Shen Wang had thoroughly sealed this world off. At the very least, they could now ensure that a clone like Chen Yuan would not be able to enter. This was the sole advantage Chen Feng had left.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yuan\u2019s goal is to be the world controller. Having stopped him from obtaining misfortune and time, his next step will most definitely be me.\u201d Chen Feng was certain of this. \u201cTherefore, we sealed this alien world up, stopping his clone from entering. Naturally, if it\u2019s his real body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances. If it was the real body, they truly wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. After all, Luo Yuan\u2019s real body was too powerful. The seal placed on this world would not be able to stop his advance. Regardless, if he came with his real body, they would have no choice but to engage in a decisive battle with him here. If that happened, the result would either be their side\u2019s victory or mutual annihilation.</p><br/><p>If required, Chen Feng would not mind destroying the entire alien world and dying together with Luo Yuan. This was also why Luo Yuan had never dared to enter personally. There was a chance that he would die together with Chen Feng. If this alien world was destroyed while he was inside, it would be the end of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, he will definitely not come personally. However, he will probably try other methods. Perhaps he will send some unique clones that are stronger, or clones that possess the same strength as him, or something else that is similarly unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the conclusion Chen Feng had reached. This was also the most likely thing to happen.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan nodded in agreement. \u201cThat should be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>All other possibilities they could think of had been rejected. Continue to look for comprehension of world creation from an alien world? Luo Yuan did not have such a world. Therefore, his goal would most certainly be Chen Feng. With Luo Yuan\u2019s nature, after discovering Chen Feng, he would likely try to do something he wouldn\u2019t normally do. Therefore, this would be yet another bitter struggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Yuan, list all your guesses of what he might do. Do not miss a single one,\u201d Chen Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Chen Yuan had a solemn expression. Since this pertained to his life, he had to take this seriously. And thus, Chen Feng, Chen Yuan, Ming Yue, and even Wang Chun started discussing Luo Yuan\u2019s possible choices. Also discussed was Chen Feng\u2019s rapid growth. It was quite possible that the next battle would also be the final one.</p><br/><p>At least, this was what they thought would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. However, you have to increase your strength as rapidly as possible as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone voiced their opinions. Every single possibility, every single idea, every single possible conclusion was discussed. With this alien world as the center, a game of chess was played. In this game, they tried to encircle Luo Yuan, to checkmate him in every possible way. Even the assistance of Qin Hai and the rest was taken into consideration in their planning.</p><br/><p>Because of that, everyone was gathered in this world. To do this, Wang Chun had to make a huge sacrifice. Several lively girls had to sign contracts of life and death with these fellows to enable them to enter this world. The mere thought of this caused incomparable pain in Wang Chun\u2019s heart. He felt like his head would be eternally green now. After all, this world was supposed to be his harem!</p><br/><p>Granted, Kong Bai\u2019s appearance here taught the girls that Wang Chun was actually quite dashing, but one should not forget that Qin Hai and Xu Fei also entered this world.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun gnashed his teeth. \u201cWhat are you guys looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei laughed dryly. \u201cHehe.\u201d This place was simply heaven. Tsk tsk. Why couldn\u2019t he have this ability as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not looking,\u201d Qin Hai said solemnly. He pointed at the surrounding girls. \u201cThey are the one looking at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What could he say to this? Just as they were discussing their plans, suddenly, the air cracked. A deafening sound echoed from the sky above them.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue blanked. This sound\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The sound grew louder.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng\u2019s vigilance rose. \u201cPrepare for war!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue and Shen Wang began reinforcing this world\u2019s defenses. Even if Luo Yuan once again tried to send his clone in through a world of The Crystal Palace he created, the clone wouldn\u2019t be able to get here. If so, what exactly was this sound? Everyone\u2019s vigilance rose. Perhaps this was, as they\u2019d guessed, a strengthened version of Luo Yuan\u2019s clone?</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Cracks appeared in the sky. Energy converged in the hands of Chen Feng and everyone else as they entered a battle-ready state.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Accompanied by a loud boom, the sky was ripped apart. There, a familiar figure appeared. Luo Yuan had truly arrived! However, when they saw him, they were all stunned, as they realized that rather than a clone, Luo Yuan was descending personally. That\u2019s right, he had actually come with his real body. It was no wonder that he could enter so easily.</p><br/><p>With his real body\u2026 Was he here to die? Everyone was filled with doubt. After all, with Luo Yuan\u2019s real body coming personally, victory was no longer possible for him. There could only be two results. The first was Chen Feng\u2019s victory. The second was him defeating Chen Feng, but before death, Chen Feng would destroy this world, banishing Luo Yuan from reality forever. There were no other possible results.</p><br/><p>As such, they had never expected Luo Yuan to come personally. Had this fellow gone crazy? Even Chen Yuan was staring at Luo Yuan with a disbelieving gaze. Could it be that beyond just being Luo Yuan\u2019s clone, Chen Yuan had also possessed some of Luo Yuan\u2019s intelligence? Thus, after he left, Luo Yuan\u2019s intelligence had dropped? He truly couldn\u2019t make sense of this. However, at this time, there was no point in trying to understand anything.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave a signal. \u201cSeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had truly made no preparations for this action of Luo Yuan\u2019s. He hadn\u2019t seen this coming at all. However, there was no need for any preparations. With a single thought, Ming Yue and Shen Wang placed this world on lockdown.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around as the entire alien world was locked down. In fact, a locked-down alien world could be opened through unique methods, such as what Luo Yuan had done with his clone before. But Luo Yuan entering personally was equivalent to locking himself within this world. Nobody would be able to open this lock. Now, this world was truly locked down. What exactly was going on in this fellow\u2019s brain? Chen Feng and the rest exchanged glances, bewildered. They did not believe that Luo Yuan would do something as stupid as deliver himself into their trap.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was truly a special clone? Everyone instinctively looked at Chen Yuan.</p><br/><p>He shook his head bitterly. \u201cThis is the real body.\u201d Even though he was no longer linked to Luo Yuan, he was still sure that this was the real body.</p><br/><p>Everyone sank into silence. In short, this might be the end of this long struggle? Slowly, Luo Yuan descended from the sky. The crack in the sky closed up, yet he did not seem to care. He merely gazed ahead, gazing at the figure that he had been thinking about for several decades. Indeed\u2026 Chen Feng was still alive. This was the first time he had seen Chen Feng in over 30 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has\u2026 truly been a while, Chen Feng,\u201d Luo Yuan said with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng narrowed his eyes. What exactly was Luo Yuan\u2019s plan?</p></div>\n</div>"}

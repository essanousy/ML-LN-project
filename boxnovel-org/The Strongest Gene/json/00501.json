Energy tests required different dosages, different types of gene reagents, or different stimulants as well. As such, the danger level was rather high. Chen Feng did not dare to use ordinary people for his tests. All the dangers were explained in a serious manner by Chen Feng to Wang Chun and the sisters. The procedures and what might happen during the tests were all explained to them. These were extremely important. Hence, he had to make it clear to them.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng answered their doubts honestly. \"I am not sure of what might happen either. For now, I can only use numerous different gene reagents and observe whether the energy particles are stimulated and become lively.\"</p><br/><p>Ultimately, Wang Chun decided to not reject Chen Feng. The reason for this was the arrival of the devil race and ancient race, which had transformed the entire world. He was too clear on how important this was to humanity. More importantly, he had the utmost trust in Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Since he had known Chen Feng, how many miracles had this fellow created? Since Chen Feng said that it was possible, then that had to be the case. Naturally, he would prefer if Chen Feng could maintain a certain distance from his summoned ladies.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was grateful. \"Many thanks.\"</p><br/><p>After finishing the discussion, Chen Feng started the tests. Toward the researchers involved in this project, the Genetic Union and Gene Production Association had authorized the usage of all gene reagents. As such, Chen Feng gathered all gene reagents capable of stimulating one's energy. With that, the tests began.</p><br/><p>First test.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Numerous gene reagents were injected into the ladies. Next, the recording device started recording the changes in their energies faithfully. The first gene reagent was ineffective. The power of beyond didn't appear.</p><br/><p>Second test.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng proceeded to the next test calmly. From the start of the tests, he had already been aware that this was not something that could be completed in a single day. Shortly after, the second gene reagent was proven ineffective as well.</p><br/><p>Third test.</p><br/><p>Fourth test.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The tests proceeded without stop. Chen Feng had a rather clear-cut goal as well: by provoking their energy without stop, he would filter out the gene reagents capable of provoking the power of beyond into appearance.</p><br/><p>After three days, the first gene reagent capable of stimulating the power of beyond appeared. Granted, this beyond state only lasted for 0.00001 seconds. Unfortunately, this gene reagent had only worked on Shen Yi. When Chen Feng tried using it on the other ladies, nothing happened. Another failure.</p><br/><p>This was precisely the reason Chen Feng had decided he would require several different energies for his research. In this genetic era, there was a myriad of differing abilities. As such, it was not possible for Chen Feng to direct his research toward the search of items capable of stimulating genetic abilities. Therefore, he had chosen to provoke the energy instead.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, similar situations occurred several times where the gene reagent only worked on one of them and not the others. This continued until the seventh day, when the first gene reagent that worked for everyone appeared. Unfortunately, the duration of the beyond state was extremely short as well.</p><br/><p>\"Success! The first gene reagent that works on everyone has finally appeared. The active duration is too short, as it is less than one ten-thousandth of a second. If not for the recording devices, we probably would have failed to even notice it. Increase the dosage for the next test.\"</p><br/><p>The intensity of the gene reagent was increased by tenfold. And next\u2026 the ladies died.</p><br/><p>Under the high-intensity stimulation, the eyes of the ladies rolled over before they directly died as they transformed into countless energy particles and dissipated. This caused Chen Feng to be in a stupor for quite a while before he recovered. Indeed, increasing the dosage was unreliable. Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>\"Note this gene reagent down first. We shall continue trying out other gene reagents,\" Chen Feng commanded.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, the testing continued. This time, he stuck with conducting preliminary tests before noting down all the results. Even the gene reagents that had only worked on one of them were recorded. Only after one entire month did this phase of testing end. Through this one month of crazy tests, the gains were rather bountiful. A total of 162 gene reagents were able to provoke the power of beyond in Shen Yi. For Shen Wei, it was 155 gene reagents. Each of the ladies had a different number of gene reagents that worked for them. Alas, ultimately, it was noted that only 15 gene reagents were those all of them could use. These were Chen Feng's actual goal.</p><br/><p>Granted, the power of beyond only lasted a split second for each of them. If it wasn't for the recording devices, they wouldn't have noticed it happening.</p><br/><p>\"Extract the core materials of these gene reagents before continuing,\" Chen Feng decided without hesitation.</p><br/><p>If the first round of the tests were in order to discover the working gene reagents, the second round of tests were to figure out the true materials that had caused the effect. Among these gene reagents, what was it that had been capable of provoking the appearance of beyond? Some base materials? Some resurrection elements? All of these would require further testing.</p><br/><p>One time.</p><br/><p>Two times.</p><br/><p>Three times.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Once again, Chen Feng started researching crazily. Ultimately, among the 15 gene reagents, 22 types of materials were selected. It was precisely these 22 materials that had provoked the appearance of beyond.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a sudden idea. \"If all 22 of these were blended\u2026\" Without hesitation, he blended all 22 materials together before feeding them to the ladies. And next, all the ladies immediately died!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Failed?\" Wang Chun looked at him helplessly. He took a short rest before once again summoning all the ladies.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun sighed. \"Can you be more reliable?\"</p><br/><p>\"I am already very reliable,\" Chen Feng stated forthrightly.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun protested his fate. \"Even if they don't truly die, you can't do this, right? Moreover, how many times have I told you? I am not a lady summoner!\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, how could I think that way\u2026 eh?\" Suddenly, Chen Feng's eyes shone. That was because this time, the ladies had been fed with different dosages of the fused materials, and Lady Shen Wei had actually remained as the sole survivor among the ladies. Moreover, the power of beyond that lasted half a millisecond had been provoked in her. The duration was still extremely short, yet this was already much better than their previous results.</p><br/><p>Progress! Chen Feng was excited.</p><br/><p>He was now sure that using these 22 materials, if a certain gene reagent was produced using a certain formula, a gene reagent capable of provoking the power of beyond could appear. Perhaps the concept of beyond was no longer so far away. Thanks to this single success, the completion of his research had instantly exceeded 50%.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was overjoyed. \"Success!\" Next, he only needed to produce the correct formula and it would be sufficient to complete this research of his. Naturally, this was also the hardest step of his research. The creation of a formula was the hardest thing to do. There were a total of 22 materials that would be used. Which should be allotted a higher portion? Which should be allotted a lower portion? Between liquid and gaseous form, which was required? Were catalysts required? What should the final concentration be? Would other mixing agents be required? And so on.</p><br/><p>Which fragment of the genes would be the most important? This seemed to be an extremely difficult task. Apart from selecting gene reagents from the gene bank, Chen Feng needed to select materials out of the gene reagents, and now, he had to select the gene fragments from among the materials. Only after the correct gene fragments were discovered and activated in the correct manner would this stand a chance at success.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"Come, then.\"</p><br/><p>For this part of his research, even the construction of an emulator was not possible. This was because nobody had any idea what might happen when any single material was reduced or increased by even 1%. This was the step where Chen Feng started thinking of using his Luck Aura. He had truly been waiting a long time to finally reach this final step.</p><br/><p>In order to save his luck value consumption, he had used only a single luck value to ascertain the direction of his research where required. For everything else, he had not dared to waste his luck value. If he had depended on luck value for his previous steps, upon reaching this point, the luck value at his disposal would be too limited. Now that he had been saving his luck value for an entire month while conducting his tests, his nearly emptied luck value had finally reached a respectable amount.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Light started swirling before him. Without hesitation, Chen Feng started inferring the correct formula. Luck Aura, activate!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

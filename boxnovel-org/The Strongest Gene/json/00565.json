It wasn't as bad as the rain when the devil race appeared, but this was still the type of weather that made it hard for one to feel cheerful. However, when the numerous mysterious yet formidable spirit arts appeared, all of mankind felt like a golden brilliance signifying hope had appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Is this what spirit arts are?\"</p><br/><p>Countless people stared blankly at the numerous abilities that had been developed freely. That's right. This was the present state of spirit arts. Initially, the spirit arts had only consisted of time, spatial, and energy abilities, which had not had any practical use. Now, when the genetic warriors were allowed to combine their abilities with spirit arts, infinite possibilities were now possible.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>One spirit art after another appeared. In the Master Spirit Developer platform, the sales of spirit arts had surpassed all records. People watched as the sales volumes of the numerous spirit arts increased without stop, surpassing ten thousand, surpassing a hundred thousand, surpassing a million, and so on.</p><br/><p>\"Haha. This really works.\"</p><br/><p>\"After combining spirit arts with my original ability, the strength of the new ability is over onefold higher.\"</p><br/><p>\"Same here.\"</p><br/><p>They all exclaimed in admiration. Due to the existence of this platform known as Master Spirit Developer, the strength of humanity had increased as a whole. From what the masses remembered, the last time something like this had happened was when the beyond X gene reagent was released. Yet again, Chen Feng had changed the entire world.</p><br/><p>\"I want to become a developer!\"</p><br/><p>Countless people joined the profession of being a developer. The frightening sales volume was the very motivation for these people. Some had even formed groups to develop \"AAA-tier\" spirit arts. One could imagine how terrifying these new spirit arts would be if their development proved to be successful.</p><br/><p>\"Buy, buy, buy!\"</p><br/><p>As for those regular genetic warriors, they were all taking this opportunity to increase their strength without stop. Every single day, there would be countless missions waiting for them. Even a tiny increase in their strength would increase their survival rate, let alone the survivability added by the present Master Spirit Developer that could increase their strength as a whole.</p><br/><p>All of humanity was overjoyed. The users of Master Spirit Developer surpassed one billion, and the number of spirit arts that had been successfully developed surpassed a hundred thousand. Moreover, this figure was still constantly increasing.</p><br/><p>As for Genetic Union points Chen Feng had, it had long since gone off the charts. At the Genetic Union, the president and the deputy president were watching on in silence with everyone else as the figures signifying the points and authority of their Genetic Union changed without stop. This time, they truly had no way of preventing it.</p><br/><p>The people of the Finance Department were not reconciled to this. \"Are we going to just let this be?\"</p><br/><p>The president looked at him with a strange gaze. \"What else do you want to do, then?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" The person from the Finance Department wanted to say something, but he decided against it and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>The Genetic Union was way too used to their hegemonic ways. As such, they had only recalled now that this opponent of theirs this time wasn't an enemy, nor was it even a potential enemy. Rather, it was Chen Feng, the messiah of humanity! Using threats and bribes against him? The higher-ups would most definitely be the first ones to finish them off if they were to do that to Chen Feng. Regardless of what they decided to do, Chen Feng's safety had to be assured.</p><br/><p>\"Remember this. Chen Feng's contribution to humanity is higher than all of you added up together. So long as the laws are followed, regardless of what he does, we must assure his safety. Control your lackeys properly. I do not wish to hear about anything untoward happening. If something happens to Chen Feng\u2026\" The president's eyes gleamed coldly. \"None of you should hope to survive.\"</p><br/><p>The people of the Finance Department trembled as they heard this. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph.\" The president concluded with a snort and stopped talking. Chen Feng's identity was too unique. The things he did were way too extraordinary as well. Regardless of whether or not Chen Feng was intentionally acting against them, he was ultimately still changing this world for the better, changing all of humanity. This single feat alone was already deserving of respect from everyone.</p><br/><p>\"If he can continue repeating such feats,\" the president stated calmly, \"so what if I give him even my position as the president?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence. And now, the changes officially began.</p><br/><p>On the first day, Chen Feng's points reached an amount worth 20% of everything the Genetic Union had to sell.</p><br/><p>On the second day, Chen Feng's points reached an amount worth 50% of everything the Genetic Union had to sell.</p><br/><p>On the third day, Chen Feng met the requirement to start purchasing authority in the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a slight wave of his hand, instantly, all of Chen Feng's points were cleared. With this, he obtained the qualification to start purchasing authority in the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>On the fourth day, Chen Feng purchased 1% of the total authority.</p><br/><p>On the fifth day, Chen Feng purchased 3% of the total authority.</p><br/><p>On the sixth day, Chen Feng purchased 5% of the total authority.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With the present seemingly unstoppable momentum of the Master Spirit Developer, in a single week, Chen Feng earned enough to purchase more than 10% of the total authority. With this, he officially became part of the upper management of the Genetic Union. This shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>\"This speed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was now convinced.</p><br/><p>\"One week, huh?\" someone lamented.</p><br/><p>Even back during the dawn of a new era with the creation of the wristband, Luo Yuan had still used two months just to obtain the qualification to purchase authority. As for Chen Feng, only three days had been used. The times had changed indeed.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps this is not a bad thing?\"</p><br/><p>\"I guess so.\"</p><br/><p>\"I hope that Chen Feng will not act all bossy and set up stupid rules now that he's part of the management.\"</p><br/><p>Some of them were anxious. After all, the Genetic Union specialized in something different than the Gene Production Association. If Chen Feng as a producer decided to interfere with the various decisions of the Union, it would bring them trouble. In the eyes of everyone, Chen Feng was ultimately a producer, a researcher. Even the miracles he had created were related to these two identities of his. On the other hand, his combat prowess and management prowess were things he had yet to prove.</p><br/><p>Alas, surprising them all, Chen Feng did not even bother coming to the Genetic Union after obtaining management authority. The only thing he did was select a certain training camp and register his name to enter. Next, with his terrifying contribution, he surpassed everyone and placed first on the waiting list.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Spurt Growth Training Camp</p><br/><p>Right Holder: Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>Class: Peak beyond B class.</p><br/><p>Difficulty: 5 stars.</p><br/><p>Participants: Three per year.</p><br/><p>Order of Entry: Priority based on one's ranking in the Union.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>This was the camp most fitting for Chen Feng at present. This was also the only training camp with a vacant spot at present. But then, why had he decided to enter a training camp at a time like this?</p><br/><p>The president rubbed his head. \"Should he not be coming here to join our meeting?\" As someone who had just become part of the management, shouldn't he be coming over to fight for the power that was rightfully his? This Chen Feng guy\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the deputy president recalled something. \"Hold on.\" Training camp\u2026 Contribution points\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The deputy president asked, \"Do you have the list of applicants for the training camp from earlier?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Soon after, the list was sent by the employee.</p><br/><p>The deputy president took a look and was instantly stunned. That was because the list indicated that previously, Chen Feng had applied to join a training camp and had been rejected due to his contribution points being insufficient.</p><br/><p>\"It can't be, right?\" the deputy president muttered. He had a rather bad premonition.</p><br/><p>The president looked at him with a strange gaze. \"What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Please wait a moment.\" The deputy president called Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng on the screen, looking surprised. \"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>With an expression of someone who was constipated, the deputy president said, \"I have a question I need to ask you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ask it, then.\" Chen Feng seemed rather busy.</p><br/><p>\"The real reason for you buying authority in the Genetic Union\u2026\" The deputy president paused before continuing with a disbelieving tone, \"Was it for the sake of joining a training camp?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" Chen Feng stated as if that was the natural thing to do.</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>The deputy president nearly fainted. As for the other higher-ups around him, they were all stunned as they heard this as well. Training camp?</p><br/><p>\"The only thing you wanted was to enter a training camp to break through?\" the president asked, full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Chen Feng curled his lips. \"Don't you guys have a limitation based on one's contribution points? I tried applying several times yet kept getting rejected. As such, I had no choice but to do something about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"!!!!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone had a rather wonderful expression on their face.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 what reason was this? What nonsense was this!</p><br/><p>\"Were the contribution points you obtained from the Master Spirit Trainer not sufficient for that?\" the deputy president asked with a forced smile.</p><br/><p>\"Originally, it should have been sufficient.\" Chen Feng assumed a helpless expression. \"However, you guys forced me out. I had initially planned to use the points and contribution points I earned through Master Spirit Trainer to try to get on the waiting list. Who could have expected that you guys would take it over from me forcefully? Out of options, I had no choice but to release Master Spirit Developer to earn points.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence. The silence was stifling. An unbelieving expression was plastered on each of their faces. Numerous people had a \"what the f*ck\" expression as well. They had truly never expected that the primary reason Chen Feng had created these spirit arts and had even purchased their authority was for the sake of entering the training camp.</p><br/><p>They all looked at each other. \"What in the world?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh yeah, I am about to enter the training camp. I will be ending the call here.\" Chen Feng seemed somewhat busy with his preparations to enter the training camp and ended the call in a rush. The higher-ups were all left there looking at each other with stunned expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"Who's the one managing the training camps?\" the deputy president asked with his teeth gnashed.</p><br/><p>Someone raised his hand meekly, a forceful smile on his face. \"Me.\" What the hell? If he had known earlier that Chen Feng had done all this just to enter the training camp, he would have allowed Chen Feng to enter even at the risk of getting expelled from the Union. Chen Feng should have said so if he wanted to enter, right? How was this person managing the training camps supposed to know this if Chen Feng hadn't even mentioned it? What could he do about this? He was feeling extremely helpless as well.</p><br/><p>The president shook his head. \"Forget it.\" After all, this ridiculous incident could be considered to have ended. The most important thing at present was the fact that Chen Feng was truly planning to enter the training camp despite the terrifying enemies they had. This was too dangerous. They wanted to stop him. However\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Damn it.\"</p><br/><p>The president's head ached. Since Chen Feng was now part of the upper management, they were no longer qualified to control Chen Feng's actions and had no choice but to allow Chen Feng to risk his life like this.</p><br/><p>\"His identity is too unique. It is my hope that you guys can manage his trip to the training camp properly. No matter what, his safety must be ensured!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The vicious eyes of this monster appeared petrifying, and the might contained within a single howl caused countless beasts to tremble with fear. As the monster howled, its gaze was fixed on the opponent before it. The aura of this opponent was extremely feeble, yet a hair-raising sense of danger could still be felt from this opponent.</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>The monster howled, seemingly trying to scare this opponent into leaving its territory. And yet\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The opponent took a step forth, leaking a faint aura. Instantly, the monster's expression changed. Abruptly, the monster turned around and started to flee. Alas, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An immense force could be felt harshly smashing this monster down to the ground. A tiny figure walked over. This fellow that was even smaller than the monster's claws walked to the front of that monster before imprinting a red seal on the monster's forehead. Instantly, the vicious gaze of the monster became empty before slowly becoming docile as the monster prostrated on the ground deferentially.</p><br/><p>\"Not bad, not bad at all.\"</p><br/><p>The old devil was very satisfied. He patted the latest victim he was standing on. His devil army was growing in size. With the power of that S-class devil, he was able to defeat all opponents. He believed that it wouldn't be long before he could finally restore the devils to their former glory.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the S-class devil's eyes shimmered slightly. Those empty eyes became clear for a split second before returning to normal.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm?\" The old devil swept his surroundings with his acute gaze. He muttered to himself, \"Weird\u2026 I seemed to feel some ominous aura earlier? Was it a misconception?\" Failing to detect any other auras, he shook his head and decided to depart this place hastily.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Light swirled around and the devils vanished amid the darkness.</p><br/><p>Presently, at the Genetic Union, the latest plan they had conceived against the devils was being prepared. Eliminating the devils during this period while the humans and ancients were still in their honeymoon phase was the most apt choice. Perhaps peace would finally grace this planet. The problem now was\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Should we inform the ancients of this?\" the deputy asked with a solemn expression. Everyone sank into silence. The strength of the ancients could not be underestimated. One could say that the ancients were in fact stronger than the humans.</p><br/><p>Previously, when going on missions against the devils or on other special missions, they had always encountered the ancients accidentally, resulting in a battle erupting between the two parties. Now that they had obtained a temporary peace, should they inform the ancients of this plan?</p><br/><p>\"Notify them about it, then.\" The Strategy Department head waved his hand. \"Even if we don't notify them, they will find out about it anyway. If we were to encounter them during battle without telling them in advance, it would be quite awkward.\"</p><br/><p>The others understood. \"True.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone thought of something. \"What about the strategy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Strategy Department head's eyes gleamed. \"It would be for the best if the ancients could work with us.\" True, now that they were in an absolute honeymoon stage with the ancients, if they could work together with the ancients\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Do it, then.\" The Strategy Department head patted his thigh and stated in joy, \"Ba Gu, I will hand this assignment to your Diplomacy Department.\"</p><br/><p>\"???\" Ba Gu's complexion became ashen as he gnashed his teeth. \"Foreign Affairs! We are the Foreign Affairs Department! Not diplomacy!\"</p><br/><p>The Strategy Department head did not seem bothered. \"Is there a difference? As far as the ancients are concerned, you guys are the Diplomacy Department. I heard that when selecting candidates to breed with the ancients, even your younger brother was sent, right? Hahahaha.\"</p><br/><p>Ba Gu's expression darkened.</p><br/><p>The deputy president held his laugh in and coughed. \"Stop quarrelling. Let the Foreign Affairs Department deal with this, then. If we could work with the ancients to get rid of the devils, that would be beneficial to both our races. The devil race with an S-class expert is truly akin to an unstable nuclear warhead. I suppose the ancients are rather impatient to destroy the devils themselves as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood,\" Ba Gu replied.</p><br/><p>\"I mean, if it doesn't progress smoothly, you can get your younger brothers and the others to have some 'pillow talk' with the ancients, right?\" the deputy president proposed.</p><br/><p>Ba Gu: \"???\"</p><br/><p>\"Cough, cough. Let's do this then,\" the deputy president announced. \"Let's implement our plan.\"</p><br/><p>The Diplo\u2014no, the Foreign Affairs Department would be in charge of communicating to the ancients their intention for a joint mission. The Strategy Department would be in charge of drawing the overall plan and deploying the required manpower for the mission. Regardless of whether the ancients were willing to work with them or not, this was a battle the humans had to fight.</p><br/><p>Even with the sealing reagent they had created with the help of the young devil prince, the power of an S class couldn't be underestimated. This mission would be much more dangerous than their past missions. As for the main force, it would be the Genetic Union president and numerous other top experts of humanity. All of them were peak beyond A classes.</p><br/><p>This was the eldest group of the peak A classes of humanity. Before the appearance of the beyond X gene reagent, these people had already been peak A classes. They were the strongest humans, possessing strength far surpassing the imaginations of regular people. Those beyond A1, A2, and so on who had advanced relying on the beyond X gene reagent were simply not in the same league as these people.</p><br/><p>These people were true experts, each of them being a legend in their own right. Naturally, in such a team, an oddity was included: Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's first battle after his return had stunned countless people. With a kick, Qian Liexian had been sent flying. This was extremely shocking. Even now, his strength level was still an enigma to a lot of people. They had tried asking Chen Feng about it before, but he had only replied with a simple answer: \"peak beyond A class.\"</p><br/><p>\"Has Chen Feng truly reached peak beyond A class?\"</p><br/><p>\"I guess so?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is way too fast, right? Is it truly as he said, where one needs to be in constant life-and-death tempering to break through at a faster pace?\"</p><br/><p>\"That is indeed true. However, Chen Feng's speed is still too impossible, right? From B class to his present level, how long did he take? I am not worried about that. I am worried that Chen Feng might have used some unique methods or trump cards to be able to send Qian Liexian flying with a kick\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What difference does it make?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course there's a difference. A true peak beyond A class and someone who can only reach peak beyond A class during unique and specific circumstances are way too different. The combat power between the two is as different as the sky and earth. Chen Feng's identity is too unique. If something were to happen to him, it would be too heavy a loss for the humans. Have you forgotten what happened when he was believed to have died previously?\"</p><br/><p>The deputy president was extremely distressed. They wanted to prohibit Chen Feng from joining, yet this time, they couldn't even find an excuse. In terms of authority, Chen Feng had now exceeded all of them combined. In terms of strength, Chen Feng was now at the apex of humanity. How could they restrict his actions?</p><br/><p>The deputy president sighed. \"Get people to pay more attention to his safety, then. This time, get our own people to do the job. No matter what, his safety must be assured.\"</p><br/><p>The Strategy Department accepted the command. \"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>\"You may leave now.\" The deputy president stared ahead in silence. Chen Feng seemed to always have excellent luck, to be able to create miracles repeatedly. Apart from his strength, his excellent luck had played quite a big role in his achievements.</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully\u2026 you will still be favored by luck this time.\" the deputy president muttered. Unknown to him, that person he thought to be favored by luck, that creator of miracles, was presently in an extremely melancholic mood due to his luck.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This primordial item is actually so powerful.\"</p><br/><p>Shua.</p><br/><p>He took out a turtle shell.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swirled around. Once again, he tried stepping in. The repelling force was counteracted by the swirling light. Finally, Qin Hai was able to enter Mysterious Town. After walking past two blank regions, he saw Chen Feng. At present, the aura around Chen Feng was incredibly unstable.</p><br/><p>\"Something has happened?\"</p><br/><p>He recalled what his master had told him. Without hesitation, he pointed at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A powerful aura swept out and instantly engulfed Chen Feng's aura. Next, the aura rapidly combined together with the environmental aura, forming a new power.</p><br/><p>At this instant, within the primordial world, the sea of lava and rain of blades that had surrounded Chen Feng vanished the moment before they reached him.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A peculiar aura swept past. Instantly, the forest returned to its previous appearance. The forest that had initially been so desolate that it couldn't hide anyone started growing crazily. In a single second, the vegetation grew so huge and dense that the sky and earth seemed to be covered by it. Instantly, Chen Feng's figure and aura vanished amid the dense and lush forest.</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>Those people chasing after him were dumbstruck. Previously, there had been sudden lava and ice blades. Now, the forest had suddenly become lush. What in the world was going on? None of them had a clue. They tried entering the forest to look for Chen Feng. With grief, they found that looking for a person in such a lush forest was simply an impossible task.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Feng, he could keenly feel that the this world's hostility toward him had vanished. Moreover, this world was presently showing goodwill to him instead of the previous hostility. As such, the world was now operating in a way that favored him.</p><br/><p>\"Why?\" Chen Feng was doubtful as he muttered, \"Is it because of my earlier proclamation that this fellow is indeed amazing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why don't you call me amazing instead?\" sounded the grumbling voice of Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Hai?\" Chen Feng was pleasantly surprised. \"How did you enter?\"</p><br/><p>He remembered clearly that only awakened ones could enter this town.</p><br/><p>\"Master gave me a turtle shell,\" Qin Hai said.</p><br/><p>\"So with a turtle shell, anyone can enter?\" Chen Feng pondered. He recalled the turtle shell he had obtained in the first region. So it turned out that the shells of the scarab race had such special functions as well. He had previously thought that turtle shells could only be used to cook some soup.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What happened earlier?\" Chen Feng asked as he looked at the dense forest around him.</p><br/><p>\"Aura synchronization.\" Qin Hai continued, \"I transmitted your aura to the primordial fragment of this region, causing it to be able to sense your aura and sync your aura with its aura. With this, this world will no longer reject you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Chen Feng finally understood.</p><br/><p>\"That whole primordial item that is controlling everything, that mysterious consciousness's name is Dream Recall Bell, a little bell. Initially, it was an item crafted by some superexpert to remember and to visit his dead relatives when he missed them by traveling into the past. Subsequently, though, this item became one of the strongest surviving primordial remnants. It had zero combat power, yet it was capable of controlling space and time. After awakening its own consciousness, it became one of the most vicious weapons in existence, an extremely powerful existence.\" Qin Hai continued, \"For an unknown reason, it awakened right at this time. Such a coincidence is supposed to be impossible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Dream Recall Bell\u2026\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai continued, \"This is an information master obtained from his inherited memories. After waking up, the first thing this fellow did was forcefully enter the Primordial Era and tamper with the timeline before other powerful primordial remnants could awake, turning this bell into a true immortal. However, it had expected these primordial fragments to actually resist it when it was attempting to alter history.\"</p><br/><p>\"Now that you say this, I have some doubts.\" Chen Feng asked, \"Since this fellow is so powerful and possesses an independent consciousness, why must it tamper with the history of the races whose primordial fragments were here? For example, the scarab race earlier via the scarab-race shell fragment. If the bell had instead selected to alter the history of other races whose primordial fragments were not here, it would be able to change history much more easily, right?\"</p><br/><p>This was Chen Feng's doubt. If this fellow was truly able to change the history of any target it wished to, why not change the history of a race whose primordial fragment wasn't here? Why did it have to choose to suffer the counterattacks of all these fragments?</p><br/><p>\"First, it was too arrogant and did not bother about these fragments at all, since it is whole, unlike the others, which are still fragments. As such, it never expected that these fragments would still be able to resist it with their mere instinct. By the time it noticed this, it was already too late, like the rider of a tiger who is having a hard time getting off. Second\u2026\" Qin Hai pondered and said, \"Perhaps this Dream Recall Bell requires some sort of coordinates to return to the past as well and is unable to return to any point of time freely. In any case, some sort of channel is required, like how the twin-horns race reached this world. Without coordinates, those fellows would have had no way of reaching this planet. Perhaps\u2026 this is the case for Dream Recall Bell as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"If so, a single fragment should be sufficient, right?\" Chen Feng pondered and said, \"Although there are numerous fragments here, each with their own stories, most of them are of the same era, the Primordial Era. To return to the Primordial Era, one of the fragments would be sufficient, right?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai shook his head. \"I am honestly clueless. Regarding your doubts, how are you even sure that the histories of the fragments that are not here have remained the same?\"</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated and was instantly overwhelmed with fear. True. What was the original history of the Primordial Era? What was the present history of the Primordial Era? Nobody could answer that. Therefore, it was possible that the Dream Recall Bell had already altered the entire Primordial Era, changing everything in a direction that was beneficial to itself. What they were seeing presently could very well be the results of a changed history. Only the primordial fragments here were still stubbornly resisting.</p><br/><p>It wasn't that the Dream Recall Bell had only selected to change the history of these primordial fragments. Rather, the entire world had already been changed, with these fragments being the leftovers. If that was truly the case\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"Hiss\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai continued, \"Therefore, we must hang on. Master's opinion is to not worry too much about this. Although the Dream Recall Bell is capable of altering a huge portion of the Primordial Era's history, the truly important and powerful existences of the Primordial Era all have some primordial fragments left behind. So long as the changes here are unsuccessful, the core events of the Primordial Era will not change. Those powerful races such as the scarab race are simply impossible to be cleanly erased. They will not allow a mere Dream Recall Bell to alter their history. As such, their fight will also be our opportunity. For instance, what's happening now.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That's right, this was the palace of the ancient race. With the assistance of humans, the ancients had installed the most advanced technological equipment here as well. Naturally, as they were still rather unfamiliar with operating this equipment, half the staffers here were humans.</p><br/><p>After this equipment had been installed, the study on the topography of the ancient race's territory, environment, and species had begun. With this, the exploration of the planet had increased rapidly. After one month of study, the results had finally come out. At present, 58% of the planet had been explored. This was a rather astonishing amount. One ought to know that back then, when Chen Feng had first become a Genetic Warrior, only 18% of this planet had been explored. Now, the figure had increased by more than two times. At present, 58% of this planet had been explored, with the remaining 42% still unknown.</p><br/><p>However, from the map, they deduced that the remaining 42% could very well be comprised of oceans, a domain humans did not need to reach for the time being.</p><br/><p>\"If the remaining 42% is truly all ocean, we can use blue to indicate it in the map. With that, the map of the entire planet will be clear. Look, this used to be the devil race's territory.\" The technician pointed at a huge blank zone. \"Although this territory is now abandoned, when we were hunting the devils in the past, this area was reconnoitered as well. There are no dangers there. As for these\u2026\" The technician pointed at the red signs on the map. \"Some areas have powerful beasts, whereas some are hard to enter due to environmental factors. Due to our limited manpower, we have yet to investigate these areas thoroughly. However, these areas only comprise 1% of the planet and will not affect our overall development. We can just mark them as danger zones on the map for now and leave it alone.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Mhm.\" These special danger zones were not only available in the devil race's territory. In the human territory, there were many such locations as well. An example was the Frozen Sea they had been to previously. Toward the end, they only needed to focus on confirming such locations before marking them with a warning sign.</p><br/><p>As for the remaining areas, most of them were the territory of the ancient race. After talking it out with the ancient race, they had cheerfully accepted the convenience offered by the Genetic Union. Communicators were introduced to the ancients, chips were installed, and monitors and numerous detection radars and even numerous other facilities, such as Ironclouds, were directly installed in the depths of the ancient race's territory.</p><br/><p>The ancients were extremely happy with the convenience brought by technology. As for the Research Agency, they were incredibly busy these days. As the major figure in the technological industry, Stormtech Company had also set out to become a role model and had gifted the ancients numerous pieces of equipment. With this, the speed at which humans gained understanding of the ancients increased even faster than they had imagined.</p><br/><p>It wasn't that the ancients were too stupid. Rather, the facilities the humans offered were truly too convenient. Moreover, at the same time the humans were penetrating deep into the lives of the ancients, the ancients were doing the same to the humans. This was essentially a double-edged sword of sorts.</p><br/><p>With the present harmonious relationship between humans and ancients, nobody dared to act recklessly. The appearance of Ironcloud had also increased the speed of their integration. If no mishaps happened, after several decades, the humans and ancients would slowly fully integrate into a single entity.</p><br/><p>However, this was on the premise that none of those formidable powers of the Primordial Era were lurking around. Based on what Duma had said, the powers of the Primordial Era would appear occasionally. This was precisely the reason for his seemingly random occasional disappearances all this while, even if these powers might appear rather feeble.</p><br/><p>Duma solemnly advised Chen Feng, \"The moment one of these powers appears, it must be destroyed. Nobody knows what terrifying thing will be awakened by the appearance of these powers. For example, these powers might awaken something in a similar fashion to the way the devils awoke themselves. Or perhaps\u2026 some formidable existence might be awakened.\"</p><br/><p>These years, he had destroyed numerous powers of the Primordial Era that had appeared abruptly. This had continued until that stone had appeared. He hadn't even been able to touch that stone. For him, the pink origin wasn't an issue. What he was worried about the most was that stone.</p><br/><p>\"As of now, each power that has appeared has been a remnant of that era, a fragment of that era. However, that stone gives me an extremely bizarre feeling, as if it is a complete entity.\" Duma was extremely anxious.</p><br/><p>Mysterious stone\u2026</p><br/><p>Duma spoke a lot, yet Chen Feng merely listened on silently.</p><br/><p>\"What is a primordial power? Primordial power is comprised of all the powers that existed during the Primordial Era. Any power that existed in that era will bear a trace of the aura from that era. They were extremely powerful and dreadful. What's important isn't the might of these powers. Rather, it is the fact that all the aura leftover from that aura will have some sort of resonance with those existences that have slumbered or been dead for several millennia. How dreadful the resonance of that era is is something you can't even begin to comprehend,\" Duma said with a heavy tone.</p><br/><p>Resonance\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. For the primordial powers, the most important thing was resonance? What exactly was this so-called resonance? Chen Feng had way too many questions about all this.</p><br/><p>Duma shook his head. \"It is impossible to describe. If you encounter it in the future, you will know. Naturally, I hope that the day will never come\u2026 Although the powers of the Primordial Era are mighty, there are still differing levels, with some being weak as well. An example is the awakened ones. During the Primordial Era, awakened ones existed. If the power of resonance is not taken into consideration, their strength is in fact similar to ours. There was nothing special about them.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was astonished. \"Oh?\" The awakened of the Primordial Era was actually similar to present awakened ones? It seemed like the Primordial Era was not a big deal, then\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something. \"Oh, right. What exactly does awakened mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"Awaken?\" Duma contemplated. \"I recall that, at that time, it was said that an ordinary person that had awakened the power of resonance would be called an awakened. As for their increased combat power, it was merely a supplementary effect of being awakened.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Increase in combat power was merely a supplementary effect? In short, what he had achieved so far was nothing but a mere side effect of others when they awakened? So he was in fact a fake? </p><br/><p>Hey, hold on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled that the first time he had heard the term awakened had been on the Twin Horns World. Why would they be using the same term? Chen Feng was able to guess something. The Twin Horns World, the so-called alien world, the arena that was the so-called savior of space travelers, had probably been built by some refugees of that era? If so, this would be acceptable. Chen Feng's thoughts moved rapidly, numerous thoughts swirling around in his brain. With Duma's explanation, he was getting more curious about the so-called resonance power. However, even with this, Duma couldn't explain it to him.</p><br/><p>\"Resonance\u2026\" Duma shook his head. \"I can't say it, I can't use it. It's too mysterious. If I provide an excessive explanation, I might truly attract the resonance of some existences.\"</p><br/><p>\"???\" Chen Feng's eyes widened. Holy shit, a mere explanation would give rise to resonance as well?</p><br/><p>Duma smiled bitterly. \"Why else? This is also why those existences were akin to the sun, the moon, and the stars of the Primordial Era, why the world revolved around them. I hope that I will never see the power of resonance ever again.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng raised a brow. Is that so? Resonance\u2026 was something one couldn't even speak about? This was the first time he had realized how scary this power could be. This was akin to a censoring software that would censor someone whenever they said something\u2026</p><br/><p>An example would be \"water **, Duma's **,\" and so on. One would never be able to see the full word, just a bunch of asterisks.</p><br/><p>Resonance was evidently such an existence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something. \"Can you use such a power, then?\" One ought to know that Duma was also an awakened of that era.</p><br/><p>Duma nodded his head. \"Yes. The inheritance of our race is a bloodline inheritance. Everything will appear as we age. I still remember all of them. However, even now, I have never used them once, as I dare not. Even at the risk of becoming as weak as the present me, I still didn't dare use them.\" Duma gazed at the remaining pink on his body. \"Although I don't know what will happen, the power of resonance\u2026 is something I will never use, if possible,\" Duma stated firmly, causing Chen Feng to exclaim in admiration at the prowess of resonance. Even if he had to be controlled by his disciple, even when near death, he still dared not use the power of resonance.</p><br/><p>What exactly was this thing?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng thought of something, and his eyes shone brightly. \"Do I have such power?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

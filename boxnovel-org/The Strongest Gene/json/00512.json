Everyone had an unbelieving gaze as they looked at the power of beyond in Chen Feng's body.</p><br/><p>This is\u2026 beyond? This gene reagent can be used by everyone? This is too unbelievable!</p><br/><p>The reason they found this unbelievable was because, to create a gene reagent usable by everyone, it was obvious that a huge amount of beyond B classes and beyond A classes were required as test subjects. Only with this would this be researched successfully after an unknown amount of time. And now\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Bang!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have any other B classes here?\" Chen Feng took out more gene reagents. \"They can come here and try this gene reagent as well. Have a feel themselves at the power of beyond.\"</p><br/><p>A B-class employee walked forth in excitement. \"Let me try it.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Gold radiance surged around him. Beyond B class! Indeed, it was beyond B class. Everyone was in an uproar. Everyone was going insane as they saw this. Only at this moment did they realize what sort of terrifying thing Chen Feng had created from his research. Despite the short active duration of one second, this gene reagent was nearly flawless. No overexertion or assistance of any sort was required to use his gene reagent. For this project, Chen Feng's results were already the best. As long as the correct formula was in hand, they could immediately start mass production. This was the scariest aspect of Chen Feng's research result.</p><br/><p>Doubts? How could one doubt this? Chen Feng had directly taken out more than 10 gold-colored gene reagents. Anyone with doubts could try the gene reagent themselves. The doubters could feel how real the power of beyond was by themselves after using the gene reagent. Their monitoring devices were fully activated, and all the harvested data indicated nothing but perfection.</p><br/><p>A number of genetic warriors with different genetic abilities tried his gene reagents. Even those C-class and D-class warriors tried the provided gene reagent and verified that they were in perfect condition. The only flaw was the somewhat-higher exhaustion of energy, but then, this could also be considered as a merit. After all, only an intense eruption of power would result in higher rate of exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, with trembling hands, the employee recorded down these words: Universality \u2013 Perfect.</p><br/><p>Doubts? There were no longer any doubts. Chen Feng had directly provided more than 10 gene reagents for them to try as they wished. This was completely different from the Man Junxi earlier who had played all sorts of tricks. One could perhaps cheat when the test was conducted on one's own body, but could this apply to the bodies of others? Nope, it couldn't. Shortly after, this new gene reagent received full approval.</p><br/><p>After being verified by the higher-ups of Genetic Union and Gene Production Association, they confirmed that this gene reagent would bring no harm to one's body. The Beyond X project was thus completed perfectly.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire Genetic Union was in an uproar. Everyone that knew what was happening was incomparably shocked. They had indeed been hoping that this project would be completed sooner rather than later; however, they had never imagined that Chen Feng would use only one month to complete this astonishing accomplishment. Moreover, the very first submission of his was already a completed product. Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>Today, countless people muttered this name. Although a lot of people knew about the Star City battle some time ago, it still hadn't left too deep an impression on their minds. Now, though, they finally gained a clear understanding of this Chen Feng. Other aspects notwithstanding, when it came to production, this guy's skills were definitely top-notch, and nobody was capable of contending against him.</p><br/><p>\"He has reached such a height?\"</p><br/><p>Countless gene producers were in a daze. Even now, the memory of when Chen Feng had first arrived at Star City back then was still vivid in their minds. How long had it been since then? The act of gene production seemed as easy as drinking water for Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>With the early completion of this Beyond X project, the Genetic Union acted decisively and appointed Chen Feng as the general manager of this project. He was in charge of the follow-up projects, improving the gene reagent, and the launch of subsequent projects. Everyone would now have to listen to Chen Feng's commands.</p><br/><p>Naturally, after the Genetic Union's research, the exact effect of this new gene reagent was completely dug out. Although Chen Feng had created this new gene reagent, when it comes to pure research on a specific gene reagent, he was still somewhat lacking compared to the experienced researchers.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Gene reagent name: temporarily unnamed.</p><br/><p>Function: Triggers the power of beyond.</p><br/><p>Active duration: One second.</p><br/><p>Main effect 1: Triggers the power of beyond, pushing the user into a beyond X state and increasing the user's power greatly.</p><br/><p>Main effect 2: Enables a regular genetic warrior to start contemplating the power of beyond in advance. Every single usage of this gene reagent can potentially increase the user's understanding of the power of beyond.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>The gain of comprehension on the power of beyond was an unexpected harvest for Chen Feng. As the very first edition, Chen Feng had had rather low expectation for this gene reagent. Unexpectedly, a formula created with the assistance of Luck Aura was actually so powerful. This was truly a perfect gene reagent. From here on, they would mostly aim at increasing the active duration, increasing how much comprehension the user gained, and so on.</p><br/><p>It was clear that one second was not the limit. So far, Chen Feng had merely combined the power of energy and the physical body. If other aspects, such as blood and other different powers, were added to the equation as well, something entirely different might be created as well.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Chen Feng did not intend to get involved in such research personally. What joke was that? Merely combining the research results of physical body and energy had exhausted all the luck value he had saved over a month. If he had to combine the result with even more research results, he would probably not have any leftover luck value for an entire year. For him, the most important thing was this effect of allowing the user to gain comprehension on the power of beyond. Next to this, nothing else seemed as important.</p><br/><p>Soon, Chen Feng came up with a decision. \"I can just let the BC team deal with it.\"</p><br/><p>He had decided to use the BC team as the core team members. The other teams would assist in their research. With this, the follow-up plans for this new gene reagent would be implemented, aiming for the creation of an even better gene reagent. Beyond Chen Feng's expectations, after figuring out all the functions of this new gene reagent, an argument broke out, as those fellows were trying to name this new gene reagent.</p><br/><p>\"I think calling it Chen Feng reagent is very good.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, that's too blunt. How about calling it the Feng tip reagent.\"</p><br/><p>\"How about Mount Feng reagent?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, this name is already taken by a breast enlargement reagent.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How about we change it around, Feng Chen reagent?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why not call it wind dust, then? You must have gone to those places way too much.\" [1] 1</p><br/><p>\"You are the one who has been to those places way too much.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even if that's true, so what?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They nearly started fighting then and there. As Chen Feng heard their arguments, he did not know whether to laugh or cry. To show their respect for him, the name had to be related to Chen Feng in some form? The mere thought of this caused Chen Feng's head to ache. Chen Feng started imagining the scene where two people battled each other before suddenly shouting, \"Look at my Chen Feng gene reagent!\"</p><br/><p>Based on Chen Feng's estimations, this gene reagent would most probably end up as a gene reagent that was mass distributed. Would his portrait and name be printed everywhere then? No, he was not The Godmother![2] 2 No! Chen Feng vetoed their proposals decisively.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the project name, in a firm manner, he decided on \"Beyond X\" as the name for this gene reagent. Despite the fact that this X had merely signified the unknown at the start of this project, Chen Feng quite liked it. In any case, this was better than allowing these people to keep messing around and coming up with weird names.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, it was decided that this gene reagent would be named Beyond X gene reagent, with Chen Feng credited as the inventor. Next, they would have to decide on the copyright of the formula. Despite the fact that this was something researched by Chen Feng, Chen Feng had to take into consideration the participation of the BC team, the huge amount of resources invested by the Genetic Union, and the fact that this formula was simply too valuable, so valuable that one couldn't begin to price it. After all, possessing this copyright would be equivalent to possessing the greatest wealth of humanity. This single fact alone was sufficient to cause people to go crazy over it.</p><br/><p>All the higher-ups of the Genetic Union, Gene Production Association, and Research Agency, in addition to countless other people, were focusing on this, focusing on the piece of incredibly delicious cake in Chen Feng's hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

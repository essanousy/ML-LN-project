As for you, don't mess around.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" The minor god was absolutely horrified. He felt like he was the saddest of them all. He had been slowly and steadily recovering here in this world. Who could have guessed that he would encounter so many powerful gods when he woke up today? No matter what these gods said, he had to listen. Right now, everyone was looking for a way to leave.</p><br/><p>Alas, nothing was found. One day passed, then three days, seven days, one month, and even more. As time passed, the gods finally started collapsing emotionally, as they no longer had much godly power left.</p><br/><p>\"We can't keep waiting like this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, those major gods are surely trying to exhaust us to death so they can monopolize this planet's faith.\"</p><br/><p>\"That is certain.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, a number of gods started resisting. Due to their low amount of godly power, they had no choice but to resist. And thus the war of the gods erupted. Countless gods started fighting each other so they could obtain the pitiful hundred thousand believers of the twin-horns race. None of them had expected that so soon after awakening from the true war of the gods during the Primordial Era, a new war would erupt here. One could say that this war was in fact even more desperate than the previous war had been.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The twin-horns world shook without stop. Everyone was fighting while that minor local god could do nothing but pitifully defend the world from destruction. Since he was the most familiar with this world, this task had landed on him. Nobody bothered doing anything to him, as everyone was clear that regardless of who the final victor was, this world had to survive. Otherwise, they would all be trapped in space, lonely and desolate as they waited for their eventual deaths.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The war continued. Suddenly, the entire sky sank into silence as a bloody glow bloomed. Finally, the first god had been killed. The entire world sank into momentary silence. However, almost immediately afterward, the battle resumed. Everyone was fighting for survival.</p><br/><p>Slumbering? None of them were willing to fall into slumber. If this was the human world, they would still be able to awaken from the slumber. But here, slumbering in this damnable world? No, they were not willing!</p><br/><p>The moment they fell into slumber here, with the pitiful amount of godly power this world could supply, the slumber could very well be eternal. That was scarier than death itself. As such, they might as well throw caution to the wind and fight it out.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The battle continued. Boundless godly powers with numerous colors flickered without stop, driving this world to destruction. Amid all this, the Forest Goddess had stayed her hand. That was because she had noticed something familiar: coincidences, inner conflict\u2026 weren't these things that luck bitch had been good at? But wasn't she dead? Could this truly be a coincidence?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Hands pulsing with godly power, she helped that minor god protect this world. The other gods had already descended into madness, causing this world to be on the verge of collapsing from their fights.</p><br/><p>The minor god was grateful. \"Th-thank you.\"</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess ignored him. As she had been awakened earlier, she had quite a healthy amount of godly power. As such, she did not need to fight. Unfortunately, this minor god here would probably not last much longer. The moment this battle ended would also be this god's moment of death. Those gods would not allow a god all the inhabitants here believed in to live, as that would be too dangerous. Therefore, this god would most certainly die.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>With blooming blood, yet another god was killed. The almighty and majestic gods had become nothing but cannon fodder here due to them being too weak. The other gods all blanked momentarily before regaining their senses and resuming the battle. This was a war between gods. Therefore, there would definitely be more deaths.</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>With the continuous death of gods, everyone soon became accustomed to it. The ground was dyed red by blood, and the sky was tinged by various colors, each representing a different god. Godly powers bloomed everywhere, dying gods screamed everywhere, and numerous colors interwove together. From this group of several thousand gods, a huge number died off.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, amid the blood-red world, only around 100 gods persevered, fighting on with great difficulty.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Yet another god died off. With this, the surviving gods numbered less than a hundred.</p><br/><p>Among the surviving gods, some could no longer stand properly, while some were covered in wounds. Everyone was glaring at each other, waiting for the final fatal attack.</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess sighed. \"Can you all stop? This is enough. With the number of twin-horns members, even if they are split among you guys, the godly power will be sufficient for you all to recover.\"</p><br/><p>Only at this did the gods awaken from their madness. True, this was already sufficient. This was a war where there were no winners. Their only goal was to survive, that was all. They looked around, looking at the multicolored and ruined world. It was only at this moment that they realized how bitter this war had been and how many gods had perished.</p><br/><p>Several thousands of them had perished. Each of the survivors was the strongest of gods, or to be more accurate, these gods used to be the strongest. As for those so-called low-tier and mid-tier gods, they had all perished in this war.</p><br/><p>\"Is it over?\" a certain god muttered.</p><br/><p>\"I guess so.\"</p><br/><p>For now, none of them had any desire to do battle.</p><br/><p>\"If\u2026 if I can return to the human world, I will most certainly kill that damnable fellow.\"</p><br/><p>Their eyes blazed with hatred. Chen Feng! That damnable human! When had they ever been tricked so badly by a mere mortal? After all, several thousand gods had been tricked. God slaying was an incredibly terrifying term, as even in the Primordial Era, anyone that showed any potential god-slaying capability was instantly killed off by the gods.</p><br/><p>That was because none of the gods wished to be the one to perish. And yet this Chen Feng had caused several thousand gods to die. With the persuasion of the Forest Goddess, the gods here had finally stopped fighting. Regardless of how bitter the battle had been, regardless of how many gods had perished, now that the believers of the twin-horns race were sufficient to support them all, there was no longer a need to fight.</p><br/><p>However, this would only stay true temporarily. And now they had one final question left. How were they supposed to convert these believers?</p><br/><p>\"I... I can transfer them all to you guys,\" the minor god said in horror.</p><br/><p>A god sneered. \"There is no need for that. They believe in you. Thus, the godly power will be supplied to you. Even if you are willing to convert their faith to godly power and transfer the godly power to us, that is too much of a waste. Moreover, this will result in all of us relying on you alone. We definitely cannot agree to this. As such, I have an even better solution,\" he said coldly.</p><br/><p>\"What solution is that?\" the trembling minor god asked.</p><br/><p>That god laughed nastily. \"Killing you. Next, we can divide the believers of this world.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The moment his words left his mouth, he moved.</p><br/><p>The other gods merely watched on silently. Even the Forest Goddess could only shake her head. From the beginning, they had been aware that this was the only acceptable ending. For any of them to start gathering believers, this minor god had to first die.</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess sighed regretfully. Compared to these gods, this minor god here was probably the most innocent of them all. Unfortunately, there was truly no helping it. They only had themselves for blame for invading the human world.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Terrifying godly power descended. This was a true top-tier godly power. Despite the low amount, it was still something a minor god could never hope to contend against.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The terrifying godly power swept forth.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The familiar sound of flesh being pierced echoed. And yet when all the gods there got a clear look, their hearts thumped wildly, as what they saw was truly too horrifying. That minor god had used a single hand to easily block the attack from the other god.</p><br/><p>So easily, so terrifyingly. He lightly grabbed at the clump of godly power in his hand. Just like that, the top-tier god's godly power could no longer advance.</p><br/><p>The top-tier god was horrified. \"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>The minor god chuckled. \"Ah. Collapse!\"</p><br/><p>With that, the godly power collapsed and that god was flung back, coughing blood wildly.</p><br/><p>The other gods were all shaken.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 who exactly are you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Me?\" The minor god grinned. \"Who do you guys think I am?\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the corpses of the gods sprawled everywhere, the godly powers lingering in the air, and the blood of the gods that had been spilled earlier were absorbed by the world. The minor god stood up, pulsing with a seemingly boundless godly power. Everything that the world had absorbed transformed into a huge whirlpool before entering his eyes and transforming into numerous clumps of flame that seemed capable of blazing on forever, akin to a sin that could never be extinguished.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

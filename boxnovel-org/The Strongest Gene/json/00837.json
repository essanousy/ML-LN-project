In the middle of it was Chen Feng, and at his sides were Ming Yue and Shen Wang. Their energies met and interweaved in midair before assuming the form of one big heart.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was dumbstruck as he saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo missies, can you two stop with the excessive public display of affection?\u201d Chen Feng was speechless. Indeed, they had reconciled, as per the original plot. However, this was too much, right? They could even show off their affection while fusing their energy?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Ming Yue glanced at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t mess around.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that we are still bound by the contract. If you continue to mess around, I will summon you randomly in the future, and I\u2019ll pick times when you two are getting intimate to do so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Yue: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fine. She stopped messing around.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The energy converged, and finally, the two were done fusing their energy.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire world trembled. When Ming Yue and Shen Wang combined their energies, they accomplished what Luo Yuan had always wanted: combining all the godly powers of the world. Now, the two were the controllers of this world.</p><br/><p>Borrowing the unique power of The Crystal Palace, slowly, the consciousnesses of Spirit and the Misfortune Goddess drifted out before slowly entering the two bodies that had been prepared for them. Finally, their consciousnesses returned to the outside world. Not only that, with their departure, both of their godhoods were slowly shifting out of Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Godhood shifting! Chen Feng\u2019s eyes shone when he noticed this. So long as the shift was a success, he would no longer have to worry that Luo Yuan would obtain them. He would then be able to break through as he wished.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A beam of light descended and slowly condensed. Alas, right at this instant, the world began to tremble, alarming everyone. Next, they saw a person they were all familiar with appear in midair. That person was precisely Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That person shattered space and stepped into this world.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart jolted. \u201cLuo Yuan?\u201d Why had he appeared here?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The world trembled as that person truly descended upon this world.</p><br/><p>Wang Chun\u2019s expression changed greatly. \u201cStop him!\u201d He joined hands with Shen Yi, Shen Wei, and the others to try to stop Luo Yuan. However, Luo Yuan\u2019s mere aura was sufficient to knock them all away.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Wang Chun and the rest coughed up blood as they were flung away. Luo Yuan was too powerful.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That person landed resoundingly.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze merely landed on Wang Chun for a split second before he noticed a distant figure that caused him to doubt his eyes. That was\u2026 Chen Feng?</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng!\u201d Luo Yuan was in shock. \u201cYou are actually still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>He found this totally inconceivable. He had confirmed Chen Feng\u2019s death more than 1,000 times. Each time, the result had been the same: confirmation of Chen Feng\u2019s death. Moreover, he had even obtained the scene of Chen Feng\u2019s death from his deductions. How could Chen Feng still be alive?</p><br/><p>And how could Luck Aura have failed to detect this fellow, who used the same power? How was it possible? How was it possible for this fellow to have been able to hide from him? Luo Yuan was ashen faced. It was no wonder that, even after several decades, he hadn\u2019t been able to find the godhood of misfortune. Since Chen Feng was still alive, how could the godhood of misfortune have appeared?</p><br/><p>No, that did not seem right. He had obviously confirmed that the godhood of misfortune was vacant when he had confirmed Chen Feng\u2019s death. Damn it! Luo Yuan had an unsightly expression. But then again, it no longer mattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have been discovered by me, you can no longer hide,\u201d Luo Yuan said with an ice-cold expression. Instantly, his senses locked down on Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you appear here?\u201d Chen Feng asked. He remembered that Luo Yuan had not selected the same world as Wang Chun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I selected a different world. However\u2026\u201d Luo Yuan smiled self-mockingly. \u201cThat main character called Su Hao was too strong and easily defeated me, then broke free of my control. As such, I was able to construct a new world. This time, I selected The Crystal Palace. Interesting, right?\u201d Luo Yuan asked with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \u201cSeems like he failed to kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrior to entering that world, I thought for a long time before finally deciding to send my clone. If I had entered personally, I would be dead. Being lucky is a good thing after all, right?\u201d Luo Yuan said calmly. Although Su Hao was the main character of that world, Luo Yuan was sure that out here, he was the true main character. On top of that, he was also this world\u2019s sole tyrant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t spent much time developing the new world I constructed, it is, after all, exactly the same as this one. As such, a link of sorts was established. And thus, I have arrived here,\u201d Luo Yuan finished with a smile.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ming Yue\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cYou killed them.\u201d Since Luo Yuan could be here, that signified that the world he had constructed was already fully under his control. Yet that world had surely only been constructed recently. How could he have obtained control over it so fast?</p><br/><p>It was very simple. He killed both Ming Yue and Shen Wang, and he even copied both their godly powers. As such, Luo Yuan had been able to swallow that world for himself.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan shook his head as he lamented, \u201cThis is why I was never willing to select this world. This world is too weak. With ease, everyone in that world was exterminated. Next, that world was destroyed and used as a springboard to reach this world. Well, it does not matter. That world no longer exists. However, this world is still here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Luo Yuan finished his words somewhat casually, everyone was utterly shocked. He had indeed destroyed an entire world. Even though it was a fictional world, the moment it had been constructed with the ability, those people had become true living beings. Yet Luo Yuan had directly killed them all, the entirety of The Crystal Palace!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe moment I entered The Crystal Palace, I knew that I had to come here, as a very ominous aura could be sensed. However, I never imagined that it was actually you, Chen Feng!\u201d Luo Yuan\u2019s killing intent surged. The 30 years he had wasted had caused him to develop an extremely deep hatred for Chen Feng. This was a person he had to kill no matter what.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng remained silent. Not far away, the shifting process was on the verge of completion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are trying to buy more time, right?\u201d Luo Yuan smiled sinisterly. \u201cHowever, do you know why I have allowed you this time? Because the cruelest way to deal with someone is to destroy all their hope during the imminent moment of success. You have allowed me to experience an entire 30 years of such cruelty. Now I shall repay this favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A powerful radiance streaked through the air. This was the power that Luo Yuan had duplicated from the other world\u2019s Ming Yue.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That power pierced through the air and forcefully insert itself between the powers of Ming Yue and Shen Wang. With this, their powers, which had previously been in harmony, were instantly out of sync. The godhood shifting failed!</p><br/><p>\u201cFailed!\u201d Luo Yuan said, a menacing expression on his face. However, he was somewhat astonished to find that Chen Feng hadn\u2019t tried to stop him. Rather, Chen Feng had merely watched on coldly as Luo Yuan foiled the godhood shift.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Chun. Lock down the world,\u201d Chen Feng said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun resisted the pain he was feeling and speedily left with Shen Wei and the rest.</p><br/><p>They actually departed this world and returned to reality before locking down this world.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan frowned. \u201cMhm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rubbed his fists. \u201cBefore this, you were nearly killed by Su Hao. As such, with your cautious nature, you would most certainly use only your clone to come to this Crystal Palace world, right? Therefore, you are merely a clone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, there was no point in stopping you. I just have to kill you and then restart the process. In any case, I am also quite curious. After this world is locked down, severing your connection with the outside world, will the real you outside receive any news from here after I destroy this clone of yours? Can he even find out that I am actually still alive?\u201d Chen Feng asked with a sharp gaze, his killing intent surging. Scheming? Chen Feng had never feared anyone in terms of scheming. The moment Luo Yuan had entered this world, Chen Feng had already seen through him.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan nodded. \u201cYou are very smart.\u201d He was indeed a clone. After experiencing that incident with Su Hao, he no longer dared to use his real body to visit locations that might pose him any danger. The Creation God of an alien world could very well threaten him.</p><br/><p>As such, he had opted to use a clone. Chen Feng\u2019s plan was completely correct. Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not my opponent,\u201d Luo Yuan said with an ice cold gaze. \u201cRegardless of how smart your brain is, strength is what matters.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

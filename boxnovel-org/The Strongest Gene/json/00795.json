How ridiculous and lamentable. He was Ye, the strongest god.</p><br/><p>And yet he had never expected that a divine seat trial would result in his divine seat being challenged by Chen Feng, or that he would be backstabbed by that damnable silhouette. Or that, upon returning from dealing with all that, he would still have to face this. The illustrious Sin God had fallen so far.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all courting death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s terrifying aura rippled out. Even without godly power, his strength was still astonishingly terrifying. And yet those gods did not step back. Rather, they approached him because, from Ye\u2019s reaction, they could sense that Ye was clearly lacking confidence. This almighty god had indeed aged.</p><br/><p>One ought to remember how astonishing Ye\u2019s strength used to be. Even him letting out a small portion of his aura had been sufficient to cause everyone to revere him. Yet now, even after pushing himself, he was only capable of this much. He was now far weaker than he had been.</p><br/><p>Was this due to his injuries? The gazes of the various gods became vicious. There were innumerable life-forms in the human world, and the absorption of faith from these people had caused the strength of these gods to increase greatly. It was impossible for them to hand out the believers they already had under their control even though these believers belonged to the Sin God.</p><br/><p>After all, these were the believers they had obtained after two months of painstaking effort. Give them back to the Sin God? They were not willing to do so. Moreover, even if they decided to truly give the believers back, would they truly be fine? After all, among the believers they had obtained were apostles, which couldn\u2019t be transferred between gods. These were the believers the Sin God had spent 12 years painstakingly cultivating. Who would be willing to give such believers away?</p><br/><p>There had been tens of thousands of these resonators on the verge of reaching the apostle realm. Yet now, all these resonators had been snatched by these gods. As they thought about this, their hearts chilled. In all honesty, if this happened to them\u2026</p><br/><p>Even if it was only two or three apostles, they would probably flip out. If tens of thousands of their apostles were snatched away in such a manner, they would probably collapse emotionally. What about Lord Ye? He had not shown his anger, nor had he gone mad. Rather, he had merely decided to leave calmly. What did this signify? This signified that he did not care, because as long as he killed the gods that had snatched his apostles, he would be able to regain those apostles, since the apostle\u2019s contracts would dissolve with their deaths. As such, Ye had no intention of showing them any anger.</p><br/><p>This was the most terrifying aspect of it all. So it turned out that Ye was planning to get rid of them secretly? True, only like this would Ye be able to once again obtain a divine seat and regain his believers.</p><br/><p>At this thought, their enclosure around Ye tightened. They were afraid, truly afraid. Therefore, they could not allow Ye to leave.</p><br/><p>Ye laughed in a somewhat deranged manner. \u201cHehehehehe\u2026\u201d Evidently, he had never expected these people to surround him due to their fear of him and his revenge. Therefore, they had decided to eliminate him first. Did they think that they might succeed because of his lack of a divine seat? Hehehehe\u2026 How pitiful. Had these people forgotten how strong Ye was?</p><br/><p>The reason he had even fallen into that silhouette\u2019s trap in the first place was due to his negligence of outer space and the gods there. Even now, he was still unaware of that fellow\u2019s identity. But these fellows here? Even this trash dared to challenge him?</p><br/><p>Ye laughed in an extremely joyful manner. Even without his divine seat\u2026</p><br/><p>Slowly, Ye\u2019s gaze became cold. At this moment, the veterans that had been following Ye for a long time, including Zero, were extremely worried, as what was happening now was simply a repeat of what had happened back then.</p><br/><p>Back then, to ensure the rapid growth of the world, the Creation God had hoped that more gods would rise in power. And thus, powerful gods had been groomed, including Ye.</p><br/><p>And yet the powerful Ye had instead issued a challenge to the Creation God, resulting in the subsequent great war. What was happening now was so similar to what had happened back then. What Ye had done to the Creation God was now happening to him, and similarly, he was being challenged by the gods he himself had groomed.</p><br/><p>The only difference was that the Creation God had been challenged by Ye, who the Creation God had groomed himself, whereas Ye had, in order to prevent that, ensured that not a single god under him was excessively powerful, hoping that all the gods would grow in a balanced manner. He had originally thought that, with this, history would not repeat. Unexpectedly, what happened instead was all the gods betraying him at the same time.</p><br/><p>Zero trembled. \u201cLord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye smiled. \u201cFear not. Perhaps it is time to show them my real strength. I can regain my apostles with this as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tens of thousands of apostle candidates had been divided among the major gods. He had originally still been contemplating whether or not to spare these gods. Now, though, there was no need for that. These gods had given him the answer he sought.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. It has been way too long since we last did battle\u2026\u201d The Sin God had a chilly gaze.</p><br/><p>A major god sneered. \u201cDo not fear him. He has obviously suffered a grave injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Not only that, he has also lost his divine seat. He lacks the replenishment of believers. So long as we take this chance to get rid of him, he won\u2019t be too strong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods eyed the Sin God. Since it had come to this, they had no choice but to fight. This would be a battle where the major gods were the main players.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Terrifying godly power surged out as those gods started attacking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to survive this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must eliminate him while he is injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous powerful attacks blasted toward Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are going at it.\u201d Chen Feng was in a solemn mood. Even though he had merely urged them on to deliver more injuries to Ye, he was hoping that Ye would truly fall here. If that happened, it would be excellent. Unfortunately, this was Ye\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Ye raised his hand lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have indeed lost my divine seat\u2026 However, you guys seem to have forgotten one thing. Before this era even started, I was already one with this world. I am the master of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A horrifying power erupted suddenly. This unique power that was completely unlike godly power, that was so powerful that it caused one to suffocate, began to descend from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 The power of the world! Damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have actually fused with this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave, fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>The major gods\u2019 faces fell. The entire world operated as Ye willed. A massive power akin to numerous rotating mountain ranges headed toward the gods, suppressing them. Their instinctive reaction was to flee. Alas, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The boundless power of the world descended, and just like that, the powerful major gods turned into ash and smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other gods took in a deep breath in shock. Dead! All the major gods were dead! Ye, even without his divine seat, had only required a single attack to accomplish this feat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The lips of all the gods there felt dry, and their scalps became numb. This was truly too scary. Was this Ye\u2019s strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cFusing with the world\u2026\u201d Chen Feng muttered inwardly. So it turned out that after fusing with the world, one could employ the world\u2019s power? That seemed reasonable. The moment one fused with the world, the world would be equivalent to that person\u2019s weapon. As such, that person would be able to control the entire force of the world, becoming an unequaled existence.</p><br/><p>But in that case, how had the Creation God suffered defeat back then? Exhaustion. Even though such a person would nearly be unequaled with access to the entire force of the world, the exhaustion rate of mobilizing such a force should be rather astonishing as well. In short, our adorable Lord Ye was presently\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng instinctively looked at Ye. Mhm\u2026 Ye\u2019s aura, which had already been heavily injured in the first place, was even more unstable now. As for the remaining gods, who were in lower stages, none of them dared to look straight at the Sin God. However, Chen Feng could clearly see that Ye\u2019s aura was now near collapse.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng understood something. To awe and scare all these lower-stage gods, Ye had exhausted nearly all his power. In that case\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

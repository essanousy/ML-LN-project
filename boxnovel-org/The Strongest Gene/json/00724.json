That Zhou Ye was even capable of chasing the primordial dragon away? The Luck Goddess did not feel like that was possible. After all, that was a primordial dragon. She had once used a similar method to defeat her enemy. With her godly power of luck, a primordial dragon had appeared and treated Zhou Ye's group as the enemy. How could the dragon let them off? But even so\u2026</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess had a feeling of unease in her heart. \"What in the world is going on?\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint godly power surged out. This forest's godly power was already recovering, indicating that it wouldn't be long before the Forest Goddess awakened.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess glanced over. \"This is somewhat troublesome.\" She could feel that the aura of Zhou Ye's group was getting nearer and nearer. From the chaotic mess of auras she was feeling, it was obvious that the quality wasn't too high. Nevertheless, godly power was still godly power. She had initially believed these people to be a chaotic group that was not worth her attention. Now that she looked at them, they seemed capable of advancing or retreating in an orderly fashion with zero internal strife. This was obviously a complete team. That Zhou Ye fellow had awakened way earlier. Was this what he had been focused on doing?</p><br/><p>\"How much do you hate me? It is a pity that regardless of how strong you guys are, you are all still mere resonators,\" The Luck Goddess said calmly. Perhaps, it was time to show them the true might of a god.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>She softly pressed her hand to the ground. Her present godly power was still too weak. Earlier, to awaken the Forest Goddess and deal with Zhou Ye's group, she had already exhausted too much of her godly power. Despite that\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Let me first borrow some of your power,\" Luck Goddess muttered.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A boundless forest power surged out. With the push from the godly power of luck, the Forest Goddess's power started surging out, enveloping the entire edge of the forest.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The vegetation there started growing rapidly. Next, the entire forest edge was blockaded by numerous green branches, resembling a bird's nest. In the center of this bird's nest was a piece of green fruit that was glowing without stop. This was the Forest Goddess's core. Similar to the Fate Stone and Misfortune Pen, prior to her full awakening, the Forest Goddess was slumbering within this fruit.</p><br/><p>At present, with the manipulation of the godly power of luck, a hole appeared in that fruit. Next, a terrifying godly power started surging out of the fruit and entering the Luck Goddess's body.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Green radiance flickered about.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess smiled. \"Excellent.\"</p><br/><p>Although borrowing the power of the Forest Goddess would cause the Forest Goddess's recovery to take longer, so long as she could deal with those annoying pests, everything would be fine.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess gently waved her hand, causing the trees around her to tremble, weaving and swaying about in accordance with the tempo of her fingers.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess smiled. \"Ah.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye\u2026 I will be waiting for you.</p><br/><p>Not far away, at the salt lake, Chen Feng and the rest were already at the edge of the lake. In front of them was a lush forest with a dense grouping of trees.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye did not hesitate. \"Come, deal with it.\" Since even these trees had appeared, the Luck Goddess was definitely not far from them.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The group charged forth and started trying to destroy these trees. Alas, they all suffered an intense backlash.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Someone coughed up a mouthful of blood, nearly dying then and there.</p><br/><p>\"Godly power\u2026 This is the godly power of the Forest Goddess!\" he shouted in alarm. Everyone else's expression sank as they heard this. Were they too late? No, the radiance unique to the Forest Goddess had yet to appear. Furthermore, the Luck Goddess had no way of awakening the Forest Goddess in such a short period of time. But in that case, what was up with the godly power here?</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye sneered. \"We will know after entering and taking a look.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>The group was filled with a desire to do battle. The damnable Luck Goddess, this moment had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on.\"</p><br/><p>The group that had first signed the contract with Chen Feng suddenly felt like something wasn't right. \"Are we not here to protect the Luck Goddess? Since we have already decided to become followers of the Luck Goddess, there is no need for us to enter, right? Staying here is already sufficient. It is not very nice for us to enter impudently,\" someone said. He had a feeling that something did not seem right. Looking at them, it did not seem like they intended to protect the Luck Goddess?</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>True, he had nearly forgotten that in this group, there were some people that had been scammed by him. These pitiful children were probably still clueless even now. They had all innocently believed that this entire journey had been to offer protection to the Luck Goddess. Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Well, in any case, at least Chen Feng had told them one single truth: some despicable villains were trying to ambush the Luck Goddess, and this was their chance to perform a meritorious deed for the Luck Goddess!</p><br/><p>And thus, these fellows had, in order to get noticed by the Luck Goddess, established the first-ever primordial resonator squad of the present era, and had all agreed to follow Chen Feng despite how difficult the journey had been. And yet\u2026 Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke cautiously. \"Erm, may I tell you guys a little secret?\"</p><br/><p>They were immediately on guard. Suddenly, they had a bad premonition. \"What?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"In truth, the Luck Goddess is already treating you guys as enemies.\"</p><br/><p>Their eyes went wide. \"What joke is this?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng seemed to have realized something and said, \"Oh, right, I forgot to tell you guys. Along the way, all the dangers and enemies, and even that primordial dragon, were summoned by the Luck Goddess in order to stop our advance. I hereby thank you all for your hard work. I reckon by this point, she already feels an intense hatred toward all of us.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>They were all dumbstruck. \"Hold on\u2026 Are you not her spokesperson?\"</p><br/><p>Gods would also hate their own spokesperson?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at them while smiling. \"I used to be. Right now, I'm a free man and the spokesperson of the Misfortune Goddess. The contract you guys signed earlier was her contract.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's expression sank. \"What?\" After pouring their senses into their respective contracts to sense the godly power within, their expressions changed greatly. Just as Chen Feng had said, this damned godly power was indeed the godly power of misfortune.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that\u2026</p><br/><p>All their doubts from earlier could now be answered. They also understood why this mortal enemy of the Luck Goddess, Zhou Ye, had agreed to Chen Feng's contract. This damnable Chen Feng!</p><br/><p>Everyone was furious. \"You dare trick us all?\"</p><br/><p>They had initially believed that, by following the Luck Goddess, they would be joining the strongest primordial camp. Never had they imagined that the beautiful future they had dreamed of had been a lie all along!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Killing intent surged out as their eyes gleamed coldly. So what if they had all signed the contract? As per the contract, it would only stay active here in this place. Otherwise, they would have never agreed to sign it in the first place. The moment they left this place\u2026 hehe. Everyone already had their gazes locked on Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not seem to be the least bothered by them. \"Calm down, calm down. You guys are all mortal enemies of the Luck Goddess now. Moreover, you guys even signed the contract of the Misfortune Goddess. I have a question\u2026 Do you guys intend to offend both the Luck Goddess and Misfortune Goddess?\" Chen Feng calmly finished, \"I don't quite care either way.\"</p><br/><p>As the rest heard this, their hearts chilled. Misfortune\u2026 What would happen if one offended both the Luck Goddess and Misfortune Goddess at the same time? The mere thought caused them all to tremble in fear. It was with utmost grief that all these resonators that had intended to hold Chen Feng responsible realized that even though they knew the truth, they had no choice but to remain in this trap laid out by Chen Feng. What a scammer!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

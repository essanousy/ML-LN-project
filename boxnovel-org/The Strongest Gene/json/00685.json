With astonishment, he found that despite his several minor breakthroughs, he was still a level three awakened.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"Somewhat weak.\" One ought to know that at present, most of the awakened ones were already level one or level two. As for the people that had been stuck at beyond A class for countless years like their president, these inconceivably powerful genetic warriors had immediately reached level three the moment they had awakened, skipping past the first two levels.</p><br/><p>Seniors were indeed seniors. Chen Feng could only comfort himself this way. They had already been stuck for several decades. Now that the bottleneck had been broken through, it was natural for them to skyrocket. After thinking about it, Chen Feng found that the only way he could increase his strength rapidly was through gene production. Unfortunately, if he had to personally research the gene reagents capable of increasing the strength of awakened ones, the time taken would be way too long.</p><br/><p>\"Wouldn't it be good if you could still be used?\" Chen Feng said as he looked at his Luck Aura. He was confident that if he had his Luck Aura helping him, he would be able to create a brand-new gene reagent in a short time, a gene reagent capable of greatly increasing his strength.</p><br/><p>Alas, Luck Aura had been inactive since a while ago. He still remembered that at first, Spirit had told him that this was an upgrade. And next, after upgrading, it had deactivated, no longer working. This stupid Luck Aura was truly even more unreliable than Android. Chen Feng had long gotten used to the discomfort caused by the lack of Luck Aura.</p><br/><p>Spirit pondered and said, \"Don't worry. I have a premonition that soon, something will happen.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. \"I do not believe you.\" He recalled how, previously, Spirit had told him that Luck Aura would not take long to upgrade, yet how long had it been?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed self-mockingly. \"I might as well rely on myself.\" In any case, the improvement of an awakened one was a lengthy process. At present, those people had only been able to advance rapidly due to their accumulation during the several decades they had been stuck at beyond A class.</p><br/><p>As for those that had fused with primordial fragments, these people had broken through borrowing the help of the primordial powers. As such, a number of awakened ones were starting to enter level three, with some at level four or level five already.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Feng, he was still stuck at level three. As time passed, the masses would slowly forget the fact that once upon a time, Chen Feng had been the number one expert in the world. When they mentioned him, they would only talk about his legendary gene productions or his kindness.</p><br/><p>How about Chen Feng as an expert? Huh, Chen Feng could fight as well? This was especially true since nowadays, one gene producer after another was entering the awakened realm as well. Chen Feng's unique identity as the sole awakened gene producer ceased being unique.</p><br/><p>Of course, these awakened gene producers were all people that relied on gene reagents to break through and thus had extremely weak combat power. However, they had never participated in any battles anyway and had only been focusing on gene productions.</p><br/><p>With all these developments, once again, the dividing line between genetic warriors and gene producers became crystal clear, with the trend of fighting gene producers that had arisen due to Chen Feng dying out.</p><br/><p>Genetic warriors should be responsible for fighting, whereas gene producers should be responsible for gene production. That was all.</p><br/><p>During this period of time, it was also rumored that numerous formidable auras could be felt without stop, yet these auras had yet to reveal themselves. The popular opinion was that these were the auras of those in the resonance realm, or perhaps even gods.</p><br/><p>This was something Qin Hai was extremely worried about.</p><br/><p>\"Fear not. Although the appearance of gods is inevitable, a long time will be required for that. For now, even those in the resonance realm have yet to reappear. As such, the gods that those in the resonance realm resonated with will naturally take longer to appear.\"</p><br/><p>This was the answer given by Duma.</p><br/><p>After the seal on resonance was lifted, Duma had officially become the number one expert in the world. Despite that, he still avoided using the power of resonance as best he could. As for his previous task of locating primordial fragments around the world, it had been handed over to the Genetic Union. His present task was searching for those in the resonance realm, the resonators.</p><br/><p>Although the possibility of him locating them seemed slim, he remained hopeful. If\u2026 if he could kill those resonators in their cradle, perhaps the gods would not appear at all? This was what he thought.</p><br/><p>Alas, these resonators were similar to Duma, all sly old foxes that had been alive for ages. Each of them was extremely crafty. How would they allow him to find them?</p><br/><p>With all this happening, time passed slowly. At present, one whole month had passed.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai, Xu Fei, and the rest had all entered the awakened realm as well, becoming geniuses of the Genetic Union. They had been accepting missions without stop, subduing awakened ones worldwide Their fame had spread far and wide, making them sort of celebrity genetic warriors. There were also a huge number of geniuses from the ancient race that had passed the test and been accepted into the Genetic Union, joining the ranks of the awakened ones.</p><br/><p>\"Look, fast.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, it's Kong Bai!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah, I heard he killed an evil awakened one yesterday that had caused disaster to an entire city.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, I heard that too. That awakened one had seemingly fused with some disgusting primordial fragment, turning him into an absolute pervert. Luckily, he was ended by Kong Bai.\"</p><br/><p>\"I have decided that Kong Bai is my idol, despite his somewhat ugly appearance.\"</p><br/><p>Several young girls chattered on and on, talking about the celebrity genetic warriors.</p><br/><p>Distantly, our dear Kong Bai, who was walking by, feigned a calm look on his face with a trace of a proud smile as he heard them talking about him. Alas, this did not last long before he was utterly hurt by the final few words uttered by the girls.</p><br/><p>Fake fans! All of you are fake fans!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time passed.</p><br/><p>At present, the general situation had stabilized. At the very least, this was what it seemed like on the surface. While Kong Bai and the rest were gaining fame worldwide, our dear Chen Feng was already a legend who had withdrawn himself to the second line of duty, hiding himself behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>The masses were no longer able to see him publicly, yet his legends never stopped being talked about.</p><br/><p>At present, this very legend was filled with worry in a certain training room. In the illusory world within his body, two completely identical people, one big and one small, were staring wide eyed at each other.</p><br/><p>\"Left!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng lifted his left hand. Almost instantaneously, the miniature person opposite him lifted a hand as well.</p><br/><p>\"Right!\"</p><br/><p>He lifted his right hand this time. The miniature person did the same.</p><br/><p>\"Left.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right.\"</p><br/><p>\"Left.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started waving his hand without stop, and the miniature person reacted accordingly without stop. Gradually, the complicity of the movement increased. From the initial waving of hands till the final complicated set of motions, the two were able to move uniformly.</p><br/><p>Spirit started producing some sound effects. \"Cilacila\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned slightly but steadily continued with his range of motions. In the real world, there was no absolute silence. As such, to maintain the absolute affinity between him and the miniature person, he had to ensure he could maintain it despite background disturbances. This was what Chen Feng was training for.</p><br/><p>\"Cici\u2014\"</p><br/><p>The random noises persisted around him. Chen Feng and the miniature person were still able to maintain their affinity despite the complicated motions. Right at this time, Spirit seemed somewhat dissatisfied. Next, the random background noises changed suddenly, turning into a familiar song. The moment Chen Feng heard this, his face greened.</p><br/><p>\"The boundless end of the world\u2026\" [1] 1</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The coordination between Chen Feng and the miniature person did not last longer than three seconds after this song.</p><br/><p>\"Stop,\" Chen Feng grumbled. \"Why are you messing around?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit curled her lip. \"Did you not say that disturbances are essential for your training?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, but you don't have to use the ultimate trump card right at the start, right?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>What in the world? If Spirit was allowed to continue playing such catchy songs, how was he supposed to control both him and the miniature person at the same time? It would already be great if he was able to stay clear headed under the effect of this song. If, later, Spirit started playing songs like Little Apple and such, Chen Feng felt like he would no longer be able to continue this training.</p><br/><p>Spirit laughed mischievously. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is the degree of affinity at present?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Spirit took a look and said, \"More than 99%. Although your realm still remains at level three awakened, I am certain that not a single awakened one out there is capable of controlling their miniature person as nimbly as you. Of course, I doubt they can even discover this miniature person.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wu.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into contemplation. The only reason he had been able to discover the miniature person was due to the existence of this illusory world created in his consciousness by Luck Aura. Even with this superiority, he had only discovered this miniature person at the very depths of his consciousness even after being an awakened for so long. If he did not have this illusory world\u2026</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>He would probably have taken much longer, or he might have failed to discover this miniature person altogether. The miniature person would be concealed within the depths of a person, never to appear. As such, the act of exerting any control over this miniature person was unheard of.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like I am ahead of them all.\" Chen Feng smiled. \"Since my affinity is nearing 100%, I can start trying other things.\"</p><br/><p>Hu\u2014</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. As everyone else was focusing on increasing their strength, Chen Feng was focusing on his affinity with the miniature person. The reason for this was a rather inconceivable guess he had. Now, it was finally time to verify his guess.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He raised his hand, aiming at the testing equipment before him.</p><br/><p>Within him, that miniature person raised his hand as well and assumed the same posture.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>A ray of light shot out. The instant that ray of energy shot out, space and time seemed to transform. Chen Feng had a feeling that at this moment, he and that miniature person were increasing in affinity infinitely until ultimately, they were synchronous.</p><br/><p>This feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the testing equipment before him was spoiled. This brand-new equipment capable of enduring the attack of a level six awakened had a hole in it as a result of this single jab from Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 is this the power of resonance?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

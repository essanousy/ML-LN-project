She found that she truly had no idea. From birth, she had been here, within Chen Feng's consciousness. Everything else about herself, she had no idea. She had initially believed that her entire life would pass in such a fashion, yet this calamity had abruptly arisen.</p><br/><p>Spirit had already given up on explaining herself. \"I'm sorry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course I know that you don't know,\" Chen Feng said with a smile. \"However, some existences know who you are.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit looked at him. \"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pointed at the mysterious stone. \"That thing. I am sure that everything you possess now should have appeared after Luck Aura completed its upgrade. As for the completion of the upgrade, it is related to this stone. I have a feeling that even the sudden halt in Luck Aura's upgrade is related to that stone. When comparing when the upgrade paused and when Duma told me about the existence of this thing, I kept having a feeling that something was wrong somewhere. This stone might be the one causing Luck Aura to be deactivated. After all\u2026 luck is capable of everything! When two powers of luck encounter each other, it will probably be a clash between luck values. My Luck Aura, which normally does not have much luck value, most certainly could not have been a match for this stone. As such, Luck Aura deactivated itself.</p><br/><p>\"Furthermore, this stone knows of your existences. As such, it kept calling to you without stop. That is also why you were so impatient to meet this stone, so anxious that you employed the power of Luck Aura subconsciously in the midst of your anxiousness,\" Chen Feng slowly finished his explanation. </p><br/><p>In Spirit's mind, things appeared clearer and clearer. \"I see.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed gently at Spirit. \"Now, I need your help.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" Spirit played with the corner of her skirt, somewhat nervous. \"Can I still be of help to you?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Of course. You are Spirit, the one and only! Now, I will give full authorization over Luck Aura to you. You will be deducing and analyzing\u2026 seeking any probable truth, finding out exactly what this damnable stone is,\" Chen Feng said solemnly.</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded resolutely. \"Mhm!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Luck Aura started operating.</p><br/><p>Spirit poured all her effort into her deductions. Bright light shone within Chen Feng's illusory world. As a body of consciousness, she was incomparable in terms of deductions, much better than even Chen Feng. Therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Countless figures of light flashed past in the illusory world. In real life, everything seemed to have paused. Chen Feng waited for the result silently within his illusory world. After a long time, Spirit completed her deductions. However, she remained silent for a long time, not daring to speak.</p><br/><p>\"What's up?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026I\u2026\" Spirit raised her tiny fist to encourage herself before saying. \"I am done deducing! The truth is not far from your guesses. That stone is quite possibly the other fate stone. To be precise, it was originally one stone and was divided into two during that war back in the Primordial Era. The one you obtained was the smaller piece of the stone. Despite the smaller size and the lower amount of luck value that stone had, it was nevertheless the core part of the stone. That is also why the bigger stone has been calling to it without stop.</p><br/><p>\"I am aware of what you are worried about. You are worried that the power of Luck Aura will be devoured by that stone. This is quite possible. After all, the power of luck the bigger stone has at its disposal was way too scary. However, If we can think of a way to get the stone to come for the fusion, to come of its own initiative, it is quite possible that its power will be the one to be devoured.</p><br/><p>\"From my deductions, I obtained three proposals that might be of use to you. So long as we succeed in one of them, you will become an expert in the truest sense, possessing an inexhaustible power of luck, truly becoming invincible!\"</p><br/><p>Spirit was finished with her explanation. She had not only verified all of Chen Feng's guesses, she had also deduced solutions based on the results of her deductions, behaving precisely like the impression of Spirit that Chen Feng had had in his heart all this while. Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Have you not thought of any problem that might arise from this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you still not believe me?\" Spirit asked dispiritedly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"No. Even you, the smaller fate stone, had your consciousness birthed right here within my consciousness. Do you think that the bigger fate stone is without its own consciousness? If you two fuse\u2026 do you think you will survive?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit's body trembled as she heard this.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke faintly. \"Or perhaps\u2026 you have indeed thought of this. You are afraid, yet you dare not voice your concerns. Or perhaps you are of the opinion that I will proceed despite knowing that you might disappear after the fusion?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit remained silent.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"This is what I am worried about. Spirit, although you now have the authority to use Luck Aura, I do not wish for you to go beyond your authority. You only need to tell me the results. That will be sufficient. How to do it, or what to do, is something for me to decide. Do you understand now?\" Chen Feng said coldly.</p><br/><p>Spirit lowered her head. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"I do hope the same thing will not happen again in the future,\" Chen Feng said faintly.</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\" Spirit blinked. In the future? \"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"A stronger fate stone and a boundless power of luck are indeed incredibly tempting. However, for me\u2026\" Chen Feng glanced at Spirit. \"They are not as important as you.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit blanked. \"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" Smiling, Chen Feng said, \"Boundless power\u2026 does that not sound like the seduction of the devil itself? I will never give up on an adorable loli for the sake of something like that. After all, I have watched your growth myself.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit's eyes were filled with hope. \"Huh?\" She felt like today, she had taken a trip to both Hell and Heaven. She had done something like this\u2026 yet he was still not willing to abandon her?</p><br/><p>Spirit was endlessly touched as she clenched her tiny fists tightly before her chest and vowed that she would most certainly not let Chen Feng down.</p><br/><p>\"Thus, let us leave here together,\" Chen Feng said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded resolutely. \"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled as he saw this. This little girl was trying her level best to showcase her worth now, huh?</p><br/><p>He had his own reasons for not accepting that mysterious stone. A more powerful fate stone, with power as attractive as the devil's temptation? A single Spirit was already capable of controlling the power within him. If he allowed that even more powerful fellow to enter his body\u2026</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Would he still be Chen Feng in the future? More power also signified greater sacrifice. This was something Chen Feng was clear on. Regardless of how strong he became or what strength he obtained, it had to be under his control. Otherwise, what was the point of living? As for Luck Aura and Spirit, if his guess was correct, probably\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Forget it.\" Chen Feng shook his head, returning his consciousness to reality.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

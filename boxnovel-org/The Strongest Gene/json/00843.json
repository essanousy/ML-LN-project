He was not aware of Chen Feng\u2019s plan. However, in the outside world, a certain terrifying true god\u2019s attention was focused here. Chen Feng going out alone was truly too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. I know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun nodded \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Luo Yuan\u2019s clone is locked down, making it easier to ensure he cannot establish a connection with his real self, we must still ensure that no connection whatsoever can be established between this world and the outside world,\u201d Chen Feng said. \u201cI will move in and out through the link between Xiao Ying and Ming Yue. Under no circumstances are you to open up the connection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chun\u2019s expression became solemn. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Tearing a portal in midair, Chen Feng vanished. As Luo Yuan saw this, he became incomparably excited. This was his chance, as a connection had been established with the outside world by Chen Feng himself. He had been watching on expressionlessly. The moment Chen Feng ripped space apart, he nearly revealed his excitement. So long as a connection was established, even if Chen Feng was the only one to go out\u2026</p><br/><p>Hehe. He would be able to instantly connect to his real self. This little cage was completely incapable of stopping him from connecting with himself. Luo Yuan was getting excited. Alas, surprising him, even though a connection had already been established with the outside world, he was still unable to connect with his true self.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Sealed again? Not possible. Chen Feng was not a true god; how could he be capable of this? What exactly was going on, then? Instinctively, Luo Yuan looked over at the tear in midair left by Chen Feng, which was already closing up. Suddenly, an astonished expression appeared on his face. This crack\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn it! This portal opened by Chen Feng did not connect to the real world. Rather, it connected to a region of spatial currents. There just a huge and vast nothingness there. That was not the outside world. Chen Feng had actually stepped into the spatial currents by himself? However, this thought had merely flashed by before Luo Yuan understood what was going on. That damnable Chen Feng!</p><br/><p>To ensure that he could not connect with his real self, Chen Feng had used a region of spatial currents as a springboard to move between the outside world and this world. That region was too chaotic and was capable of crushing all auras and energy. As such, Chen Feng had chosen to go out through there. As for the dangers posed by that region?</p><br/><p>That place was dangerous to everyone, including true gods. That was a region of chaotic spatial currents. One could never know where it would lead.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was an exception thanks to his godly power of luck. Even though he had already separated the godhood of luck from himself, his new godly power was incomparably powerful and had fused with a huge amount of the power of luck. As such, he could convert it to pure luck for his own usage as he wished.</p><br/><p>In that kind of place, luck was the strongest of all powers. As such, it was impossible for a mishap to befall Chen Feng there.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan clenched his teeth. \u201cA fine move, Chen Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had never expected Chen Feng to have such a trick up his sleeves. It seemed like hoping for Chen Feng to reveal a weakness was an impossible dream. However, why had that fellow decided to go to the outside world? How would Luo Yuan kill his own clone? Hehe. What a joke.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was something Chen Feng did not know. Even if the real Luo Yuan wanted to kill the clone, he would not be able to accomplish that, as a connection couldn\u2019t be established with this world. After all, without a connection, the self-destruct order could not be transmitted here. How naive. But what if Chen Feng reestablished a connection at that specific moment?</p><br/><p>Things would become even more interesting, as the clone\u2019s memories would be instantly shared with the real Luo Yuan. At that time, the real Luo Yuan would know everything that had happened here. He would know that the world of the Crystal Palace was in fact incomparably weak. His next course of action would be to destroy this world. He would also discover Chen Feng and proceed to put an end to him for real.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sneered. \u201cChen Feng, is that what you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a clone, but he was also real. As a true god, as a clone that was capable of maintaining an absolute connection with his real body, he was merely slightly weaker than the real body. The strength of their connection was something Chen Feng had no way of imagining.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze was ice cold. \u201cI am curious. How are you going to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, in the outside world, Luo Yuan was still staring at the air. How long had it been? He calculated the time in silence. He seemed to have completely lost his connection with his clone.</p><br/><p>He had chosen to construct The Crystal Palace as his alien world. This was the same book Wang Chun had chosen. Next, he had sent his clone over to gain understanding of that world. However, the understanding the clone had gained was merely of the book\u2019s early period. Nearly every book would reach a situation where minor gods were more worthless than dogs while major gods were everywhere toward the end.</p><br/><p>Therefore, to avoid this occurrence, he had used his clone to destroy the entire world. In his version of The Crystal Palace, Ming Yue and Shen Wang, everything and everyone had been eliminated by his clone. Even those two had merely caused his clone a slight inconvenience. They were still incredibly weak. The only thing he had left in that world was a connection he could use to hop into Wang Chun\u2019s world.</p><br/><p>They should already have a full understanding of The Crystal Palace\u2019s power system. As such, after the clone entered, he should have been able to kill everyone there and give him a report. Alas, no such thing had happened. After entering the world, his clone had gone missing. Why? What had happened? Luo Yuan did not even dare try to pry into what was happening there.</p><br/><p>After his previous experience with Su Hao, he did not dare to recklessly enter an alien world. Moreover, if even his clone had been instantly killed, him going there personally would be pointless. An existence capable of instantly killing his clone would most definitely be extremely terrifying, along the likes of that Su Hao. The mere thought of Su Hao caused Luo Yuan\u2019s spine to chill. In short, something similar had happened in the world of The Crystal Palace?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan frowned. \u201cWhat exactly happened there?\u201d The only difference between Wang Chun\u2019s The Crystal Palace and his own was the time they had been established. His world had been in the early period of the book, whereas Wang Chun\u2019s world had already reached the late period. As such, the power system of that world might have changed? Or perhaps, due to an energy transformation, an even more terrifying existence had appeared?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan couldn\u2019t know, as such things weren\u2019t in the original book. Due to Wang Chun\u2019s existence and his interference, that world might have developed in an entirely different way. After all, even the Genetic Era had gone through numerous transformations.</p><br/><p>In the early period, A-class warriors had been the peak of the food chain. Next, it had become beyond A class, followed by S class, until it reached the present, where gods were everywhere. As such, his own version of The Crystal Palace might be similar to the early Genetic Era, where A-class warriors ruled, while Wang Chun\u2019s The Crystal Palace might have reached the late period, where gods were everywhere?</p><br/><p>Was that why something had occurred the instant his clone entered? His clone had gone completely missing. Even whether he was alive or dead remained unknown. What exactly had happened there?</p></div>\n</div>"}

It hadn\u2019t been that long since the fast-guy incident, yet the divine seat was once again being challenged. It seemed like this divine seat would not have anything to do with them, the common apostles.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually this fellow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the gods\u2019 descendants recognized this person. Among the gods\u2019 descendants, this person was a comparatively weaker one. Unexpectedly, he had actually gotten ahead of everyone using such a unique method.</p><br/><p>That gods\u2019 descendant howled with wild laughter. \u201cHahaha, daddy is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A loud boom erupted from the divine seat that was attacked. For the first time, a mirror image appeared from the divine seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mirror image has finally appeared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if this guy had died from running into the divine seat like the fast guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the others heard this, they rolled their eyes. How was that even possible? Apart from the fast guy, who could be so idiotic?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The god\u2019s descendant shone resplendently as he unleashed his greatest might. As everyone saw this, they sighed, as it seemed like this divine seat would temporarily fall under the control of this person. Alas, when that radiance faded, the entire world suddenly lapsed into silence. When the gods\u2019 descendant attacked with formidable godly power, the mirror image merely waved his hand, and the gods\u2019 descendant instantly froze and was suspended in midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes went wide. The mirror image had actually blocked the attack? No, that was not just blocking. From the looks of it\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Before anyone had recovered from their shock, the mirror image waved his hand a second time.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Just like that, the powerful god\u2019s descendant was ripped apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s scalp went numb. Dead? Just like that? In such a manner? That mirror image had only waved his hand, right? As they thought about this, they couldn\u2019t help but shudder in fear. All the apostles that were rushing over at top speed immediately stopped.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence, a terrifying silence. Everyone was greatly alarmed at what they had seen. How could this\u2026 Didn\u2019t this a mirror image only have 1% of the original god\u2019s strength?</p><br/><p>Was this not the mirror image of a deceased god? Why was this mirror image so strong? And why was this mirror image so ruthless? What exactly was going on here? Nobody could provide an answer. Even the apostles that had rich experience in godhood trials were dripping wet with cold sweat, as this was their very first time seeing such a horrifying scene.</p><br/><p>What, exactly, was going on here? At the distant end of the world, the mirror image could be seen returning into the divine seat. He had merely come out to wave his hand about before returning. Nobody had any idea what was going on. That mirror image seemed rather familiar, yet when they tried paying close attention to him, he seemed so unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this\u2026\u201d someone asked with a hoarse voice, yet nobody bothered to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Despite what had happened, the silhouette instead laughed. Worthy of being the Sin God indeed. He only needed to use such a method once to scare and warn everyone else. This would be sufficient to cause the other participants to lose their confidence. With the number of challengers reduced, he wouldn\u2019t have to exhaust as much godly power.</p><br/><p>With this, would these apostles start to give up? It was as expected. At this moment, a huge number of apostles started to lose their confidence. What kind of joke was that? A huge number of them were aware that their chance of actually ascending to godhood was incredibly low. Most of them were only here to join in on the fun, to have a chance to approach a divine seat or somewhat increase their strength. That was all they wished for.</p><br/><p>Moreover, most of them were also here to try their luck. What if they just happened to be lucky enough to be the one to ascend? Yet now, when failure equaled death, they no longer had any motivation to even give the challenge a try.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they even started retreating backward. The mirror image being able to kill a level 20 apostle with a wave of his hand was truly outside of their expectations.</p><br/><p>Two particular gods\u2019 descendants directly gave up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis god is too strong. I forfeit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The silhouette wasn\u2019t the least surprised by this. It seemed like he had to make a move personally after all. If possible, he truly wished to keep his identity concealed. Just as he decided that he had no choice but to make a move, a voice suddenly rang out. \u201cI seem to recall that there is a limitation to the amount of godly power a mirror image can have, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this sentence, everyone seemed to awake from their reverie at the same time. True, the godly power was limited. Regardless of how powerful the mirror image was, so long as the godly power was exhausted\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not forget. This trial was activated for Chen Feng. Regardless of how strong the mirror image is, only 1% of the god\u2019s godly power is available to him,\u201d that apostle said unhurriedly. Finally, everyone recovered from their shock. True. However strong it was, there had to be a limit. With so many apostles here, what was there to fear? If one wouldn\u2019t do, they would use 10 or even 100! So long as this mirror image\u2019s godly power was exhausted, wouldn\u2019t he be completely helpless?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, who shall be the first to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other. Not a single one of them was willing to answer this question. The first to make their move would inevitably be the first to die. Regardless of how weak this mirror image was, it would probably be able to last more than 10 rounds against the barrage of apostles. At that time, luck would play a role in deciding who survived. At the very least, this was what the apostles here believed.</p><br/><p>That apostle spoke calmly. \u201cIt is quite simple. Who says that the first to make a move has to be in danger? I know that a lot of the apostles here have no intention of actually ascending into godhood. In that case, how about allowing these apostles to go first? Around 100 of them will be sufficient. Moreover, if this mirror image is truly too weak, one of the weaker apostles might have the good fortune of ascending to godhood. What do you guys think of this plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes shone. That was indeed true. Under normal circumstances, these weak apostles would have no hope of succeeding in such a trial. If this plan was followed, though\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, those willing to be part of the first wave of attackers, please step out. As for the rest, I will assume that you are declaring that you are interested in competing for this godhood. These people will be classified as the enemies of those vying for this particular godhood\u2026\u201d That apostle smiled toyingly as he finished his sentence. The word \u201cenemies\u201d seemingly had a profound meaning attached to it.</p><br/><p>With this, the apostles that had been thinking of staying back to take advantage of the chaos had no choice but to stand out and offer themselves. With this, only the gods\u2019 descendants and the comparatively powerful apostles were left behind. In this situation, if the weaker apostles dared to stay behind, they would truly die.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. What comes next will be extremely simple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose in the first wave, we shall silently approach the divine seat together. Next, attack together. Naturally, remember to spread around so as to not get caught in a single attack. If you guys can kill that mirror image immediately, a god shall be born among you guys,\u201d that apostle said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nearly everyone expressed their approval. With this, the first wave attackers were given some hope and turned into cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember. Enough of this mirror image\u2019s godly power must be exhausted before he can actually be defeated. Therefore\u2026 do your best,\u201d that apostle said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, one of the gods\u2019 descendants looked at him and asked, \u201cWhat is your name? If I am able to ascend here, I shall accept you as my follower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQin Hai,\u201d that apostle answered with a smile. \u201cI shall await your ascension.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even the god was caught by surprise. No matter how he looked at it, Chen Feng's body size did not look like it contained such astonishing strength. However, it was this very Chen Feng that had instantly defeated his only apostle. One ought to know that the treant had been an apostle, and what did that signify? It signified that the treant's strength far surpassed these resonators.</p><br/><p>The god had allowed them the trial of fighting this treant to show them how strong an apostle was, to consolidate his prestige, and to give them something to look forward to. That was what he had intended. Yet now his apostle had been defeated by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>This gave him a rather uncomfortable feeling. Among the 5,000 herculean apes, Chen Feng was the one he was the least optimistic about. It wasn't because of his strength. Rather, it was because of his poor talent, so poor that it was almost incurable. One ought to know that of the two absolute requirements for one to become an apostle, one of them was to fully comprehend the godly power of their god.</p><br/><p>Yet this Chen Feng\u2026 With his poor talent, would he be able to comprehend the godly to the point that he could become an apostle? The god doubted it. However, since he had already promised to make those that passed this trail into apostles, he could not go back on his words. Furthermore, if he did not turn Chen Feng into his apostle, he might not even have a single apostle left.</p><br/><p>\"Come.\" The god had come to a decision. \"Assume the correct posture. Yes, this is correct. I am coming.\"</p><br/><p>The god inhaled deeply. He pointed his finger at Chen Feng's forehead, and his finger started flickering with a faint glow.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A contract of the gods appeared. The contract this time was not a regular contract. Rather, this was a true-locked contract, an apostle's contract. The moment this contract was signed, Chen Feng would be his apostle.</p><br/><p>The god pointed. \"Go.\" The apostle's contract entered Chen Feng's body and started operating.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His godly power surged.</p><br/><p>\"It's starting.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart trembled. He was aware of what this god was thinking. However, he wasn't worried. The reason for what had happened previously was Xiao Ying devouring the godly power. This time, he had already ensured that Xiao Ying would stay quiet and would not indiscriminately eat random stuff.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he should be able to smoothly enter the apostle realm, giving this god a shock. Chen Feng was still quite a prideful person.</p><br/><p>It would surely be quite an experience to witness a god's shocked expression. Alas, even as the apostle's contract entered his body, Chen Feng found in astonishment that he still had no reaction.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Hey? Instinctively, Chen Feng looked into his sea of consciousness. This was not right. Xiao Ying was obviously not doing anything. So what had happened to the godly power\u2026 As Chen Feng took a glimpse into his sea of consciousness, he was instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>There, all the godly power vanished the moment it neared the miniature person. All the godly power had been absorbed by the miniature person.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was stupefied. Holy shit, this miniature person truly could absorb godly power? Suddenly, he recalled that, due to Xiao Ying's appearance, he had believed that Xiao Ying was the reason his body had been unable to absorb godly power. Unexpectedly, his body truly couldn't absorb any, since it was all absorbed by the miniature person.</p><br/><p>Why was this happening? Chen Feng was doubtful. He could not make sense of this. The only thing that happened when this miniature person absorbed godly power was him not obtaining godly power for himself, halting his progress. There were no other benefits. Furthermore, he couldn't even make use of the godly power the miniature person had absorbed. He had no way of making this miniature person materialize in the outside world to fight for him, even though he truly wished he could.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Dude, you are dragging me down here\u2026\" He had never expected that this miniature person, which had always been so helpful, would be such a letdown at such a crucial moment. The godly power flowed in without stop, yet it was the same as throwing stones into a sea.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The god's expression was turning unsightly as well. He knew that Chen Feng's talent in godly power was poor. However, he had never expected it to be this poor. Previously, it had already been quite hard to push Chen Feng into the resonance realm. Now that he wanted to push Chen Feng into the apostle realm, it was indeed much more difficult than he had imagined. Unfortunately, he could only continue.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Godly power surged out without stop. The god clenched his teeth and sent even more godly power out.</p><br/><p>He had decided to use his powerful godly power to push Chen Feng into the apostle realm no matter what. And thus, a terrifying number of waves of godly power surged in. All of them entered Chen Feng's sea of consciousness\u2026 the boundless godly power.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Within his sea of consciousness, the miniature person welcomed the waves of godly power. The godly power that arrived in waves halted the instant they encountered the miniature person, then vanished. No matter how much godly power arrived, this continued. Chen Feng's sea of consciousness remained calm; not a single wave remained.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed. One minute\u2026 Two minutes\u2026 Three minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>\"What are you guys doing?\" The huge monkey scratched his had with a puzzled expression. \"Lord God, hurry up and finish the contract.\"</p><br/><p>The huge monkey was truly confused. This god had said that he would turn Chen Feng into his apostle using the contract. Yet why was it that they both had been maintaining that weird pose for so long without moving?</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" As the god heard this, his face darkened. Even he wanted to ask the same question. The contract had obviously been sent out. His godly power had clearly been unleashed without holding anything back. Why? Why was nothing happening? This fellow\u2026 The god's expression became scarily unsightly.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng was feeling rather awkward as well. What could he do? He was clear on what was going on. As such, after careful consideration, he cautiously said, \"Why don't we forget about this?\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the god was infuriated. \"Forget?\" Are you looking down on me now? I am a god!</p><br/><p>He was furious. He felt like he had lost the prestige he should have as a god. All other gods only needed to casually wave their hands to make anything happen. Yet he, similarly a god, had failed every single time he had tried to show off. Moreover, so many awkward incidents seemed to be happening. Even worse was the fact that he had even lost an apostle to this. Was stopping even an option for him now? No, it was not! He had no choice but to grit his teeth and proceed.</p><br/><p>The god spoke coldly. \"I said that I will turn you into an apostle. I will do what I said.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A holy beam appeared. The god had actually intensified his godly power, unleashing his full power upon Chen Feng's body. At present, the god was shrouded in a dazzling radiance; he appeared incomparably divine. As for the herculean apes, they all became filled with expectation when they saw this. So this was the so-called apostle's contract?</p><br/><p>Only Chen Feng knew clearly what was going on. Somewhat awkwardly, he watched on as the waterfall of godly power entered his sea of consciousness and vanished. So what if the amount of godly power was increased? It could not even start fusing with his sea of consciousness. It all\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as Chen Feng was about to say something, suddenly, he felt like the miniature person's complexion seemed to look better than before. This was not a misconception on his part. Rather, the miniature person's complexion was truly looking better.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was feeling doubtful. \"Could it be\u2026\" Was the nourishment of godly power bringing about some change in the miniature person? That was quite possible. Chen Feng's heart trembled. If so, it seemed like it wasn't a bad thing after all for the miniature person to absorb the godly power. He proceeded to try syncing with the miniature person, and he found with astonishment that his amplified strength had actually increased compared to earlier.</p><br/><p>The miniature person had indeed improved. Was this the effect brought about by the godly power? Too strong!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng finally understood. \"He is absorbing the godly power to improve.\" So it turned out that this was the manner in which the miniature person improved. However, this was quite an astonishing method of improvement. After all, godly power was not normally something one could obtain casually. Who would have guessed that this miniature person actually required godly power to improve?</p><br/><p>\"If this is the case, things will be quite troublesome.\" Chen Feng smiled bitterly as he realized that if this was the case\u2026 he would never be an apostle in his entire life.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Waves of godly power surged in. The lord god was still trying his very best to pour godly power into Chen Feng. Unfortunately for him, he did not realize that the godly power he was pouring in was working as fertilizer instead of the way he intended.</p><br/><p>Five minutes, eight minutes, 10 minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, when it reached the point that even the god's expression was turning pale, he gave up. The apostle's contract had failed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

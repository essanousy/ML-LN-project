One month? There truly wasn't much time left for him. Even though the devil race had suffered losses due to their previous defeat, the S-class giant devil that had recently appeared served as a frightening deterrent. That single giant devil was akin to a nuclear warhead.</p><br/><p>As for the ancient race, Qin Hai had always been curbing them. However, with the existence of their Land of Legacy, the ancient race would never be eliminated for real. Moreover, Qin Hai would never be able to truly gain complete control over the ancient race unless the Land of Legacy was destroyed. Chen Feng shook his head, as this was an unrealistic expectation. There, an old man was hidden in seclusion. Moreover, there were also numerous peak beyond A classes residing there as well. Regardless of how many human experts were sent there, it would be no different than throwing rocks into the sea.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"Forget it. I won't think about it too much.\" His utmost priority right now was to enter beyond A class in the shortest time possible.</p><br/><p>I am currently a peak beyond B class and can become a beyond A1 by breaking through the bottleneck and fusing with a new gene, Chen Feng thought inwardly. With his current strength, at most, he would be able to force a beyond A5 forcefully thanks to his strength as a peak beyond B class. If he was able to enter beyond A class\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gaze burned. \"Perhaps, I could even be a match for Li Lei.\" In a way, Li Lei was one of the apex existences among humanity. He was a beyond A8. As long as Chen Feng entered beyond A class, he would possess such combat power as well, even if this combat power would only be made available by erupting with his trump card. At least with that, he would possess powerful self-defense capabilities. If so, the only thing he needed to concern himself with was breaking through in the shortest time possible. Chen Feng looked at the latest data on the training camp.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Following the Genetic Union's guide, he reached his destination. There, two people were already waiting for him.</p><br/><p>A male of around 30 years old nodded at Chen Feng as he introduced himself, \"Qian Chen.\"</p><br/><p>A delicate-looking young lady smiled sweetly as she introduced herself, \"Si Fan.\"</p><br/><p>Both of them were peak beyond B classes. For them to have been able to obtain the qualifications to enter this camp from the numerous beyond B classes of the Genetic Union, their contributions to the Genetic Union were apparent. Either they had terrifying backers or they were\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded slightly. \"I am Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"We know.\" Si Fan smiled. \"You have been rather popular recently.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thanks,\" Chen Feng replied politely.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go,\" Qian Chen stated faintly. \"We have been waiting a long time for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Chen Feng did not bother saying anything much. This time, the three of them were the participants in this training camp. Based on the content of this training camp, their goal here was extremely simple: to enter the \"ownerless land.\" That was a place with a unique environment. If one were able to grab the chance presented properly, one would be able to break through. This was the training camp with the lowest difficulty level among all training camps for their level.</p><br/><p>\"That is a unique place. There, the environment is rather harsh. However, it is also precisely this harsh environment that will allow our energy to be tempered, helping us in our breakthrough,\" Si Fan explained gently. She wasn't someone with an exceptionally beautiful appearance, yet she gave off a feeling of comfort to onlookers. When talking, her voice was gentle and soft. A person like this should be the ideal partner for a lot of people.</p><br/><p>\"Is that so?\" Chen Feng narrowed his eyes. Ownerless land\u2026</p><br/><p>Qian Chen shared his knowledge as well. \"In this mission, there are no ancients or devils. If nothing unexpected happens, there will only be the three of us there. As such, you don't need to worry too much about it.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"I don't think I have any information worth sharing.\" He had only selected this training camp at the last minute out of various camps. Furthermore, he hadn't been on the waiting list, nor had he been waiting for a year or so like others. Naturally, he had not had the opportunity to learn more about this camp.</p><br/><p>\"No worries. It will be fine so long as you don't bring us any trouble,\" Qian Chen stated bluntly.</p><br/><p>Si Fan smiled. \"You don't need to mind him. This is how he is, a blunt person. When I had just arrived, I suffered from his words several times as well. I nearly start chopping at him with my weapon.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled. Qian Chen raised his brow yet remained silent.</p><br/><p>\"This ownerless land is a training camp discovered long ago. However, at that time, due to the environment there being too harsh, B classes were unable to survive there. As for A classes, this place is useless for their breakthrough. As such, this place was considered an abandoned region. But due to the appearance of beyond X gene reagents, beyond B classes appeared, resulting in this place being converted into a proper training camp. Ultimately, this is thanks to you.\" Si Fan shook her head. \"Without your beyond X gene reagent\u2026\"</p><br/><p>So that's the case, thought Chen Feng. Only beyond B classes could temper themselves in this unique environment?</p><br/><p>Si Fan flashed a wide smile. \"You don't have to worry. It has been 10 years since this place was discovered. No other life forms had ever appeared here. If everything goes smoothly, we might be able to break through in a single day.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Mhm.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Chen maintained his silence as he led the way. Soon, the three reached their destination. Interestingly, as they neared their destination, the sunny sky started darkening. By the time they arrived, the sky above them was already dark as night.</p><br/><p>\"It has gone dark?\" Chen Feng checked the time but noted that it was still two o'clock in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Qian Chen's body vanished abruptly before reappearing.</p><br/><p>\"The further it is from this place, the clearer the vision is,\" Qian Chen replied calmly. \"This is unrelated to the time of the day. Rather, this is caused by the unique environment here.\"</p><br/><p>Ah? Instant teleportation? This Qian Chen fellow was a spatial specialist?</p><br/><p>\"If it's only due to the unique environment, it's all good,\" Si Fan said with a smile. \"The last time the sky darkened suddenly like this, something extremely scary happened.\"</p><br/><p>She was clearly referring to the appearance of the devils.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go,\" Qian Chen stated faintly. \"Enter earlier so we can leave earlier.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>The two followed behind him in silence. Si Fan was feeling somewhat helpless. Evidently, she found this Qian Chen fellow somewhat dull, making this trip somewhat boring. Arriving, training, and finally returning... They might very well remain strangers even after completing this training camp. Truly\u2026 Si Fan shook her head as she lamented inwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Idol, remember to give me an autograph after this is over,\" Si Fan said to Chen Feng, smiling.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng chuckled. \"Not a problem.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, the three reached the ownerless land.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>This area was formed of a rocky mound. Countless rocks hovered in midair, some of them streaking across the air at a terrifying speed. Occasionally, rocks would collide against each other, creating terrifying shockwaves that spread all over. This was the ownerless land. Here, everything was ownerless.</p><br/><p>Si Fan opened her mouth. \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qian Chen wanted to say something as well. \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They both discovered that even when speaking, no sounds could leave their mouth. This was the first property of this ownerless land: sound restriction. This was a soundless place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

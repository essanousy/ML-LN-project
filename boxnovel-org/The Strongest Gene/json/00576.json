He had an odd feeling that even though there was only a patch of darkness up there, someone was observing them.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ying,\" Chen Feng urged inwardly, \"stay here in your void form. Do not show your real body no matter what.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Kong Bai retreated rapidly. Although the beyond A class creature was powerful, fortunately, it wasn't fast. With Chen Feng and Kong Bai's present strength, they were able to flee with only some difficulty.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The gigantic creature chased after them for five kilometers before giving up.</p><br/><p>\"Damn, I was almost scared to death.\" Kong Bai panted endlessly. \"That fellow's defense is too scary. My attacks couldn't even move it.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at him in amazement. \"You actually attacked?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" An awkward expression appeared on Kong Bai's face. \"A small attack.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng cautiously probed, \"\u2026Demonic Mirror?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai remained silent. It seemed like Chen Feng had guessed correctly. Chen Feng exclaimed in admiration. Kong Bai's demonic mirror had even failed to work on a giant creature like that? Was this giant creature the handsome one, or was Kong Bai the one that was too ugly?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai's expression darkened. \"What kind of gaze is that?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng coughed. \"Don't worry about it.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a scene flashed through his mind. This was the scene transmitted to him by Xiao Ying. As his strength increased, Xiao Ying's strength increased as well. After all, Xiao Ying had merged with Chen Feng's spiritual energy. As such, the two of them could still maintain communication even when far away. When Xiao Ying had scouted around earlier, it had been equivalent to gaining vision of the entire map. In Chen Feng's illusory world, the map was imprinted within his mind. His map contained everything within 50 kilometers.</p><br/><p>This was also how they had managed to flee from the giant creature easily. Xiao Ying was still presently remaining around 50 kilometers away from him. As the scene flashed through his mind, Chen Feng saw an astonishing scene.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>His pupils shrunk abruptly. What had he seen? Earlier, the place they had just departed from had suddenly transformed into ruins. No, to be more accurate, it had transformed into an unexplainable state of nothingness, a blank slate. That place remained in a state of nothingness where nothing existed. Everything around Xiao Ying was in a state of nothingness.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng raised his brow. \"Things are somewhat odd.\" That was a place they had been to, a place they had seen themselves, a place they had experienced themselves. How had it transformed back into a state of nothingness where no plants or animals existed?</p><br/><p>This place\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng's back chilled. Mysterious vegetation, the sudden appearance of life-forms, and then them all vanishing mysteriously\u2026 They seemed to have truly arrived at a rather amazing place.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \"Let's go back.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Kong Bai's foot trembled. \"Where?\"</p><br/><p>\"Where we came from. The place where we first descended into this world.\" Chen Feng had a resolute gaze. \"I need to verify something.\"</p><br/><p>Immediately, a tearless crying expression appeared on Kong Bai's face. He thought of that damnable huge creature. Wasn't returning there the equivalent of seeking death?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Don't worry. That thing can't outrun us anyway.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, they returned. That giant creature was nowhere to be seen along the way. They traveled through the forest without stop. When they were around 10 kilometers from their destination, Chen Feng stopped.</p><br/><p>This place\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shivered. Where Xiao Ying was, the world once again existed. Vegetation, life-forms, and the lush forest, everything had reappeared.</p><br/><p>Why? Chen Feng could not understand it.</p><br/><p>He retreated 200 meters and, with astonishment, noted that where Xiao Ying was, everything had once again turned into a state of nothingness. And when Chen Feng advanced, once again, everything there reappeared. That place 10 kilometers away from Chen Feng, a place where the naked eye couldn't see, he was seeing clearly through Xiao Ying. He witnessed the birth and destruction of all living beings. He saw the growth and disappearance of the forest.</p><br/><p>Everything there seemingly changed in accordance with their distance from that place. If Chen Feng advanced, those things would appear. If Chen Feng retreated, those things would vanish. The distance to trigger all this was 10 kilometers.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a dreadful thought surfaced in Chen Feng's mind. \"Could it be\u2026\" Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \"Xiao Ying. With me as the center, take a spin 10 kilometers around me. You don't have to make a perfect circle, you can move in a wavy line.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ying started moving around him. Next, an even more astonishing scene appeared in Chen Feng's mind. Distantly, as Xiao Ying moved, the environment would appear and disappear. When Xiao Ying neared Chen Feng, everything would appear. When Xiao Ying pulled away from Chen Feng, everything would vanish, with the distance between Chen Feng and Xiao Ying being the determining factor.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, Xiao Ying scouted the entire region. This time, Chen Feng was casting his senses out and was able to clearly feel everything Xiao Ying could feel. As Xiao Ying was moving around in his illusory state, even the world failed to detect Xiao Ying's existence.</p><br/><p>Finally, by the time Xiao Ying returned, Chen Feng's entire body had already chilled. This was a world that would only exist 10 kilometers around Chen Feng. Apart from this, everything remained in a state of nothingness. Wherever Chen Feng went, the world would be created. Whenever Chen Feng went away, the world would perish. Everything seemed to happen so lightly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \"Kong Bai, walk in that direction and stop around 500 meters from me. Remain within my sight.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Kong Bai walked over without hesitation. There, Chen Feng sent Xiao Ying out scouting once again. He noted that with Kong Bai as the center, a perfect 10-kilometer circle around him was a world, and everything outside was in a state of nothingness. As such, this was a world with Chen Feng and Kong Bai as the core? Chen Feng contemplated.</p><br/><p>But then, how had Xiao Ying scouted the distance of 50 kilometers around them earlier? This was strange. Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ying. Return to my body before leaving again with your physical body to scout around,\" Chen Feng said. Soon, Xiao Ying returned and left once again. Next, everywhere Xiao Ying went, a world filled with life could be seen. The nothingness from before was nowhere to be seen. With this, Chen Feng concluded that a world had been formed 10 kilometers around Xiao Ying as well. This was a world that only recognized physical objects. This world was incapable of sensing Xiao Ying's illusory state, thus allowing Xiao Ying to see the nothingness.</p><br/><p>Without Xiao Ying, Chen Feng and Kong Bai would most probably have spent their entire lives here without realizing that. This world was much scarier than they had imagined. Chen Feng was fearful. False world? No, this was a real world. The vegetations and animals that had appeared from nothingness were all real, merely depending on where Chen Feng's group was. This felt rather unreal, like a movie scene where the required environment would only be constructed where the scene required it. Outside of the constructed environment, nothing existed.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng remembered a particular movie in his previous life: The Truman Show .</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As for why the figures had stopped appearing at this point? It was quite simple. Rather than this being the limit of the Sin God\u2019s imagination, it was due to the total exhaustion of Wu Hui\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy godly power is already fully exhausted.\u201d Wu Hui smiled bitterly. This was the first time his godly power had been fully exhausted since he had entered the apostle realm. After all, he normally relied on the imagination of his enemies and so did not need to expend too much of his own energy. One could say that his normal exhaustion rate was extremely low.</p><br/><p>Yet this time, the more than 200 figures had fully emptied him. The scale of Ye\u2019s imagination was truly so great that they could only gasp in amazement. And that was why the figures had stopped appearing at this point. Naturally, from the Sin God\u2019s point of view, it was thanks to his Karma String that he had been able to drag all these enemies out. He had absolutely no idea that this had nothing to do with his Karma String.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the moment Ye made his move, both Chen Feng and Wu Hui were truly alarmed. This was especially true when all the figures transformed into ash at the same time. That shocking sight gave Chen Feng quite the fright. So it turned out that Ye had such a trump card? Worthy of being Ye!</p><br/><p>If so, were there any trump cards he had yet to show? Chen Feng used the godly power of luck to obtain an answer through deduction. After obtaining the answer, which he found favorable, he acted without hesitation. He unleashed the strongest attack he had ever launched, amplified to the power of three. The might of this attack reached an extremely terrifying level.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this attack couldn\u2019t have done anything against Ye at his peak. However, against this weakened Ye, this Ye who had no trump cards left, Chen Feng\u2019s attack displayed an astonishing effectiveness, immediately piercing through Ye.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Through Ye\u2019s chest the attack went.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 have joined them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye did not dare believe his eyes. Chen Feng, that pitiful human. All along, Ye had merely seen Chen Feng as a chess piece, a chess piece that was struggling for survival with great difficulty amid Ye and the silhoutte\u2019s conflict. Chen Feng had only been able to survive by fluke alone.</p><br/><p>Even Chen Feng\u2019s godhood was something Ye had personally bestowed upon him. And yet, Ye had never imagined that Chen Feng, whom he had personally gifted a divine seat, would be one to kill him with godly power.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye sensed the pain in his body and, at the same time, Chen Feng\u2019s power, which was absolutely beyond Chen Feng\u2019s level, a power that normally only major gods could unleash. Ye was indignant. He had calculated everything. He wouldn\u2019t be bothered even if all these elementary and journeyman gods were to rebel right here. That was because his body was sufficiently powerful to the point that a regular elementary or journeyman god was completely incapable of doing him any harm. As the strongest god, his body had been tempered to an extremely terrifying level.</p><br/><p>However, this attack of Chen Feng\u2019s\u2026 major god\u2026</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Ye laughed bitterly. This little fellow, who had received the gift of godhood from him, had reached such a height? He had been defeated, thoroughly defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cCreation God\u2026 Bright silhouette\u2026 Dark shadow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s eyes were filled with hatred. He was indignant and felt great hatred. He was the illustrious Sin God! How could he suffer such a miserable defeat? He was truly indignant. The only person he did not hate was Chen Feng, because as far as he was concerned, Chen Feng was still a pitiful chess piece.</p><br/><p>Ye laughed softly. \u201cHehe. Do you know that even after killing me, they won\u2019t let you off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>He could feel his power weakening and the organs within his body going rigid. Without the replenishment of godly power, his unequalled body was on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the Creation God is a kind person. However, too long has passed. That silhouette\u2026 I can feel the surging ambition within him.\u201d Ye laughed. \u201cYou will die. Ultimately, that silhouette will subjugate the entire world. Be extremely sure that his goal is definitely the subjugation of the entire world, including the world of humans. Your strength as a mere major god is far from enough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s gaze was filled with pity as he looked at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course he was aware of this. However, he had no other choice. He had to eliminate these two one at a time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter killing you, I will naturally go kill him as well,\u201d Chen Feng declared coldly.</p><br/><p>Ye howled with laughter. \u201cHahaha. Is that even possible? His strength is not below me. Perhaps, he has similarly powerful trump cards as well. What can you use to kill him? Do you even stand a chance? If\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t for the appearance of the shadow forcing my hand, how would you even have stood a chance against me?\u201d Ye said with disdain.</p><br/><p>Major gods? He had killed many of them not very long ago. If not for his fight with the shadow exhausting his trump cards, how could Chen Feng have had a chance?</p><br/><p>\u201cTrump cards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not deny this point. Indeed, an existence comparable to Ye would most definitely have terrifying trump cards. This almost certainly applied to that silhouette as well. Well, he would find out with time. Chen Feng took in a deep breath. Because he had lied about that silhouette being left behind by the Creation God, Chen Feng was the only one that was aware that the silhouette\u2019s real identity was still a mystery.</p><br/><p>Who exactly was that fellow? Chen Feng hadn\u2019t the slightest idea. Perhaps the day would come when he figured out who that person was. At that time, he would perhaps be able to figure out what his trump card was as well. As for now\u2026 As Chen Feng looked at Ye, a thought suddenly surfaced in his mind.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s body was gradually going cold. His consciousness was becoming blurry as well. Even so, a firm gaze was still maintained on his face. He was indeed worthy of being the once strongest god. Even with such an injury, he was still not fully dead.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be waiting for you.\u201d Ye had a faint smile as he looked at Chen Feng. \u201cWithin that endless abyss.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been defeated. Thus, he would admit his defeat. However, he would never allow a mere chess piece to ridicule him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Suddenly, Chen Feng laughed. \u201cThere is something I have forgotten to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s gaze focused on Chen Feng. \u201cMhm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as a bright silhouette and a dark shadow, nor is there anything like the leftovers of the Creation God\u2026\u201d Chen Feng whispered into Ye\u2019s ear. \u201cAll of that was but a lie told for the sake of killing you. What you killed with your trump card was just a fragment of your imagination\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ye would not believe these words easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook over there\u2026 and imagine the Creation God. See what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Chen Feng said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCreation God\u2026\u201d Subconsciously, Ye did as he\u2019d been told. And next, he saw that in that corner, a figure indeed appeared\u2026 This was the figure of the Creation God\u2026</p><br/><p>Instantly, Ye\u2019s blurry consciousness recovered a moment of clarity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Ye\u2019s gaze became bloodshot. Chen Feng! It was actually him! Everything had actually been his plan! How was this even possible?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke unhurriedly. \u201cI told you, I will return. The moment you conquered the human world, I said I would return and retake the human world right before your eyes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s mind trembled, his heart filled with unwillingness. He could admit his defeat toward the Creation God. However, this Chen Feng, a mere bug, an existence he could ignore, had actually\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ye calmed down. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told me this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng blanked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ye\u2019s voice became faintly discernable and illusory. \u201cWith my title as the Sin God, I hereby curse you\u2026 to eternal depravity!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod\u2019s curse!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding gods were so shocked that everyone retreated. The god\u2019s curse was a curse unleashed by a god with all his might and potential. It was an extremely terrifying curse. The stronger the user was, the scarier the curse. And Ye\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I no longer have anything, even without my divine seat\u2026 my accumulation throughout the years is sufficient to consign you to eternal damnation!\u201d Ye howled with laughter. \u201cIf it had been the silhouette and the shadow, seeds left behind by the Creation God, I would truly be helpless, as the Creation God is a greater god than me, an existence I can\u2019t curse. But you\u2026 Haha.\u201d In his final moments, Ye appeared deranged. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told me the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A black beam pierced through the void and directly entered Chen Feng\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet this end now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye\u2019s gaze became calm. Finally\u2026 everything was over\u2026 even if he was no longer immortal. However, this had concluded with an ending he found acceptable. However, right as his consciousness was fading, Chen Feng\u2019s voice sounded by his ear. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was there to thank him for? Before Ye could even react to this, his consciousness sank into slumber, an eternal slumber.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Against Chen Feng, who was constantly exhausting his power, if he wanted to avoid dropping down from S class, he had to use this method. This was the only way to solve his current predicament. The power of the counterseal was something he was clear on. It was a seal within one's body, and with this method, he would be able to recover his strength and reduce the coverage of the seal.</p><br/><p>\"You are all challenging my temper,\" the devil expert said indifferently. He spoke with a domineering tone, seeming telling those humans they were not the only ones with trump cards. As a top expert, he had even more trump cards, even in his current circumstance. This was a true devil expert, completely different than he had been when under the control of the old devil earlier.</p><br/><p>He pointed at Chen Feng. \"Destroy!\" A seal formed in midair before heading toward Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The terrifying seal immediately rushed at Chen Feng's body, seemingly unstoppable. This was the true usage of awakened power. It wasn't something Chen Feng could stop with his brutish handling of awakened power.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng punched forth. That seal formed with the power of the awakened was shattered with a single punch. The devil expert's lip twitched. This time, he had been able to see clearly. Damn it, this Chen Feng had actually wrapped the unique and unmatched power of awakened around his fist before punching out directly? How could this human possess so much of this awakened power? Was this precious power supposed to be used in such crude manner? The devil expert was somewhat dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\"Has the seal restricted too much of my strength?\" the devil expert self-mockingly asked. Even if he had removed the seal on his arm, at most, the seal had only been reduced from 90% to 80%. The seal remained, causing his powerful Letter of Destruction to actually be destroyed by such a brutish method. Still, using awakened power in such a manner, this feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>It was akin to seeing a small-time hoodlum wrap precious magic power around his fist to fight in a melee brawl. This was a fight that could be settled with a single fireball with the precious magic power, yet it was used in such a crude manner\u2026</p><br/><p>The devil expert's heart ached. If I had that much awakened power in my body\u2026 He had only recently been restored and had suffered from being sealed. As such, the amount of power he had was truly pitifully low. Seeing Chen Feng wasting power in such a manner, he couldn't endure it.</p><br/><p>\"Good. Very good.\" The devil expert took a deep breath. \"Let me properly see just how much remains of this power that you obtained through a unique method.\" He pointed midair. \"Condense!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, all the power within his body was concentrated into a single dot of light on his finger. That single dot seemed to contain an entire universe.</p><br/><p>The devil expert pointed at Chen Feng. \"Die!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Time seemed to stop flowing. The president and the rest were able to feel an intense sense of crisis even so far away, yet in such a situation, they could only wait. This was no longer a battle they could get involved in.</p><br/><p>Xiu!</p><br/><p>The dot of light, like a star in the sky, slowly headed toward Chen Feng. Despite the slow movement, it still appeared before Chen Feng instantly. Even though it appeared feeble, the power contained within it was able to cause space itself to collapse around it, as space was incapable of enduring the existence of such might.</p><br/><p>This attack was still launched using the proper control method for awakened power. The same power could display astonishing might through different control methods. This was a powerful ability of this superexpert's.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's expression became solemn. \"This power\u2026\" The awakened power indeed required various control methods. The same awakened power that Chen Feng had, when used by this devil expert, was able to display a much greater might. But this was also the best opportunity for him to learn.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit?\" Chen Feng asked inwardly.</p><br/><p>Spirit frowned as she said, \"It has been recorded. However, the analysis can't be completed in a short period of time.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Chen Feng's gaze became sharp. Spirit could only record and analyze it for him. Now, he could only rely on himself.</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>He could sense how terrifying that dot of light was.</p><br/><p>The dot of light locked onto Chen Feng, making it impossible for him to escape. However, Chen Feng had no intention of escaping. Rather, he activated all of the power within his body. He had decided to use the simplest method to deal with this: brute force!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The devil expert shook his head. \"How ridiculous. You are dreaming of stopping the attack with your idiotic control method?\"</p><br/><p>How ridiculous. If Chen Feng's control method was akin to a child waving a giant hatchet, the devil expert's control method was akin to the creation of the universe, soaring high in the sky before slashing down with the hatchet! Their levels of control were in entirely different leagues. How could Chen Feng stop his attack?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The dot of light charged at Chen Feng. The devil expert watched on coldly, awaiting Chen Feng's death. Next, he saw an extremely petrifying scene. That dot of light he had sent erupted, unleashing boundless power. Chen Feng, in a clumsy manner, blocked the attack with a power tenfold the quantity the devil had used to launch the attack earlier. In this manner, Chen Feng blocked the attack forcefully, exhausting its power. Ultimately, he ended up using a hundred times as much power as the devil had used to completely exhaust all the power making up this dot of light.</p><br/><p>\"???\" The devil expert was dumbstruck. How had Chen Feng obtained so much awakened power? Even if he had obtained some remnants of the Primordial Era, he should not have this amount of power. Perhaps he had in fact obtained a huge number of primordial items? The devil expert despaired. Was the creation of universe a terrifying feat? Yes, it was. Could a child waving a hatchet around stop it? No.</p><br/><p>Alas, this opponent had no intention of blocking. Rather, in a simple manner, numerous hatchets were tossed out, allowing him to slash at it as he wished until the moment he exhausted all his power. What the hell?</p><br/><p>The devil expert was alarmed. He had been an awakened for so many years, yet he had never seen someone use the awakened power in such a barbarous method. Never had he seen such wastage; never had he seen such a boring method of combat. Alas, this was exactly what had stopped his attack.</p><br/><p>The amount of power his opponent had wasted earlier\u2026 The devil expert grabbed at his heart as his heart ached at the thought of all that wasted power. If the power had been given to him instead, even if it had only been one-tenth of it that amount, he would have been able to destroy everything here long ago.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Seems rather simple?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" The devil expert narrowed his eyes. This human\u2026</p><br/><p>The young prince gave his ancestor a hasty explanation of Chen Feng, as he saw that things did not seem good. \"Ancestor, this is a bizarre fellow. In the human world, I heard of him. This fellow is good at creating miracles, capable of counterattacking when one least expects it. His luck is astonishingly good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Luck\u2026\" The devil expert contemplated. Was that how this guy had obtained so many primordial items? If he was lucky enough, he might truly have been able to obtain so many of them, but right now, the devil expert had to think of a way out of this predicament. Only by leaving here could he start removing the seal and recovering his strength.</p><br/><p>\"Can't you remove the seal now?\" The prince pulled at his clothes and righteously stated, \"I am ready for that.\"</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>The devil expert slapped this prince away, seemingly furious at him for being so useless. \"Do you think removing the seal is a simple affair? How long the seal removal takes is more than sufficient for me to be killed.\"</p><br/><p>The prince put on a wronged expression. \"Oh.\"</p><br/><p>The devil expert sighed. \"Seems like I can only do that, then.\" He could not ignite his remaining arm, as he would truly be a cripple if he did that. This time, he decided to ignite a certain part of his body that was quite an imposing sight. In any case, he hadn't had a chance to use it for several thousand years. Besides, he wasn't particularly interested in that. He might as well use it now to increase his power.</p><br/><p>And thus, under everyone's gaze, the devil expert's crotch ignited and started burning with a raging flame.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

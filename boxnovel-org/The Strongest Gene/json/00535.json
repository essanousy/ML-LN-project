Outside a crude-looking altar, an elderly devil race member was kneeling on the ground as tears streamed down his face. \"That lamp\u2026 has been extinguished.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>The hearts of the other devil race members trembled. They knew very clearly what that lamp signified. The future of the devil race depended on that lamp. Now that the lamp had been noiselessly extinguished\u2026 it seemed like the future of the devil race was gone as well.</p><br/><p>\"We received news that the humans are already preparing to come here,\" one devil race member stated.</p><br/><p>A different devil race member sighed. \"The people from the ancient race might come as well.\"</p><br/><p>Was this the reason that lamp had been extinguished? Humans\u2026 ancient race\u2026 They shut their eyes in pain. During the holy war back then, the devil race had been able to evade the disaster and had watched on as the barbarians fell. Unexpectedly, now, they did not even have the chance to restore their civilization.</p><br/><p>A sigh could be heard. \"If we had known it would be like this, back then\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What should we do now?\" asked several devil race members, their faces remaining expressionless. Since even that lamp had been extinguished, was there still any hope for the devil race?</p><br/><p>\"Get the prince here,\" the elderly devil race member said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Shortly afterward, a young devil race member appeared. His height was less than two meters, and his body shape was rather similar to a human's. On his face was a pair of lively eyes. He was Ling, the youngest prince of the devil race. Based on how humans calculated their age, this prince would be 12 years old. That was also why they'd been able to awaken this prince this early.</p><br/><p>After the prince they had been waiting for was castrated by the humans, the elders of the devil race had put all their hope on this young prince. The sequence of the awakening of the devil race members depended on the strength of the awakened devil race members. Apart from this, if one wished to awaken any particular devil race member earlier than the natural sequence, a high price would have to be paid. An example was this elderly devil race member.</p><br/><p>He coughed as he felt his vitality leaking out.</p><br/><p>The elderly devil race member sighed. \"Your majesty. The devil race no longer has any hope. I will gather several children so that you can escape together with them. The future of devil race will rest on all of you.\"</p><br/><p>Ling felt doubtful. \"Why?\"</p><br/><p>\"We failed to kill that human.\" The elderly devil race member sighed. \"In addition, our battle attracted the attention of the ancient race. Now that we are in the midst of our sacrifice ceremony, we can't stop it. By the side, the ancient race and human race are both stirring and are preparing to come. I'm afraid the devil race no longer has any hope.\"</p><br/><p>Ling was doubtful. \"Can't we try fighting them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we can, but\u2026\" The elderly devil race member gazed into the distance. His expression appeared even older now. \"That lamp has already been extinguished.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone sighed. That lamp was the soul lamp of the devil race. Burning it was the hope and future of the devil race. Now that even the tiny speck on that lamp had been extinguished, the devil race was truly finished.</p><br/><p>Ling seemed to recall something. \"Which lamp?'</p><br/><p>\"The one in the ancestral hall.\" The elderly devil race member shook his head. This young prince was truly still too young if he did not even know about this.</p><br/><p>Ling gained understanding. \"Oh, that lamp. I was just about to tell you this: the other day, while I was answering nature's call, my pee splashed on it accidentally, extinguishing the lamp. One of you can just go and light it again.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Everyone sunk into silence. The elderly devil race member who had been sighing earlier froze before lowering his head to gaze with expressions of disbelief at this young prince that signified the future of the devil race.</p><br/><p>\"Sp-splashed?\" the elderly devil race member asked while shuddering.</p><br/><p>Ling nodded. \"Yes. It's not that I want to nag you fellows, but something like a lamp is better placed somewhere higher, and it should be covered with a lamp cover. I have studied the humans. All these things are worth learning. When you guys place the lamp on the floor, isn't it too easy for some water to splashed on it? After all, when this prince pees, the pee can reach the length of around 30 meters.\"</p><br/><p>The other devil race members nearly fainted as they heard this. In other words, the lamp signifying the destiny of the devil race had actually been extinguished by the pee of this young prince? How lamentable.</p><br/><p>Flop.</p><br/><p>Countless devil race members knelt down in a daze.</p><br/><p>Only the elderly devil race member was still staring at Ling. Word by word, he asked, \"Say again, how was the lamp extinguished?\"</p><br/><p>\"Pee.\" Ling had no fear. After all, he was the young prince. When had he ever feared anyone?</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" The elderly devil race had a solemn expression. Bringing Ling with him, they arrived at the lamp. Looking at the extinguished lamp with his own eyes, he said, \"Where's Da Huang?\"</p><br/><p>A devil race member who looked like a dog appeared. \"Here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Check it,\" the elderly devil race member stated calmly.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Da Huang assumed a solemn expression. This lamp was, after all, the lifeline of the devil race. As such, Da Huang did not dare to be careless with it. Walking toward the lamp, Da Huang used his nose to sniff the lamp without stop. Next, with a solemn expression, Da Huang licked it before sinking into contemplation.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Da Huang opened his eyes. \"It was indeed peed on.\"</p><br/><p>The young prince: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>What the hell, these are my future citizens? Since awakening, this young prince had mostly been exposed to human culture. Influenced by human culture, the prince felt like these devil race members were all akin to wild uncivilized savages, even worse than those barbarian fellows. One ought to know that once upon a time, the devil race had been a race that signified grandeur and nobleness.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the elderly devil race member suddenly began to laugh wildly. \"Hahahahaha.\"</p><br/><p>This wild laughter shocked numerous people. Even those devil race members who had earlier collapsed in despair were startled by this laughter.</p><br/><p>\"The lamp was lighted by our devil race's indestructible fire. Wind and water cannot extinguish it, and it was supposed to burn forever. That was also why it was called the soul lamp of the devil race. But now, you have actually managed to extinguish it\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The elderly devil race member's eyes shone, seemingly seeing true hope for the devil race.</p><br/><p>\"So it turns out that you, young prince, are the true future of our devil race.\" The elderly devil race member's gaze seemed to burn. \"With your existence, perhaps we can really summon that lord\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" What? Ling was puzzled.</p><br/><p>A dreamlike voice rose. \"Prince. Now, come with us\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In this territory of the devil race's, the sacrifice ceremony that had been stopped quite a while ago resumed. Moreover, the speed of the summoning started to increase as chanting resounded throughout the area. Among the faint clump of radiance, an arm slowly appeared.</p><br/><p>Previously, this single arm alone was the very thing that had defeated Li Lei. This was where the devil race had stopped their ceremony previously as well. Now, the speed of the summoning seemed to have increased by more than 10 times. Perhaps that lord was truly going to be summoned?</p><br/><p>Ancient race? Humans?</p><br/><p>Hehehehe.</p><br/><p>The gazes of all the devil race members became fanatical. When that lord returned, all the ancient race members and humans could go to hell! All the devil race had lost would be regained!</p><br/><p>At the same time, at the border of the unknown regions, the team of humans finally entered the territories of the devil race after finishing their preparations.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>As they stepped in, the sky above them darkened. Different from the clear and boundless sky among the human territories, here in the unknown territories, which were equivalent to forbidden grounds for humanity, the endless darkness and torrential rain remained.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The black rain poured down, and the ground beneath them was already dyed black. Numerous devil race bodies appeared from the ground before surrounding all of them.</p><br/><p>Li Lei sneered. \"Indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Protected by everyone there, Chen Feng merely watched on silently. Since the devil race did not want them there, the devil race most certainly had some preparations in place. During this journey, every single patch of black land they stepped on might cause some devil race members to appear.</p><br/><p>Li Lei waved his hand calmly. \"Kill!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The genetic warriors moved and battle erupted. These newly awakened A-class devil race members seemed somewhat lacking in strength when compared to the Genetic Union members, whose strength had been greatly increased recently. The only alarming thing about them was their absolute quantity.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Group after group of devil race members appeared, seemingly without end. How many more of these fellows were there, exactly?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

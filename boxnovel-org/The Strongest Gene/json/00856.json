The unique aura here allowed this palace to hover in the air, a faint energy surrounding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp it maintain the null-gravity state,\u201d Shen Wei said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest continued defending this place seriously.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Loud booms occasionally sounded in the distance. The earth itself shook as the immense might of the impacts caused the entire palace to lean sideways. However, through the efforts of Shen Wei and others, the palace was stabilized.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay more attention. No matter what, we can\u2019t allow it to be hit,\u201d Shen Wei said.</p><br/><p>Shen Yi came over with a big smile on her face. \u201cLet me help as well.\u201d After all, here, only the two of them were truly aware of what this palace represented. In fact, the huge battle that was unfolding on the other side of this world was precisely for the sake of this palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lady Wang Yao\u2026 please wake up quickly,\u201d Shen Yi prayed. That terrifying demon king seemed to have descended upon this world.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long. We met not too long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Luo Yuan suddenly realized something. So that mysterious person had indeed been Chen Feng? How idiotic of him at the time.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at Luo Yuan indifferently. \u201cDo you even realize what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Entering this alien world signified that the very best outcome Luo Yuan could hope for was mutual annihilation. With Luo Yuan\u2019s intelligence, how could he do something so stupid?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan smiled. \u201cOf course. This was indeed quite the stupid thing to do. You kidnapped my clone and had even subverted him. Therefore, I, being furious, lost my reason and came charging here. Isn\u2019t that normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \u201c\u2026\u201d To hell with this \u201clost my reason.\u201d Did Luo Yuan look like someone who had lost his intellect at all? No, he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was all smiles. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? Come, sit down and have a chat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely regarded Luo Yuan coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, you younglings sure are impatient,\u201d Luo Yuan lamented. His gaze became cold. \u201cYou\u2019ve been tricking me for over 30 years. If even I am not in a rush to teach you a lesson, why are you in such a rush? Hehe, there are things that can\u2019t be rushed. In fact, I am very curious. All these years of keeping me in the dark, do I appear silly to you? I fell for all your plans and traps. For what? For the misfortune godhood, which is as good as nonexistent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sighed as he shook his head.</p><br/><p><em>Misfortune\u2026 </em>Chen Feng had a contemplative look. He glanced at the distant Wang Chun and signaled him. Instantly, Wang Chun understood. He immediately told Ming Yue to use the laws of this world to separate luck and misfortune. That\u2019s right, forceful separation. With this, Luo Yuan would have no chance of getting into contact with both without first destroying this world. No matter what Luo Yuan\u2019s true goal was, Chen Feng would never mind adding an extra layer of preparation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are truly too impatient,\u201d Luo Yuan said with a smile. \u201cWho told you that I\u2019m here for the misfortune godhood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here then?\u201d Chen Feng asked calmly. \u201cAre you only here for the sake of killing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Luo Yuan was all smiles. \u201cAfter all, you subverted my clone. Every step I take will be anticipated by him. Therefore, my subsequent actions will all be within your expectations. To avoid this, I can only do something I wouldn\u2019t normally do\u2026 by doing something you will never see coming. For instance, what I am doing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was very happy, seemingly feeling pleased with how his action had surpassed Chen Feng\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \u201cA dead end?\u201d After all, this path Luo Yuan had chosen was indeed a dead end. A dead end he could never return from even if he managed to emerge victorious from the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Luo Yuan approved of his choice greatly. \u201cOnly a dead end can surpass your expectations. Only by choosing a dead end will I be able to escape from your tricks. And only a dead end can\u2026\u201d Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze suddenly intensified. \u201c\u2026allow one to be reborn from death!\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Chen Feng sank into a solemn mood.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan moved. Chen Feng had long been prepared for this. However, Luo Yuan\u2019s attack was not directed toward Chen Feng, Kong Bai, or anyone else. Rather, this attack was headed toward his surroundings, toward the world restricting his strength.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying shockwave spread out. Luo Yuan was pouring out his power to destroy this world.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The Crystal Palace began shaking.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan cursed. \u201cHave you gone crazy?\u201d Had Luo Yuan truly become stupid? Chen Yuan thought back to his previous self. With his intelligence, he should have progressed step by step and slowly push Chen Feng to his death. How could he do something so hot headed? Moreover, to attack this alien world? What a madman! After all, the result of this world\u2019s destruction would be everyone\u2019s death!</p><br/><p>Was Luo Yuan truly here only to die together with them? As they thought of this, fear crept into their mind. Only Chen Feng became even calmer. Dying together\u2026 was in fact not the worst thing that might happen, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to die together with me?\u201d asked Chen Feng. The world rocked as the earth trembled. The entire world began cracking all over. Even Ming Yue and Shen Wang couldn\u2019t heal this world at this point. Luo Yuan\u2019s real body was too powerful.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan laughed. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, ripping space apart. Next, numerous people appeared from the tear. When Chen Feng looked over, he noticed that these were all subordinates of Luo Yuan, the gods Luo Yuan had accumulated throughout the years. There were several thousand of them here, each a formidable god in their own right. This world had been locked down. They shouldn\u2019t have been able to appear here. Since they had\u2026 Luo Yuan had to have kept them somewhere on his self when he came here.</p><br/><p>These people had to have been hidden somewhere on Luo Yuan. Perhaps they had shrunk, or perhaps they had latched on to him, or maybe they had used some other method. In any case, they had entered. However, what was the point of this? Even the strongest among these gods was merely a journeyman god, right? Chen Feng could probably kill a whole bunch of them with a casual wave of his hand. Why had Luo Yuan gathered them here?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you curious?\u201d Luo Yuan was all smiles. \u201cI am very curious as well. After all, this method is so stupid that even I myself would never have thought of it. However, this is also precisely something you never prepared for, right?\u201d Luo Yuan calmly said. Chen Feng had gained control over his clone, and Luo Yuan had been in at an absolute disadvantage. All his future actions would have been within their expectations. Therefore, he\u2019d had to kill his way to a solution.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart sank. \u201cThis fellow\u2026\u201d What exactly was this person intending to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost time,\u201d Luo Yuan muttered.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>As the world was on the verge of destruction, Luo Yuan poured his strongest might into the world. If this attack actually landed, the entirety of this world would be instantly destroyed. At this moment, everyone\u2019s gaze became focused.</p></div>\n</div>"}

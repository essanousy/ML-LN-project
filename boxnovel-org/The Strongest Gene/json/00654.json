Her face was pale as she ran with a huge belly. The elegance of the finest beauty of the scarab race was nowhere to be seen. Chen Feng had lured the enemies away for her. At present, she could only flee without stop, heading toward a location far away based on her memory. Alas, just as she was about to leave this area...</p><br/><p>\"Madam, where are you going?\" a sinister voice resounded. Madam's expression changed greatly as she raised her head abruptly. On the tree trunk before her, a monkey-like fellow could be seen. He had an ugly appearance and presently had his eyes locked on her.</p><br/><p>Madam's expression changed. Not good! She tried fleeing in a different direction, yet in a split second, that monkey reappeared in front of her again with the same sinister smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Madam, you won't be able to escape.\" The sinister voice caused Madam's entire body to chill.</p><br/><p>Madam paled. \"How is it possible for you to\u2026\" She recalled that the person from earlier had obviously lured everyone away.</p><br/><p>The monkey sneered. \"Hehe. Are you referring to those idiots? Indeed, I also saw those traces and also saw all of them chasing after that aura. However, none of them noticed that under the chaotic aura, an aura so feeble one couldn't miss it was hidden as well. Granted, that aura seemed like a diversion in and of itself. However, at that time, I asked myself, Why are there so many chaotic auras here? If the purpose was to confuse us, why is there such a clear aura trail after the chaos? That aura is way too clear, so clear that all the diversions seem pointless.</p><br/><p>\"That did not seem too logical. Thus, what was the point of the diversion? I thought about it for a long time. Perhaps those auras had all been left for the sake of hiding the real aura? Therefore, I discovered the weakest aura\u2026 Hehe.\" A proud smile appeared on the monkey's face. \"If I followed after those bastards, even if we managed to locate Madam, there wouldn't have been anything left for me in any case. I figured I might as well follow this single trail by myself. The probability of my guess being correct was low. However, so long as I found you, Madam, I would profit greatly.\"</p><br/><p>Madam's heart chilled. So that's the case.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe\u2026 I have been wondering why Madam fled. So that is the reason?\" the monkey said as he looked at the woman's belly, and he started laughing maniacally. \"Haha, I reckon those bastards never imagined that the madam of the scarab race actually got pregnant. Mhm\u2026 True, Duma hasn't returned for three years, as he was killed when he was outside. Logically, you shouldn't be pregnant. As such, they never thought of this. However, the scarab race\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Rumors have it that yours is a race capable of pregnancy even three or five years after sex. Hehe, if my guess is correct, the child inside you is the future Duma, since you are the sole surviving scarab-race member. Duma\u2026\" the monkey said in a trance-like manner. \"That is the soul of the scarab race. Now that it has entered the body of this child, if I can cook and eat this child\u2026\" The monkey laughed maniacally. \"Hahaha! The luck of the entirety of the scarab race shall belong to me!\"</p><br/><p>Madam's body chilled.</p><br/><p>Greed appeared on the monkey's face. \"Don't worry. I will take you away. I will care for you properly until the birth of this child.\"</p><br/><p>Despair appeared on Madam's face.</p><br/><p>At this time, at a certain faraway location, Chen Feng was also facing a life-or-death predicament, as he was surrounded by the tiger-faced man and others.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. What should I do? God Punisher? This was the strongest single target attack Chen Feng had at the moment. However, after thinking about it, Chen Feng realized with great grief that regardless of how strong God Punisher was, even if he could insta-kill his target, it was still a single target attack. He could only kill one of them with it. That would not do.</p><br/><p>Yet his others abilities would be even more useless against these people. He wasn't their opponent. If so, the only thing Chen Feng could rely on was his Luck Aura.</p><br/><p>He glanced at his luck value. At present, only half was left. The amount of 9,999 had seemed very terrifying, yet to ensure their escape earlier, he had been using it up without stop. Ultimately, Myriad Illusions hadn't been powerful enough. To conceal himself from these people that were far stronger than him, a huge amount of luck value had been required.</p><br/><p>Ten luck value exhausted\u2026</p><br/><p>Ten luck value exhausted\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed inwardly. This won't do. Although he had absolute superiority in terms of \"length,\" his strength was still lacking. Moreover, this absolute superiority was only against their humanoid forms. If the opponents were to transform back into their true forms\u2026 Mhm\u2026 Perhaps Chen Feng would be able to witness a \"big bird\" the size of several dozen meters.</p><br/><p>They approached him without stop. \"Hehehehe.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng asked, \"Why are you fellows staying in this form?\" He felt like he could try dragging this out by asking them some questions. \"Aren't your true forms even more powerful?\"</p><br/><p>\"It is a surprise that madam's taste is so heavy,\" the tiger-faced man said in astonishment. \"The beast form is, after all, still a primal form. Regardless of race, only the humanoid transformation is an indication of them being an expert. Madam\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The rest of them were rather shocked as well. Why was this madam asking such an idiotic question?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart thumped. Humanoid\u2026 This was not the first time he heard this term. The Primordial Era should not have any humans. Why did the term \"humanoid\" exist, then? All these races prided themselves on being able to assume a humanoid form and regarded only those capable of assuming a humanoid form as true experts. How had such an idea appeared?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng could vaguely feel that he had perhaps stumbled upon something amazing. But then\u2026 it was destined that these people would not be able to answer his questions.</p><br/><p>The tiger-faced man narrowed his eyes. \"Looks like Madam is trying to drag this out.\"</p><br/><p>\"Madam's voice is so charming. I reckon that Madam will perform very well in foreplay. However, too lengthy a foreplay isn't too nice, am I right?\" the snake-shaped man said as he approached.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the precipice behind him. From his memories, in all the movies he had watched, the main characters could survive by leaping down the precipice. Since he had the assistance of Luck Aura, it shouldn't be a problem for him to jump down as well. Instinctively, he glanced downward. Next, he noticed a rather powerful-looking beast falling down due to carelessness. Instantly, the beast transformed into dry bones.</p><br/><p>At the sight of this, Chen Feng's heart chilled.</p><br/><p>Shit, this wasn't how plots progress in the movies!</p><br/><p>The tiger-faced man saw Chen Feng's action and thought that \"she\" was contemplating suicide. Since they were planning to capture Madam alive, they could never allow suicide. \"Go!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying energy erupted.</p><br/><p>The tiger-faced man's eyes gleamed coldly. \"God Convergence!\"</p><br/><p>His calm eyes turned gold. From the gold pupils, terrifying energy shot out and locked onto Chen Feng's body.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng's body stiffened. He was no longer able to move.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was horrified. What damnable ability is this?</p><br/><p>Luck Aura, activate!</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>His luck value dropped crazily. Instantly, several thousand luck value disappeared. Finally, Chen Feng's body was no longer stiff. However, the \"Madam\" appearance he had been assuming started flickering, nearly disappearing.</p><br/><p>Shit!</p><br/><p>When Chen Feng saw a perverted hand reaching out, trying to grope him, he turned around and directly leaped down.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a leap, he entered the endless abyss of sure death.</p><br/><p>\"Not good.\"</p><br/><p>The tiger-faced man grabbed forth hastily, yet he failed to reach Chen Feng in time. With his eyes wide open, he stared blankly as Madam's body started flickering in an odd fashion before entering the abyss.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a loud boom, Madam's body vanished.</p><br/><p>They all sank into silence. The water down in the abyss was such that, regardless of how powerful a person was, death was assured by a single touch of the water. Not a single person was an exception to this. They had expected that Madam would attempt suicide. However, they had never imagined that they would fail to stop her.</p><br/><p>The snake-shaped man angrily glared at the tiger-faced man. \"Didn't you say that you could stop her suicide?\"</p><br/><p>The tiger-faced man was speechless. He had never imagined that the God Convergence he was so proud of would actually fail. One ought to know that this ability had a 99.99% success rate against awakened ones at the same level as him. The last time this ability had failed him was when he had used it on his second uncle.</p><br/><p>Damn it! he cursed inwardly. However, despite his regret, they weren't terribly troubled, since their mission was to only ensure the death of the sole survivor of the scarab race.</p><br/><p>\"Well then, let's announce the completion of this mission.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Chen Feng felt like he'd been scammed. What team project and competition\u2026 Had anyone seen a team project where there was only one person in the entire team? Chen Feng did not believe that he would be able to completely research the power of beyond just by himself. This did not seem like something Luck Aura would be able to do. At the very least, he needed to know clearly what exactly beyond A class was before he could proceed with his research, right? Right now, he did not even have a single team member. Chen Feng rubbed his head.</p><br/><p>\"Oh. The available participants have all been grabbed by other teams.\" Hou Liang felt somewhat awkward. \"There are only so many beyond-A-class warriors in the Genetic Union. As for talented researchers, there are also only so many of them. As such, all of them were recruited by the different teams in a short period of time. This project for you is one I have provided special authorization. As such, your project is different from the other teams, and thus you have also started later than the other teams. But you don't have to worry; I managed to obtain one unique privilege for you.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone as he heard this. \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>Hou Liang patted his chest. \"You can recruit your team members yourself!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng's expression darkened. Who was there to recruit? All the beyond-A-class experts and talented researchers had already been selected by other teams. Where should he go recruiting, then?</p><br/><p>\"I'm not doing this!\" The annoyed Chen Feng decided to just toss all responsibilities away and start leaving.</p><br/><p>Hou Liang pulled at him. \"Please don't. The future of humanity requires you.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stared at him coldly.</p><br/><p>\"The Gene Production Association requires you.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng still continued staring at him coldly.</p><br/><p>\"I require you,\" Hou Liang stated bashfully.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gave him a cold look before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>\"You will be given access to the entire formula warehouse,\" Hou Liang stated with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Chen Feng's face. \"And?\" If Hou Liang had mentioned this from the start, wouldn't this have been settled by now?</p><br/><p>Hou Liang sighed. \"You will also be given full access to the gene bank.\"</p><br/><p>He was aware that by granting these two authorities to Chen Feng, it was almost the same thing as granting Chen Feng control over the entire Gene Production Association, granting him control over all their resources.</p><br/><p>\"However, there must be some results in your research.\" Hou Liang's head ached. He was also under tremendous pressure.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"Don't worry. As long as it's true that I can recruit my team members as I wish, I will be able to do it.\"</p><br/><p>\"There's no problem with that,\" Hou Liang confirmed. \"As long as it's helpful to the research, you can recruit anyone.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled toyingly. \"Anyone?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hou Liang felt his hairs stand on end as he looked at Chen Feng's expression. However, after putting some thought into it, he reasoned that this was still the Genetic Union headquarters. As such, Chen Feng shouldn't be able to mess around too much here.</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\" Hou Liang confirmed with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" Chen Feng was very pleased. One day later, Hou Liang had already left Chen Feng to get busy with other matters. As for Chen Feng, he had already gotten started with the preparations for the research he was about to conduct. His first test subject was also contacted and was already here. However, this test subject had been maintaining an odd expression on his face all the while.</p><br/><p>He stared at Chen Feng helplessly. \"Is this proper?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng curled his lips. \"What's improper about this? Since Old Hou didn't recruit anyone for me, I shall recruit my team members as I wish.\"</p><br/><p>\"But\u2026\" That person pointed at the blazing alarm and smiled bitterly. \"The entirety of the Genetic Union's alarm system is blazing without stop.\"</p><br/><p>After all, his present identity was already different. This was especially true due to that black diamond shining on his forehead. That faint radiance served as an indicator of his present identity, a member of the ancient race. This person was precisely Qin Hai.</p><br/><p>To resist the invasion of the ancient race, the Genetic Union had long installed numerous defensive mechanisms. So long as the aura of an ancient race member was detected, the alarm would start blazing. Therefore, Qin Hai's appearance here had\u2026 mhm\u2026 triggered the entirety of the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit, there's really an ancient race member here?\"</p><br/><p>\"The detectors can't be wrong. An ancient race member has indeed appeared in our headquarters.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is too scary.\"</p><br/><p>\"Have the exact coordinates been located?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nope. This particular ancient race member is too unusual, too mysterious.\"</p><br/><p>\"We have already requested reinforcements. I suppose the true experts will show up soon enough.\"</p><br/><p>\"Continue!\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop all projects for now. Everyone, be on full alert.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>A chaotic mess of sounds could be heard without stop. The entirety of the Genetic Union had been thoroughly provoked. Almost all their A-class warriors were mobilized, and the only thing lacking to complement such huge mobilization was the destruction of their own headquarters.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai looked at Chen Feng, who had an innocent expression on his face. Qin Hai had only arrived here after receiving a message from Chen Feng. As such, the fault for this should not lie on him.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai spread his hands. \"What about what's happening out there\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ignore them. Nobody dares to intrude here anyway,\" Chen Feng stated calmly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>After finishing his words, he started taking out numerous gathering devices to gather the energy in Qin Hai's body. Qin Hai could only spread his hands helplessly and allow Chen Feng to do as he wished.</p><br/><p>\"Open your cloth wider. Yes, yes, correct.\" Chen Feng studied the energy that was appearing in the gathering devices. The color of the gathered energy was black, a rather unusual color.</p><br/><p>\"My energy should be somewhat different than other beyond-A-class warriors,\" Qin Hai stated with a bitter smile. He had an idea of what Chen Feng was trying to do. If the goal was beyond A class, using him as a test subject would be rather unreliable even though he was also a beyond-A-class warrior.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"I know, but you are the only one I can look for.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai raised his brow as he asked, \"What about your girl?\" If he recalled correctly, Wang Yao had broken through into beyond A class not long ago, right? After all, his senior apprentice sister's residence had been attacked precisely by this young lady alone. That attack had even resulted in countless casualties. Even his senior apprentice sister had been killed during that attack. If it hadn't been for his master making a move personally to restore her and fishing her out from the past, she would have been gone forever. As such, Wang Yao's strength had most definitely reached beyond A class.</p><br/><p>\"I already sent a message to her. Alas, I have not gotten a reply from her.\" Chen Feng was somewhat worried about her. After the Star City battle, there had not been any news from Wang Yao. If he hadn't known about what she had done from Qin Hai, he would have thought that something had happened to Wang Yao. Since the senior apprentice sister had been killed, what of Wang Yao, then? Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled something. \"Could it be that your master\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Nope.\" Qin Hai shook his head. \"By the time my master returned, their battle had already ended. I remember that Wang Yao had already left by that time. Hold on, let me check for you.\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai contacted his senior apprentice sister while Chen Feng got out of the detection range of Qin Hai's communication tool.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A screen popped out. Soon, Qin Hai's call went through. On his screen, that slimy ancient race senior apprentice sister appeared. She was indeed alive. Chen Feng was alarmed. That old man was the Sage from back then? Qin Hai's master\u2026 that fellow was truly capable of resurrection?</p><br/><p>However, as Chen Feng recalled how that old man's daughter, who was also the wife of Lu Hun and the one who had previously worshipped Chen Feng, had also tried resurrecting Chen Feng, he found the fact that the old man was capable of resurrection acceptable. That was the power of time. A power that, apart from that old man, his daughter also possessed.</p><br/><p>\"Senior apprentice sister, how are you?\" Qin Hai asked sincerely.</p><br/><p>The ancient race female snorted. \"Hmph! Even you have heard of it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\" Qin Hai expressed his anxiousness and asked, \"Are you fine? How did a human manage to get there?\"</p><br/><p>\"I was tricked,\" the ancient race female stated coldly. \"I was tricked by that damnable human called Chen Feng. That is why a beyond-A-class human managed to follow my trail to where I was staying. However\u2026 hmph. This is something I will repay her sooner or later. That person called Chen Feng and that damnable little girl, I heard that Lu Hun has encountered that Chen Feng guy before as well. I was just about to go ask about him.\" As she finished her words, the ancient race female stood up.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai took this opportunity to ask, \"Little girl? The one who defeated you was a little girl? Where is she now? Let me help you capture her.\"</p><br/><p>The ancient race female shook her head. \"I have no idea. I suppose she left long ago.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Qin Hai put out an expression of extreme disappointment. Next, he glanced at Chen Feng. Chen Feng nodded at him. Since Wang Yao had managed to leave, she should be fine. \"All right then. Senior apprentice sister\u2026\" Qin Hai nodded his head. Just as he was about to say something, his eyes suddenly widened. Unbelieving, he stared at his screen with a dumbfounded expression.</p><br/><p>A mournful scream resounded. \"Ah\u2014\" This mournful scream of that ancient race female appeared so very tragic.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Even Chen Feng by the side was shocked.</p><br/><p>The voice seething with extreme hatred of the ancient race female resounded. \"It's you!\"</p><br/><p>Who??</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at Qin Hai's stupefied expression before listening to the voice of that ancient race female. Suddenly, he thought of a single possibility. With a single wide stride, he walked to the front of the screen. On the screen, it could be seen that, presently, the ancient race female couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the screen. That was because, once again, a huge flaming sword could be seen protruding from her chest. The person who had stabbed her was precisely Wang Yao!!!</p><br/><p>\"Hi. Long time no see.\" Wang Yao smiled lightly, and in a low voice, she said, \"I have waited a long time for you, yo.\"</p><br/><p>The ancient race female was alarmed. \"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I find resurrected people particularly annoying. I promised him that I will kill you. Therefore\u2026goodbye,\" Wang Yao said.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>The body of the ancient race female was pierced through.</p><br/><p>The ancient race female fixed her gaze on Wang Yao. \"You won't be able to kill me for real\u2026\"</p><br/><p>As far as the ancient race female was concerned, this little girl wasn't truly strong. If the ancient race female was in her peak condition, this little girl could be killed very easily. But now, due to the forceful descent of her main body to her clone, she had been damaged badly, resulting in a drop in her strength. This had given the little girl a chance to take advantage of her momentary weakness. And now, even after her resurrection, she had yet to recover her full strength, and just like that, she was killed yet again by this little girl.</p><br/><p>\"Wait for me! When I return once again\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The ancient race female was filled with hatred. How could she not feel hateful after being killed two times in a row by this little girl that was far weaker than her peak strength?</p><br/><p>Wang Yao smiled lightly. \"You won't be able to return anymore. Although I do not have power over time, I am ultimately a person who went through transmigration before. When the time imprint of a person's existence is erased\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Wang Yao slapped her palm on the ancient race female's forehead. \"You will be eternally erased.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" The ancient race female gazed at this little girl blankly before collapsing loudly onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>The communication tool was broken after the fall, causing the scene on the screen to vanish instantly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

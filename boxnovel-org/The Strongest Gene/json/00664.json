But I can replay what happened earlier. Please wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A screen appeared. There, what had happened when Chen Feng's soul had traveled to Earth was replayed. Similarly, only a few seconds had passed in the present world this time as well. In the few short seconds, the purple dot on his neck had flickered suddenly before transforming into that pen.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was shocked. \"This purple dot\u2026\" He found that in the shown scene, even prior to his entry into Mysterious Town, the purple dot had remained on his neck.</p><br/><p>\"What's up?\" Spirit had an odd feeling. Wasn't the purple dot something that had always been on his neck? Why was he reacting like this?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng realized something. \"So that's the case.\" In short, history had changed, resulting in him having this purple dot growing up. The purple dot had been hidden on his neck all along until this moment when he'd returned to Earth. Only then had it awoken.</p><br/><p>Doubt flashed through Chen Feng's eyes. \"What are you, exactly?\" The moment he used this thing, a formidable power would erupt from it. Chen Feng had a feeling that if he used it forcefully, something unimaginable would happen. That was why he had stopped it, as that something was akin to a barrier that would break apart with a single jab.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. If he was able to control the usage of this power and restrict it to a certain threshold that would not break that barrier\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, he took the pen out.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The booming sounds he expected to appear once again appeared.</p><br/><p>Everywhere around the world, it resounded. Those people that had concealed themselves, those experts that had just finished preparing to return to their long slumber, opened their eyes once again and, with a joyful expression, listened to the booming sounds.</p><br/><p>\"Here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, so it turns out that the stop earlier was merely an accident.\"</p><br/><p>\"It is here again!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was ecstatic. Once again, the powerful phenomena appeared throughout the world.</p><br/><p>Filled with anticipation and in a fanatical manner, they waited for that legendary power. And next, just as they were about to touch the power, everything vanished once again.</p><br/><p>\"???\" Everyone was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\"Gone again?\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, I was so near to regaining it.\"</p><br/><p>\"What happened, exactly?\"</p><br/><p>The numerous experts cast their senses out blankly and helplessly, searching for the aura that had vanished. They had obviously been on the verge of success! Why had it suddenly disappeared? None of them had the answer. And now they felt rather awkward, as they did not know if they should return to where they had been hiding all this while. Should they go into slumber yet again? Or keep waiting?</p><br/><p>In case\u2026 in case it returned, then what? Alas, after waiting a long time, it did not reappear.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps fate has yet to come.\"</p><br/><p>They sighed in regret. Alas, right before they entered their slumber, once again, the booming resounded worldwide. That symphony of resonance, that pounding from the depths of their souls, was once again calling to them.</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>Again!</p><br/><p>They waited in anticipation. Once again, the phenomena appeared.</p><br/><p>One step\u2026</p><br/><p>Two steps\u2026</p><br/><p>At the precise moment when they were about to touch the phenomena, everything vanished.</p><br/><p>All the experts raged. \"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>\"Screw this! Which asshole is doing this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Gone again!\"</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong with that bastard?\"</p><br/><p>\"What exactly is that fellow doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea. This guy is like someone who can't pee smoothly\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They were all furious. Pacing back and forth, they waited, not knowing what to do. Subsequently, the booming indeed returned several times. Yet each time, it vanished at the crucial moment. Only a single one of them needed to succeed for this resonance to remain for real, yet unfortunately, it did not happen.</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps\u2026\" Suddenly, one of them thought of something. \"I understand. After all, it has been very long since this land got a new awakened one. As such, a certain awakened one might have been trying to break through after obtaining some primordial power. The moment he finishes comprehending the power of resonance, this mysterious veil that has been sealing us will be thoroughly torn apart.\"</p><br/><p>The rest pondered. \"You are saying\u2026 He does not have sufficient strength?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! He's too weak!\"</p><br/><p>\"This should be a regular awakened one who accidentally found out about resonance and tried entering that realm. Unfortunately, the method he is using is too idiotic, resulting in this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps we can assist him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's feasible.\"</p><br/><p>The experts communicated with their senses. Only a little power needed to be lent to that person\u2026 They were all incredibly powerful existences that had been sealed on this land and couldn't leave for real unless the Primordial Era appeared once again. As such, it was not a problem for them to first lend a tiny bit of their power to that person. Perhaps\u2026 this was their only hope!</p><br/><p>As such, when the power of resonance appeared once again, all these legendary experts unleashed their powerful, rare, and precious power over to the origin of resonance.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in Mysterious Town, Chen Feng, who was waving the pen around, found with joy that his strength actually increased for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>\"Using this thing can actually increase my strength?\"</p><br/><p>He was pleasantly surprised. It had been a long time since his strength had last increased. He had initially believed that he would not be able to increase his strength anymore in his entire life. Unexpectedly, this mysterious pen was actually able to increase his strength.</p><br/><p>Splendid!</p><br/><p>\"In any case, it will be fine so long as I don't go over that limit. I can try it out a few more times.\"</p><br/><p>The elated Chen Feng started acting according to his plans.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The pen in his hand fluttered around. Numerous powers surged out and converged together without stop. At this moment, all over the world, everyone was waiting in anticipation for the power of resonance to go over the limit required to lift their seal. They could vaguely feel that the power was increasing without stop.</p><br/><p>\"He has become stronger.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"He will be able to break through sooner or later.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>They could personally feel the never-ending symphony of resonance. They waited as the symphony of resonance increased in intensity, waited for the moment of rebirth, waited as that person charged forth time and time again in his attempt to break through.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 wasn't he taking too long? The power at their disposal was already very rare and little in amount. However, even after channeling their power to that person, he still seemed stuck, forever unable to break through.</p><br/><p>Over and over.</p><br/><p>Soon, some of them gave up. However, some still persevered on. Depressingly, regardless of the amount of power they channeled over, that person was still stuck a tiny distance from breaking through.</p><br/><p>Thereupon, the legendary symphony of resonance behaved like some public speaker, being replayed over and over again.</p><br/><p>Toward the end, when this symphony resounded once again, all the experts merely watched on with stupefied expressions, watching as the phenomena appeared before vanishing, too lazy to even stretch their hands out anymore.</p><br/><p>Swindler!</p><br/><p>They were all numb now.</p><br/><p>\"This person is probably so stupid that he wouldn't be able to comprehend resonance his whole life, right?\"</p><br/><p>They all despaired. After so many years, the first person to touch upon the power of resonance was actually someone with such a terrible aptitude, someone so idiotic! Regardless of the amount of power they had channeled over, that person had still failed to break through.</p><br/><p>\"Trash!\" they cursed before finally deciding to ignore that person. They had never expected that a day would come when they would hear the symphony they so yearned for to only feel annoyed by it, so annoyed that they feel like killing someone.</p><br/><p>Screw this resonance!</p><br/><p>Screw this symphony!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had imagined countless possibilities, yet he had never imagined that this unlucky person was actually Mu Yuan. Why was it him? What sins had Mu Yuan committed to deserve this? Chen Feng was speechless as he recalled the sad Mu Yuan in the hotel when he had lost his first love back then and the subsequent Little Min incident, which nearly crippled him. Now\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was feeling somewhat embarrassed about having to tell Mu Yuan this truth. How was he supposed to tell Mu Yuan? Should he tell Mu Yuan that his wife had actually been a male, previously known as Li Goudan, and was older and much stronger than him and was also previously known as Bro Scarface and a tyrant in his village of origin? How was Chen Feng supposed to say that? Could he even bring himself to open his mouth? Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing?\" Mu Yuan appeared rather resentful. \"Are we really this unfamiliar with each other?\"</p><br/><p>Although they hadn't met for quite a while, they had still kept in touch relatively frequently by way of messaging tools. This rather awkward appearance of Chen Feng's was truly giving him an odd feeling, making him rather unhappy.</p><br/><p>\"No, of course not.\" Chen Feng patted his shoulder and looked at Lady Yua Lan. \"But this person here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan grinned happily. \"Because of Yue Lan? True, my Yue Lan is truly a goddess. Hmph. You have no idea how long I spent pursuing her back then.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Lan smiled in a somewhat pampered manner. \"The only thing you know how to do is brag about the past.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan wrapped his hand around her slender waist. \"Of course I need to do that. That is the biggest victory of my entire life.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Lan smacked him lightly in a somewhat bashful manner. \"Naughty.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bro Scarface was actually acting in this manner?</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. So why have you come to Sea City?\" Mu Yuan asked. A conflicted expression appeared on Chen Feng's face. What should he do? Gazing at that expression of happiness on Mu Yuan's face, Chen Feng truly didn't know how should he say this. Chen Feng shook his head. \"Nothing. I'm only here to release some production missions.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan's eyes shone. \"Oh? What mission? Is there anything I can handle? Hehe, if there is, why don't we settle it internally?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's fine for me.\" Chen Feng thought about it and issued a bunch of purchase orders to Mu Yuan. \"We are in quite a rush for these orders. These are all low-level purchase orders. I initially planned to let the Sea City branch have a look at them.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan patted his chest. \"Let me deal with it. I am quite familiar with the people in the branch here. Don't worry, I will deal with this today.\"</p><br/><p>He was aware of Chen Feng's present identity. Since Chen Feng had mentioned that he was in a rush, these things were assuredly extremely important.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right, do you have any vacancies for harvesting-related jobs?\" Mu Yuan had a conflicted expression. \"Can you get a better job for my Yue Lan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Harvesting\u2026\" Chen Feng muttered to himself. \"Well, I'm going to the Procurement Department anyway. I can ask their manager about this. Yue Lan, right? Well, you can lead me there, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right,\" Yue Lan replied gently.</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan was overjoyed at this. \"Many thanks.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"No worries.\" Next, Mu Yuan rushed to the branch, and Yue Lan brought Chen Feng to the Procurement Department. As for Chen Feng, his gaze remained on this Lady Yue Lan. Indeed, something seemed off. Despite the deep concealment, with Chen Feng's present strength, he was most definitely capable of sensing something different about her. An ancient race member was, after all, an ancient race member. However, what exactly did these ancient race members have in mind at this time?</p><br/><p>With the current circumstances of the ancient race, were these refugees still thinking of returning? Or were they willing to live like humans instead? All these were things Chen Feng needed to ascertain. If they could truly make these ancient race refugees part of humanity, the strength of humanity could very well increase. Chen Feng sank into contemplation as he considered all this.</p><br/><p>At this time, Lady Yue Lan, who was leading the way, sensed Chen Feng's unrestrained gaze. After enduring it for a long time, she was finally furious. Yue Lan clenched her teeth as she said, \"Your distinguished self, please do not look at me wantonly. You are Mu Yuan's friend, after all. Please have some respect for him.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\" Holy shit, Bro Scarface is angry! \"You truly love Mu Yuan?\" Chen Feng asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Yue Lan did not know what Chen Feng was trying to say.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know who I am, then? What my status is?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026A big shot of the Gene Production Association?\" Yue Lan replied after pondering the matter.</p><br/><p>Ever since she'd entered human society, she had always been hiding herself. Even subsequently, she had only dared move around a small area, and she did not even have a single communication device on her. As such, she'd been rather cut off from the latest news. A lot of things she knew were things she had found out gradually after getting to know Mu Yuan.</p><br/><p>\"I am Chen Feng. Perhaps you have never heard of this name,\" Chen Feng said faintly. \"However, you will most definitely be aware of some of my feats. For example, the beyond X gene reagent is something I created.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, the expression of Yue Lan changed. Beyond X\u2026 after experiencing what happened in the ancient race, she was most certainly aware of how terrifying that beyond X gene reagent was. Moreover, she was also someone who had become a beyond A class after using that gene reagent.</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Chen Feng's face, \"Secondly, I am also the mastermind behind the activation of the Nine Yin Demonic Termination.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An explosion seemingly appeared in Yue Lan's brain as she paled immediately. The moment \"Nine Yin Demonic Termination\" came out of Chen Feng's mouth, she knew why Chen Feng had been staring at her without restraint, and she was also aware of why Chen Feng's gaze had been so odd.</p><br/><p>Yue Lan panicked. \"S-sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"You fellows from the ancient race are truly getting excessive\u2026 You guys are already in such situation yet you still dare to come here?\"</p><br/><p>Yue Lan panicked. \"It was my own idea to come here. I am here to take refuge. Really, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gaze became cold and detached. \"There's also Mu Yuan\u2026 Daring to collude with the ancient race\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"It has no relation to him.\" Yue Lan prostrated before Chen Feng, knocked her head loudly on the ground, and started begging without stop. She told Chen Feng everything she had done and everything that had happened since she'd escaped toward the human society. Chen Feng became speechless.</p><br/><p>Hold on, this plot seemed wrong\u2026 Wasn't the plot supposed to develop toward a direction where Bro Scarface rose vigorously and started resisting arrest and Chen Feng had no choice but to kill him? Why had Chen Feng instead transformed into a villain separating this lovely couple instead?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"You truly love Mu Yuan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" Yue Lan stated in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\"Return, then. After this, I will get someone to contact you and perform some simple authentication for you. If possible, I will help you truly become part of humanity,\" Chen Feng stated calmly.</p><br/><p>Yue Lan was overjoyed. \"For real?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Suddenly, Chen Feng said, \"However, since you are going to become part of humanity, if, in the future, a war were to erupt between humanity and the ancient race\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yue Lan unhesitatingly replied, \"I will most certainly battle for humanity! I am one who has experienced the most bitter of circumstances in the ancient race. I am one who was forced away by those of the ancient race. My hatred toward them might be even higher than yours.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. \"Very good. Go back to your job first, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Yue Lan bowed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng regarded her as she left. From the darkness, several genetic warriors walked out. All of them were beyond A classes. This wasn't surprising. Since Chen Feng had dared to confront this beyond-A-class ancient race member, he most certainly hadn't been acting alone.</p><br/><p>\"How's the test result?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"No problems found,\" one of them replied. This person specialized in mind reading. If he fully activated his power, even a beyond A class could not escape his reading, let alone this female here who hadn't been prepared for this at all. \"This lady's thoughts are consistent with what she said. Moreover, even when she was prostrating and knocking her head on the ground until she bled, she never thought of making a move against you. She never thought of killing you. When she spoke of her origin earlier, she had even prepared to sacrifice herself to protect Mu Yuan. This lady is truly in love with Mu Yuan.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng listened silently. He looked at a different person. \"How about you?\"</p><br/><p>\"The data has been verified,\" that person stated faintly. \"Using our tools, we received the same conclusion as those who judged using their ability.\"</p><br/><p>Is that so? Chen Feng shut his eyes. When conflicts arose between two races, one could not allow their personal feelings to affect their decisions. However, if both aspects could be controlled properly, that would be for the best. An example was what he had just witnessed. It was certainly for the best if this ancient race expert could become a part of humanity. However, this was based on the premise that these ancient race members that were willing to join them truly lacked any problems.</p><br/><p>\"Qin Hai.\" Chen Feng contacted Qin Hai directly to obtain the details. Not just Yue Lan, Chen Feng wanted to obtain the details of all other ancient race members that had taken refuge in the human world. He wanted to see how many of these could he recruited to humanity's side.</p><br/><p>All this would be accomplished using the detection tools of the Research Agency, the assistance of mind-reading genetic abilities, and the help of the information obtained from Qin Hai, the super spy.</p><br/><p>One could say that everything about every single one of these escaped ancient race members was cleanly unearthed. Everything about them was investigated cleanly. Among all these ancient race members, apart from some who were comparatively violent and were killed off by the Genetic Union, the vast majority of them truly liked their life in human society.</p><br/><p>Compared to the desolate and barbarous territories of the ancient race, the peacefulness of human society was evidently something valued by these ancient race members that had experienced numerous sufferings. These ancient race members were determined to be accepted into human society. However, when the employees found them, some were like Yue Lan, who had been able to reach an agreement with humanity, and were formally accepted, but a huge group of them had unexpectedly misunderstood the intentions of these employees and instead escaped.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless as he found out about this. Fortunately, these people had merely hidden themselves in some unique locations, as they had no idea how to survive and were in fear of being found out. Chen Feng was able to locate them and proceed with granting them formal identifications to live in human society.</p><br/><p>Genetic Union: Procurement Department.</p><br/><p>This was a department that appeared ordinary, but in fact, it was a rather unique department responsible for gathering rare materials in those hard-to-reach locations. This was also a department incomparably suitable for these escaped ancient race members. These jobs that seemed rather dangerous for ordinary humans were instead extremely easy for them. Here, they obtained an official identification, a higher reward for their job, and a venue in which they could blend into human society.</p><br/><p>Indeed, these ancient race members blended into human society for real. Naturally, the only con to this new life of theirs was the continuous monitoring on them. This would continue until their physical bodies and bloodline completed their transformation into those of a true human. For this undertaking, the Research Agency would have to put forth more effort.</p><br/><p>\"We are conducting blood-improvement research. This might be able to clear all remains of the ancient race from their body. They might truly be able to become true humans.\"</p><br/><p>Thanks to this, the strength of humanity actually obtained a surprise increase in strength.</p><br/><p>Mu Yuan called Chen Feng to express his gratitude. \"Chen Feng, thanks.\"</p><br/><p>His wife, Yue Lan, was obviously much happier and more relaxed than before. Every day, her working hours were the regular eight hours, and finally, she dared to follow him out of the house as well.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry about it.\" Chen Feng heaved a sigh of relief as well. Finally, this had been dealt with. As for the ancient race, they were still consuming the beyond X gene reagents, not suspecting the gene reagent in the slightest. All the blame for the gender change had been pushed toward the Nine Yin Demonic Termination. Mhm\u2026 a perfect conclusion. And next, they could finally focus on dealing with the devil race. As long as they could control the restoration of the devil race\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thunderous clap resounded. Instantly, all human territories were shrouded by a dazzling radiance.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stood up immediately and gazed at the terrifying radiance in shock. At that instant, a boundless devil aura appeared, engulfing the entire world. Something had happened!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

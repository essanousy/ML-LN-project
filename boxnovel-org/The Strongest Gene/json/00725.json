Truly worthy of being resonators, as even their capability of acceptance was higher than ordinary people's. Everyone was remaining silent.</p><br/><p>\"Well, let us start our work, then.\" Chen Feng was in high spirits. \"This barrier of trees\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye sneered. \"Let us deal with it.\" Since they were intending to fight the Luck Goddess, how was it possible for them to have come without any preparations?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A faint fluorescent powder flashed out of Zhou Ye's hands. The powder drifted through the air before suddenly transforming into a raging inferno that swallowed the entire tree barrier. Slowly but surely, the huge bird's nest darkened, then transformed into ashes and smoke.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The flame raged. The tree barrier was not the only thing that was destroyed, as even half the forest's edge was transformed into ruins.</p><br/><p>\"How powerful,\" Chen Feng exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye appeared proud. \"That is only natural. This is the godly power of my father. With a single spark, a much larger portion of the forest godly power could have been destroyed.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes flashed. \"Do you have more of it?\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's expression dimmed. \"No. This is all I have left. Otherwise, why would I be worried about the awakening of the Forest Goddess?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless. \"True.\"</p><br/><p>\"Back then, it was precisely because my father's godly power was so much of a counter to the Forest Goddess that the damnable Luck Goddess decided to kill him.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's hatred was overflowing.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gained understanding. So this was the case. So this grudge originated in the Primordial Era\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A cool breeze swept past, sweeping away all the ashes. A rather sinister-looking forest was revealed. Half of it was lush and green, the other half in ruins. Zhou Ye and the rest were in the ruined half, while the other half was glowing with a seemingly boundless radiance.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A green radiance flickered.</p><br/><p>\"Be careful.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone increased their vigilance.</p><br/><p>\"Zhou Ye,\" a faint voice resounded, seeming to have arrived from the distant horizon.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Ye's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Luck Goddess\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Each of them had different reasons for hating the Luck Goddess. Presently, they all had surging battle intent. Initially, they had only hoped to prevent the awakening of the Forest Goddess. However, due to Chen Feng's appearance, due to the Misfortune Goddess, they were now planning to slay a god!</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026 this would be their only shot. As for the other half of the resonators, they all felt bitter and somber. They had no choice but to provide support to these enemies of the Luck Goddess, since they now had no other options.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess stared at one of them in astonishment. \"Xiao Hua, I can't believe you are part of this as well.\" If she remembered correctly, this fellow was the spokesperson of a certain god with a rather amicable relationship with her. Why had he gotten mixed up with these people?</p><br/><p>Xiao Hua: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, this Xiao Hua was one of Chen Feng's scam victims.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, Lord Goddess.\" Xiao Hua's gloomy gaze swept across Chen Feng and sighed. \"This is hard to explain in few words.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess followed his gaze and looked over. Even if that person had been hiding behind everyone, despite his lowered head, Luck Goddess was still able to recognize him with a single look.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess was somewhat astonished. \"Chen Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had no choice but to walk out of the crowd. \"Hey, long time no see.\"</p><br/><p>This guy really knows the Luck Goddess?</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. They had initially believed that Chen Feng had been telling them pure lies.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess felt her head aching. \"Is there a need for this?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's relationship with her was too unique, rendering her incapable of both killing and sparing him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke lovingly. \"Even if you sealed your emotions toward me, your body will remember it.\" At this, the Luck Goddess's expression darkened as the memory of the time when she had been dragged into the black room by Chen Feng surfaced. That innocence from back then, the innocence of a first love, was seemingly still lingering about her heart. As for the others around them, they were thoroughly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Hold on, this script\u2026 did not seem to be playing out like they had imagined?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's scam victims were all watching on expectantly, waiting for the plot to develop in a similar direction as a famous movie, Primordial Heat . This movie had been famous during the Primordial Era, as even back then, watching these movies that only required two or three people to create with their abilities had been a rather popular pastime as well. As for Zhou Ye's group, their expressions darkened. The relationship between these two\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Holy shit, they wouldn't be suddenly affectionate after a quarrel, right? If that really happened, then it would be way too excessive! Did these two truly think they were the characters in Primordial Heat ? Fortunately, the Luck Goddess was not moved by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>She looked at him coldly. \"I am the one who spared your life.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"I know. Therefore, this time, I will spare your life as well.\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess's killing intent surged. \"You are courting death.\" She finally realized that this Chen Feng fellow was truly an annoying person. If she allowed him to remain alive, he might continue creating problems, or maybe he'd start shooting his mouth off, talking all sorts of nonsense\u2026</p><br/><p>Shortly afterward, the Luck Goddess decided that she might as well get this over with rather than prolonging the agony. She would directly kill Chen Feng here. Even if she would be pained by it in the future, even if she would regret this in the future\u2026 she would deal with this right here!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess's terrifying power started rippling out.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gaze was sharp. \"Here she comes!\"</p><br/><p>\"They started fighting!\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye's group heaved a sigh of relief. That's right, this was how the plot should develop.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" Zhou Ye barked. Next, thirty-odd resonators, each with a unique godly power, surrounded the Luck Goddess. Alas, horrifying them all, all their powers vanished into nothing. They had all failed their resonance.</p><br/><p>They were all horrified. \"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>\"With the godly power of the Luck Goddess, she is capable of transforming any probability into 0%, which also applies to all your abilities,\" Chen Feng reminded them.</p><br/><p>They were all alarmed when they heard this. Generally speaking, the release of powerful abilities would not have a 100% success rate, as there would always be a slight probability of failure. As for the Luck Goddess, with her unique godly power, she had crippled half their combat strength right off the bat.</p><br/><p>\"So we can only use abilities with a 100% success rate?\" Zhou Ye asked quickly. When using basic abilities, their success rate would definitely be 100%.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke coldly. \"No. Continue using abilities that are affected by probability. The Luck Goddess has limited godly power remaining. Since she is willing to waste her godly power to change all probabilities to zero, let her continue the exhaustion. I am curious as to how much longer she can last.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye and the rest understood the plan.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous terrifying godly powers bloomed before vanishing into nothingness like fireworks.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In truth, the scene playing out truly appeared rather humorous. A bunch of people were surrounding the Luck Goddess and shooting numerous godly powers at her. All the powers landed on her, but none were able to hurt her, since all the godly powers collapsed the moment they landed on her. One time, two times, three times\u2026</p><br/><p>After more than 10 times, everyone had already exhausted a huge portion of their godly power. When they noticed that the Luck Goddess still had a toying smile on her mouth, they realized that something was wrong. The Luck Goddess\u2026 seemed to still have a lot of godly power remaining!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"This is not possible.\" It was impossible for the Luck Goddess to have so much godly power remaining. If she truly had so much, she would have been able to easily kill all of them even when they had been on the salt lake. Why would she have needed to slowly send attacks toward them in waves? And yet, right now, she\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at the Luck Goddess before shutting both his eyes. Suddenly, a pensive look appeared on his face. There, behind the Luck Goddess, from the lush forest, he sensed a surging godly power. This power was unique to the Forest Goddess.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was startled. \"You are absorbing the godly power of the Forest Goddess!\" It was no wonder that she still had so much godly power to spare. The present Forest Goddess had yet to recover. With the Luck Goddess absorbing her godly power in this manner, the Forest Goddess would definitely suffer a great loss, one she would require countless years to recover from. And if all her godly power was exhausted by the Luck Goddess, even if she did awaken, she would be no different than a cripple.</p><br/><p>How ruthless.</p><br/><p>All of them were alarmed. They had initially believed that the Luck Goddess was only ruthless toward her enemies. Surprisingly, she was also ruthless to those on her side. With this, after awakening, the Forest Goddess would have no choice but to forever stay a subordinate of the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was not surprised at all. \"How else did she gain a reputation for being shameless?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph.\"</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess swept her gaze past them coldly, not even interested in offering an explanation to these bugs. A faint godly power started emanating from her hands.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Zhou Ye and the rest were heavily injured. That's right. Without using any abilities, merely a shockwave of luck power was sufficient to heavily injure all of them.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye and the rest were alarmed. \"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not find this surprising. it was as he had guessed. When the godly power of luck reached a certain amount, it was almost unrivaled. Doing something like forcing one's consciousness or physical body to mutate negatively would be way too simple. Even Chen Feng had been able to easily deal with four resonators using luck back then, let alone the Luck Goddess. At present, the Luck Goddess was unrivaled!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

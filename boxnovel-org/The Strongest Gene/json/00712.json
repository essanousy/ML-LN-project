B*itch? B*stard? Whatever he could use, he had already done so. For him, a man of culture, this was his limit. Would he have to descend to calling Chen Feng a big baddie instead?</p><br/><p>Wealthy Zhao sighed. They had initially believed that this time, they had, in the river of time, boarded a huge battleship sailing forth into the sunshine. Unexpectedly, they had been tricked onto a little boat that could sink at any time.</p><br/><p>Wu Liang still had a trace of hope within him. \"Erm. Since Misfortune Goddess could communicate with you, has she recovered?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed endlessly. \"Nope. She still needs to recover her godly power. It hasn't been easy for me to deal with her.\"</p><br/><p>\"True.\"</p><br/><p>They nodded, as they found this reasonable. Subsequently, though, their expressions sank. Screw this, in short, the Misfortune Goddess had yet to recover her godly power? They had actually boarded such a damaged boat? This was too excessive!</p><br/><p>Even the usually steadfast Wealthy Zhao was nearly losing control from his anger. \"Chen Feng! You\u2026\" This scammer\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Calm down.\" Chen Feng coughed. \"Don't worry. There will still be bread and butter, and despite the difficulty level, the future will still be beautiful.\"</p><br/><p>The four looked at him coldly. \"Since you are treating us this way, do not blame us\u2026\" The contract worked on both sides. Since Chen Feng had scammed them, he could not blame them if they started playing tricks as well. However, at this moment...</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Sakata Chuunibyou recalled something. \"Hold on. The contract of a god!\"</p><br/><p>Although they had indeed signed the contract, if their memories served right\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances and took a look at the contract. When they got a clear look at the contents, their hearts chilled. In the contract, it was stated that if Chen Feng broke the contract, his link with the Luck Goddess would be severed.</p><br/><p>Hold on\u2026</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess? Weren't they already enemies now? In short, this contract\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had an expression of shame. \"I'm sorry. I tricked you guys.\" However, this only remained momentarily before he said, \"However, with your intelligence, it is way too dangerous to stay solo out there. Just follow me around for a bit.\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions darkened. \"\u2026\" Finally, they understood the prowess of shamelessness.</p><br/><p>Looking at their furious expressions, he decided to give them some time to calm down and think about this. \"Cough. For now, take a good rest at the Genetic Union.\" He was confident that with his sincerity, kindness, and, to a lesser extent, the contract, they would be able to gain enlightenment and make the correct choice.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Yes, they would. And thus, after leaving behind some commands, Chen Feng returned to his own room.</p><br/><p>\"With this, I do not need to worry about the Genetic Union for now,\" he told himself. With those four, he was confident that the Genetic Union would not suffer any disasters for the time being. The deputy president would be able to make use of them nicely. Even if other resonators started creating trouble, with these four, the Genetic Union would be able to stabilize the situation.</p><br/><p>He sighed deeply. \"Then... I only have one more problem to solve.\" This issue concerning the Genetic Union wasn't a particularly major one. For him, the true problem had always been the power of misfortune. At first, the pen had intended to fuse with Chen Feng, providing him power unconditionally, exactly the same as the Fate Stone had done way earlier. However, after his experience with the Luck Goddess, Chen Feng understood clearly that the power gained from others could be easily retrieved at any time as well.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a long time, as well as consulting with Duma, he had decided to employ a contract.</p><br/><p>First, the consciousness of the Misfortune Goddess would not be allowed to enter his body.</p><br/><p>Second, the Misfortune Goddess would offer up to Chen Feng complete authority over her godly power.</p><br/><p>The only thing Chen Feng needed to do was restore the Misfortune Goddess's godhood before the awakening of all other gods. Otherwise, the contract would deem Chen Feng to have failed his part in the contract and he would have to pay a terrifying price. If he succeeded\u2026</p><br/><p>He would be free to choose if he wanted to become a believer of the Misfortune Goddess, continuing to borrow the power of misfortune. Or he could choose to give up on the power of misfortune and become a free man. This was a contract Chen Feng had offered the goddess. He had initially prepared for a series of negotiations, but unexpectedly, the Misfortune Goddess had directly agreed.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The power of misfortune swirled around his hands. Rows of translucent seals flickered into existence. If a resonator saw this scene, they would be shocked to see that this was in fact an advanced version of the contract of a god. Not only that, this was a contract only a god could sign. Mere possession of godly power was insufficient to sign this contract. Only a true god could sign it.</p><br/><p>This was the contract they had signed, and the moment it had been signed, Chen Feng had become equivalent to the spokesperson of the Misfortune Goddess. Not only that, as he could also use the true power of misfortune, a supreme godly power.</p><br/><p>This was in fact no different than being a substitute god. At the exact moment they had signed the contract, Chen Feng had understood why the Misfortune Goddess had agreed to the contract without hesitation. At present, she was truly too weak, unimaginably weak.</p><br/><p>How could one describe this? In the corrected history timeline, she had been following Chen Feng since his infancy, serving as a birthmark on his neck. However, for twenty full years, she had never shown herself. With Spirit around, she had never dared show herself. From this, it was apparent how weak she was right now.</p><br/><p>Although after their quarrel\u2014no, their war back then\u2014both had similarly fallen, in hindsight, it seemed like the Misfortune Goddess had suffered a much more disastrous injury. As for the Luck Goddess, after following Chen Feng, she had been able to upgrade herself several times, recovering without stop.</p><br/><p>How weak was she, exactly?</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>The strength Chen Feng had exhibited to block the godly power of war earlier was already her limit. As such, Chen Feng had had no choice but to resort to trickery.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Old Misfortune, how was my performance?\" Chen Feng asked proudly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>An intense anger emanated from the pen, though it wasn't clear whether the anger was toward Chen Feng himself or how he had addressed her.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng appeared completely oblivious. \"What are you trying to say? Old Misfortune, when will you be able to form your consciousness into a body? I have heard from the War God and the others that you have a really hot figure\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Once again, intense anger emanated out from the pen. She was a god! These words of Chen Feng's were akin to an insult! This was too excessive!</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea what you're trying to say.\" Chen Feng looked at the shaking pen, which was shaking like a vibrator, and was truly clueless as to what she was trying to say. Finally, he gave up thinking about it. \"Forget it, I will pretend you're a mute for now,\" Chen Feng said honestly.</p><br/><p>Pen of Misfortune: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She remembered how, earlier, when they had been signing the contract, Chen Feng had seemed completely capable of understanding what she was trying to say. Yet now\u2026 This bastard scammer!</p><br/><p>\"There, there, time for you to rest. Try recovering your consciousness as soon as possible so we can start communicating.\" Chen Feng waved his hand and said generously, \"It will not be too late to rain your praises upon my brilliance after your recovery. There is no rush.\"</p><br/><p>Pen of Misfortune: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>With a flash, she vanished.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into contemplation. Although the Misfortune Goddess was pitifully weak now, the advantage she brought was the supply of a true supreme godly power, rather than the lower tiers of godly powers those resonators were using. If strength was not taken into consideration, the present him was in fact no different than a god.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>He checked the amount of power of misfortune he had in his body.</p><br/><p>Erm\u2026</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it would be more apt to call him a pseudo-god only capable of a part of what gods were capable of.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

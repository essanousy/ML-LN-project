He turned around abruptly and looked at the hovering devil. He had never expected that this ancestor that had fallen under the control of that treacherous old devil would return.</p><br/><p>\"Fast, kill him!\" the president said.</p><br/><p>The killing intent of Tianyu Liming surged. \"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Nearly all of them moved instantly. The consciousness of this fellow had returned. This was the most dreadful thing. If they allowed him to return completely and recover his strength, nobody would be his match. Thus, the humans had to kill him now. However, when the unparalleled attack of all nine of them reached the S-class devil, all the attacks vanished as they were all destroyed in midair.</p><br/><p>Their expressions changed. \"How is that possible?\" This strength\u2026 How was he so powerful?</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Numerous waves of attacks erupted, but the devil merely waved his hand casually and all the attacks were destroyed. Regardless of how powerful the attacks were, they all vanished before the devil. Vanished, vanished, and vanished!</p><br/><p>With a casual wave, all the attacks would vanish without a trace. How was this possible? They all despaired. They were not even in the same league as this opponent. Even when encountering the old devil that had obtained S-class power earlier, they had still been able to put up some sort of fight, but now, against this S-class devil with 90% of his power sealed, they were completely helpless.</p><br/><p>They could not understand this. Was this due to the return of his consciousness? Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Come back.\" The devil stretched his hand out. The young prince's figure floated over.</p><br/><p>\"Stop him!\" the president shouted.</p><br/><p>They couldn't even defeat this devil when 90% of his power was sealed. If this fellow was able to use the young prince to unseal himself, they would be in grave danger.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The president and the rest moved. Alas, they couldn't stop him. All of their attacks transformed into nothingness the moment they neared the young prince. They had no way of harming him.</p><br/><p>\"Wow.\"</p><br/><p>The prince watched on as his surroundings easily devoured every attack without any sort of pressure, akin to a black hole </p><br/><p>He knelt before the devil expert in happiness. \"Ancestor.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" The devil expert merely nodded slightly before, ultimately, his gaze landed on the president.</p><br/><p>\"You all\u2026 deserve death,\" the S-class devil stated with a cold gaze. \"However, seeing how he is fine, I shall let you guys live. Scram!\"</p><br/><p>The cold aura of the devil shook, chilling all of them.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\" The president merely sneered before looking at Tianyu Liming beside him and asked gently, \"Can you still hold on?\"</p><br/><p>Tianyu Liming lifted her weapon with one arm. \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" The president smiled cruelly. \"Let's continue fighting, then!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance erupted. All of them aimed at the S-class devil. The moment he said that he was letting them live, they had understood. This fellow probably didn't have much strength left. Otherwise, there was no way he would let them off. Letting them off for the sake of the young prince? Hehe. What a joke. How would a fellow who would pee all the time, whose pee would even fork, be so important? The only explanation for this choice of the devil expert's was that the devil expert himself wanted to leave to recover as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>At that time, the humans would truly be in danger. Therefore, they had to get rid of him now.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance erupted. They attacked with all their power.</p><br/><p>The S-class devil was furious. \"You are all\u2026 courting death.\"</p><br/><p>He had never expected that these humans and ancients would not know what was good for them like this, and he had also never expected that from a single word of his, they would be able to see through his actual state. That's right he truly did not have much power remaining.</p><br/><p>Previously, he had been restored using the young prince, and he had subsequently been sealed using the young prince as well. At present, he didn't have much strength left. As such, the proper choice for him was to leave as soon as possible to remove his seal and recover his strength. Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A clump of light exploded near him. The president soared and intercepted his escape route with force.</p><br/><p>\"Thinking of leaving? Have you asked for my permission?\" the president said with a cold expression.</p><br/><p>The devil expert stared at him gloomily. \"You have no idea what it is you are doing here\u2026\" The eyes that had always been lifeless in the past were now filled with killing intent and the rage of being provoked.</p><br/><p>\"I know,\" the president replied with a calm expression. \"I am killing you to get rid of future troubles.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" The devil expert's gloomy gaze swept past the president before landing on Tianyu Liming. A trace of doubt flashed in his eyes. He knew a lot of the ancient experts, yet this person here\u2026 Back then, he had once met an ancient general. That general had been rather similar to this lady here. Was this the daughter of that general? What a coincidence.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter anymore.\" He sighed. \"You guys have indeed guessed correctly. I am indeed trying to leave and recover my power. At present, every ounce power I use will be gone eternally and will never be recovered. The seal is much terrifying than I imagined. As such, I do not intend to exhaust myself here with you guys. However\u2026 since you guys are thinking of keeping me here\u2026\" He inhaled deeply. Next, intense killing intent surged. \"I shall do battle with you all! Even at the cost of my strength, I will kill all of you here!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A devilish aura swept out and pervaded everything. This strongest S class in history was finally making a move with all his power. The air trembled. That terrifying aura caused all their hearts to be petrified.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, come!\" the president shouted. Rather than feeling fear, he laughed. This devil would lose power eternally? This was precisely what the president wanted!</p><br/><p>In short, whatever exhaustion they cause him, he would not be able to recover in the future? If they could do their best and cause this guy to exhaust so much strength that he dropped from S class\u2026 He glanced at Tianyu Liming and smiled at what he saw. \"It seems like we have thought of the same thing.\"</p><br/><p>Tianyu Liming sighed with melancholy. \"Yeah.\" How long has it been since I last battled side by side with someone so compatible with me? Devil? S class?</p><br/><p>\"Come!\"</p><br/><p>The two erupted with their strongest attacks.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The devil expert snorted coldly. \"Hmph!\" Both his wings flapped. The mysterious and bizarre power surged once again, appearing and disappearing constantly from space. This was the power of one who had awakened!</p><br/><p>\"Space?\" Li Lei said with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\"No, I tried locking the space down, but it doesn't seem to be effective,\" one ancient said.</p><br/><p>Spatial power was one of the more powerful traditional powers, yet its flaw was rather obvious as well. Any spatial undulations and spatial currents would be able to affect the usage of this power. On top of that, there also existed countless barriers capable of countering spatial abilities.</p><br/><p>This flaw was even more pronounced among top experts, who could rip space apart, causing it to collapse. Users of spatial power would be subjected to a rather huge limitation and would not be able to display their full potential. Moreover, the undulations caused by spatial power were too obvious and were simply incapable of hiding from anyone with powerful senses.</p><br/><p>As such, for top experts, almost all users of spatial power specialized in teleportation or the like. Yet now\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The devil expert appeared and vanished in midair without stop. Every time he vanished, he reappeared behind one of his opponents in an odd manner and released a powerful attack. After several repetitions, all of them had already suffered heavy injuries. This was simply the clash of powers in entirely different leagues. How were they supposed to battle such strength?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

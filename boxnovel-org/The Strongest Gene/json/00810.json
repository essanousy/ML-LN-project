As of quite a while ago, his control over Chen Feng hadn\u2019t existed. Since that certain day when Chen Feng\u2019s wristband communicator broke down for no apparent reason, Chen Feng had stopped using a wristband communicator. Luo Yuan had once suspected that Chen Feng had found out about his plan, yet Chen Feng had obviously not figured anything out.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was extremely certain of this. At that time, Chen Feng had yet to even notice his existence. Luo Yuan had spent quite a while observing Chen Feng and had confirmed with his Luck Aura that Chen Feng had indeed not noticed anything. Slowly, Luo Yuan had forgotten about this. Unexpectedly\u2026 it had now come back to haunt him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng\u2026\u201d Luo Yuan muttered. Suddenly, his heart throbbed as he thought of something. His senses instantly spread out, searching for some people. Not a single one of them could be found. Kong Bai, Qin Hai, Wu Hui, these people that should have existed within his network of senses had all vanished.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cThey were all clearly within my senses in the past\u2026\u201d Evidently, the moment he had descended from the sky, those people had removed their wristbands. This was what one would call a variable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the so-called 1% chance of failure?\u201d Luo Yuan laughed. He had initially still been somewhat worried about this 1%. But now that he had figured out that the 1% was these fellows, he laughed. How ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng, if you think these fellows are sufficient to contend against me, you are gravely mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain mountain range, Chen Feng\u2019s group was watching as everything unfolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201d Kong Bai said, fear still lingering within his heart. After he and Chen Feng had been able to roughly guess the truth, they had immediately notified their friends. However, due to the problem being the wristbands themselves, they\u2019d had to contact their friends manually. If they had still used the wristbands even after figuring out the truth, they would be true idiots.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they had only been able to notify a small number of people before this happened. Luo Yuan had appeared too speedily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis moment he chose to appear is too convenient\u2026\u201d Chen Feng had an odd feeling. When he was using Luck Aura, he would also make his move at the most opportune moment. Now, it seemed like he wasn\u2019t quite capable of choosing the most opportune moment anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI sensed a similar power in Luo Yuan,\u201d Spirit said. \u201cThat\u2019s why your power and Luo Yuan\u2019s power have counteracted each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying that Luo Yuan is also capable of calculating the most opportune moment to act?\u201d Chen Feng said with a pensive look.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Spirit was certain. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t know is exactly what power he is using to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the case. Chen Feng finally understood. He did not quite care that they counteracted each other. After all, in Luo Yuan\u2019s plan, choosing an opportune moment was much more important for him than Chen Feng. With their powers counteracting each other, Luo Yuan probably wasn\u2019t feeling very good now. Or perhaps he was of the impression that this was indeed the opportune moment?</p><br/><p>If so\u2026 this would be quite the opportunity. Chen Feng\u2019s heart throbbed. Without a doubt, Luo Yuan\u2019s strength would grow dramatically very soon. Chen Feng, who had personally experienced the same thing, understood clearly that after gathering more believers than him, Luo Yuan\u2019s speed of growth would be even scarier.</p><br/><p>And thus, this would be the most opportune moment to fight Luo Yuan. Luo Yuan had yet to fully recover from his fight with Ye. As for his godhood, it did not matter. After all, people like them were too powerful, to the extent that the power they gained shortly after godhood wasn\u2019t much at all. As such, even after godhood, Luo Yuan wouldn\u2019t benefit much. The best benefit of faith was the speed of growth rather than the immediate combat prowess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis growth will be scarier and scarier. Now is the moment when he is at his weakest,\u201d Chen Feng said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Kong Bai focused his gaze. They all knew that if they wanted to defeat Luo Yuan, this would be their best shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it, then,\u201d Qin Hai said without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>They approached Luo Yuan\u2019s location silently. At this time, Luo Yuan seemed to be calculating something. Suddenly, a faint shadow appeared from the foot of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was the first to notice it. \u201cMhm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShadow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis familiar appearance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods recognized this shadow the moment it appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, this is the dark shadow left behind by the Creation God.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had themselves witnessed the fight between this shadow and Ye. Although the shadow seemed to have died quickly, it was now clear that the shadow had been resurrected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the shadow is weak, he seems capable of rebirth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is acceptable. There ought to be such a balance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the bright silhouette\u2019s identity, which we had guessed about in the past\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many gods seemed to realize something. Earlier, they had guessed that Luo Yuan was precisely that bright silhouette. However, after Luo Yuan revealed his identity, they had concluded that Luo Yuan was not the silhouette at all. If so, who exactly was the silhouette left behind by the Creation God?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bullshit are you all talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan frowned. Creation God? Shadow? He had never seen them before. However, from the words of the various gods, he discovered that this shadow had once fought Ye and had even forced Ye to use his ultimate trump card. This was the shadow that had caused Ye to be completely helpless, to the point that even Chen Feng could kill him.</p><br/><p>Was this the truth? Luo Yuan frowned. Shadow\u2026 Luo Yuan looked at that seemingly nonexistent shadow. A powerful aura seemed to be building up within that shadow. The aura was so powerful that it was suffocating. That was an aura surpassing that of the gods.</p><br/><p>Creation God? Luo Yuan finally understood something.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Slowly, that shadow revealed his full body. He did not have any bodily features, being purely comprised of a shadow. However, his strength was incredibly terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to have become even stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the shadow of the Creation God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed similar to what we guessed, a faceless existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods exclaimed in admiration. Although the shadow had been instantly killed by Ye in his last appearance, he was still not an existence they could contend against. Furthermore, he had obviously been killed, but here he was, alive and well. How scary was that? Perhaps this shadow wasn\u2019t any weaker than Ye. And perhaps he wasn\u2019t lower than this person\u2026 Their gazes landed on Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Step by step, the shadow strode forth. As he walked forward, his strength slowly grew. He seemed to have given all the gods sufficient time to talk and had thus continued to advance slowly while his strength slowly built up. His strength had now reached an extremely terrifying level.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I getting such a terrifying feeling from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit, he seems to have become even stronger now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is too scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at his forehead. There\u2019s an imprint there. That does not look like the imprint of an ordinary god. There seems to be some unique power in that imprint. Perhaps this imprint was left behind by the Creation God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is quite possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe imprint of the Creation God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens. He did not have this thing when he last appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he didn\u2019t have time to use the imprint last time? Now that he had the time to use the imprint, Luo Yuan is probably in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods exclaimed in admiration solely from the strength this shadow was emanating.</p><br/><p>With every step the shadow took, a different power seemingly manifested from him. That imprint on his forehead seemed to contain a completely different energy, one that was incomparably terrifying. When he had first appeared, everything had still seemed calm. Yet now, as he stepped forth, his aura surpassed even Luo Yuan\u2019s. This was the true strength of the shadow of the Creation God.</p><br/><p>At this moment, killing intent pervaded the air. When the shadow got closer, the gods no longer dared to talk. They merely looked at the shadow and Luo Yuan, clear that a major battle was about to erupt. Silently, they distanced themselves from the coming battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is starting.\u201d Chen Feng was filled with expectation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy godly power of the wish is already capable of manifesting the imaginations of an entire crowd,\u201d Wu Hui proudly said. He did not even need to care if Luo Yuan would buy the lie or not. As long as the others believed the lie, it would be sufficient. This was the scariest aspect of his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis shadow is already strong enough to kill Luo Yuan.\u201d Wu Hui was certain. Those foolish gods, having seen the shadow once before, had become the shadow\u2019s fuel. Their imaginations had fed the shadow with strength without stop until, finally, the shadow reached this level of strength.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they could win this fight. Everyone was filled with expectation.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The shadow was about to attack. However, outside of everyone\u2019s expectation, right at this moment, a different shadow walked out from the foot of a different mountain. This shadow greatly resembled the first, but there was something different about it.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked over at Wu Hui instinctively. \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wu Hui was dumbstruck as well. What was this?</p><br/><p>\u201cNot your work?\u201d Qin Hai was alarmed.</p><br/><p>Wu Hui stared blankly. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not good! Chen Feng\u2019s heart thumped. Holy shit. This\u2026 can\u2019t be\u2026 a lie turning into reality\u2026 right? Are you kidding me?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

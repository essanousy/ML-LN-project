Before the Holy War, way before that\u2026 Master already existed. He had been alive for countless eras. Do you think anyone can stay alive for countless eras? No, that's not the case. Even the devil race, with their tenacious vitality... That devil expert was only able to increase his life span via a constant cycle of hibernation and waking up. Yet Master\u2026\" Qin Hai looked at Duma.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"He can absorb life force, right?\" Duma's ability of was very terrifying. If he could truly control time, it would not be a problem for him to stay alive for countless years, since he could absorb time. Chen Feng had once had a dream. If each person in the world gave him a penny each, he would be able to be the richest person in the world. Naturally, this dream had gone unachieved.</p><br/><p>As for Duma, if everyone gave him a second each\u2026 he would achieve eternal life!</p><br/><p>\"This is the story. Qin Hai sneered, \"In the history of the ancient race, there was a mysterious period called 'God's Anger.' On that day, everyone was able to feel some abnormalities. Naturally, with their strength at that time, they were not able to discover anything. Even the records of the later generations only mentioned this in passing without an in-depth explanation. However, if one thinks back to this now, one might notice that the so-called 'God's Anger' was merely a leap in time. Each and every person lost a single second of their life. This is what actually happened.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took in a deep breath. \"Hiss\u2014\" Damn, this old man had truly done that? One had to know that in Chen Feng's previous life, there had indeed\u2026 Oh, forget it, that was in the past. Since this old man had succeeded in his undertaking, what was Qin Hai's intention in mentioning this?</p><br/><p>\"Do you think that regularly, one would be able to absorb so much time?\" Qin Hai shook his head. \"That's not possible. Don't think that it is a good thing if a normal person were to suddenly have a lot of time. The moment the time of the entire world gathered in a single person, there would be only one result. That person would have his time extended so much that he suffers death.\"</p><br/><p>So that's the case. Chen Feng found himself in agreement to that.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled the Spirit Bomb from Dragon Ball in his previous life. This was a supreme technique created by gathering everyone's energy. A power at that level wasn't something an ordinary person could sustain.</p><br/><p>\"A human can't, an ancient can't, and a devil can't.\" Qin Hai coldly continued, \"In this world, for someone to be able to endure such power, there is only one possibility\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng couldn't help himself. \"El... elder?\" [1] 1</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Qin Hai blanked. \"What's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, nothing.\" Chen Feng coughed. \"You are referring to\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Scarab.\" Qin Hai looked at Duma and said, \"The early Primordial Era was a wondrous era. At that time, the war had yet to erupt. At that time, gods were still everywhere. At that time, there was a particular race said to be the descendants of gods. They possessed formidable strength, their bodies were sturdy and strong, and naturally, what others envied the most was their long life spans. Their life spans were second to none. Even a certain powerful deity once said that if a war between races were to erupt, the scarab race might be the race to survive, as they could simply outlive all the other races, including the gods.\"</p><br/><p>Before him, Duma maintained his silence, merely looking at him with a cold gaze. There were several times where Duma had wanted to make a move yet had been restricted by some unknown power.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's lip twitched. \"Outliving gods\u2026\" Truly worthy of being a race with a long life span. However, the term scarab was something he had heard before. Despite his low understanding of it, he could clearly remember from his previous life on earth that this was something related to pyramids, pharaohs, or something similar, a legendary life-form of the west. Of course, if one wanted Chen Feng to describe this thing called a scarab, it would be a dyed beetle.</p><br/><p>In short\u2026 Chen Feng looked at Duma. This old man is in fact a huge beetle?</p><br/><p>Duma: \"\u2026\" He had no idea what Chen Feng was thinking, yet he still felt annoyed by Chen Feng's gaze. Of course, if he knew what Chen Feng was thinking about, he would most certainly have been enraged then and there.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai narrated, \"The scarab race is legendary. Due to them being too amazing, it is said that in the beginning of the war, they were the first race to be eliminated. Although the other races all hated each other, if any members of the scarab race were to appear suddenly, they would temporarily forget their hatred and join hands to kill the scarabs.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng remained silent. This scarab race was so hated?</p><br/><p>Qin Hai shook his head. \"They were too powerful, thus attracting hatred due to jealousy. This was something they couldn't do anything about either. In a war-torn era, everyone knew that the scarab race was capable of outliving everyone. If so, how could anyone give them a chance?\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you sure it's not because of their smell?\" Chen Feng started imagining a sight where there were so many beetles that the sky was covered, and he was horrified by his own imagination.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai blanked. \"What smell?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng coughed. \"No, nothing.\"</p><br/><p>\"???\" Qin Hai glanced at Chen Feng with an odd gaze. He did not think much of his comments and continued, \"Back then, Master was the one who told me the story of the scarab race. I never expected that a member of the scarab race indeed survived. That very survivor is Master! The language of the scarab race is very complicated, and I have never studied it. I forgot about it not long after master told me about it. But earlier, I recalled something\u2026 and after thinking about Master's name, I was finally able to understand everything.\" Qin Hai completed his narrative, \"In the scarab race's language, 'duma' means chief, and the chief was the strongest among the scarab race.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was instantly alarmed.</p><br/><p>Duma\u2026 was actually the chief of a powerful race from the Primordial Era? This was too inconceivable!</p><br/><p>Duma merely laughed coldly. \"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at these two idiots as they gradually grew old within his ocean of time. Regardless of Chen Feng or Qin Hai, both were becoming old. Each second they dragged on, death approached. As such, Duma wasn't bothered with stopping them and merely watched on as they courted death themselves, watching on as they wasted their precious lives, becoming older and older.</p><br/><p>\"Are you thinking that we are very stupid?\" Qin Hai smiled. \"My master once told me a lot about the scarab race, the scarab race's abilities, their legends, and also\"\u2014suddenly, Qin Hai's expression became cold\u2014\"the battle of the scarab race.\" As he finished his sentence, he lifted his hand lightly. \"You are exhausting our time away, but I am also waiting for time. Time is the strongest trump card of your scarab race, yet it's also your biggest weakness.\"</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Qin Hai pointed.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With that point, a bright radiance erupted. A faint power of time bubbled up and started rupturing from within. All the power of time started transforming, aging, and all failed. Instantly, Qin Hai's and Chen Feng's somewhat aged appearances reverted, transforming back to their youthful appearances. The backlash of the formidable power of time had started.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Duma couldn't believe it. \"You actually know of this?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai laughed. \"Hehe. Therefore, you are definitely not my master. Even if you are controlling his body, controlling his consciousness, you will never be him\u2026 You\u2026 are too weak!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The terrifying power of time shattered. Chen Feng and Qin Hai returned to normal, and an expression of suffering appeared on Duma's face due to the backlash. He started yelling, and numerous bizarre radiances flashed past his face.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026 accompanied by a loud roar\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>An immense black figure appeared. After being ravaged by the power of time, Duma had revealed his real body!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Instantly, a terrifying power erupted from them. These two had actually reached beyond A class as well. Moreover, the weapons they held were similarly shrouded with a familiar power, the power of Shroud Art.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>With them joining the battle, Gou Li's group of five formed a circle around Lu Hun, surrounding him with a mysterious power. Within this circle, the power of Shroud Art was everywhere.</p><br/><p>\"Scram!\" Lu Hun was furious. At present, the only person he wanted to kill was Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry.\" Gou Li laughed sinisterly. \"At present, we only want to kill you. From the moment our close ones died, we have been waiting for the arrival of this day, the day we get to kill you. Finally, our wait is over. You might hate Chen Feng; alas, I'm sorry to inform you that he is our benefactor.\"</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The feet of the five of them never stopped moving. They attacked Lu Hun while at the same time moving without stop around him. With these movements, a mysterious and abstruse power was seemingly brewing within the circle.</p><br/><p>\"Scram!\" Lu Hun roared in a deranged manner. At this time, he no longer had any intellect. The only thing that occupied his brain was his desire to kill Chen Feng. These few people that kept getting in his way were incredibly annoying, yet he was incapable of killing them.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Lu Hun tried throwing them off several times, yet each attempt failed as his advance was blocked by them.</p><br/><p>Li Lei was shocked. \"Is the power of Shroud Art so powerful?\" The present Lu Hun was a beyond A9 peak expert. Even with that, he was still being used to wipe the floor by five beyond A1 fellows. This was simply two powers in completely different realms. This Shroud Art\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Lu Hun was still struggling crazily. As for Gou Li's group, they firmly maintained their encirclement. Each time they managed to knock Lu Hun down, a bloody scar was left on his body, causing blood to splatter everywhere.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Gou Li asked, \"Chen Feng, are you interested in learning Shroud Art?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was astonished. \"I can learn them as well?\"</p><br/><p>Gou Li shook his head. \"You can't. Shroud Art is too unique. For a regular person, any attempts at learning them will only be met with a dead end. From what we recall, Bo Quzhi was the only person capable of learning them.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"However\u2026\" Gou Li smiled. \"Ultimately, this thing is still an inheritance. Perhaps, in the future, someone will be able to learn it. Or perhaps, in the future, after you guys have improved it, you guys will be able to use it. There are other possibilities too. In short, you will be able to see clearly soon enough. At that time, learn as much as you can,\" Gou Li finished with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a vague ominous feeling. These words\u2026 Suddenly, Chen Feng felt like things did not seem too right. Apart from Bi Quzhi, nobody else could employ this skill? What about them? Alas, before Chen Feng could voice his questions, he noticed an abnormality.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The steps of Gou Li's group suddenly accelerated.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Finally, a formidable power surged. Numerous bizarre looking seals appeared midair. Everyone's heart trembled. They could clearly see that these seals were the representative of the power of Shroud Art.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, an astonishing thing happened. As that surging power increased in might, Gou Li's group rapidly aged.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's expression sank. \"What are you guys doing? Stop!\"</p><br/><p>\"We can't stop anymore\u2026\" The hoarse voice of Gou Li sighed with emotion. \"From the moment we started using this power several years ago, everything was fated. Shroud Art\u2026 this is the power of Bi Quzhi. The cost of using this power is one's vitality.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Once again, Lu Hun was knocked down by them.</p><br/><p>The group of five muttered without stop. \"Chen Feng, this is what we owe you. Chen Feng, this is how we repay you. Thank you for bringing us hope back then. Thank you for bringing us here today. That girl has already been waiting for me for ten-odd years on the other side. She has a bad temper. I expect she is already anxious from the wait. I guess it's time I go meet her.\"</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>Finally, that terrifying power belonging to only Bi Quzhi was launched by the combined effort of Gou Li's group and landed on Lu Hun's body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying power erupted. The entire world was blanketed by a scorching white.</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's mournful scream echoed everywhere. This peak beyond-A-class superexpert, this superexpert of the ancient race, this person who had personally started his grudge with Gou Li's group back then, finally died here.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the mournful scream vanished. The white dispersed slowly as well. As the white faded, the bodies of Gou Li's group became illusory. Chen Feng's gaze landed on them. He could seemingly see several departing figures. With their revenge taken, on each of their faces was a relaxed smile. Gou Li, Guo Jia, Sheng Shiyi, Qi Yin, and Fu Huo\u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, the transparent barrier activated by Gou Li's group in the beginning was slowly transforming into countless light particles before vanishing from the air. Amid those dim particles, a single figure could be vaguely seen.</p><br/><p>\"Bi Quzhi\u2026\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>After a long time, everything returned to normal. On the ground, only a huge crater was left behind. Lu Hun was gone. Some of them had seemingly seen Lu Hun being evaporated forcefully by that terrifying power, not even leaving a single trace behind. Or perhaps his entire body was gone due to the rupture of his spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Gou Li's group was gone as well. By forcefully using the Shroud Art, they had ultimately overexerted their vitality. Everything was finally over.</p><br/><p>Li Lei sighed. \"Is this the power of Shroud Art?\"</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that the power was so strong. By paying one's vitality as the cost, how could the resulting power not be strong? Such a power, regardless of circumstances, was something that would remain a forbidden skill.</p><br/><p>\"What they paid was their vitality and time?\" someone asked.</p><br/><p>However, nobody replied, as nobody knew the answer. Chen Feng stared blankly at where Gou Li's group had vanished.</p><br/><p>Li Lei patted his shoulder. \"My condolences.\"</p><br/><p>He was aware that these people had been friends of Chen Feng's. He was also aware that in a way, these people were the ones who had saved them all, their benefactors!</p><br/><p>\"This time, we will submit an application to the higher-ups after returning. They are the heroes of humanity. As such, their families and relatives will receive the greatest honor of all,\" Li Lei stated solemnly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Mhm.\" Right at this moment, someone picked up an emblem from the ground.</p><br/><p>\"What is this?\" The person picked it up cautiously. \"This thing seems like something of Gou Li's.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that so?\" Li Lei took it. Suddenly, a bright radiance erupted.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The intense radiance shone brightly, so bright that everyone instinctively shut their eyes. On that emblem, numerous seals appeared and shone brightly. Slowly, a formidable yet mysterious power started rising, chilling everyone present.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous scenes flashed past. Li Lei and the rest were completely dazzled by the flashing scenes. With the exception of Chen Feng, all of them frowned, not knowing exactly what these things were. Chen Feng fixed his gaze on those seals.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Spirit started accurately and faithfully recording everything. After comparing the data received from Gou Li earlier with this newfound data, this initially incomplete set of information was suddenly completed.</p><br/><p>This thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes widened. This was Bi Quzhi's power! This was\u2026 the true Shroud Art!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

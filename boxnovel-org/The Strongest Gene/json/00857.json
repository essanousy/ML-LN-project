Luo Yuan\u2019s mighty power spread out and traveled through the void to directly appear above the palace wherein Wang Yao dwelled. This alarmed everyone here. He was actually attacking the palace! Was he trying to kill Wang Yao? No, that was not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to break through the palace\u2019s defense.\u201d Chen Yuan was sure. After all, the Luo Yuan had been the one to place the defense\u2019s around this palace, and the defenses were capable of guarding against even Luo Yuan himself. The reason he had done this was to allow Wang Yao to focus on nothing but comprehending the power of time, undisturbed by anyone.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That mighty power collided with the top of the palace, creating a deafening sound.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The entire world seemed to shake. The palace wasn\u2019t destroyed; it was just as Chen Yuan had said. This palace couldn\u2019t be destroyed. However, because of Luo Yuan\u2019s attack, the power surrounding the palace echoed out, forcefully scattering what power of time Wang Yao had comprehended thus far.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the terrifying power of time roiled out. Like a tidal wave, the power of time engulfed the entire world, covering every single corner of the world and everyone in it, including Luo Yuan himself.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan was horrified. \u201cYou are actually\u2026\u201d He finally understood what Luo Yuan intended to do. Time chaos! He was forcefully dissipating all of Wang Yao\u2019s power of time, forcing it to spread around this world, which would become a chaotic time that would affect all the people present.</p><br/><p>The alien world was too small, to the point that when this power spread, it was sufficient to engulf the entire world. None of the people in this world could hide. Everyone would suffer the effects of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are throwing Wang Yao\u2019s 30 years of work down the drain!\u201d Chen Yuan howled.</p><br/><p>Doing this was no different than suicide. That was because Luo Yuan was the only one who wished for Wang Yao to comprehend the power of time. Nobody else cared. By doing this, the progress of Wang Yao\u2019s cultivation would be reduced greatly. This madman\u2026 after appearing this time, everything he was doing was crazy.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sneered. \u201cI know.\u201d He had finally seen through what mattered. The power of time? It wasn\u2019t important. Killing Chen Feng was the only thing that mattered. When Chen Feng finally died, he could take his time doing whatever he wanted. Although this action of his seemed somewhat hot headed, it was also his best chance to kill Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if Chen Feng was allowed to keep hiding in this world and growing without a stop, Chen Feng would eventually surpass him. Therefore, he had to destroy Chen Feng. And now\u2026 hehe.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, the power of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing the power of time washing over him, Luo Yuan suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you guys seen time chaos before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan\u2019s expression sank. <em>Could it be\u2026 </em>Time chaos was an entirely different concept than spatial chaos. A lot of people had experienced spatial chaos. It was a region brimming with the power of space, a region capable of disintegration, a region filled with various spatial cracks. Anyone who entered accidentally would be ripped apart by the power of space. That was because in such a place, anything might collapse at any time. Space might shatter into spatial fragments, or the space one occupied might suddenly rip apart. They were extremely fatal places.</p><br/><p>Even people as strong as Luo Yuan and Chen Feng would not dare to carelessly enter such a location without Luck Aura. The few times Chen Feng had been able to avoid Luo Yuan\u2019s detection were by relying on spatial chaos. As for time chaos\u2026</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Time chaos was a damnable place nobody wanted to experience. After all, the essence of spatial chaos was the same as the essence of time chaos: chaos! In other words, time chaos was a location where time itself was chaotic. Here, the flow of time was unstable. It might be fast or slow. Naturally, there was also the possibility that time would flow normally. This was a place where the direction time took was abnormal. It might go forward or backward.</p><br/><p>Could one imagine what it would feel like when time moved everywhen mindlessly? Nobody would want to know that feeling. The scariest of all was frozen time. If one was unlucky enough to be in an area where time was frozen, well, one would be frozen there forever.</p><br/><p>The power of time was endless and boundless, and all these effects were unstoppable. One might be able to defend against the collapse of space caused by spatial chaos. However, the power of time permeated everything. It was unstoppable. What did Luo Yuan intend to do? He intended to destroy everything, to restart this world. No, to be precise, he intended to reset all the life-forms on this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you are doing!\u201d Chen Yuan yelled. Unfortunately, as the power of time washed over him, his voice stopped and an expression of utter terror appeared on his face. In that one instant, time had flowed backward 10 years. He had unluckily been engulfed by the power of time. Perhaps, normally, time flowing backward 10 years might be a good thing. After all, it was 10 years worth of youth, right? Alas, Chen Yuan was an exception. Ten years ago, he had not existed!</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>His body was surrounded by a boundless radiance. Eventually, he transformed into countless light particles and dissipated into nothingness. This clone, the other Luo Yuan, under the effects of time, had transformed into nothingness. This sinister scene shocked everyone. Everyone retreated madly. Alas, it was pointless. The power of time had already engulfed the entire world. Nobody could hope to hide from it.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The power of time swept around. Some people aged immediately as the beautiful young ladies suddenly became old. There were even some who instantly died of old age. Time was the scariest of powers. Some became extremely young. Some grew younger by three years, some by five years, and some grew several decades younger instantly, transforming into nothingness.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>As the power of time rippled out, countless people vanished from existence. A terrifying change was taking place at a speed visible to the naked eyes.</p><br/><p>The power of time swept over and engulfed Chen Feng, Qin Hai, Kong Bai, Luo Yuan himself, the numerous gods behind Luo Yuan, and all the others. Ultimately, that power shook the entire world. The alien world, which had already been on the verge of collapse, began to recover and became even stronger than before. The entire world was reinforcing. One time, ten times, a hundred times\u2026Nobody knew what this world was experiencing. That was how profound the power of time was.</p><br/><p>Even now, the rippling of the power of time had yet to stop. Even though the entire world had already been changed, the power of time was seemingly still changing something.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance began to spread. After a long time, finally, that terrifying power stopped. At this time, in the entire world, only a single location hadn\u2019t changed in the slightest. This was the deepest core of this world, the center of the power of time, that very palace. At this time, the palace was hovering in the sky. Within, in the very center of the palace, Wang Yao was seated cross-legged, looking very much like a true god.</p><br/><p>She was still immersed in her cultivation, completely ignoring everything that was happening outside.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The power of time swirled around within the palace. Finally, it stopped overflowing outside and started gathering around Wang Yao. Here and now, Wang Yao appeared so very resplendent. As of this moment, this place was the core of this world.</p></div>\n</div>"}

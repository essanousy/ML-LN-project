This was an extremely wondrous realm. If Chen Feng were to start researching the energy of S class now, he would have to start from scratch. It would take an unknown amount of time to complete. As such, he had no choice but to put this matter aside for now. What was the first thing he should do now that he had broken through into S class? Leave this place!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was not willing to stay here like some circus monkey. As such, after familiarizing himself with his new S-class power, his first course of action was to leave this place, to gain greater understanding of this Twin Horns World before looking for a means of leaving this world altogether.</p><br/><p>Alas\u2026</p><br/><p>Two minutes after leaving his room, Chen Feng returned in silence. The reason? In these short two minutes, numerous auras with a strength similar to his own could be felt.</p><br/><p>S class. All of them were S classes. This was actually a place with so many S classes. It was at this point that Chen Feng gained a clear understanding of the level of this world. This was actually a world where S classes were everywhere. From what he had found out by asking around in an indirect manner, these people were called \"awakened.\"</p><br/><p>This was an extremely mystical world. Here, one could advance from F class to A class through natural growth alone. Even a fatty nerd would be able to reach A class by way of natural growth. This was a phase with no bottlenecks whatsoever.</p><br/><p>As such, those spectators, those roaring upper-class women, nearly all of them were peak beyond A classes. Yet in this world, such people were mere commoners. Here, true warriors were the awakened. It was rumored that within the horns of the twin horns race was an astonishing amount of energy. Only those capable of comprehending the energy contained within could become awakened.</p><br/><p>Here, an awakened would be the equivalent of humanity's S class. Each of them had astounding strength. With their powerful strength, they were the true masters of this world.</p><br/><p>\"Awakened\u2026\" Chen Feng smiled bitterly. This damnable Twin Horns World.</p><br/><p>\"In short, those horns are the reason they can advance from F class to A class through natural growth alone?\" Kong Bai was awed. \"Their twin horns will naturally absorb energy from their surroundings, constantly purifying the energy and improving one's strength. Holy shit, are these fellows Teletubbies?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rolled his eyes. It did not need to be discussed whether these were Teletubbies. However, the strength of these fellows was indeed frightening. Chen Feng checked his body. His luck value was still growing. After entering S class, the speed his luck value accumulated at had not increased. However, thanks to the huge growth in the strength of his spiritual energy, Spirit had become stronger as well.</p><br/><p>Now, Spirit's optimization was even better than before. Chen Feng's current luck value had initially been insufficient for him to leave this world, but now, after the upgrade in Spirit's optimization capabilities, this amount was sufficient.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Kong Bai tried transmigrating. It failed.</p><br/><p>That's right. He failed. This was the first time this had ever happened. Even he himself was utterly shocked.</p><br/><p>\"This might be related to this place.\" Chen Feng looked around. Their living quarters were surrounded by a unique power. Since this place was initially used for transmigration research, to avoid the transmigrators they summoned going somewhere else, all the rooms here were surrounded by a unique energy. Only within the arena would transmigrators arrive. Similarly, that was also the only place where they could hope to transmigrate away.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like we will have to join one of their events.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng checked the time. It was almost time for their show.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the next day, when Chen Feng and Kong Bai reached the arena, the entire crowd boiled. With their cheers thundering everywhere, this was the arena for transmigrators to showcase their prowess. Ruo Shui, the host, was currently livening up the mood there. In fact, the higher-ups of their company had secretly investigated the unique energy undulation that had appeared the day before. Next, they had discovered that a hole had appeared in the wall between Chen Feng's rooms and Kong Bai's.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>When they had gone over, they had seen that Kong Bai's clothing seemed rather messy and had vague traces of blood.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>\"When did this hole appear?\"</p><br/><p>\"Last night.\"</p><br/><p>\"In short, Chen Feng blasted a hole in the wall last night to have a secret date with Kong Bai?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They lapsed into silence.</p><br/><p>Here, everyone had an individual room that was separated from the others. They were aware that Chen Feng and Kong Bai were close, but then, weren't they somewhat too intimate?</p><br/><p>\"Shouldn't we be focusing on the fact that Chen Feng could actually create a hole in the wall instead?\" one person asked with a bitter smile. Each of the rooms was incredibly sturdy, and when required, the rooms themselves could be locked down to prevent the transmigrators from escaping. Yet now, Chen Feng had been able to blast a hole through their wall\u2026</p><br/><p>\"That's normal. These few days, he has been absorbing so much energy. It isn't weird for him to have been able to blast a wall there. What I care about more is his relationship with Kong Bai\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I initially believed that they were merely ordinary friends. Now, though\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"After this, give them a warning to not let any sex scandals leak. Make sure they keep their desires in check during the event. After all, a majority of their present fans are female. If those fans find out that these two are actually\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh.\"</p><br/><p>Their heads ached. They had never expected that just as they had decided to invest in Chen Feng, something like this would crop up. At this time, a message from Ruo Shui arrived.</p><br/><p>\"Time's up.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right. Get them to enter, then. With Chen Feng's present strength, it won't be a problem for him to survive this event. However, we must still find some way to make their adventure more thrilling\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, only this will keep the audience excited.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>The various departments of the arena started operating. Under their request, Chen Feng and Kong Bai entered the arena. Light swirled around them. A new adventure was about to begin. To maintain the sense of realism, once a transmigrator was killed, the transmigrator would remain dead. In any case, the transmigrators weren't the original inhabitants of this world anyway.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. A new world started. The audiences started their discussions.</p><br/><p>\"Hopefully, they will bring us something different this time,\" one upper-class woman stated.</p><br/><p>Their monotonous lifestyle bored them greatly. As such, only the excitement brought upon by prospects of life and death could attract them due to the brutish battles to be viewed here, due to the blood that would be spilled.</p><br/><p>\"Yeah.\" A different person lamented, \"The previous race that transmigrated over here did not last long at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. If Chen Feng can survive this event, I will be his sugar mommy for one full year,\" stated a heavily overweight upper-class woman.</p><br/><p>A different person sneered. \"Hmph, do you think you will even have an opportunity for that?\"</p><br/><p>In this manner, the audience discussed without stop.</p><br/><p>Their favorite was alien males, as these alien males could bring them an entirely different experience. An example would be the previous elephant race whose ding dongs had been on their heads instead. There had also been a particular silver snake race whose heads had been on their ding dongs; they had also given the women here quite a wondrous experience. This caused the women here to be in awe over the majesty of the Creator.</p><br/><p>\"It's starting.\"</p><br/><p>They all focused on the arena.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A bright radiance erupted. Instantly, the world transformed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"A new world, huh?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stretched his hand out and cast his senses out, feeling up this wondrous world. Previously, he had only been aware that they had transmigrated here and had not been aware that this was in fact a created world. Now that they were aware that this was a created world, they would naturally be interested in studying this world. Alas, their observations showed that everything in this created world was real.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hand casually. He could feel the energy pervading the air. Everything created within this Arena of Life and Death was exactly the same as reality, including the orbit of energy. This place was no different than the real world.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Kong Bai exchanged glances, shock apparent in their eyes. For the present humanity, regardless of their augmented-reality or virtual-reality technology or the illusory abilities of genetic warriors, none could reach such a level of realism. This was simply akin to the power of a god of creation.</p><br/><p>This arena was evidently much more mysterious than they had imagined. The same moment the both of them entered this world, the distant life-forms seemed to awaken as well. Numerous auras locked onto Chen Feng and Kong Bai.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The earth shook. Numerous life forms charged ferociously at them.</p><br/><p>\"Here it comes.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sank into a solemn mood. Before entering, the person in charge had informed them of the contents of this event. If the contents of the event they were in when they had first transmigrated were classified as an adventure, then the words \"fleeing for life\" could be used to describe the contents of this event, an event where they had to flee and survive amidst the pursuit of numerous mutated beasts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The green had already been entirely destroyed, the primordial fragment included. However, within the boundless red, a spark of green could be seen shining.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The faint green shone before sweeping toward Chen Feng and enveloping him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The red intensified. The furious red flashed and destroyed the green. Alas, it was already too late. The final dot of green had been able to tear open a hole with a wondrous method.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled. When Chen Feng opened his eyes, he saw a brand new world. A gloomy sky above him, a light drizzle pattering down, a huge crowd, and a world tinged in ancient-looking colors. This was a scene he had never seen before. Distantly, numerous tall buildings and tall mansions stood. Oddly, these buildings gave off an extremely ancient feeling, lacking the feel of modern buildings. The architecture did not seem like any of the cities Chen Feng was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\"Weird\u2026 Where is this place?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was sure that he had never seen such a scene. However, for an unknown reason, what he saw gave him an unprecedentedly familiar feeling, as of something imprinted in the depths of his soul, causing his very soul to tremble. He tried stretching his hand out, yet he found that he was unable to move, just like the previous time he'd traveled back to the Primordial Era.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"I can't move right now. This should be something similar to what happened before. In short, I have returned back to a certain unique era? From the looks of it, this should be a civilization preceding the Genetic Era. Mhm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the vehicles that were moving without stop and watched on as the world became clearer and clearer, yet he still could not move. After pondering his previous experience, he gained some understanding.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like that terrifying existence is capable of changing history. Or perhaps one could say that this is a terrifying ability one stands to gain by owning a whole primordial item. Time and space can be easily reversed. History can be tempered with to achieve his goal. With his ability, he tried to change everything. As for these radiances of differing colors in Mysterious Town\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The truth seemed to be appearing before Chen Feng. The radiances of numerous colors were not the helpers of that fellow. On the contrary, these radiances were all resisting that fellow.</p><br/><p>\"In short\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng drew a conclusion. That complete primordial item was trying to tamper with history, to erase the origin of all existences to reach a certain goal. As for these fragments here, due to their spiritual nature, they refused to permit this happening. This was the reason the large-scale undulation had erupted. That was the origin of the multicolored radiances surging straight to the sky. That was the origin of all that had happened in Mysterious Town.</p><br/><p>\"So that's the case.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng finally understood. Each of the different regions occupied by different colors was a node to change history. He had coincidentally entered the blue region first, entering Duma's world.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng thought about it. \"If I wasn't there at that time\u2026\" If he hadn't been there, the scarab race's history might have truly changed, and Duma might have truly disappeared for real. This was in accordance with his conclusion. In short, what he needed to do was spoil this fellow's numerous attempts at changing history? As he thought of this, he had an ominous feeling, as this time, he had reached a modern society rather than the Primordial Era.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart chilled. \"Something seems wrong.\" This was supposed to be yet another primordial fragment. Since that fellow was trying to tamper with the history that this particular primordial fragment was imprinted with, he should have traveled to the Primordial Era. Why had he arrived at a modern society, then?</p><br/><p>Green\u2026</p><br/><p>Primordial\u2026</p><br/><p>Modern\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. When he had entered this world, the situation had seemed somewhat different from his previous time travel, as this time, the green radiance had been destroyed prior to his time travel. That unknown existence had forcefully destroyed the green.</p><br/><p>In short, this unknown existence had initially unleashed an AoE, triggering the resistance of all the other fragments. Now, on top of the AoE, this unknown existence had unleashed a single target attack as well. With that, the green fragment had been directly destroyed.</p><br/><p>No, this reasoning did not seem right. If the opponent was truly this powerful, the turtle shell could have been destroyed previously as well. If this opponent had decided to unleash the AoE and single target attack at the same time, none of the other fragments would have been able to resist the attack. However, this opponent had obviously not done that previously. As such, this reasoning wasn't right.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng thought of another possibility.</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>\"When I arrived, the green had already been defeated by the AoE in the first place?\" Chen Feng guessed. Could it be that just as he'd arrived, the history imprinted here had already finished being tampered with? A certain part of the Primordial Era's history had been erased? This was the only conclusion he could reach. This was also the only possible explanation for what had happened.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled before his eyes. This modern world still operated before his eyes. Amid the light drizzle, a middle-aged couple appeared with an umbrella. They seemed to be holding onto a child, hugging the child tightly for fear of the child suffering from the cold.</p><br/><p>The family of three seemed to be in a rush, and this entire world seemed to become clearer along with their appearance.</p><br/><p>These two are the main characters this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Similar to the woman from the scarab race earlier, when the main character appeared, the entire world became clear.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Chen Feng found that he still couldn't move. He was still playing the role of an observer.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. What's going on? Suddenly, he thought of a possibility. Previously, he had only been able to move thanks to the help of the primordial fragment, that turtle shell. Now, the green fragment had already been destroyed. As such, he could no longer participate in what was happening in this part of the history.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. \"So I can only watch on?\" Fine, he would play this role, even though he was clueless as to whose history this was.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>In the sky, two muffled peals of thunder sounded, and the rain became heavier. By the road, the masses moved hurriedly. Most of the people without umbrellas were taking cover within the shops. Chen Feng's gaze was focused on the middle-aged couple.</p><br/><p>\"The point where the course of history is altered\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng watched on silently.</p><br/><p>Du du\u2014</p><br/><p>The cell phone sounded.</p><br/><p>\"Hello. Mhm, I know. Don't worry, after settling down the child, I will go over with my wife immediately. Haha, don't worry. I will succeed for real this time.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man ended the call and left quickly with his wife and child. Just as the family of three turned a corner, suddenly, a truck that had gone out of control rushed at them.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The out-of-control truck charged forth like a ferocious beast and crashed through several cars in a row. Even the street lamps were being knocked over everywhere, yet the truck was still heading directly toward the couple.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Here it comes!\" This damnable primordial item was indeed altering history!</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\" The middle-aged man pulled his wife and child and retreated to the side hastily. Alas, the out-of-control truck was still heading toward them. They retreated hastily, dropping the umbrella in their panic. For the first time, the appearance of the child that was being hugged tightly by the woman was revealed to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>With a single look, Chen Feng was alarmed.</p><br/><p>No, this should be a mere resemblance\u2026</p><br/><p>However, when his gaze trailed downward, when he saw the stone hanging around the child's neck, he finally understood. This was his world! This child was him! This damnable primordial item was trying to erase his existence as well!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

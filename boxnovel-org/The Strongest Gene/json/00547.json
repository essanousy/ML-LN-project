Those experts who were in the midst of their cultivation were all startled awake. Gazes overwhelmed with shock were aimed at the sky. If they remembered correctly, the last time such a drizzle had fallen, it was when that senior apprentice sister of theirs had died? This time\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire Land of Legacy shook as one particular person charged rapidly into the ancestral hall. There, one particular name had been colored grey, a grey that would remain for all eternity. Lu Hun\u2026 finally, that brilliant green had stopped burning.</p><br/><p>An overcast and hoarse voice resounded. \"Who is it\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"They are already dead as well.\" One of them gazed at the empty space and was able to see the scene of Lu Hun being killed by Gou Li's group. \"This is karma resulting from grudges. The survivors from what Lu Hun did ten-odd years ago returned to die together with him.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone sank into silence. Dying together\u2026 If so, they truly had no way of seeking revenge against the killers.</p><br/><p>\"No request for help was received on our side?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\"</p><br/><p>They sighed. With how stubborn Lu Hun was, he had most probably been unwilling to seek help even as he'd been dying.</p><br/><p>\"Is there a need for such stubbornness?\"</p><br/><p>Their mood sank. Why had things become this way? For so many years, nobody from the Land of Legacy had ever died. This was especially true for the few of them who were among the apex existences of this world. But now, two of them were lost one after the other\u2026 One was their senior apprentice sister, the other Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>\"Have we found the killer of our senior apprentice sister?\" Master Mu asked as his eyes gleamed coldly.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Her name is Wang Yao. On that day, she went to senior apprentice sister's residence alone and killed everyone there. After that, she vanished,\" one person responded in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Master Mu's killing intent surged. \"Vanished?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Regardless of how we search, we can't find any trace of her. That young lady has seemingly vanished into nothingness.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Thunder roared at the Land of Legacy. Master Mu's killing intent was on the verge of erupting.</p><br/><p>They couldn't do anything to avenge Lu Hun since his killers had perished together with him. But even though their senior apprentice sister had been murdered right at her home, they couldn't even find the murderer?</p><br/><p>Master Mu glared at them. \"All of you are the apex experts of your respective domains!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not their fault,\" a youth said suddenly. \"The disappearance of that young lady is probably related to Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>Master Mu calmed down. This was not the first time he had heard this name. One could say that he was now very familiar with this name. Back then, he had even met this Chen Feng guy when he had gone undercover as Wang Feng in the Mysterious Organization. That damnable bastard!</p><br/><p>\"Wang Yao is his girlfriend. She has formidable strength and is a beyond A class. As such, it is impossible for Chen Feng to just let her laze around doing nothing. However, after that incident, she vanished completely. Even when Chen Feng encountered danger, she did not appear.\" The youth finished his words slowly. \"As such, we suspect that her disappearance is the work of Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They muttered this name. If they had to select a single human who had left the deepest impression on them, it would be this very Chen Feng. This was the fellow who even the ancient race would regard as a freakish existence.</p><br/><p>\"Is Master still in seclusion?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Can we kill Chen Feng?\"</p><br/><p>\"We won't be able to do it. At present, he is the absolute treasure of humanity. Everyone is protecting him with all they have. To kill him, we would have to utilize the entirety of the ancient race just to stand a chance,\" the youth stated calmly.</p><br/><p>It was truly too difficult a feat to kill Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>He had once attempted to kill Chen Feng as well, yet he had been stopped by a mysterious, unknown power. From that, he was aware that Chen Feng's body had to possess some secret.</p><br/><p>A faint voice echoed in the air. \"Tell Qin Hai to end the rebellion as soon as possible. We can no longer ignore the humans.\"</p><br/><p>The youth sighed. \"Our present problem is not the humans\u2026 Rather, it is the devils. That person has suddenly awakened, and his location is rather near the place where Lu Hun met his end. Our guess is that Lu Hun's death might be related to him as well. Lu Hun might have been gravely injured by that person, allowing his enemies from back then to have a chance at ending his life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Devil race\u2026\" Master Mu's voice was filled with disdain. That race akin to animals had been restored again?</p><br/><p>One of them sighed. \"Stop looking down on them. Have you guys not discovered where the problem lies? The ancient race, which was supposed to be high above everyone else, is suddenly surrounded by enemies on all sides, such as the humans and the devils. If we can't deal with this properly, the ancient race will truly be in danger. Even if Master has never said anything about this, I do not wish for the first thing Master sees after his seclusion to be a destroyed ancient race.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence. True, since when had the ancient race degenerated to such an extent?</p><br/><p>\"Raise our vigilance. We can no longer look down on the devils and humans.\"</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Devil race.</p><br/><p>They were still celebrating their victory. Since reawakening, they had suffered numerous defeats. Defeated by the ancients and humans without stop, they were no different than those \"experience farms\" in games. Now, though, they had finally regained their glory, beating both the humans and ancients that had entered their territory this time.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha.\"</p><br/><p>The devils celebrated. Countless people surrounded the old devil and the giant devil. At this moment, the ground trembled. Suddenly, the giant devil opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 have returned!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Thunder roared. Instantly, those dull eyes were filled with life.</p><br/><p>However, the first thing he noticed after awakening was the alarming odor on his body. His nose wrinkled, and shortly after, he understood clearly what had happened.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>His sharp gaze landed on the old devil. \"How dare you!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His howl thundered.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His hand grabbed at the old devil. \"You dare use such a method to resurrect me? To even use my descendant as the catalyst for this, how dare you!\" roared the furious giant devil.</p><br/><p>The other devils were all alarmed. However, that terrifying attack of his was ultimately stopped. Just as his gigantic palm reached the old devil, he had seemingly encountered a terrifying force that stopped his advance.</p><br/><p>\"Do you really think that I have made no preparations at all?\" the old devil asked with a sinister expression.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A shiny seal was imprinted on the giant devil's forehead.</p><br/><p>\"From today onward\u2026 you can assume the role of my puppet,\" the old devil howled.</p><br/><p>Endless radiance swirled around the giant devil's body as the imprint radiated brightly. Next, the initially bright eyes of the giant devil became blank again, and once more, the giant devil became as dull as before.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Loudly, the giant devil knelt on the ground. Starting from his palm, slowly, the old devil stepped up, went past the giant devil's shoulders, and ultimately reached the immense head of this giant devil.</p><br/><p>\"From today onward, I am the emperor of the devil race.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Countless devils prostrated before him. High in the sky, that black rain was becoming even heavier.</p><br/><p>At present time, at the Genetic Union, Chen Feng and Spirit were busy researching something new. Despite how good the inheritance left behind by Gou Li was, it didn't have any substantial use. As such, Chen Feng had to improve it.</p><br/><p>He looked at Spirit. \"Are you sure that there's no problem now?\" He was aware of how terrifying this Shroud Art was. He had no intention of reducing his life span for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded. \"Mhm. This Shroud Art was created with Bi Quzhi as the core. The subsequent version created by Gou Li's group was merely an imitation rather than the true Shroud Art. Therefore, to recreate the true Shroud Art, improvements are required,\" Spirit explained seriously.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\" Chen Feng inhaled. \"Come, then.\"</p><br/><p>He himself wanted to see clearly how much luck value would be required to improve this technique. Could he even complete it at all? Could he create a Shroud Art that truly belonged to the humans?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

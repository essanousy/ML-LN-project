Chen Feng had a solemn expression, feeling like he had a thorny problem on his hands. The time lag was still tolerable, as Xiao Ying VPN was capable of showing him what was happening out there in real time. Coupled with Spirit's deductions and analysis, he was able to deal with it. The lag effect seemed to be ineffective against Spirit. It might seem like the time taken for Xiao Ying to transmit the scenes and for Spirit to complete the deduction would still slow Chen Feng's reaction time, but in actual fact, it did not affect him much.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Duma canceled the time lag. The world before Chen Feng's eyes turned back to normal, yet he did not dare to reduce his vigilance. This was Duma, the leader of the scarab race. Based on what Qin Hai had said earlier, the scarab leader was an extremely respectable and authoritative position, akin to being the king of an entire race. Regardless of who it was, the one who reached this position would be called Duma.</p><br/><p>The scarab race was good at time abilities. Time abilities were the most unique of all abilities and were extremely rare. Since Duma was the king of this scarab race, there was no doubt that he would be good at time manipulation.</p><br/><p>Time leap? Time slow? All these were mere basic abilities for him. For the scarab race to be considered a threat by all other races during the Primordial Era, their prowess was evident.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at Qin Hai. \"What will he do this time?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai shook his head. \"No idea. Most time abilities are related to one's consciousness. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be too big of a problem for the user. But now, with Master's unstable state as a result of being controlled by the pink energy, he won't be able to display the true power of time. Therefore, the abilities he has used and will use are all abilities that won't be influenced by the state of his consciousness,\" Qin Hai explained.</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Chen Feng contemplated. It was no wonder that he kept feeling like Duma's abilities weren't that powerful. Moreover, even though Duma seemed to have everything under control, no move had been made against Chen Feng and Qin Hai. The reason for that was his lack of confidence in totally killing them. For the present him, the little turtle was the utmost priority.</p><br/><p>If so, this killing intent\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at Duma, who had locked on to him. Suddenly, he was startled awake as he realized something. He had nearly fallen for Duma's trick. This guy seemed to be preparing an ultimate ability, yet in fact, his target was still the little turtle. As he thought of this, Chen Feng directly lifted the little turtle and placed the turtle on his body.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" The killing intent that Duma had been condensing stagnated. \"You are courting death.\" He was truly furious now.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous abilities appeared in Duma's brain. These time abilities all seemed so terrifying, yet after browsing them all, he noted that he couldn't use most of them due to this damnable consciousness. Fortunately, there were still some powerful abilities he could use. His focus landed on the few abilities that he could still use. If it was this ability\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his gaze flickered and glimmered with a faint radiance.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Power of time, bloom!</p><br/><p>\"What is this?\" Chen Feng was on alert. Even though the present Duma was half-crippled and could only unleash a small portion of his real strength, this small portion alone was already sufficient to kill both him and Qin Hai. This was, after all, the power of time\u2026</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The faint energy rippled past. Chen Feng frowned, not feeling any changes. Time? The time undulation hadn't changed. Age? No changes there either. Just as he was feeling puzzled, suddenly, his body felt somewhat different. With astonishment, he noticed that he had become slightly weaker.</p><br/><p>\"???\" He was dumbstruck. A time ability capable of reducing one's strength? What in the world? Even more shocking was the fact that Chen Feng had noticed with horror that both he and Qin Hai had become slightly younger.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took in a deep breath. Time reversal! Damn it! Finally, Chen Feng understood. In fact, they had once encountered numerous time-reversing abilities. However, most of those abilities had only been capable of inferring things that had happened in the past. They had been abilities used for investigation and analysis. Here, what Duma had used was a true reversal of time.</p><br/><p>He was reversing time, reversing Chen Feng to the Chen Feng from before. Last year, the year before that, three years ago, this would continue all the way until before he had even been born. The moment he reached that point, he would directly die. Naturally, there wasn't even a need for the reversal to go that far back, as it would waste too much energy. As such, the reversal only needed to reach the period when he was at his weakest\u2026</p><br/><p>\"This is one of my minor abilities.\" Duma sneered. \"After all, the opponents during the Primordial Era all had long life spans. Even those not of the scarab race had extremely long life spans, rendering this ability useless. Any random person would require me to reverse several thousands of years for it to be effective. As such, even for me in my peak form, this ability is rather useless. But against you guys\u2026 humans\u2026 Hahahaha, you guys are too short lived! Let me take a good look at your weakest period.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The power of time bubbled up.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's expression darkened. Damn it! For others, this ability might need to reverse ten-odd years or even several decades for it to be effective. But for Chen Feng? Only several years would be required for Chen Feng to be reduced to a normal person. The time he had cultivated was too short. This wouldn't do.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, are you not done yet?\" Chen Feng urged anxiously. From the start of this battle, Spirit had been studying Duma's power of time. He wanted to do the same thing he had done when he'd faced the devil expert, creating an ability unique to him from this. Alas, he had yet to succeed even now.</p><br/><p>\"No.\" A conflicted expression appeared on Spirit's face. \"This power is much more complicated than the devil's power.\"</p><br/><p>So far, the results of their study could only improve Chen Feng's disintegration ability. Apart from that, it was useless.</p><br/><p>How about Xiao Ying? Forget it, he's probably still searching for the source of the pink energy. Chen Feng rubbed his head. Suddenly, he found that he was out of external options. Spirit and Xiao Ying were occupied, while Luck Aura was still silent. At present, he could only rely on himself.</p><br/><p>Power\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng started recalling all the abilities he had. Time Quicksand? He did not dare to use it. The moment time skipped, he might die as well.</p><br/><p>At present, his time was flowing backward. If he dared to skip time, it was likely that only a second would pass in the real world yet he would already be near death.</p><br/><p>God Punisher\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it. This thing contained Time Quicksand. He couldn't use it either. Naturally, against an opponent on the level of Duma, these normal abilities wouldn't work anyway. Facing an awakened one, only powerful awakened powers would work. As for Chen Feng, he only had two awakened abilities. One was the Useless Void Destroyer, which only worked on spatial abilities, while the other was his Star Disintegration Finger.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Star Disintegration Finger: a basic awakened ability capable of disintegrating basic abilities of all ability types.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>After being improved by Spirit, this Star Disintegration Finger was even more powerful. Unfortunately, facing an advanced ability such as this time reversal, a formless and directionless ability, Chen Feng was helpless and could only watch on.</p><br/><p>In short\u2026 there were no solutions? Chen Feng's heart chilled. It was over. He watched on as his strength declined rapidly as time reversed unendingly. He was nearing the bottleneck before S class. He knew that it wouldn't be long before he would drop from S class. At that time, it would truly be game over for him. Yet he couldn't do anything and could only watch on as he reached the border of S class. On the verge of dropping from S class\u2026</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an odd expression appeared on his face. This\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

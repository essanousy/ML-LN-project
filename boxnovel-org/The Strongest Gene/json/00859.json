However, everything suddenly vanished. Only that question was left lingering in the air: \u201cWho\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d Curse it! The gods were all horrified. After all, this group was comprised of one major god and nine journeyman gods. Their combined strength was unimaginable. However, even with their strength, their combined attack had been erased by this single seemingly stupid question from Kong Bai?</p><br/><p>Why? This fellow\u2026 Fear filled their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me. Who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d As he asked this question, a stiff smile took shape on Kong Bai\u2019s face. He was seemingly trying to make himself look kinder, yet when the creases on his face piled together due to the forced smile, he instead looked even scarier.</p><br/><p>One of the gods had an ominous feeling and wanted to retreat. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Bai\u2019s expression became sinister. \u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A beam of light shot out of his eyes, instantly disintegrating that god.</p><br/><p>The other gods: \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>What in the world was this? Titanium beams? Apart from some unique existences with powerful eyes, someone killing someone else with their eyes was extremely rare. How could this Kong Bai fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d Kong Bai\u2019s gaze rested on one of them. \u201cWho\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. It\u2019s you,\u201d the trembling god answered.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence. Even Kong Bai stopped talking. He didn\u2019t attack either. Was that the correct answer? That god was overjoyed when he noticed this. Alas, before he could revel in his joy, a beam of light appeared and punched straight through him. Before his death, Kong Bai\u2019s emotionless voice waffled into his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cA lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other gods were all dumbstruck. What was this? Ignoring him would result in death. Answering him would still result in death, as he would assume it was a lie. What the hell? How were they supposed to answer this question, then?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai\u2019s gaze came to rest on yet another god. \u201cAnswer me. Who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d</p><br/><p>That god gulped. \u201cMe\u2026\u201d Since saying the most handsome man was Kong Bai wouldn\u2019t work, he might as well try saying it was him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a flash, he was reduced to ash.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai\u2019s cold and hoarse voice drifted past. \u201cAre you not ashamed of saying that, with that face of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, the entire world lapsed into silence. The remaining gods began to sweat profusely. This Kong Bai\u2026 was truly very scary.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai seemed to have been overexposed to time, to the point that his consciousness was now hazy. From the look of his face, he seemed to have experienced many years, to the point that his strength had become this terrifying. At this time, Kong Bai\u2019s gaze landed on another god.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me. Who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The questioned god felt a chill go up his spine. Was he going to die now? How should he answer this? Heavens, a question like this\u2026 This did not seem like a question with a proper answer, right? Who was that \u201cmost handsome man\u201d? Suddenly, he thought of a possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was just about to yell the name out. Alas, before he could answer, he was reduced to ash by yet another flash.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai\u2019s cold voice resounded. \u201cHesitating to answer such a question? Ignorant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The remaining gods were all dumbfounded. An\u2026 another death? Heavens! What exactly did this guy want? Perhaps, he merely intended to slowly torture and kill everyone here? No, that did not seem to be the case. His consciousness seemed to have truly gone hazy.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai\u2019s gaze landed on the weakest god in this group. \u201cAnswer me. Who\u2019s the most handsome man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That god paused slightly, then recalled the earlier god\u2019s death. Immediately, he howled, \u201cKong Bai! Kong Bai is the most handsome man!\u201d</p><br/><p>This short sentence was yelled so loudly that even a deaf person could hear it. The nearby gods all felt their ears going deaf from the loud shout.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Kong Bai regarded this god with his blank eyes. Just as everyone thought that this god was about to die as well, Kong Bai\u2019s head nodded suddenly. An expression of approval appeared on his face. \u201cIndeed. Kong Bai is the most handsome man. Hehe. Even if I have forgotten many things\u2026 I still remember that he is the most handsome man.\u201d</p><br/><p>This old Kong Bai seemed to be extremely satisfied. Thus, he nodded his head approvingly before turning around and leaving. The remaining gods were all sweating profusely. Their legs were limp from the fear. So they had survived? What they had just experienced was something\u2026 that could not be explained with words. At this time, some of them looked at the departing Kong Bai. His elderly figure was somewhat stooped. From his body, a familiar power could be felt. Right, it was precisely the power of that damnable mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that mirror fuse with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what had happened to Kong Bai. However, it was at this moment that these gods had a feeling, like the hunt this time wouldn\u2019t progress as smoothly as they had expected. Something like this had happened to Kong Bai. What about the other targets? The gods wondered, were they still the hunters? Why did they feel like the roles had been reversed?</p><br/><p>\u201cContact our lord. This Kong Bai is not someone we can handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a different location, a group of gods was advancing cautiously. Suddenly, one of them stopped the others. \u201cHalt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why? The other gods looked at him questioningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d That god looked at the region before them, which was filled with swirling light. He paused momentarily before looking at the god beside him. \u201cI seem to recall that your flesh is capable of unlimited regeneration, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>That god nodded. \u201cYeah. Why\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, his arm was severed from his body. This was followed by a miserable scream from him. Next, the other god tossed the cut arm into the region of swirling lights. At a speed visible to the naked eye, the arm instantly withered, began desiccating, and ultimately transformed into nothingness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. The flow of time here is a hundred times faster than normal. Entering might result in death,\u201d that god said with a calm expression.</p><br/><p>However, the god whose limb had been severed was currently extremely angry. \u201cI don\u2019t care. You are the scout. If you need something, say it and we will cooperate. Why did you cut my arm off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That god paused, then looking at them doubtfully. \u201cWill you guys trust me if I say it out loud?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. After all, you are a scout whose abilities specialize in detection,\u201d the remaining gods answered doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That god seemed to come to a sudden realization. \u201cSorry. I have never worked with other gods before. I only did that to increase my persuasiveness. Next time, I will take note of my actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The now one-armed god stared at him, stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh!\u201d After taking a detour around that region, the scout suddenly told everyone to keep quiet. Distantly, the figure that they had been trailing had finally stopped moving. He seemed to be looking for something. He stood on the shore of a lake, his gaze stalled on the water below him. He was staring at the glittering water, seemingly hesitating about something. The gods behind him increased their vigilance. Suddenly, that figure stripped naked. He continued to intently stare at the water below him for a long time before suddenly proudly saying, \u201cIndeed. It has grown larger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gods behind him: \u201c???\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

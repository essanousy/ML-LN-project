This was not met with much resistance. Those geniuses initially filled with an air of arrogance had, under the effect of feminization, seemingly become a different kind of proud, one that could be described with the word \"tsundere.\"</p><br/><p>Now, Qin Hai had indeed brought some hope to the ancient race. Within the land of legacy, all those that had already been beyond A classes were not affected by the humans' forbidden skill. As for those that had only entered the realm of beyond after the appearance of the gene reagent, they had all been feminized. This clearly showed that when the humans had unleashed that forbidden skill, these people had still all been A classes.</p><br/><p>In other words, the reason Qin Hai and the rest were fine was because they had already been beyond A classes when the forbidden skill was unleashed. Only those in beyond A class could resist this forbidden skill. This was also a source of a hope for the ancient race.</p><br/><p>The newborns of the ancient race were innately powerful. Most of the time, they were in D class from birth, but some geniuses were in C class from birth. There were even rare talents that were even more powerful from birth. For the ancient race, their only hope of surviving against this was to ensure that their children could enter A class as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\"Remember. Make sure to separate all the children that have yet to start being feminized. Try to reduce contact between them and others to avoid them being polluted by the curse. Try to push those children into beyond A class as soon as possible.\" Qin Hai assumed an anxious appearance, seemingly hoping that the ancient race could preserve this final batch of seed.</p><br/><p>Thereupon, everyone started using the beyond X gene reagent crazily. Alas, it did not seem to work. These children had apparently failed to escape the curse as well. Before they could even fully develop their speech, their gender was already changing from male to female. The various family heads were pained and alarmed by the prowess of the humans' curse.</p><br/><p>With this, the extinction of the ancient race was assured, but the contributions of our friend Qin Hai couldn't be ignored. Naturally, due to Qin Hai doing what seemed to be the best course of action and using the methods that seemed correct all along, none of the ancient race members blamed him for this. Rather, they shed tears of gratitude to him for his willingness to help. At this time, perhaps due to everyone suffering from the same fate or perhaps due to the anxiety about the future of the ancient race, the ancient race rebels was actually showing signs that they were going to give up on the rebellion.</p><br/><p>As a response, Qin Hai took on the policy of \"settling inner conflicts before dealing with outer conflicts.\" He led the main army of the ancient race and declared war on the ancient race rebels. This caused the rebels to forget about giving up on the rebellion and instead strengthened their resolve to rebel, their rationale being that without rebelling, only death would await them.</p><br/><p>With this, a great civil war erupted, and once again, the ancient race was mired by chaos.</p><br/><p>\"Remember, the present war is for our future peace. In truth, I hate war. As such, I hope to end this as soon as possible. My dream is to return to that little mountain, to continue cultivating happily with my fellow apprentice brothers.\"</p><br/><p>This saying of Qin Hai's became a renowned saying among the ancient race. Evidently, after hanging around Chen Feng, he had learned quite a lot from Chen Feng. But then, whether this scheme Qin Hai was playing had been instructed by Chen Feng or not remained unknown.</p><br/><p>In short, thanks to Qin Hai's act of assuming the role of the king of the ancient race, he managed to gain even more time for humanity.</p><br/><p>\"How long can you get for us?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai sighed. \"I have no idea.\" He had no idea if this was because he was the king, but when he'd been warring against those rebels, some of them had actually surrendered immediately after seeing him, volunteering to serve him instead. Even Qin Hai himself was dumbfounded by this.</p><br/><p>\"There is one thing I can be sure of, though. Since there are no more males in the entire ancient race, the moment the rebellion is dealt with, when they have the time to finally pay attention to the humans, the fate of human males will probably be\u2026\" Qin Hai did not finish his words, yet it was sufficient to cause Chen Feng to widen his eyes.</p><br/><p>What in the world? That wouldn't be, right? Only now did he think of this terrifying fact. The moment the ancient race, which was completely comprised of females, mixed with the current human society, where there were many more males than females, Chen Feng was sure that the ancient race would not even need to try any seduction techniques.</p><br/><p>Those ancient race females with beautiful looks only needed to beckon at the human males with their fingers; that would be sufficient to cause a lot of human men to lose their mind. At that time\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng felt helpless. \"Can different races even reproduce with each other?\"</p><br/><p>Qin Hai sighed. \"How am I supposed to know? These days, even humans and beasts can bear offspring, so isn't it logical that it would work for humans and ancient race members as well?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's lips twitched as he was left speechless. Indeed, look at the horseman clan, the oxman clan, and so on. It was rumored that the origin of these clans was actually\u2026</p><br/><p>If what Qin Hai guessed truly happened, at that time, rather than the ancient race being eliminated, the human culture might be the one being annexed by the ancient race. The reason was that regardless of what gender the offspring of humans and ancient race members ended up being, their strength would most definitely be formidable. At that time, all of humanity might instead end up as the slaves of the ancient race.</p><br/><p>As such, even after all this, humanity was still hard pressed for time. This was especially true because even now, the ancient race was still increasing in strength.</p><br/><p>\"Time\u2026\" Chen Feng kneaded his head. Humanity would require time to grow. At present, the beyond X gene reagent had already entered the rapid growth stage, and almost everyone already had a chance to comprehend the power of beyond. But this was still not enough to contend with the ancient race. Humanity needed to become even stronger. The humans that had comprehended the power of beyond needed to enter the realm of A class as soon as possible as well. Only with this would the power of humanity be sufficient.</p><br/><p>\"Oh yeah, recently, some ancient race members have been thinking of ways to enter the human territories. I heard that it's because they are no longer able to bear with life in the ancient race territories and want to start a new life in the human territories. Their outer appearances do not seem too different from humans'. You guys need to be alert on that,\" Qin Hai told Chen Feng. It was rather troublesome if the ancient race population were to mix among humans.</p><br/><p>\"Oh?\" Chen Feng started pondering. Ancient race\u2026 \"Seems like I need to think of something,\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>Based on what Qin Hai had said, this might be an opportunity to clash with some of the ancient race in advance. This would allow them to try to discover the weakness of the ancient race and gain understanding on actual ancient race members.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>After ending the call, Chen Feng immediately started his investigation. Soon, they found the particular ancient race member that had mixed into human society. Surprisingly, this ancient race female had even gotten married to a human. By feigning to be a human, she had married a human male.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Name: Yue Lan.</p><br/><p>Strength: Beyond A class.</p><br/><p>Introduction: Appeared at Sea City three months ago. Due to her exceptional temperament, appearance that stands out from others, and calm nature, she was pursued by countless people. Finally, she married one of them. After marriage, this female even found a job and started living a normal working life. She has never done anything else.</p><br/><p>Disguise: Due to her extreme strength, nobody has been able to see through her.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"Yue Lan\u2026\" His underling had delivered the detailed information on this beyond A ancient race member. Mhm, she was indeed exceptionally beautiful. That delicate face with a faint smile on it and that figure that was almost perfection, this was truly a goddess in the hearts of a lot of males. Who would have guessed that this female was also an ancient race member? Chen Feng had not told anyone else about this.</p><br/><p>Some of the investigators that had been compiling this information for Chen Feng exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, how beautiful.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, to obtain wife as such, it would be worth it even if one's life span was reduced by 30 years.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng glanced at them but did not comment on it. Presently, nobody had any idea what exactly these ancient race members that had entered human society were thinking. If it was in the past, directly killing them would have been the proper path to take.</p><br/><p>But now, since they were refugees and had even gotten married\u2026 how should they be dealt with, then? Perhaps one should ask: what exactly were they aiming for?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"Seems like I have to personally deal with this.\" Naturally, before doing anything, he first looked for Qin Hai to gain detailed information on this Lady Yue Lan.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have any impressions of this person?\"</p><br/><p>\"Please wait a bit.\" Shortly after, Qin Hai managed to find her information. \"Mhm, I found it. This fellow's initial name was Li Goudan. He was a savage from one of the farming villages of the ancient race. Back then, he was the tyrant of an area and was also called Bro Scarface. With his valiant strength, he reached A class. Subsequently, after plundering a huge amount of beyond X gene reagents, he broke through into beyond A class. After that, he went missing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Bro\u2026 Bro Scarface?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless as he gazed at the picture of Lady Yue Lan he had in his hand. Truly\u2026karma. He let off a long sigh.</p><br/><p>As for who was the one who had actually suffered the retribution of karma, it did not need to be said. Naturally, in a certain way, this Bro Scarface hadn't been lying to that newly gained human husband, as the \"scar\" had merely changed locations now\u2026</p><br/><p>Mhm, there was nothing wrong with that. After arranging the information about \"Lady Yue Lan,\" Chen Feng decided to go meet her and that poor husband of hers. However, surprisingly, just as he reached Sea City, he encountered this lady.</p><br/><p>A familiar voice could be heard. \"Hahahaha. Chen Feng! I knew it was you! Wow, I initially believed that you would never come to Sea City. Unexpectedly, I can still see you!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng raised his head and was immediately stunned. \"Mu Yuan?\"[1] 1</p><br/><p>That's right, this person was Chen Feng's friend from back then, Mu Yuan. However, due to his rather ordinary potential, after giving up on breaking through, he had directly decided to start a normal and simple life in Sea City. His life was truthfully rather easy and comfortable. However, what alarmed Chen Feng wasn't his appearance. Rather, it was the person beside him\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Come, let me introduce you.\" Mu Yuan proudly stated, \"This is my wife, Yue Lan.\"</p><br/><p>\"!!!\" Chen Feng's eyes widened. What? This isn't true, right? For that legendarily unlucky person to actually be Mu Yuan?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng recalled the \"bunny girl incident\" and the \"Little Min incident\" back then. In short, this pitiful Mu Yuan still couldn't escape this cursed destiny?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

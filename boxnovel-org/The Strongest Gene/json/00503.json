Unfortunately, even with the full activation of his Luck Aura, his completed formula had only increased the active duration of beyond to a pitiful 300 milliseconds, or in other words, 0.3 seconds.</p><br/><p>\"This won't do\u2026\" Chen Feng muttered. This duration of 0.3 seconds was way too short. Ending before even starting\u2014what, was this a quickie? Chen Feng started imagining a situation where during a battle, during the crisis of life and death, when one erupted with one's strongest trump card, the power of beyond only lasted a split second and ended before one could even unleash an ability with it.</p><br/><p>What was this akin to? This was akin to one reaching orgasm before even taking one's pants off. This was too excessive! The shortest acceptable duration for this test was a duration of one second. This was the determined minimum standard after numerous verifications. Only an active duration of one second and above could allow one to unleash even the simplest of abilities. This duration of 0.3 seconds was far from sufficient for that.</p><br/><p>\"How much luck value was exhausted earlier?\" Chen Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\"700 points,\" Spirit answered honestly. \"Out of the luck value you have saved up during the past month, only 100 points remain.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Indeed. After holding it in for an entire month, he'd fired a single shot and it was all gone.</p><br/><p>He had initially thought that he would be able to complete this successfully with a single attempt. Alas, the difficulty level of this research had far exceeded his imagination. Even after exhausting 700 luck value, he had only achieved a duration of 0.3 seconds. In other words, was this the limit of the 22 chosen materials? Or perhaps, was this the limit of energy?</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, is this result of 0.3 the limit?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was somewhat anxious. If this was due to the limited amount of luck value he had or the sheer difficulty of the problem, he only needed to put more effort into it. But if it was truly the limit\u2026</p><br/><p>Spirit's reply caused Chen Feng's heart to chill. \"It has already reached the limit.\"</p><br/><p>\"By inferring using these 22 materials, the most optimal result is a duration of 0.3 seconds. Using 700 luck value for this is already more than sufficient. Some luck value even overflowed during the process.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"But you don't have to worry. The overflowed luck value was used with 'inferring the power of beyond' as the basis. However, whether that has born any results remains to be seen,\" Spirit replied.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. This was exactly what he had been worried about. He had truly never expected that the limit was 0.3 seconds. The concept of beyond was truly much harder to grasp than he had imagined. Even after choosing the correct research direction to pursue, he was still stuck here. If he had selected another direction\u2026 Chen Feng did not even need much pondering to know how tragic the end of the research would have been.</p><br/><p>That was evident by how earlier, someone had tried applying for energy stimulating gene reagents and was told off by Chen Feng. Unexpectedly, only one day had passed since then and his own research was stuck at a bottleneck as well.</p><br/><p>Just 0.3 seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sunk into contemplation. Going forward, he would have to rely on other methods to increase this duration. Perhaps he could try using other materials on corresponding distinct energy? Chen Feng could remember clearly that all 22 chosen materials he had used were common materials usable for all energy types. If he chose to focus the direction toward a specific individual, he would have more than 100 materials to work with. For example, a total of 160 materials would work on Shen Yi.</p><br/><p>But then, using this method, even if he reached the minimum standard of one second, it would be pointless, as this wouldn't be practical for others. Would he be forced to conduct specific research on each different individual from now on? Or perhaps\u2026 he should just complete the research on one individual first before thinking of his next step?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated without stop. Right at this moment, his wristband buzzed. Instinctively, Chen Feng gave it a glance. Instantly, he was astonished at what he had received. On his screen was a complete set of research data.</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Project code: MILD-971</p><br/><p>Project content: Through gene reagents, genetic abilities, chemical reagents, animal liquids, and all sort of other materials, stimulate the power of beyond from a genetic warrior's physical body.</p><br/><p>Result: Success</p><br/><p>Duration: 0.001 second</p><br/><p>Project team: BolkoChost team</p><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>\"Success?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng exclaimed in admiration. This was indeed worthy of being a well-known research team of the Genetic Union. Only with the numerous advantages Chen Feng had coupled with using luck value to complete the biggest chunk of his job had Chen Feng managed to complete his research. Astonishingly, this team had also completed their chosen research, the research on one's physical body. Despite the duration being a short one millisecond, that short duration was in fact due to the limitations imposed by them researching in the wrong direction.</p><br/><p>But then, why had they sent this to him? Chen Feng was somewhat surprised. Only shortly after did he note the short row of words behind the dataset. They were hoping to cooperate with Chen Feng and were willing to assist Chen Feng in the completion of his research.</p><br/><p>BolkoChost team\u2026</p><br/><p>Why was this name so familiar? Chen Feng recalled that indeed, this was the team that had been told off by him earlier.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like the overflowed portion of the 700 luck value still played a small role after all,\" Chen Feng guessed.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that a large portion of the 700 luck value had been focused on inferring the formula, the small amount of overflowed luck value had managed to bring about an unexpected result after Spirit's optimization. This team had astonishingly offered to cooperate with him. For Chen Feng, this was a good piece of news. Since both energy and physical body research had reached the limit, what if the results were combined?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. Shortly after, he invited them over. When they found out that Chen Feng's research had reached a duration of 300 milliseconds, they were greatly shocked. This was a progress 300 times higher than theirs! Indeed, energy research was the correct direction of research.</p><br/><p>\"Now, I am thinking of combining the results,\" Chen Feng stated honestly. \"You guys shall provide a suitable body-provoking gene reagent while I shall provide a suitable energy-provoking gene reagent. With the combination of both\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Soon, a blended reagent was produced. This was a gene reagent with a faint gold color and a faint aroma leaking out of it. What would the effect of this thing be? It was unknown. This was not some simple math like 1+1=2. In fact, under their research, 1+1 would either be far greater or lower than 2.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contacted the person with the highest vitality. \"Xu Fei.\"</p><br/><p>\"Here I am.\" Xu Fei gulped the gene reagent down without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint power started dispersing. Everyone stared unwaveringly at Xu Fei without stop until, finally, a trace of that formidable power emanated out of his body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A gold radiance bloomed. Beyond had appeared!</p><br/><p>The screen on their recording device started flickering without stop. Everyone looked at the timer with expectation: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250\u2026 310!</p><br/><p>\"It surpassed the previous record!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was overjoyed. They had finally surpassed the limit of 300! Surprising all of them, this number was still increasing: 350, 400, 500, 600\u2026 Ultimately, it stopped at 800. A duration of 0.8 seconds!</p><br/><p>Everyone was enraptured. Indeed, 1+1 had brought about a result far greater than 2! Fusion was the way to go.</p><br/><p>\"Genius!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone in the BolkoChost team gazed at Chen Feng respectfully. He was indeed worthy of being part of the management of the Gene Production Association, worthy of being a legendary excellent producer. This result alone was already sufficient to cause countless people to look up to him.</p><br/><p>\"This 0.8 seconds is not the limit,\" Chen Feng stated decisively. \"We can continue to allocate the different data to figure out the most fitting ratio.\"</p><br/><p>The person in charge of that team accepted this troublesome task immediately. \"Let us deal with that.\" Soon, after numerous attempts, the new ratio of the gene reagent had reached the limit, with the active duration being one second!</p><br/><p>\"Success!\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, we have succeeded!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was overjoyed. They had done it! They knew that from then on, the fate of humanity would change! This was a day fated to be entered into the annals of history!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

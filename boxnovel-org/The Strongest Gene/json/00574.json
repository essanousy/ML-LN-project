Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous layers of killing intent erupted as various terrifying streaks neared Chen Feng. The only thing he could do now was spam his luck value. Alas, right as Spirit was about to activate Luck Aura, suddenly, a black shadow flashed past. Instantly, Chen Feng's weakened body was knocked flying away.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was dumbstruck. What was going on this time?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Before he could even do anything, numerous swirling radiances of multiple colors flashed before his eyes. Chen Feng could only feel a powerful force dragging him before he lost all perception.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in the Ownerless Land, the ancient experts were watching on with blank expressions as well. Where Chen Feng had stood before was now completely empty. That black flash had streaked past and Chen Feng had vanished.</p><br/><p>\"Where is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"No idea.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you all blind?\"</p><br/><p>The ancient experts were furious. After a long time, when Master Mu returned, his expression became ashen as he heard what had happened. When he had returned to the White Church, that mysterious person already departed. That expert hadn't waited around to meet him at all. As such, he had taken a trip for nothing. Now that he had returned here, Chen Feng was gone as well. Just like that, an adult had vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>\"There are some traces of spatial power here.\" Suddenly, Master Mu recalled Chen Feng's spatial teleporting gene reagent from earlier. Chen Feng had to have used that gene reagent. This Chen Feng fellow had to have kept one more behind as a trump card. Even though Si Fan had failed to detect it, with Chen Feng's capabilities, it wasn't odd for him to have been able to hide one from Si Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Chase!\" Master Mu ordered without hesitation. He gathered all of them together before activating the spatial teleporting gene reagent he had grabbed from Chen Feng earlier.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Instantly, a terrifying explosion erupted. Bloody chunks of flesh flew everywhere.</p><br/><p>Master Mu was dumbstruck. \"???\"</p><br/><p>The ancient experts that had still been alive and well earlier were now all chunks of meat. Master Mu was the only one left alive. He rubbed his face and discovered that he seemed to have sustained injuries as well. This spatial teleporting gene reagent was a freaking fake? Master Mu's body chilled. He gazed at a certain skull that was flying toward him. Mhm, only half the head remained. This was the head of one of the ancients that had reinforced him earlier. He recalled that this fellow was the son of his junior apprentice brother. How was he supposed to answer to his junior apprentice brother?</p><br/><p>A mournful scream echoed through the air. \"Chen Feng!\"</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>At the same time, at a certain unknown location, Chen Feng woke up from the darkness. He could vaguely recall that during that final moment, he had felt some sort of warmth around his body, like someone had been embracing him. That familiar feeling\u2026 Chen Feng raised his head. A face capable of giving children nightmares entered his sight.</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked at him with a smile. \"Heh, you're awake?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng retracted his hand that had instinctively prepared to attack. This face was so ugly at the first glance that he had thought that this was someone from the devil race.</p><br/><p>\"You rescued me?\" Chen Feng asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"What else?\" Kong Bai curled his lip. \"Anyway, at that time, I was peeing. When I saw my pee that was supposed to shoot forth over 30 meters distort and form an 'SOS' shape, I knew something must have happened to you.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Therefore, this lord here locked onto your aura and transmigrated over there to rescue you,\" Kong Bai stated proudly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was alarmed. \"Transmigration?\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked at him with an odd gaze. \"Of course. How else am I supposed to get there? Spatial abilities? What kind of joke is that? Do you have any idea how many ancients were guarding the Ownerless Land? If I dared teleport there directly, I would have been killed long ago. As such, I had no choice but to transmigrate over.\"</p><br/><p>\"Where are we now, then?\" Chen Feng looked around. The environment looked rather unique. It seemed to be a place he had never been to. He raised his head and noted that even the stars in the sky looked somewhat different. Even the moon wasn't white. Rather, the moon was an icy-blue color. What damnable place was this?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai looked at him with a solemn expression. \"How am I supposed to know that?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng recalled that Kong Bai had once mentioned that he had once tried transmigrating numerous times, wasting a large number of years before he was able to return to the Genetic Era. In short, this time\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, is there any luck value left?\" Chen Feng asked hastily. They had been able to easily return during their previous transmigration thanks to the combination of Kong Bai's ability and Chen Feng's luck value. However, the further they had transmigrated, the more luck value they would need to transmigrate back. Therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Please wait a moment.\" Spirit took a glance and said, \"You have three luck value left.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng's heart chilled. He had nearly exhausted his supply of luck value when trying to save himself earlier. This time, things were getting troublesome. He looked at the fellow beside him and sighed. Even if it had been Wang Yao instead of this person who had rescued him, wouldn't it be better?</p><br/><p>Spirit shook her head decisively. \"That's not possible. Wang Yao was too far away and couldn't be reached in time. Furthermore, the experts of the ancient race were heading over there as well. Even if Wang Yao arrived, it wouldn't have helped. Moreover, your luck value was rather limited as well. In that situation, only Kong Bai could save you. That was already the most optimal choice.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. Fine. Let's first look around.</p><br/><p>\"What do you normally do after transmigrating?\" Chen Feng asked Kong Bai. This fellow should be experienced in this.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I normally gather information about the new place.\" Kong Bai scratched his head. \"I first disguise myself as a monster or a freak before going out to cause disturbances. Then I'll vanish and reappear using a brand new identity that fits the culture of that world. Naturally, at times, the world I arrive in is one where there is no culture, only primitives or beasts.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng felt helpless. This guy obviously had a tendency to act rashly.</p><br/><p>\"Let me give it a try?\" Kong Bai was eager. Since he had returned to the Genetic Era last time, it had been a while since he had last transmigrated. He had been afraid that after once again transmigrating away, he wouldn't be able to return. Now, though, with Chen Feng around, he wasn't as stressed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"There's no need for that.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A red flash streaked out of his hand. Instantly, Xiao Ying vanished.</p><br/><p>\"Huh? It's that snake capable of hardening up?\" Kong Bai exclaimed in admiration. He clearly remembered how, several times in the past, Chen Feng had used the hardened version of this snake to act tough during fights.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\" Chen Feng's face darkened. Could he use a different term than \"harden\"?</p><br/><p>Kong Bai realized his fault and coughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>When \"snake\" and \"harden\" were used separately, it sounded right. However, when used together\u2026mhm\u2026 It was capable of sparking colorful imaginings.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a flash, Xiao Ying returned. The scenes scouted out by Xiao Ying appeared in Chen Feng's brain. However, surprising Chen Feng, within a circumference of 50 kilometers around them, not a single life-form could be found. There were no animals or vegetations. This seemed somewhat odd. This place obviously had an environment suitable for life. The air\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He transmitted what he had seen to Kong Bai. As Kong Bai saw the scenes, his expression became unsightly. Based on his years of experience transmigrating, such a unique situation signified only one thing: this was a place where no life forms existed yet, a newly formed world in its most primal form.</p><br/><p>\"In short, we have transmigrated to a newborn world?\" Kong Bao howled in grief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

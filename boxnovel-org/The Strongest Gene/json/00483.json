Your bloodline ability is Divine Eyes, am I right? By looking at an ability being used, you can analyze the structural makeup of that ability before setting a direction to it and modifying it to create an imprint. Ultimately, the result is that, thanks to the numerous imprints you have, all abilities you have seen once are ineffective against you. Am I right?\" Chen Feng asked calmly.</p><br/><p>Opposite him, the once-white cat, which was now a black tiger, was for the first time looking at Chen Feng with an amazed gaze. It was astonished. Even back then, among the devil race, its bloodline had been an extremely rare one. It had only been several days since it had reawakened, so how had this fellow here figured out this secret?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. \"Looks like I'm correct.\" The rest around him exchanged glances as they realized the reason the tiger had seemed undefeatable earlier. So it was actually due to such an ability?</p><br/><p>\"The reason you used all the recently reawakened devil race members as cannon fodder is not because you were hiding yourself as a trump card. Rather, you were using those cannon fodder to perfect your imprint collection, to produce more imprints to deal with us. During this battle, you have seen with your own eyes the majority of the abilities these Genetic Union members have. As such, making use of those cannon fodder, you created imprints countering Han Yula, the deputy president, and all the genetic warriors here. In turn, that means you are nearly undefeatable here on this battlefield,\" Chen Feng stated coldly.</p><br/><p>The darknight devil tiger remained silent, yet it maintained its gaze on Chen Feng gloomily. This guy was giving him an extremely ominous feeling, causing the tiger to have a feeling of extreme danger. This feeling of danger had exceeded that of even the deputy president.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you?\" the tiger asked coldly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng laughed. \"Me? A mere human. A human lucky enough to witness the holy war between the ancient race and the barbarians back then.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the tiger's fur shuddered. \"Holy war! Witness!\" How many years had it been since the holy war? Despite the long lifespan of devil race members, they had only survived till the current era through hibernation. As for this guy here\u2026 Human? What freak was this? Hold on! How was it possible for the human species to have existed during that era?</p><br/><p>The tiger's eyes gleamed ominously. \"You are lying to me.\"</p><br/><p>As a response, Chen Feng's gaze became trancelike. \"How am I lying? That was quite a war\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, countless light particles spread around before condensing in the air. The Sage, the barbarians\u2026 everything that had happened back then started replaying in the air. Everyone present widened their eyes as they witnessed this glorious sight, witnessing the awe-inspiring strength of the ancient race.</p><br/><p>The tiger became horrified. \"You were truly there?\" Only those who had actually been present back then could show this scene!</p><br/><p>The reason for that was because the energy undulation from the war back then had been intense, to the point that nobody could obtain the scene of what had happened through divining abilities. Even merely divining certain keywords describing the war back then was impossible, yet this person here was actually able to play out the scene of what had happened back then?</p><br/><p>\"Who are you, exactly?\" the tiger howled.</p><br/><p>\"You don't need to know that,\" Chen Feng stated indifferently. \"I am only here to tell you something. To be precise, I am here to let the devil race know something, because I believe that they are able to see what's happening here through you. What I want to say is that the ancient race is still around. Through years of hibernation, your devil race has indeed become stronger. However, after numerous years of development, the ancient race has probably grown even more than you guys. The difference between the ancient race and the devil race is that the ancient race is smarter. They have been hiding behind the scenes. By allowing the devil race to reawaken and battle humanity, the ancient race will be the one to reap all the profits after our war. Please do remember the existence of such a terrifying enemy.\" Chen Feng smiled calmly.</p><br/><p>The tiger sneered. \"Do you believe that, just because of this, the devil race will let you humans off?\" A new species known as human, eh? Were all of them this naive? Even if this guy was telling the truth about the ancient race hiding somewhere, the devil race would still not let humanity off anyway. This was a world where the strong preyed on the weak, a world where the weak couldn't exist.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"No. Regardless of whether it's the devil race or the ancient race, you guys are all alien races to us humans. For us humans, there is a rather well-known saying: Those of a different race are never to be trusted! The only reason I'm telling you all this is so you won't die knowing nothing.\"</p><br/><p>Finished with his words, Chen Feng raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance converged in his hand. At this, the tiger took two steps back. Facing this person who had once witnessed the holy war back then, it was still fearful. Otherwise, it would have pounced and tried to kill him long ago. What in the world was this person here?</p><br/><p>Let alone this tiger, even those from the Genetic Union were rather confused. They had indeed obtained a small amount of information about the ancient race. All that had been obtained from Chen Feng. But then, the holy war and the barbarians\u2026 At this moment, a tinge of mysteriousness had seemingly shrouded Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chen Feng waved his hand downward. The terrifying attack that everyone was expecting to appear was nowhere to be seen. Just as everyone started to believe that Chen Feng was merely scamming them all, the earth started trembling and an oppressive sound of footsteps echoed.</p><br/><p>Clang! Clang!</p><br/><p>The earth trembled. An orderly and steady marching sound could be heard. Soon, a group of formidable and burly warriors appeared. Most shocking were their mounts. Each of them was mounted on a hillsea beast.</p><br/><p>\"Your imprints have indeed granted you an immunity to all abilities, energy and physical abilities included. Therefore, I am rather curious whether you are also immune to pure physical damage, physical damage delivered without any abilities, without any energy, without any bloodline. Physical damage delivered by pure strength alone,\" Chen Feng said coldly. Finally, the expression of the tiger changed.</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" Chen Feng barked.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire barbarian squad charged forth. At this sight, the tiger's expression sank. A long time ago, during an era long gone, when the devil race had first encountered the barbarian, they had actually played the role of the barbarians' prey. As for the barbarians, they were natural hunters.</p><br/><p>\"Howl!\"</p><br/><p>\"Howl!\"</p><br/><p>The excited barbarians surrounded the tiger. Sacred Flame? Immunity? All the immunities the tiger had were pointless against the barbarians.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The battle erupted. Surprisingly, this was also an extremely one-sided oppression.</p><br/><p>The entire group of barbarians pressed the tiger down onto the ground before beating it up. Despite the formidable physical strength of the tiger, it still could not avoid the fate of being beaten up badly. Suddenly, a bright radiance erupted high up in the air. The one that had been hiding all along were finally making a move. The terrifying power pierced through space before piercing the tiger and shooting straight toward Chen Feng directly. That person was willing to sacrifice everything just to kill Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>The expressions of others changed greatly as they saw this. \"Careful!\" They had all been bracing themselves for the counterattack of the tiger, yet it was outside of all their expectations that the devil race would decide to sacrifice the tiger just to kill Chen Feng. Even the deputy president couldn't save Chen Feng in time as the strength behind this attack was definitely not any lower than his strength.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>That attack charged at Chen Feng, and Chen Feng locked his gaze on the sudden incoming attack. Was this the devil race as well? Nope. What the devil race could unleash they had unleashed. This was, instead, an attack from the ancient race.</p><br/><p>Indeed \u2026</p><br/><p>Those words of Chen Feng's earlier had indeed managed to drag the ancient race into this war as well. From their role as observers, the ancient race had now been pulled into this war as well.</p><br/><p>\"Since you are here, don't have any hope of leaving, then,\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, his hand was raised. A faint radiance started converging on his hand and coldly, he spat two words out: \"God Punisher!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An endless white bloomed. The entirety of Star City was enveloped by a scorching white as the terrifying radiance started spreading out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

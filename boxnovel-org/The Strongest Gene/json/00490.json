Rather, it referred to someone that was literally without a chest, only two bloody messes could be seen where the chest was supposed to be. It was clear that this devil race member here was an incomplete product. Moreover, from the dull expression in its gaze, it was clear that the intelligence of this devil race member here was somewhat lacking as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \"This is the devil prince?\"</p><br/><p>The technician analyzed the data. \"Nope. From the looks of it, there are still some other devil race members from Star City that have yet to awaken as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Chen Feng pondered. Everyone else started studying this devil race member as well.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like this devil race member is without its brain as well. When the other devil race members awakened, despite being somewhat sluggish in their thoughts, that was the result of their long hibernation. As for this fellow here, its gaze is truly empty, resembling those undead beasts greatly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone there was endlessly amazed. So they could actually manipulate the devil race's resurrection project in such a manner?</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>With a casual wave, Chen Feng destroyed this devil race member. Despite it having the appearance of a devil race member, such a method of awakening had caused this devil race member to pose zero threat. Moreover, it seemed like things would be hopeless for the remaining parts of this devil race member that had yet to awaken together with this devil race member here as well. If so, what about that so-called devil prince?</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>They all exchanged glances as they suddenly had an idea of what to do. If they were able to, in a similar manner, summon a part of the devil prince out first before destroying that summoned part, what would the fate of the devil prince be?</p><br/><p>\"Good idea.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's plan received their approval easily, and thus, numerous air purifiers were carried over.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The energy contained in the dust was all gathered. Occasionally, when the energy couldn't be gathered by the purifier, they would personally destroy the dust containing that energy before letting the air purifier absorb the energy. It did not take long for them to gather a sufficient amount of energy. These unknown energies were rather unique. Among these unknown energies, there were some that were different than others, as they actually possessed a certain degree of immunity.</p><br/><p>\"This should be the energy particles of that so-called devil prince, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"I think so.\" Chen Feng waved his hand. \"Time to deal with this prince.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They started restoring the energy particles. Here at this destroyed Star City, the Genetic Union started summoning the devil prince. At a certain location, the group of devil race members that had been about to leave suddenly looked in the direction of Star City.</p><br/><p>\"This is the power of the royal clan!\" With a disbelieving expression, he stared in the direction of Star City. \"Didn't the awakening of the prince fail? Why has this power appeared, then? Does the prince possess other trump cards?\"</p><br/><p>As he thought of this, he became excited. At the same moment, countless devil race members were looking in the same direction in excitement. Had the time finally come for the devil race to rise?</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>At this time, with a radiance swirling around them, Chen Feng and the rest watched on with aching hearts. It was beyond their expectations that the attractive force of this unique energy was actually so terrifying. Different from before, this time, all the dust within 50 kilometers of them was stirring.</p><br/><p>\"How powerful!\"</p><br/><p>\"Worthy of being the devil prince indeed.\"</p><br/><p>\"With such range, I suppose 99% of the energy particles can be recalled\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Get some people to move around to intercept those incoming energy particles. We can't allow them near.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>The Genetic Union executed their plan speedily.</p><br/><p>They had long been prepared for something like this. As such, the moment the body of the prince started reconstructing, they were already on their guard. Ultimately, the dust containing the energy particles were intercepted before they managed to arrive. The devil prince that was presently awakening was yet another incomplete devil race member.</p><br/><p>\"I wonder how much of the body will be awakened this time\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"The amount of energy particles we allowed entry is not too great. For the previous fellow, around 55% of its body was reconstructed. This time, roughly the same amount of energy particles were used. However, considering how powerful the prince is, the same amount of energy particles might actually consist of even a smaller portion of the prince's body.\"</p><br/><p>\"Perhaps 20%?\" they guessed. If it was merely 20% of the prince's body, they might be able to defeat it after its awakening. At a certain location, those devil race members that were observing this had an ominous feeling. They could feel that this was not a normal awakening. The energy particles were obviously insufficient for a complete awakening. Suddenly, one particular devil race member understood what was happening. Those damnable humans were actually trying to first awaken a part of their prince!</p><br/><p>\"Damn it!\" The expression of the devil race members changed greatly. \"Let's move in together!\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>\"Condense!\"</p><br/><p>\"Severe!\"</p><br/><p>\"Seal!\"</p><br/><p>The powerful devil race member pointed at the empty air three times in a row. At that, a terrifying power bloomed and forcefully sealed the gathering point for the awakening of their prince. Since a complete awakening was not possible, they might as well seal the awakening up temporarily. Regardless of whether the energy particles had dispersed worldwide, regardless of whether the energy particles were still in the form of dust, they could not allow those humans to awaken the body parts of their prince separately to be killed.</p><br/><p>After all, this prince signified the future of their devil race. And now, the awakening process initiated by Chen Feng's group immediately ended.</p><br/><p>\"The energy stopped gathering.\"</p><br/><p>\"Whatever. Just make do with this amount of energy particles, then.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>After the absorption stopped, the energy particles started combining to construct the body of the prince. Due to the limited amount of energy particles available, the entire body of the prince would not be constructed. Only a small portion of the body would be constructed. However, they had never expected that the portion would be so excessively small.</p><br/><p>The amount of energy particles sufficient to construct 55% of a normal devil race member's body was actually only equivalent to a single piece of the devil prince. This signified the prowess of that devil prince.</p><br/><p>That technician even chanted imposingly to add to the effect. \"Awaken, o glorious devil prince!\" Alas, beyond even their wildest imaginations, the first piece of the devil prince they had reconstructed was actually this particular piece.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They all looked at that long and cylindrical thing they had awoken, and they sank into silence. It was quite vexing that only a piece of the prince could be awakened. Why would it be this thing here out of all things that could appear? Was this a coincidence? Their gaze became odd.</p><br/><p>\"Yes\u2026 yes, it's a coincidence.\"</p><br/><p>The technician was speechless. Was this a coincidence? That had to be the case, right? It definitely had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng rubbed his head. \"This is not a coincidence.\"</p><br/><p>\"How is that possible?\" In an agitated manner, the technician explained, \"I truly never intended to summon this part of the prince's body. This is truly a coincidence! Although I am without a girlfriend, I am still straight!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Why was this guy getting so agitated?</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Chen Feng glanced at him before continuing, \"What I'm trying to say is that among the countless energy particles of the devil prince, these were the only particles whose dust was destroyed and the only particles of the prince we managed to catch in our filters.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Only now did the technician regained his calm, and he stated in a gratified manner, \"Like I said, I am straight.\"</p><br/><p>Kong Bai glanced at the technician coldly. What was the point of having a normal sexual orientation if the person in question couldn't get any girlfriends?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026Can we summon other parts of this prince?\"</p><br/><p>\"Let me give it a try.\" The technician tried gathering more energy particles, yet nothing happened. He checked the data and explained, \"The initially stirring dust has now stopped moving. Someone has seemingly interrupted us. Regardless of how we summon them, it is no longer of any use.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. \"The devil race has involved themselves, then?\" Well, this wasn't surprising, to be honest.</p><br/><p>The devil race would most certainly not allow the humans to mess around like this. Even if the prince couldn't awaken, they would not allow Chen Feng's group to summon the prince's body parts separately only to be killed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng felt rather regretful. \"What a pity.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else was gratified instead. \"This is already good enough.\"</p><br/><p>\"The devil prince is no longer a threat. Even in the future, when the devil race manages to awaken the prince, it will not be able to breed anymore,\" someone analyzed coldly.</p><br/><p>As the rest pondered his words, they found this agreeable. However, they couldn't help but wonder if one day, when the devil prince awoke to discover that it was no longer with its \"ding dong,\" would it be saddened? Mhm\u2026 what a sight would that be.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

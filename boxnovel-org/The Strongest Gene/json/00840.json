She could see that Chen Feng did not have much of an advantage. This was especially true since Luo Yuan was fighting like a madman who did not care about his life. Chen Feng had sustained quite a few injuries.</p><br/><p>Ming Yue shook her head. \u201cNo worries. With Xiao Ying around, he will be fine.\u201d If she was going to be worried about someone, it wouldn\u2019t be Chen Feng. She had personally witnessed Xiao Ying\u2019s strength, which was now one of Chen Feng\u2019s powerful trump cards. If Chen Feng encountered any actual danger, Xiao Ying would come out.</p><br/><p>Even in this situation, Chen Feng hadn\u2019t called Xiao Ying out. It was apparent that Chen Feng still had some confidence. He was also keeping Xiao Ying hidden for any sudden trump cards of Luo Yuan\u2019s. As such, there was no need for them to be worried about Chen Feng right now. That fellow was a deep schemer. Moreover, she doubted that Chen Feng would truly go crazy and lose his reason over Wang Yao.</p><br/><p>So what exactly was Chen Feng thinking? Perhaps Chen Feng was of the same opinion as her and wanted to buy more time?</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Terrifying energy fluctuations spread everywhere. The fight between Chen Feng and Luo Yuan became even more intense.</p><br/><p><em>A little bit more! </em>Luo Yuan was in ecstasy. He could clearly feel the power of misfortune from Chen Feng\u2019s punches, which were suffused with the new godly power. As time went on, his comprehension of the power of misfortune was growing.</p><br/><p><em>Haha. Thanks, Chen Feng. This idiot seems to have forgotten about the power of misfortune? Tsk tsk\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Each punch of Chen Feng\u2019s contained the power of misfortune. For Luo Yuan, with his Copy ability, this was extremely good news. Punch after punch, time after time. Luo Yuan wished he could simply lie on the ground and be beaten by Chen Feng so as to allow the power of misfortune to be sent into his body. He was enjoying this greatly and had zero intention of resisting Chen Feng\u2019s punches.</p><br/><p>However, he was clear that if he actually stopped resisting, Chen Feng would grow suspicious. Thus, Luo Yuan had to resist. He had to resist earnestly, with all his might.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had to give Chen Feng the impression that they were evenly matched. Thus, he unleashed numerous attacks on Chen Feng as they engaged in this bitter struggle. Inwardly, Luo Yuan kept track of the progress: 98%\u2026 98.1%\u2026 98.2%\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng punched without stop, and Luo Yuan forcefully suppressed his delight. During such a crucial moment, he could not allow Chen Feng any suspicions. He had to make sure Chen Feng kept beating him up.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Yet another punch landed.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The progress continued: 99.93%\u2026 99.98%\u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s heart throbbed. \u201cHere it comes!\u201d One more punch was all it would take! So long as this punch landed, he would succeed and could proceed to become a world controller. The sound of that punch was already by his ear. Come! Come! Luo Yuan was extremely agitated.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He focused his senses on the coming terrifying power as he prepared to welcome Chen Feng\u2019s final eruption and baptize himself in that attack. Unexpectedly, the sound of the coming fist suddenly vanished.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was somewhat dumbfounded. Stopped? He lifted his head and looked forward in a somewhat flabbergasted manner. Chen Feng had actually stopped his attack at such a crucial moment. Damn it! What in the world? Luo Yuan cursed inwardly. Was Chen Feng not a man?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Suddenly, Chen Feng smiled. \u201cBeing beaten up is very comfortable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Luo Yuan said fiercely. He was still feigning his anger, not willing to reveal his true goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe.\u201d Chen Feng smiled. \u201cHas your absorption of the power of misfortune gone smoothly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was instantly shocked. So Chen Feng had actually seen through him?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Luo Yuan feigned ignorance. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \u201cHehe. Since you enjoy being beaten up, let me lend you a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng strode forth and instantly appeared before Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A punch shot out. Instantly, a terrifying power bloomed.</p><br/><p>The strength of that attack caused Luo Yuan\u2019s heart to palpitate. Despite the strength of the attack, due to how much Luo Yuan was anticipating having the power of misfortune, he still decided not to erect any defenses.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The punch landed.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan coughed up a mouthful of blood. In his chest was a huge hole left behind by Chen Feng\u2019s penetrating punch. Blood poured out without stop. As for Luo Yuan\u2019s regenerative speed, it had actually greatly decreased.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was alarmed. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Since when had Chen Feng been so powerful? He was clearly still not at the true-god stage. What Luo Yuan didn\u2019t dare to believe was the fact that, in Chen Feng\u2019s final punch, there had been no power of misfortune. That\u2019s right, no misfortune had been contained within that punch, not even a tiny little bit. Chen Feng seemed to have completely removed the power of misfortune.</p><br/><p>Was that even possible? The power of misfortune had already seeped into him, becoming a part of his godly power. Separating the power of misfortune from his godly power should not be possible. Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan thought of something. This would only be possible if the power of misfortune was neutralized using the power of luck. Chen Feng had to utilize even more luck to neutralize the unique property of misfortune. This was the only way to completely remove the power of misfortune from his attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Luo Yuan was alarmed. It seemed like Chen Feng had indeed seen through him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled faintly. \u201cQuite simple, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s killing intent surged. \u201cWhy did you play along if you had already realized this?\u201d</p><br/><p>So all this while, Chen Feng had merely been playing along with him?</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Chen Feng beamed as he looked at Luo Yuan. \u201cWhat a perfect plan this was. How Could I not play along? It not only allowed you to partially obtain the power of misfortune, but it also allowed me to fuse with all your powers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s true aura erupted. His aura was now much stronger than it had been before.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly\u2026 a flawless power,\u201d Chen Feng muttered. His fake nascent soul had devoured a huge number of powers. To allow Chen Feng to beat him up, Luo Yuan had opted to use different powers each time he collided with Chen Feng. This had allowed Chen Feng a chance to fuse with all of Luo Yuan\u2019s powers. In this battle, Chen Feng was not the only person to have cooperated with his opponent\u2019s plan. Luo Yuan had also been cooperating with Chen Feng\u2019s plan. Both had similarly been putting on a play.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was extremely pleased. \u201cIf you were from the same era as me, you might even have been able to obtain something called an Oscar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s gaze was ice cold. This damnable Chen Feng!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He was brimming with anger. He had never expected the plan he was so proud of and confident in to actually be seen through by Chen Feng. When he had assumed that his plan was progressing smoothly, he had in fact been cooperating with Chen Feng\u2019s plan instead. This caused him an intense feeling of shame.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are courting death,\u201d Luo Yuan spat coldly.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \u201cThese words are what I should be saying to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chen Feng vanished. When he reappeared, he was already beside Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A punch landed.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s body arched into the shape of a bow from the punch as he coughed up blood like mad. Half his body even started dissolving into particles. If Luo Yuan hadn\u2019t forcefully activated his regenerative power, he would have died from that single attack. This strength\u2026 and this speed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Luo Yuan was afraid. He had never expected that, despite how little time had passed, Chen Feng\u2019s strength would grow to such an extent. This was way too powerful and way too astonishing.</p></div>\n</div>"}

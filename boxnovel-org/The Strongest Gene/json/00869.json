The two began to brawl. No energy was used, nor any godly power. Only pure physical power was used. This was the most primitive of fights. With a bang, a random hill collapsed. Occasionally, there were terrifying gasps and shouts resounding through the air as the voices and collisions began to sound even more intense. It was evident that this battle was nearing its climax.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>One mountain after another collapsed, destroying the few remaining mountains in this world. After a long time, the world regained its peace. After an even longer time, a figure slowly crawled out of a certain crater. This was Luo Yuan, and at present, he was wearing a rather sorry look.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026 Urghhh..\u201d</p><br/><p>He started vomiting. He was aware that, to the likes of Xu Fei, fighting was extremely exciting and intense. However, no matter how exciting and intense it got, Xu Fei couldn\u2019t have\u2026 hardened\u2026 right? After all, he had been fighting stark naked! Shouldn\u2019t it have been a hand-to-hand brawl? Why had Xu Fei equipped his \u201cweapon\u201d? Could one imagine what it felt like to be slapped by that \u201ciron rod\u201d in the midst of a battle? Moreover, there were even a couple of times where that \u201ciron rod\u201d had slapped Luo Yuan\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>Even worst was the fact that this slap was actually extremely painful! This slap to the face by someone at the level of Xu Fei had nearly smashed Luo Yuan\u2019s face into smithereens. This battle had truly been\u2026 too arduous\u2026 and bitter! He had also finally figured out why Xu Fei had appeared only now. If Xu Fei had appeared earlier, Luo Yuan would definitely have been able to easily kill him. Yet now\u2026 with Luo Yuan weakened from his previous fights\u2026</p><br/><p>Sigh. This battle had been way too hard. Luo Yuan had indeed won. Alas, it was a victory he had obtained by relying on his supreme clones. In fact, his fleshly body was at a similar level as Xu Fei\u2019s: the true-god level. Therefore, to obtain victory, he had condensed a clone to fight Xu Fei two against one.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the end result had been the destruction of more than 10 clones in a row. Luo Yuan\u2019s heart ached at the thought. How many clones had he wasted thus far? He couldn\u2019t even count anymore. What had happened to the absolute superiority he was supposed to have?</p><br/><p>He could no longer remember. After going through three battles back to back, he only felt extremely exhausted. He was in a rather bad situation. However, he knew that this had not ended. Indeed, shortly after he crawled out of the crater, before he could even rest, on top of a certain ruined mountain, he saw a familiar figure. This was a figure he hated greatly. After all, he was sure that everything was the work of this fellow. The tricky fighting methods and the vile combat styles were something only this fellow could think of!</p><br/><p>A familiar greeting sounded. \u201cIt has been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the one who was running around killing people disguised as Qin Hai?\u201d Luo Yuan asked with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was me.\u201d Slowly, that figure walked out of the ruined mountain. He was indeed Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one, disguised as Kong Bai, who killed those who didn\u2019t disfigure themselves was you as well?\u201d Luo Yuan asked with another sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was me,\u201d Chen Feng answered with a wide smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Luo Yuan shut his eyes. All this was the work of Chen Feng! Due to Kong Bai\u2019s act of killing those who did not disfigure themselves, he had neglected the truth about the Demonic Mirror. Due to Qin Hai killing people randomly, he had neglected the truth about the one and only swing of the sword Qin Hai was capable of. Step by step, Chen Feng had laid out the traps for him to walk through. This was truly quite excessive of him.</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan sighed. \u201cIs there a need for this? You wasted so much energy setting me up, wasting the time you could have used to cultivate instead. This is the same as weakening both of us together. What is the point of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hai, Kong Bai, and Xu Fei had indeed dragged Luo Yuan down to buy time for Chen Feng to cultivate. After all, in this unique world of time, every second could be the equivalent of several years. Therefore, this method was capable of weakening Luo Yuan and increasing Chen Feng\u2019s strength at the same time.</p><br/><p>At the same time, this also signified that Chen Feng had had quite a limited amount of time to cultivate. With this, Chen Feng\u2019s growth hadn\u2019t been as great as it could have been despite having weakened Luo Yuan. The only thing it accomplished was annoying Luo Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Chen Feng said with a smile. \u201cIn any case, I have already reached the high-tier true-god stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s face fell. \u201cWhat?\u201d High-tier true god? How was this possible?</p><br/><p>Based on his deductions, Chen Feng should only have reached mid-tier true god at most. And with Chen Feng running around scheming, he should be even weaker, perhaps at the level of a beginner-tier true god. But now, after running around disguised as Qin Hai and Kong Bai to kill people, he had still managed to become a high-tier true god? How was that even possible?</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan found this hard to believe. However, there was no point in lying to him. After all, this was the final battle. All lies were pointless at this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime.\u201d Chen Feng smiled happily. \u201cHave you forgotten about a certain someone called Duma? He was capable of controlling time, even if his control was rather weak. Unfortunately for you, he was also here when this world descended into chaos,\u201d said Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuma? That damnable undying old turtle?\u201d Luo Yuan\u2019s heart jolted. That fellow had indeed arrived here as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Chen Feng said calmly. \u201cInitially, he was only able to exert a weak control over time. However, did you forget about his particular race\u2019s unique talent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnique talent of his race\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Luo Yuan recalled something. That so-called unique talent was precisely that ability where they could trap their opponents in time and outlive them. This was the unique talent of the scarab race!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Luo Yuan\u2019s heart started to palpitate. \u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d With a smile, Chen Feng continued, \u201cThat ability was used on me. And thus, with the amplification effect, combined with the chaotic time of this world, I was able to cultivate to my heart\u2019s content, reaching the high-tier true-god stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan shook his head. \u201cNo, something is not right. If that were the case, how did you leave the imprisonment? How could you have outlived Duma?\u201d He remembered that within that prison of time, even suicide was not an option.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I was unable to outlive him.\u201d Chen Feng shrugged. \u201cTherefore, he planted something within his body that would slowly kill him. Before entering the prison, we had already prepared everything. And thus\u2026 as time passed, he died, setting me free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan was speechless. Another miscalculation on his part. He had miscalculated everything! He had made a mistake when facing Kong Bai and the other two, and another when facing Chen Feng. That Duma had pushed Chen Feng to the high-tier true-god stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is quite a pity. Initially, I planned to reach peak true god directly.\u201d Chen Feng appeared quite regretful. \u201cHowever, that would have required too much time, and I have no confidence in that. I might truly have died of old age in there before I accomplished that. Therefore, I had to give up on it. However, being a high-tier true god is already sufficient to fight you. Am I right?\u201d With a smile, Chen Feng continued, \u201cA battle with the current you is definitely doable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yuan\u2019s heart trembled. Indeed\u2026 Right now, he had been weakened so much that he was pretty much equivalent to a high-tier true god. What a fine Chen Feng! To advance gradually and entrench himself with every step he took, for his scheming to have been able to reach this far! Luo Yuan\u2019s act of attacking this world had been completely unexpected. Chen Feng had obviously been unprepared for that. Yet Chen Feng had still been able to act accordingly, to begin laying out his schemes to reach the present situation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

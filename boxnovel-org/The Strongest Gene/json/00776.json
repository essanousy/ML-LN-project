If one were to say that the gap between awakened ones and resonators was a gap of a hundred times, and that the gap between resonators and apostles was also a hundred times, between apostles and gods, the gap would be so large the word \u201castronomical\u201d would be apt to describe it.</p><br/><p>A god was, after all, a god. Under normal circumstances, if an apostle wanted to try to ascend to godhood, they would have to increase one\u2019s strength to level 10, 15, 20, or perhaps something even greater. Only this would make it possible.</p><br/><p>Naturally, this would merely grant the apostle the qualification to attempt. One ought to know that even though the Sin God had indeed opened the channel of godhood ascension to all, the last apostle that had taken the trial had been a level 36 apostle, which was an extremely terrifying level. Ultimately, that apostle had successfully become a god, transcending the millions upon millions of life-forms.</p><br/><p>Godhood ascension was the dream of all apostles. Nevertheless, this was an extremely long path. Therefore, it had never crossed their minds that Chen Feng would be qualified to take on this challenge as well. They had never expected that Chen Feng had already threaded upon the same path they were all threading, and had even reached the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has actually reached this height?\u201d The minor god was filled with a melancholic feeling. The ultimate destination of every outstanding apostle would definitely be the trial of godhood ascension. However, even if the apostle passed the trial, he would still be tied to his initial god, thus becoming a subsidiary god. The minor god had never expected to obtain such a subsidiary god, as he himself was a minor god, the lowest of gods. One could say that he wasn\u2019t even qualified to be a subsidiary god himself, let alone gain one. When it came to apostles, he only had one.</p><br/><p>A subsidiary god? He had never dared to dream of having one. Yet now\u2026 Things were about to become rather fascinating.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter seven days, the godhood trial will be activated on the Bamboo Isles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing his words, Zero left. His words had instantly caused the atmosphere here, which had been rather still, to become filled with noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cActivating the godhood trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo yet another godhood position is going to be challenged?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA storm is about to start on the Bamboo Isles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Zero actually activated a trial specifically for Chen Feng. Good lord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Chen Feng is a mere resonator. Therefore, this trial will probably be different than in the past. After all, each trial has different difficulty levels. In that case, the number of participants\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The mere thought was sufficient to plant fear in them. In fact, the activation of the godhood trial signified that anyone meeting the requirements would be able to participate in the trial. In the past, only the strongest of apostles had been able to join such a trial. Regular people had had no hope of getting involved.</p><br/><p>Yet now\u2026 Chen Feng? A mere resonator? It was quite likely that a huge number of apostles would participate in this challenge. The number of participants this time would most definitely surpass all imaginations.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned. \u201cSomething seems off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, he had been quite pleased that this major god had such high expectation for him. However, after gaining more understanding of the so-called godhood trial, his keen senses told him that this was definitely not as simple as it seemed. After all, it was as the others had said. Godhood trials were the supreme glory for all capable of participating in them, success or failure.</p><br/><p>However, that would also be equivalent to the final battle. The sole reason that this was the final battle was that, for any single person, that person could only attempt this trial once in his entire life. The moment one failed, they would forever be unable to become a god. Moreover, a godhood trial could, in a way, be understood as a tribulation of sorts, a tribulation that everyone else could partake in as well as the selected individual.</p><br/><p>Anyone could join, yet only a single person would successfully ascend. Therefore, was this godhood trial one truly activated for his sake? Or perhaps\u2026As Chen Feng looked at the excited apostles, he suddenly understood. He had unknowingly become a cannon fodder of a certain someone.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain location, a certain petite figure was lying down on a bench.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Looks like Zero still agreed to our condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled and patted the shoulder of a certain kneeling figure before her. \u201cYour identity is rather unique. Therefore, it would be rather difficult to get a godhood trial activated for your sake. This trial being activated for Chen Feng will be the perfect opportunity for you. He is a mere resonator. Therefore, the difficulty of this trial will definitely be rather low. What you need to do is defeat all the apostles, then ascend to godhood,\u201d she gently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d the kneeling figure loudly answered.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a different location, an old man was filled with doubt. \u201cWhat does Zero\u2019s mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zero had obviously rejected their request, yet he had activated a trial for Chen Feng. Why? Could it be that Zero had agreed to the others\u2019 request?</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s gaze was filled with hope. The activation of a trial was too rare an occasion. Even the descendants of the gods would only have a single shot at ascension. In a way, it was their luck to be living in such a unique era where mortals could ascend to godhood. Everyone who was capable could participate in the challenge.</p><br/><p>That was why every single apostle capable of participating in a trial was incomparably precious to their respective gods. The truth was that the difficulty of each activated trial was directly related to the person taking the trial. This time, with Chen Feng, a mere resonator, being the person taking the trial\u2026 All the gods were wild with joy, since the difficulty level would most certainly be lower.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng himself hadn\u2019t the faintest idea just how far-reaching the effects of this trial would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Feng\u2026\u201d The old man smiled. \u201cLittle Jie, this time, remember to give Chen Feng more care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered the middle-aged man called Little Jie.</p><br/><p>The old man calmly said, \u201cSince we are snatching his godhood from him, we have to show some sincerity, right? However, although the difficulty level will be lower this time, there are still a lot of things you have to pay attention to, especially that old witch\u2019s lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Not long after, the news of the trial spread everywhere. Countless gods started to get involved. There was nothing they could do about the trials that were activated for the stronger apostles. After all, their descendants might not be able to handle the challenges presented by trials at that level. However, a trial at this level, a trial based on Chen Feng\u2019s level? Some gods analyzed that Chen Feng\u2019s present strength should be equivalent to a level 10 apostle, rather similar to a veteran apostle.</p><br/><p>Reaching this height with his identity as a resonator was completely unheard of. However, there was still quite a gap from this level to the level of the strongest of apostles.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis shall be my stage,\u201d a certain level 21 apostle said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not for sure,\u201d said a certain level 20 apostle that was not willing to fall behind. This was an incredibly rare chance, a chance that they were not willing to miss. As for that Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity. I suppose he has yet to realize that he has been made into cannon fodder, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pitiful little fella.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he can unleash power equivalent to a level 10 apostle, this will still be too difficult for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpare his life in this challenge. That can be considered a way of repaying him for activating the trial for all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The apostles all reached an agreement. Regardless of who it was that ascended in the end, they would spare Chen Feng\u2019s life. They were the descendants of gods and were foreordained to become gods in the future. As far as they were concerned, it was only a matter of time before they were gods. Therefore, even if this was a competition between them, they still needed to maintain their connections with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is roughly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The minor god sighed after he explained all this to Chen Feng. When he had first found out that Chen Feng had activated a trial, he had been rather excited as well. However, when he found out the truth behind all this, he was thoroughly stunned. Those damnable gods\u2019 descendants!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled happily. \u201cWhat an interesting trial. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can still smile?\u201d The minor god\u2019s head ached. \u201cThose gods\u2019 descendants are also apostles. However, their innate bloodlines have ensured that they are all incomparably powerful. All of them are already above level 20 apostles now. I should have thought of this earlier. Only the joint persuasion of those gods could have convinced Zero to activate the trial for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The minor god was vexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this good?\u201d Chen Feng was as calm as ever. \u201cIf I had to rely on myself, I don\u2019t know how long it would have taken to actually become the strongest apostle and activate the godhood trial through the regular channel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut those fellows\u2026\u201d The minor god was extremely anxious. At this point, he was regretting helping Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey do not matter.\u201d Suddenly, Chen Feng asked, \u201cI seem to recall that gods are not allowed to kill each other, and if there are any conflicts, a ruling from the Sin God is to be requested, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the minor good answered. This was something he was extremely clear on. Otherwise, the minor gods would have long died at the hands of those major gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Chen Feng gazed in the direction of the Bamboo Isles, seemingly exceptionally pleased. \u201cI no longer have anything to worry about. Next, let us all take a good look at who, exactly, is actually cannon fodder here.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

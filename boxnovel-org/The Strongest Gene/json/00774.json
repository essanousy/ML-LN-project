And who is your god?\u201d that apostle asked in a cold tone. \u201cWith this method, you are trying to make a fool out of all the gods in existence? Hehe\u2026\u201d Only the apostles could analyze this with a clear mind. The minds of all the gods here had already been muddled by the \u201cnumber 1 resonator,\u201d \u201cfuture strongest apostle,\u201d and \u201cstrongest god\u201d that Chen Feng had been harping about. Only the apostles were still able to see clearly and analyze this matter. All along, this farce had been nothing but a joke.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Killing intent surged out and pervaded the air. The killing intent emanated by the more than 100 gods here caused even the gods of Mountcarve City to be afraid that this city would accidentally get destroyed by these furious gods.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all attention was focused on Chen Feng. Regardless of the apostles or gods, they all required an explanation. Due to Chen Feng, more than 100 gods and around 300 to 400 apostles had gathered here. As for the number of resonators, it was countless. They all needed an explanation.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Terrifying pressure descended. Such an oppressive mood was sufficient to cause even a minor god to collapse. And yet Chen Feng remained calm. He had already entered an extremely unique state with his completed fake nascent soul. The gods\u2019 so-called oppressive auras were nothing more special to him than regular auras.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at that apostle. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShi Yong, apostle of the Chill Wind God,\u201d he proudly said, evidently pleased with his accomplishment of identifying this farce before all the gods and apostles here. He hoped that with the reputation he had brought his god, perhaps his god would obtain even more believers in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your strength?\u201d Chen Feng asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 9 apostle,\u201d Shi Ying said confidently. After all, his god wasn\u2019t one of those newly ascended minor gods. Rather, his god was a true major god. As for him, he was a formidable existence that had existed since the Primordial Era back then. He had only reached this realm after several millennia of cultivation.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \u201cIn short, you are an existence incomparably close to a god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Shi Ying started radiating arrogance. Even though there was still a large gap between one at the peak of the apostle realm and a god, it would still be correct to consider such an apostle as an existence closest to a god. And in the future, after reaching level 10 apostle, he might even be able to try ascending into godhood to become a subsidiary god of the Chill Wind God. This was the greatest accomplishment for an apostle.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Chen Feng was extremely satisfied with his answer. \u201cWell then\u2026\u201d He stood up and fixed his gaze on Shi Yong. \u201cDo battle with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shi Yong thought he had heard wrong. As for the observers around them, their eyes went wide as well. Challenge? What joke was this? Shi Yong was a level 9 apostle!</p><br/><p>As the apostle of a major god, as a formidable existence that had cultivated for so many years, even among apostles, this Shi Yong was comparably powerful. As for Chen Feng, he was nevertheless still a mere resonator.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you doubt me?\u201d Chen Feng chuckled. \u201cAll your doubts are based on the assumption that I am stuck at this realm due to my poor talent, that I am exploiting these gods to help me break through. However\u2026 I am sorry. I do not require such help. The only reason I want to enter the apostle realm is so that I can become stronger. Nevertheless, even without breaking through, I, Chen Feng, am still the strongest of believers, still a legend, even though I am a mere resonator. I am still the strongest existence below gods. Poor talent?\u201d A look of disdain appeared on Chen Feng\u2019s face. \u201cCome have a taste of my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng took a single step forward.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Formidable godly power surged out as his aura intensified.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is serious in the challenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the observers around then were shocked. One ought to know that even though Chen Feng was a legend, his achievement of defeating apostles as a resonator had merely come about from him defeating the weakest of apostles, those novice apostles. He had been able to make his name with that feat due to the huge gap between a resonator and an apostle. Yet now he was challenging the powerful Shi Yong.</p><br/><p>Shi Yong\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent. \u201cYou are courting death.\u201d He was truly furious at being challenged by a weak resonator.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng merely sneered. \u201cHehe. Do you dare or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shi Yong was furious. If he were to shrink from such a challenge, he would be too embarrassed to continue living.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me then,\u201d Chen Feng said without a trace of politeness.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>Abruptly, his body soared.</p><br/><p>Shi Yong sneered. \u201cHmph.\u201d Next, terrifying godly power surged out of him. At their level, there was no need to exchange numerous moves to decide on the victor. Generally, a single full-power exchange would be sufficient. With a single exchange, the weak and the strong would be clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are truly doing it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas this Chen Feng gone crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>What kind of courage did a resonator need to have to dare challenge a level 9 apostle? The gap between them wasn\u2019t merely a gap of realms. Between them, an absolute suppression in terms of godly power existed. The godly powers used by them were at completely different levels due to their difference in realm. With such a difference, how was the fight supposed to proceed?</p><br/><p>\u201cApostles generally use a higher-tiered godly power\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. Furthermore, this is the godly power of a major god. I seem to recall Chen Feng\u2019s god being an unknown minor god that is pitifully weak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is he supposed to win then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he is indeed incapable of victory. However, putting forth a stunning fight to his death is, after all, better than being killed by the gods due to his trickeries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone sighed. If Chen Feng were to die in combat in such manner, his fame would surely spread far and wide. As their thoughts reached this point, everyone focused their attention on the sky. There, Chen Feng\u2019s attack was descending. Even though his attack looked rather extraordinary, it was nevertheless still the power of a level 10 resonator.</p><br/><p>As for Shi Yong\u2019s attack, it truly looked overwhelming. Instantly, the power of a major god bloomed. With an astonishing aura, he collided with Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The collision resulted in a terrifying explosion, and a bright red radiance engulfed the entire world.</p><br/><p>An alarmed cry sounded. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone found with astonishment that the expected scene of Shi Ying instantly killing Chen Feng did not appear. Rather, the opposite happened. Chen Feng\u2019s terrifying aura had instantly crushed the entirety of Shi Yong\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>A mouthful of blood was coughed up. Immediately, the godly power surrounding Shi Yong collapsed. That terrifying attack of Chen Feng\u2019s seemed capable of piercing through the heavens and earth, and it destroyed everything Shi Yong had unleashed before heading toward his forehead. Just like that, the faint red radiance that was Chen Feng\u2019s attack halted and hovered right before Shi Yong\u2019s forehead. As of this moment, the entire world seemed to have lapsed into silence.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s cold voice echoed about. \u201cLevel 9 apostle? Nothing special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shi Yong stared at Chen Feng, his face unbelieving. Cold sweat poured out of his body without stop. He had never expected that this fellow before him was actually this strong. All the apostles were overwhelmed with shock. Even the gods that had initially been furious were stunned.</p><br/><p>A resonator\u2026 could be so powerful? Plan? Poor talent? Making use of the gods? What a joke. When one was this strong, what was the point of talking about so-called talent? He had not needed to explain himself. He had not needed to argue the accusation. He had only needed to challenge Shi Yong, and all accusations collapsed with the result of his fight. Just like Chen Feng had said, he was a legend.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The curse made by the Sin God before his death was also his final trump card. That black radiance streaked past the horizon and, under the shocked gazes of the various gods, hit Chen Feng, entering his body and vanishing without a trace. That\u2019s right, it vanished. This seemingly terrifying curse did not seem to do anything to Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods were in a daze from the extreme shock. The things they had seen today had truly shocked them. This was especially true for the final scene, where Chen Feng erupted with an astonishing might and killed Ye. Heavens, that was Ye! Even more terrifying was the fact that the curse Ye had made before his death, his final trump card, was seemingly useless? That bizarre black radiance had no effect on Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Not quite. The gods all opened their eyes wide and focused their gazes on Chen Feng. Next, they saw that when the black radiance entered Chen Feng\u2019s body, an expression of comfort appeared on Chen Feng\u2019s face. And next\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>An astonishing aura roiled out. This\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMajor god!\u201d the gods cried out in alarm. What was happening with Chen Feng presently was the sign of one breaking through into the major god stage. In short, Chen Feng had made use of this to directly break through to the major god stage? The various gods did not know what to say. They knew that the era was going to change yet again.</p><br/><p>Ye was dead, as were the various major gods. Only a single recently broken through major god was left behind. Despite this, this major god possessed extremely terrifying strength. This was Chen Feng. The various gods trembled, not daring to move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><br/><p>An expression of utmost comfort was plastered on Chen Feng\u2019s face. He had finally broken through. Naturally, the breakthrough didnt refer to himself. Rather, it was the Misfortune Goddess. Due to the redistribution of godly power to Spirit alone so that they could deal with Ye, the Misfortune Goddess\u2019s had growth stunted. That was why she hadn\u2019t been able to recover to the major god stage. Fortunately, before Ye\u2019s death, he had given them a huge gift.</p><br/><p>God\u2019s curse? As far as the Misfortune Goddess was concerned, this was an extremely helpful tonic. As such, she was able to instantly reach the major god stage after absorbing this curse. And now, even though Chen Feng still appeared to be a elementary god, within him were two major gods whose strength couldn\u2019t be measured with conventional methods. Chen Feng stood up, his gaze slowly sweeping past the various gods around him.</p><br/><p>Among these gods, the strongest was at a peak journeyman god. At present, all of them were prostrating before Chen Feng. In this era, hierarchy was extremely important. As Chen Feng realized that they were all prostrating before him, he blanked momentarily. So it turned out his plan to kill Ye had indeed succeeded.</p><br/><p>He had truly reached this height, had truly killed the Sin God, becoming an expert of this era. Apart from that, all the other major gods were dead as well. And thus, he was now the strongest among these gods. However, he was able to calm his surging emotions shortly.</p><br/><p>Even though it might appear like he was the strongest god, he was clear that the only reason he had even been able to defeat Ye was due to the various major gods serving as cannon fodder earlier, the Sin God\u2019s fear of the Creation God, and the injuries Ye had suffered at the hands of that silhouette.</p><br/><p>For now, he needed to first stabilize everything. First, he had to put his strength in order, then find an opportunity to get rid of that silhouette. At that time, he would truly be the strongest of this era, a supreme god.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may stand,\u201d Chen Feng said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need a new leader,\u201d Chen Feng said nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We are willing to follow your lead,\u201d the various gods said without hesitation. They pondered slightly and continued, \u201cAs for the believers\u2026 we are also willing to hand them over.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something they had to do. What kind of person was this Chen Feng? A lot of people actually had a slight idea now. When they heard that Chen Feng was actually a human, the gods with human believers trembled in fear. They were not willing to die for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \u201cThere is no need for that. Believers are, after all, believers, not murderers. Since you guys are gods they have voluntarily selected, just allow them to continue with their faith. There is no need to think about this too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various gods were overjoyed. However, right at this instant, a figure appeared in the distance.</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng\u2019s heart jolted. This figure\u2026 It couldn\u2019t be that his lies had indeed transformed into reality again, right? This wasn\u2019t something left behind by the Creation God, right? Chen Feng\u2019s heart trembled.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, that figure revealed itself in front of them soon after. This figure turned out to be a major god Chen Feng was extremely familiar with: the Forest Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cMajor god?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hearts of the various gods thumped. So there was another major god alive? Oh, true, she hadn\u2019t been around when they were ganging up on Ye.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some gods were tempted and walked to the Forest Goddess. \u201cI am willing to follow you, Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Evidently, not all the gods liked Chen Feng. After all, his identity as a human was truly somewhat too shocking to them. Moreover, compared to a new major god like Chen Feng, the Forest Goddess, who had been a major god for countless years, a primordial god, seemed like a much better choice. And thus, a large number of gods immediately abandoned Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng had a faint smile on his face. These fellows\u2026 \u201cYou guys swore an oath earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess walked over slowly. As for the various gods, they all stood behind her, not daring to say anything. However, some of their gazes were already filled with some sort of pride when they looked at Chen Feng. Evidently, they were of the opinion that this was the correct choice. Mhm\u2026 At the very least, this was what they believed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been a while,\u201d Chen Feng said. The last time they met had been during the death of the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You two are truly adept at having fun,\u201d the Forest Goddess said grudgingly, \u201cEven if you two wanted to play, why not play at home? Why must you two drag me in as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Evidently, she had already noticed a familiar power about Chen Feng: luck.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was still together with that Luck Goddess. Moreover, their relationship seemed even more intimate now. If that was the case, what exactly happened back then? Had they been playing around with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe indeed died.\u201d Chen Feng smiled. \u201cThis Spirit is the Spirit that accompanied me for many years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess had a pensive look when she heard this. Consciousness separation! This thought surfaced almost immediately. What a fine Chen Feng! Was this how he had tricked her back then as well? She shook her head. In terms of strength, she was naturally stronger than Chen Feng, past and present. Even though Chen Feng had killed Ye, the Forest Goddess was clear that Chen Feng wasn\u2019t particularly powerful.</p><br/><p>However, the last time they had met, Chen Feng had still been a normal human. Yet now\u2026 Was this the potential of the human race? Or perhaps it was this Chen Feng that was abnormal?</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you can reach your goal.\u201d The Forest Goddess sighed and left noiselessly. She had no intention of getting involved in Chen Feng\u2019s matters, nor was she interested in competing against him. As such, she drifted away to continue being a major god that was not bothered with the affairs of the world. After all, this was how she had survived the calamity that befell the various major gods earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks,\u201d Chen Feng replied calmly. As for the gods that had switched camps when the Forest Goddess appeared, they were all dumbstruck. Holy shit\u2026 So it turned out that these two knew each other? And from their conversation, it seemed like they had even done something naughty together?</p><br/><p>The gods all collapsed emotionally. If they had known this, would there have been a need for all this? Holy shit, they had believed that the Forest Goddess was here to fight for authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u201d They looked at the Chen Feng with cold expressions, their scalps going numb.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, hand over the believers,\u201d Chen Feng said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this pained them greatly, they were relieved as well. At the very least, they could stay alive. Chen Feng wasn\u2019t bothered about what they were thinking. His gaze was focused on the sky. Even though he was already the lord of these gods, even though he was already the strongest on this piece of land, he was aware who his actual opponent was. Beyond that sky was a certain shiny existence that was incomparably terrifying.</p><br/><p>Who\u2026 exactly are you?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

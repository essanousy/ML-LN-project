The stone was in the middle of them, yet none of them dared to approach it. None of them were idiots. Chen Feng's actions earlier had indeed frightened them. This was obviously something they all wanted. Thus, why had Chen Feng avoided it? Perhaps\u2026 there was some problem with this thing?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng spoke earnestly. \"Hehe. There's no problem whatsoever. Before this, I seemed to have eaten something bad, and my tummy is feeling quite bad. Therefore, I have decided to leave first.\"</p><br/><p>The rest laughed dryly. How fake.</p><br/><p>Thomas asked the main point: \"Why did this thing suddenly charge at you, then?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shrugged. \"I have no idea. Perhaps\u2026 due to my looks?\"</p><br/><p>Thomas's expression stiffened. \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Smiling, Chen Feng continued, \"Why is there a need to ask so many questions? In any case, it has already been trapped by you guys, right? I suppose you four should start discussing a way to take this stone down. As for me, I am not joining in on the fun. Hehe\u2026\" Chen Feng retreated silently.</p><br/><p>Thomas and the rest exchanged glances, at a loss as to what to do now. To stop Chen Feng, at least two of them would be required. If that happened, the other two could very well monopolize the stone for themselves. They also needed to take into consideration the fact that this stone could move by itself. Nobody knew what would happen if they truly did split up to chase after Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they had no choice but to watch on as Chen Feng left. Even though Chen Feng's earlier actions had indeed planted some fear in them, this did not outweigh the benefit the stone could bring them should they obtain it. Furthermore, they did not have to take the risk of using the stone personally. If they sacrificed it to their respective gods, that would be sufficient.</p><br/><p>At the thought of this, they all calmed down and prepared for the fight over the stone. However, right at this instant, the earth started trembling. A terrifying beast seemed to be on the verge of appearing. Suddenly, the entire ground beneath them became filled with mud, and the sky changed color.</p><br/><p>Numerous terrifying mutated beasts appeared.</p><br/><p>Howl\u2014</p><br/><p>Thomas sneered. \"Again?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it seems different this time.\" Wealthy Zhao had a solemn expression. There, on the edge of their vision, a terrifying leopard could be seen. Its entire body was emanating a bizarre radiance, a radiance that was an aura belonging to a resonator. This fellow was actually a beast at the resonance realm. Moreover, for an unknown reason, it had fully recovered its power of resonance.</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible!\" Thomas howled. \"I have been cultivating frantically since the moment the primordial started to descend, yet my full strength has yet to recover even now. How has a mere beast here recovered before me?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The rest were speechless as well. Even Chen Feng, who had left earlier, was forced back by this wave of beasts.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous beasts appeared, completely surrounding this place. A true resonator beast and several dozen awakened beasts\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Damn it.\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions were unsightly. They weren't bothered by the awakened beasts. However, the resonator beast\u2026</p><br/><p>Thomas's eyes gleamed coldly. \"These animals have chosen quite an excellent time to appear huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"Spirit\u2026\" Chen Feng called inwardly.</p><br/><p>\"Here,\" Spirit replied softly. \"If my deduction is correct, these beasts are probably here due to that stone and are being controlled by that stone using a unique method. Their real goal is to force you back here.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"Indeed.\" This fellow truly had a consciousness. Seeing as it was willing to pay any price for the sake of fusing with him, the true reason was probably not as simple as increasing Chen Feng's strength after the fusion.</p><br/><p>The leopard howled. Instantly, the several dozen awakened beasts around them swarmed Chen Feng's group.</p><br/><p>Thomas's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Courting death!\"</p><br/><p>Mere awakened beasts were nothing for them. Alas, just as they started attacking the awakened beasts, the mysterious stone suddenly moved and broke out of the weak barrier.</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The mysterious stone charged out, its goal once again Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Everyone's expression changed greatly. \"Not good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop it!\" Wu Liang howled.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the timing this stone had selected to act so ingenious, so ingenious that everyone barely missed it and could only watch on blankly as it rushed to fuse into Chen Feng's body\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng slanted his body and once again barely dodged the stone.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>He evaded it? Once again, he evaded it?</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances, doubt in their eyes. Once again, he had done the same thing!</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The stone charged at Chen Feng once again. Thomas and the rest tried to stop it, but once again, they barely missed the stone, as the beasts around them were always coincidentally in their way. This stone was still as ingenious with its timing as ever. Or perhaps it would be more apt to say that this stone was extremely good at manufacturing the perfect opportunity for it to act.</p><br/><p>Alas, all of this seemed ineffective against Chen Feng. And thus, in the middle of the lake, amid the chaotic battlefield, four resonators frantically chased after the stone while the stone incessantly chased after Chen Feng, with Chen Feng avoiding it time and time again.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. Even the leopard was dumbfounded at this.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The order it had received was to not attack the young man called Chen Feng, as this fellow was seemingly the destined chosen son of heaven. If so, why was this fellow dodging without stop? The leopard could not understand this. Perhaps this was what made the chosen son of heaven so special?</p><br/><p>Ultimately, by the time all the awakened beasts there were killed, everyone there was thoroughly exhausted. The four resonators were all panting heavily. They'd had to chase after the stone while killing those beasts, causing this exhaustion. As for that stone, it was presently floating in the air, seemingly contemplating something. As for Chen Feng, after being chased after for so long, he was incredibly exhausted as well. Turning around, he gazed at the distant stone.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the atmosphere there became tranquil. It appeared very bizarre yet awkward at the same time. Thomas and the rest had dumbstruck expressions, as none of them had imagined that their competition over this stone would turn out this way in the end.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The stone started glowing. Seeing this, Thomas and the rest became nervous. As for Chen Feng, his scalp felt numb, his tenses stretched taut.</p><br/><p>Wu Liang looked at Chen Feng. \"Erm\u2026 do you still not plan to give us any sort of explanation? If you insist on not explaining, I will watch on as you fuse with the stone. Without us stopping it, you are definitely not as fast as that stone.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered. \"Can you bear with the thought of that happening, though?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Liang and the rest had pained expressions on their faces. Testing Chen Feng with a treasure with the aura of a god lingering on it? They were truly incapable of bearing with that.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Once again, the stone shone.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng inhaled deeply. \"Fine. The only reason I have been avoiding it is because I recognized this stone earlier. It is indeed an item of a god, yet it is not the treasure we all thought of. Rather, it signifies charming and devouring! All the beasts here are under its control. Perhaps its true goal is to lure all resonators here and then devouring all the resonators to increase its strength. If I truly fused with it\u2026 hehehe.\" Chen Feng concluded with a sneer. As the rest heard this, their bodies chilled. Such a thing existed?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

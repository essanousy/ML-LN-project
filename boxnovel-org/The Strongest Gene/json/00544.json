The aurora reagent was a mystical gene reagent created by Chen Feng. This gene reagent was classified as a gene virus, yet in Chen Feng's hand, it had been transformed into an extremely powerful trump card. This time, rather than using it himself, Chen Feng had used it on Lu Hun.</p><br/><p>The reason for this course of action was simple. It was for the sake of creating an otherwise nonexistent probability. Toward feats with no chance of success, Luck Aura could only employ brute force. However, if this gene virus was used to alter Lu Hun's state and create a probability that could be exploited, things would be simpler.</p><br/><p>An example was what was happening currently. Even if Lu Hun was now even more powerful than he had previously been, so powerful that he seemed unrivaled, the aurora reagent had taken effect. This was the very gene reagent that had been transformed into an extremely godly gene reagent by Chen Feng. Despite the numerous benefits this gene reagent granted the user, it was still ultimately a gene virus.</p><br/><p>It seemed like, as time passed, a lot of people had already forgotten what virus mode was. This was especially true for the effects of the aurora reagent, a gene reagent that could select random genes within the user's body to destroy at any time. Moreover, this effect was permanent. If it wasn't for the existence of Chen Feng's Myriad Illusions and his Luck Aura, he wouldn't even dare use this gene reagent on himself. As for Lu Hun?</p><br/><p>Hehe.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The killer cubes descended upon them. Everyone looked at the hastened cubes in despair, unable to think of a single solution. Alas, right when the cubes landed on them\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>A flash of green appeared and the cubes vanished. Everyone blanked.</p><br/><p>?</p><br/><p>Lu Hun was dumbstruck as well. Gone? How was this possible? Was this the trump card of Gou Li's trio? Lu Hun frowned before waving his hand. With that, several cubes reappeared, surrounded them, and once again closed in upon them. In his present state, these people weren't even qualified to struggle when he wanted to kill them.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The green cubes neared them. Yet again, alarming everyone, the moment the cubes were about to land on them, they vanished.</p><br/><p>????</p><br/><p>Lu Hun's eyes widened.</p><br/><p>This time, he had been able to get a clear look. These green strings that had formed the cubes had transformed into countless green particles before vanishing. The cubes hadn't been blocked. Rather, they had directly ruptured. What was going on? Lu Hun felt doubtful.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>As he was about to check out what was happening, he found with astonishment that among his fingers, one of them was slowly dissipating amid the air. Suddenly, the entire finger ruptured.</p><br/><p>!!!</p><br/><p>This time, Lu Hun was truly frightened. What was it this time?</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the world of green started trembling. Lu Hun's will and body were heavily injured, so this world of green became unstable. Lu Hun's expression sank as he forcefully stabilized this world. Alas, the sight before his eyes seemed to be vanishing gradually as well.</p><br/><p>An alarmed expression appeared on Lu Hun's face. \"My eyes!\" He could clearly feel that he had lost his sight. Only now did he realize that everything within his body was collapsing slowly as his genes vibrated at a rapid speed. This feeling\u2026 was similar to what would happen when one overexerted one's spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>At this, Lu Hun gained understanding. This was the cost he had to pay as a result of Chen Feng forcing his spiritual energy to its limit.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The world before him darkened. What Lu Hun could see started reducing. Ultimately, he could no longer see anything. Only endless darkness could be seen from his eyes.</p><br/><p>\"No!\" Lu Hun screamed mournfully.</p><br/><p>Even if this was a gene virus, as an apex expert of the ancient race, the number of genes contained within his body was supposed to be frighteningly huge. Why had the genes in his eyes been the very first ones to rupture? The probability of this happening was supposed to be lower than 0.0001%, right? Why was this happening? Lu Hun despaired.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The world trembled.</p><br/><p>Along with the Lu Hun's mental collapse, this world completely collapsed.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The world of green collapsed, and everyone returned to the real world.</p><br/><p>Lu Hun panicked. \"No! This can't happen!\" The world before him was eternally shrouded in darkness. He could no longer see anything. Why\u2026 why had this happened? Lu Hun was bewildered. \"Chen Feng!\" Lu Hun spat out with his teeth clenched. It had to be him! It was this damnable fellow again! \"I want to kill you!\" spat Lu Hun one word at a time.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The collapsing world of green was forced to dissipate by Lu Hun. Next, all the energy he had poured into the world of green all these years was reabsorbed into his body.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying green radiance swirled around Lu Hun's body. His eyes, which could no longer see anything, were shrouded by a boundless green.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>His hand raised, and a green sword coalesced there.</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\" Li Lei reminded everyone. This was the condensation of the power of an entire world. Even if the world of green no longer existed, the present Lu Hun was still a terrifying existence.</p><br/><p>Energy worth 20% of the completed world of green concentrated in Lu Hun's pair of eyes, and energy worth 30% of the completed world of green concentrated in that sword he held. These were the equivalent of nearly all the energy Lu Hun had accumulated throughout the years.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Lu Hun swiped forth with his sword. Chen Feng, who had been bracing himself, managed to barely dodge this slash.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying crack appeared on the ground below Lu Hun and started spreading for a distance of several kilometers before stopping. This was Lu Hun's present strength.</p><br/><p>\"He won't be able to last long.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone could see it clearly. From the moment the world of green had collapsed, Lu Hun had been finished. Now that his greatest trump card was gone, Lu Hun was not a match for Gou Li's trio. However, the most pressing question was this: how long could they last under his assault? Could they last until Lu Hun's death? The present Lu Hun seemed even scarier than before.</p><br/><p>\"Chen Feng!\" Lu Hun roared, His roar was filled with hatred. \"You ruined my eyes. You ruined my world. You ruined my wife. You ruined my everything!\" Lu Hun's indignant roar surged to the skies.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, everyone's amazed gaze landed on Chen Feng, who presently had an innocent expression plastered on his face. Holy sh*t, they were indeed aware that Chen Feng had ruined Lu Hun's eyes and world, but what was up with that ruined wife?</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>Numerous green flashes streaked past.</p><br/><p>The deranged Lu Hun slashed his weapon at Chen Feng without stop.</p><br/><p>Damn it! Chen Feng clenched his teeth as he dodged constantly. The present Lu Hun was too strong. As such, Chen Feng wouldn't be able to resist even a single attack. The only thing he could do was escape everywhere, cutting a sorry figure. Even this feat of his was with the premise of Lu Hun being blind. Despite this\u2026</p><br/><p>Pu! Pu!</p><br/><p>Numerous cuts still appeared on Chen Feng's body.</p><br/><p>The attack range of that green sword was too huge. Rather than calling it a sword, it would be more apt to call it a pole or something. What kind of sword had such great range?</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Another attack landed. Just as Chen Feng was about to fail to persevere, several figures appeared to block in front of him.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was somewhat surprised. \"It's you guys.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's us,\" one answered calmly. Chen Feng recognized this person. This was one of the members of Gou Li's squad, a person called Qi Yin. Initially, they had been responsible for sealing Lu Hun's escape route. Now that Lu Hun's condition was such, there was no longer any needs to keep sealing the escape routes. As such, they had all come over.</p><br/><p>Qi Yin gazed at the Lu Hun before them. \"Chen Feng, leave the rest to us.\"</p><br/><p>Fu Huo, who had arrived together with Qi Yin, indifferently said, \"We have been waiting way too long for today\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

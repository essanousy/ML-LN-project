If it was this fellow, this development was not too surprising after all. This person, who was also known as the Child of God, had been a rather famous person even back in the Primordial Era. Surprisingly, he had also survived to the present day. Truly worthy of being the Child of God.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess shook her head. She had initially believed that these resonators would not be able to cause her any trouble. However, if Zhou Ye had appeared, things would not be the same. She could easily sense how terrifying the gathering of all those people was. If she were at her peak, she would naturally be able to easily deal with them with a wave of her hand. Unfortunately, right now\u2026</p><br/><p>She shook her head. \"Looks like I have to waste some godly power to deal with them.\" Her tiny hand waved at the forest as she said, \"Please wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint golden radiance surged out. The radiance of luck that had weakened previously intensified. The Luck Goddess's eyes gleamed coldly as she vowed that she would not permit these people to pass through the salt lake.</p><br/><p>Luck, activate!</p><br/><p>Kill!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The initially tranquil lake suddenly went berserk.</p><br/><p>\"Careful.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone increased their vigilance.</p><br/><p>\"Finally here\u2026\" Chen Feng was filled with anticipation. He had been scheming around just for this very moment. If his guess was correct, the simplest way for the Luck Goddess to eliminate all these people was to use her power of luck to manufacture misfortune to kill all these people. Something like this was what Chen Feng had done in the past. Although the amount of luck value required was much higher, it was astonishingly effective as well. This time, though, the Luck Goddess would be the unfortunate one. Chen Feng smiled as he mused about this.</p><br/><p>\"Time to reap our harvest.\" Chen Feng waved his hand lightly.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance flashed. No energy or aura appeared. Rather, that odd and bizarre aura lingering among the air slowly and gradually swirled around before entered Chen Feng's body. He was absorbing the power of misfortune! A hundred points, 101 points, 102 points!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The pitifully low amount of misfortune power within him started increasing madly.</p><br/><p>This was something created using the godly power of the Luck Goddess. As such, a regular person would not dare touch it. However, when the power of luck was transformed into misfortune and was sent straight to the Misfortune Goddess, there was no longer anything Chen Feng needed to fear.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>He absorbed madly. His initial 100 points of misfortune power increased sharply, and in a single push, he gained an additional 50 points.</p><br/><p>\"How powerful.\"</p><br/><p>All the resonators around exclaimed in admiration. From their point of view, they only saw an odd power rippling over them and the surface of the lake going berserk. Next, Chen Feng had taken a single step forward and waved his hand lightly, and everything returned to normal. One could only say that he was indeed worthy of being the spokesperson of the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Strong!</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye and the others exchanged glances and had toying smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>Luck\u2026</p><br/><p>Misfortune\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hehe.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye was incomparably delighted. If it was purely the power of luck, the Misfortune Goddess would be seeking her own death if she dared touch it. After all, the present Luck Goddess was way stronger than her. However, that Luck Goddess had, in a truly unfortunate fashion, transformed her power of luck into misfortune. Not only that, she had even sent the power of misfortune straight to Chen Feng\u2026 Mhm\u2026 This was truly amusing.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye laughed wildly inwardly. \"It is truly unexpected that this is happening to you as well.\"</p><br/><p>Was there anything more delightful than the act of insulting his sworn enemy?</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>The godly power rippled past several pasts. Yet each time, the lake was able to regain its calm.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hand and calmly said, \"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was getting agitated. Suddenly, they felt like becoming followers of the Luck Goddess was indeed a nice thing. Look, at least the environmental dangers would be reduced greatly, and they would also have a chance to become a trusted subordinate of the Luck Goddess in the future.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Some of them had already started thinking of ways to extend their contracts of a god forever. In this chaotic era, it would be good if they could seek shelter under the umbrella of a powerful person. Alas, unknown to them all, the all-powerful umbrella they were all thinking of was presently sensing the changes at the salt lake with an unsightly expression.</p><br/><p>Godly power of luck\u2026 gone! Without any omens, without any sign of an enemy.</p><br/><p>Just like that, it was gone, as if her godly power of luck had vanished into thin air the moment it had made contact with that group of people.</p><br/><p>Luck Goddess was in a solemn mood. \"Is Zhou Ye already this strong?\" The Zhou Ye of the past had been rather weak. However, it had been many years since any news about him had last heard. Furthermore, with his identity as the Child of God, it would not be odd for him to suddenly become strong.</p><br/><p>Shua! Shua!</p><br/><p>That surging aura from the group at the salt lake was quickly approaching her.</p><br/><p>The Luck Goddess sneered. \"Courting death.\" It had been way too long since she had last done anything. Was this why these lowly servants had forgotten about the dignity of a god? Perhaps this was the time to remind them.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying godly power surged out. The power of luck bloomed. Without surprise, the moment the Luck Goddess activated her power of luck, the salt lake started trembling. Under the lake, numerous powerful existences seemed to be on the verge of emerging. In the sky, numerous blasts of thunder roared. Numerous phenomena seemed to have appeared instantly.</p><br/><p>Again?</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Chen Feng instinctively.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng waved his hand calmly. \"Calm!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance rippled out. Coldly, Chen Feng returned the calm to this lake. Everyone around exclaimed in admiration yet again. With a snap of his fingers, he had eliminated the numerous phenomena here. This strength\u2026 was truly excessively astonishing.</p><br/><p>Everyone was filled with a sense of admiration. Little did they know that the calm-looking Chen Feng was inwardly ecstatic. Godly power! So much godly power! He had originally been worried that he would have no way of absorbing godly power. Surprisingly, the Luck Goddess was rather firm in her resolve to transform her godly power of luck into misfortune and send it to Chen Feng. This was perfect.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng grinned. \"My dearest Spirit indeed.\" However, he could not help but wonder why the Luck Goddess was still using her power of luck to create misfortune despite how little godly power she had. Was there a trick somewhere? Mhm\u2026 Chen Feng contemplated shortly before arrived at a conclusion that shocked him so much his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\"Holy shit, that can't be, right?\"</p><br/><p>He blanked. Could it be\u2026 Could it be\u2026 that the Luck Goddess was simply unaware of the more optimal method of using her power of luck?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"No, this can't be true. She is the Luck Goddess, a deity! When it comes to the operation of the godly power of luck, nobody can surpass her.\"</p><br/><p>Alas\u2026 the subsequent attacks were the same attacks of misfortune. This caused Chen Feng to revisit his conclusion. The Luck Goddess was truly unaware of the optimal method of using her power of luck! She was wasting her luck power!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 how was this even possible? She was the Luck Goddess. She was a deity\u2026 However, Chen Feng was able to deduce the real reason soon enough. The explanation was rather simple. During the Primordial Era, she'd always had boundless and endless godly power at her disposal. As such, she had not needed to consider efficiency, since her godly power had been inexhaustible. The only thing she had needed to consider was the might of her attacks.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Luck Goddess had no idea about saving up godly power. This was also why the Luck Goddess and Misfortune Goddess were mortal enemies. If the exhaustion of godly power was not taken into consideration, the domains of these two were totally overlapped.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was speechless at this. In his previous life on Earth, stuff like this had been a rather common occurrence as well. For example, a certain senior with a rather high income with nice cars and houses would frequently consult his junior when it came to the purchase of electronics.</p><br/><p>When asked why couldn't he buy those electronic products himself, the senior would say that he truly lacked understanding of these things and was afraid of the number of scammers online. Hearing that, the junior would help him select the electronic product with the best price. After they were done with the process, that senior would conclude that these poor fellows were the ones who knew more about life after all. Although they were so poor that they couldn't afford anything, they seemed to know about everything.</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>After giving it some thought, Chen Feng felt like he was rather similar to the so-called poor fellows.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

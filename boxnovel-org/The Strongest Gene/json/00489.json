Under the efforts of the barbarians, the dust was all being blown in various directions. Distantly, black rain was still falling, and a cold breeze was whizzing through the air. Some of the dust landed before drifting too far away, while some was blown far away due to the strength the barbarians were waving with. And thus, Star City no longer existed. As for the devil prince that had been hidden underground, it vanished together with the city.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was immensely satisfied. \"Look, how easy.\" The methods of the devil race's awakening were indeed rather unique. However, after their research, they had concluded that the reawakening was not merely the act of sealing the devil race members underground. Rather, the devil race members had all transformed into particles that had blended with the earth.</p><br/><p>If so, destroying Star City should do the job. This was what Chen Feng believed. As such, he acted on such a plan as a counter without any hesitation. With this, he refused to believe that they could still awaken the prince.</p><br/><p>\"Will there be any problems?\" Chen Feng asked Spirit.</p><br/><p>Spirit shook her head. \"Nope. The only way for this prince to be reawakened is if the devil race is capable of recovering every single speck of dust here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\" Chen Feng pondered. Recovering every single speck of dust? As he pondered, he noted that it was actually quite doable.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the genetic era. In this era, anything was possible. Even if the dust could vanish, what about the particles of the prince that were residing within the dust? Would the particles vanish together with the dust? Clearly, that was not possible. As the dust was destroyed, those particles would most definitely leave the dust before dissipating away amid the air and continuing the long wait for reawakening.</p><br/><p>\"This won't do,\" Chen Feng muttered. Since he had already decided to eliminate the devil race, he could not allow them any chances.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng pondered and beckoned at the technician of the Genetic Union, \"Do we have any air purifiers here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" The technician was somewhat stupefied. \"Air\u2026 air purifier?\"</p><br/><p>He was at a loss. Why was Chen Feng looking for air purifier at times like this?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded. \"Yes, those capable of filtering the air.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, we do.\" The technician smiled bitterly. \"However, they can only be used to filter physical dust particles.\"</p><br/><p>What was this Chen Feng fellow thinking? After all, this was a war between experts, and that dust was, after all, the results of the reawakening ability of the enigmatic devil race. As such, Chen Feng should have some sort of respect for the strength of the devil race, right? He should consider their feelings, right?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng curled his lip. \"Well, it's only a matter of changing the filter cartridge. Get the Genetic Union to install an energy sensor on the filter cartridge. In any case, we only need to trap all the dust containing energy undulations.\"</p><br/><p>The technician was at a loss. \"Will this work?\" However, since Chen Feng had already made the request, the technician would have to act on it.</p><br/><p>Soon after, the Genetic Union gathered several huge air purifiers, and the filter cartridges were changed according to Chen Feng's instruction.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng appeared immensely satisfied. \"Not bad, not bad.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone else: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Would this really work? Chen Feng watched on silently. He was sure that the moment Star City was destroyed, apart from the huge amount of dust blown away, a lot of the dust had also been entirely destroyed as well. Since that dust had already been destroyed, the devil race's energy that had latched upon the dust would most certainly still be around here. In the air around here, they would wait until the moment of their awakening.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled calmly. \"Sorry, you no longer have any chances.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>All the air purifiers were turned on. Instantly, the alarms buzzed without stop. They all widened their eyes as they witnessed the numerous reports that were popping out as the filter cartridges started trapping the energy remaining in the air. These air purifiers had actually managed to trap so much energy in them.</p><br/><p>\"Within the cartridges, the remains of our energy during the battle earlier are included as well. Filter those out. As for what remains\u2026\" Chen Feng commanded decisively.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Presently, the technician appeared incredibly excited, even more excited than when he had dreamed of finally getting a girlfriend.</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>Di\u2014</p><br/><p>New reports popped out without stop. Soon, the filtering was completed.</p><br/><p>With the energy monitoring apparatuses of the Genetic Union, Chen Feng separated all the identified energy and the energy that posed no threat. What remained was only an unknown energy.</p><br/><p>\"Found you.\" The technician was overjoyed. \"Although we are unable to get any information about this energy, from its structural makeup, it can be concluded that this energy indeed resembles the structural makeup of the black raindrops.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone widened their eyes as they saw this. \"They actually found it for real?\" Air purifiers could actually be used in such manner?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was satisfied. \"Very good. Destroy it.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>The technician started the elimination process. Alas, it did not seem to work. Disinfectants were most certainly ineffective against the devil race's energy. How about energy eliminators? Ineffective as well. All methods of energy elimination normally used were tried, and all failed. Even after exhausting every method known to him, the technician had still failed to do anything to the energy. This unique unknown energy was actually something they couldn't destroy.</p><br/><p>However, this was rather reasonable. If the unknown energy could be destroyed so easily, the devil race would most probably have failed to last this long and would have been destroyed long ago. After all, these were the energy particles that the devil race members had transformed into for their hibernation. Regular methods wouldn't work at all. What to do, then? Were they helpless apart from keeping this thing around? Keeping it waiting for the devil race to awaken?</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that this was merely a small portion of them, without thoroughly destroying them, the devil race in question would most certainly wake up one day, bringing disaster along with its awakening. Furthermore, other devil race members were still awakening without stop.</p><br/><p>If they could look for a method of destroying these particles, they might be able to purify the soil beneath all human cities. With this, they would no longer need to be worried about the ground they stood on.</p><br/><p>\"What to do?\"</p><br/><p>They looked at each other before, finally, they all looked at Chen Feng again.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm\u2026\" Chen Feng frowned. If regular methods were ineffective\u2026 Suddenly, Chen Feng raised his head and looked at the dark clouds. Even though the vicinity of Star City was already without the black rain, this rain was still falling everywhere else. Chen Feng contemplated. \"Use some of the black raindrops to try. Since these particles can be awakened into the devil race members using the black raindrops, perhaps\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, someone returned with some gathered black raindrops.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The black raindrops were mixed with the gathered energy.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The particles started shimmering lightly. These energy particles had actually been awakened by the black raindrops. With his own eyes, Chen Feng witnessed the recovery of the energy particles as they emanated a bizarre aura. Moreover, a formidable and mysterious attractive force was being emitted from these energy particles as well. Nearby, countless dust and particles started nearing the energy particles.</p><br/><p>Everyone exclaimed in admiration.</p><br/><p>\"The particles are capable of attracting other particles.\"</p><br/><p>\"Currently, this particle is summoning the particles that are similar in nature. Perhaps when all the particles have been gathered, they will transform into a powerful devil race member. By gathering all the same energy, the particles will condense together before awakening as a devil race member.\"</p><br/><p>\"So that's the case.\"</p><br/><p>With a single look, they all understood this. They felt enlightened. So this was how the devil race members had been awakening?</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The particles nearby started stirring.</p><br/><p>Some of the dust that had already landed on the ground earlier was now nearing this particle without stop. At the same time, they had also noticed something.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like the further the distance, the weaker the attractive force is.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Within five kilometers, the attractive force is the strongest. This is quite a huge range, as normally, the particles required for the awakening of a single devil race member are within 10 meters from each other. A range of five kilometers\u2026 is very huge!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>That particle flickered without stop, and the attracted particles nearby increased in amount as well. Alas, due to what Chen Feng had done earlier, the dust containing the relevant particles had been blown somewhere else. As such, regardless of what this particular particle did, it failed to attract the particles that were of the same set as it.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>After finishing absorbing the required energy, the particles started condensing into a devil race member.</p><br/><p>Howl!</p><br/><p>A powerful devil race member thus appeared there. However, as they looked at it, they became speechless. That was because this newly awakened devil race member was obviously an incomplete version of itself. This was a devil race member with some features of its face missing. On top of that, its chest was missing as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

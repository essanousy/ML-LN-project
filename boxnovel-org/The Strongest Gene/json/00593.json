The Research Agency was dumbfounded. Even the Genetic Union was dumbfounded. What was this? To prepare for this day, humanity had trained tirelessly and the presidents of the respective organizations had gone into various sorts of seclusion all to improve their strength, to ensure the survival of humanity.</p><br/><p>And now, when the real war erupted, something seemed off? At this moment, from the front lines, a new update was received. This time, without an ounce of effort, without sparing any manpower, the ancient race had been able to gain an entire human city.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>What was going on? At this news, the humans were truly shocked.</p><br/><p>\"Was the army there destroyed?\"</p><br/><p>Yet when they received word of what had happened there, they were all stupefied.</p><br/><p>At the front lines, the main army of the ancient race had finally entered human territory. Even though their scouts had reported that the humans were extremely weak, the ancients had still maintained the highest level of vigilance. Humanity was definitely not a race that could be underestimated. The devils had once viewed the humans with contempt, and look at what had happened to them. The ancient race would most definitely not repeat the devils' mistake.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The ancient army pushed forth. Distantly, numerous humans were already visible. That terrifying aura planted fear in their hearts. Among those humans, there were also numerous extraordinary radiances flickering about.</p><br/><p>The people of the ancient race increased their vigilance as they saw this. \"Careful.\"</p><br/><p>\"Activate our defenses.\"</p><br/><p>Some had already activated their defenses. They recall that humans seemed to possess something called \"technological weapons,\" which were incredibly terrifying, capable of killing the enemy over a long distance of several hundred thousand kilometers. They had once stolen some videos of the humans and had witnessed such a scene\u2026</p><br/><p>The destructiveness of those weapons was rather ordinary, yet their range was truly terrifying. Even that was something the ancients had seen from a videos of the humans from several hundred years ago. As for humanity's current technological level\u2026</p><br/><p>The ancients exchanged glances before further increasing their vigilance. Just like that, step by step, they approached the humans. The nearer they came, the more clearly they could feel how terrifying the humans were. Moreover, intense roars could be heard, so intense the ground seemed to shake.</p><br/><p>One step, two steps\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they charged through the barrier separating the human territory and the unknown region. But the instant they left the barrier, they stood there dumbstruck, and they remained that way for a long time. As for the ancients behind them, they were all frightened. Had something happened to the vanguard?</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>They followed closely and charged out as well. Next\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone lapsed into silence.</p><br/><p>Before their eyes, the humans' cheering was so loud that even the deaf could hear it. However, different they had imagined, they saw numerous humans carrying big, shiny signboards while shouting at them in excitement.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ying, I love you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Goddess, please give me your autograph!\"</p><br/><p>Countless people roared. As for the humans even further back in the distance, they directly lifted a white flag and waved it in the air.</p><br/><p>\"???\"</p><br/><p>The leader of the ancients was stupefied. This\u2026 what was going on? Xiao Ying? Ah, right, that's the scout they had sent to the human territory previously. How did these humans find out her name? Apart from that, this leader could also hear numerous bizarre discussions.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, they are truly all female!\"</p><br/><p>\"Too beautiful, even prettier than the northern girls\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Finally, the salvation of us forever-alones has arrived\u2026\"</p><br/><p>All sorts of weird discussions could be heard. At this time, a tall and handsome human warrior stepped forth.</p><br/><p>As he stepped forward, all the humans gave way uniformly. As the ancients saw this, they heightened their vigilance. Was this the leader of these humans? Had the time for battle finally arrived?</p><br/><p>Next\u2026</p><br/><p>They saw that handsome warrior kneel down on one knee before the leader of the ancient army.</p><br/><p>His overcast yet magnetic voice echoed in the air. \"Dear beautiful goddess, please accept my love. I am willing to become your guardian warrior.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" The ancient leader was stupefied. \"???\"</p><br/><p>What was going on? Nobody could answer this question. She turned around and noted that the ancients behind her were confused as well. Although the ancients were powerful and had once been a race with two genders, thanks to their primeval civilization, they as a race had no concept of romance, regardless of gender. But now\u2026</p><br/><p>The leader clutched her weapon. \"Is this a scheme of theirs?\"</p><br/><p>A person behind the leader shook her head. \"Lord. No malice has been detected from them.\"</p><br/><p>The ancient leader frowned and ultimately stopped attacking. She could feel that these humans before her had also consumed the beyond X gene reagent and had rather extraordinary strength.</p><br/><p>Beyond C classes\u2026</p><br/><p>Beyond B classes\u2026</p><br/><p>Even beyond A classes were included in their ranks.</p><br/><p>When had so many geniuses appeared among the humans? Moreover, even these geniuses were being used as cannon fodder at the front lines? How powerful were the humans? A sense of vigilance rose in the hearts of the ancients. If they were to make a move now\u2026</p><br/><p>The ancient leader compared the strength of both parties here and estimated a ratio of 7:3 between the strength of both parties. The ancient army had 70% odds of winning this battle, but that 30% indicated that they would still suffer rather disastrous casualties even if they won. As such, she had yet to command the army to attack.</p><br/><p>And next\u2026</p><br/><p>With astonishment, she watched on as the humans welcomed their army with delight. That feeling\u2026was rather similar to a scene from the marriage of an ancient princess.</p><br/><p>\"Is this the human race?\"</p><br/><p>The ancients were amazed. This was the very first time they had had any sort of meaningful contact with the humans. Mhm\u2026 the humans seemed somewhat different than the ancients had imagined?</p><br/><p>For the first time, this ancient race, this kingdom of females, had second thoughts about their decision to wage war on the humans. On that night itself, the ancients who had suffered loneliness for a long time and the human forever-alone genetic warriors whose sex lives were nonexistent underwent a night of great harmony, doing the deed of two genders.</p><br/><p>On the next day, the city entered a phase of peacetime. Just like that, the humans and ancients coexisted peacefully. War? Why was there a need for war? The ancient race had not even needed any sort of effort to be able to conquer these humans. Each soldier was extremely precious for the ancients. As such, they were unwilling to suffer losses.</p><br/><p>With excitement, they raised the flag of the ancient race in the city center, and thus the army pressed forth once again. But then, since this city had already been conquered, they would need to leave some people behind to keep watch, right? As such, they left behind a group of people before advancing once again.</p><br/><p>This time, they employed the newly discovered and most apt strategy for conquering the humans, undergoing the great harmony of two genders with the humans. However, with this strategy, the ancients lost their will to fight as well.</p><br/><p>In the past, whenever they had won a city through battle, a portion of the army would also be left behind to keep watch as the main army advanced forth. However, the main reason for that was to suppress the newly conquered city, to suppress any revolts.</p><br/><p>Those left behind were those that lacked any military achievements. For the sake of earning more achievements, none of them were willing to be left behind; everyone requested to go into battle with the main army. But now, the complete reverse was happening. The ancients that had conquered the human city were extremely reluctant to leave. All of them applied to stay behind. This was something completely unthinkable for the ancients prior to this war.</p><br/><p>How had this happened? The numerous army captains were in a daze as they pondered this.</p><br/><p>They thought of numerous ideas to encourage the soldiers to go do battle, yet each day, they were faced with numerous different methods of attempts to capture their fancy, to charm them, from the humans. This was something the ancients had never experienced, regardless of whether they were feminized ancients or ancients that had originally been female. They had even started entertaining the thought of forever staying among the humans.</p><br/><p>War? What was that? All was forgotten.</p><br/><p>\"Look, those are the humans' hinterlands. We only need to conquer thirteen cities and we will be able to reach the hinterlands.\" The captain spoke passionately in her attempt to raise the morale of the ancient army. Yet after three mere cities, the entirety of their army was already staying behind in the human cities. None were willing to continue advancing.</p><br/><p>\"I had already missed two cities. This time, I must stay behind.\"</p><br/><p>\"The humans are not putting up any sort of resistance anyway. Why is there a need for war?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, have you forgotten how many losses we suffered when we warred with the devils back then?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you are saying that we should conquer the humans, I personally believe that we have already conquered them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This thought was shared by a lot of ancient race members.</p><br/><p>And thus, the ancients' grand plan, the war they had wanted to start, was cast aside.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

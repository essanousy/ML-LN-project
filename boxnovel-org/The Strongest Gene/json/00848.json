She said that I have unfinished business from my past life and thus my soul was unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation. As such, she made an exception and allowed me to be reborn here,\u201d she stated seriously. \u201cMhm\u2026 She also said that you are very powerful now and want to bring me back. But\u2026 I never expected you to look this stupid.\u201d She laughed stealthily.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Oh.\u201d Luo Yuan merely stared at her blankly with a stupid expression on his face. He was aware that in this world, life was something that was granted. However, he had never expected Chen Feng to use such a method to deliver this young lady to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still have your previous life\u2019s memories?\u201d Luo Yuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d The young lady curled her lips. \u201cAbout the Genetic Union or something. I still have a portion of the memories in my head. Unexpectedly, you were also quite stupid in my past life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Luo Yuan understood clearly. Chen Feng had inferred the matters from back then, then simulated those memories. That was why this young lady only had some of those memories. At the very least, she should have quite a number of memories pertaining to her and Luo Yuan. However, she was ultimately not the woman from his youth.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the young lady stood up. \u201cHmph. I am not her. Although I have those memories, as far as I am concerned, those seem more like memories planted in me. I have a clear recollection of them, yet I do not feel deeply about them. This is not what I want. I do not need anyone to grant me any memories. I am me. I am Lian. Even if I have to be together with you, I will only do it if I truly like you, rather than depending on some granted memories. Hmph. Even if I have to like you, I would much prefer to like the present you rather than some memories of the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young lady was brimming with brightness and youthfulness. She seemed somewhat different from that flower-like young lady. As for her words, they hit straight at Luo Yuan\u2019s heart. Yes, if even this young lady could understand this, why couldn\u2019t he understand it as well? It was precisely as she said.</p><br/><p>Would she rather like the present him or some memories of the past? These words pierced straight into Luo Yuan\u2019s soul, enlightening him immensely.</p><br/><p><em>I am Luo Yuan! No, I am no longer the Luo Yuan of the past. Now, I am a new person. I was once a clone. Now, the connection has been severed and I am now a free-living being. I no longer need to be someone who only exists for the sake of someone else.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Suddenly, the young lady smiled brightly. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t you tell me something about yourself? Even if this is a marriage arranged by Lord Ming Yue, I still need to know you. Your hobbies and so on,\u201d the young lady said seriously as she waved her fingers around. This motion of hers touched the deepest part of Luo Yuan\u2019s heart for some indescribable reason. Her appearance\u2026 resembled the flower-like young lady of the past so very greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Luo Yuan blankly said, \u201cI am Luo Yuan\u2026 No.\u201d He looked toward Chen Feng and suddenly added, \u201cI am Chen Yuan! Mhm\u2026 Chen Yuan, the Yuan in my name means vigor. I traversed the entire world to come here, all in search of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d the young lady cheered. \u201cIs that for real? Then you are surely very awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like this Chen Yuan had finally accepted his new identity. He was clear that the flower-like young lady in his memories belonged to Luo Yuan, not him. However, this young lady before him, who shared the same appearance and disposition as her, was someone that did not approve of past memories. Similar to him, she was also, in a way, a replica, a replica of that young lady.</p><br/><p>Despite that, she had her own memories. Together, they could create memories that were truly theirs. As for this young lady, she would only belong to him. As for the memories\u2026 Chen Yuan stared into the distance. Even though it was just memories, he was clear that the young lady from the memories could only belong to Luo Yuan. Deep within his heart, he wished that she could forever remain in the past.</p><br/><p>After all, she was someone he had once loved. This was the conclusion Chen Yuan reached. He\u2019d made up his mind. The past was, after all, the past. He did not approve of Luo Yuan\u2019s plan of going back in time to drag her out again. After losing his connection with the real body, Chen Yuan seemed to finally start possessing his own thoughts and his own ambitions. He wanted that flower-like young lady as well! However, what he wanted was her to stay a precious memory, something that remained in the past.</p><br/><p>As for this moving young lady before him, he wanted her as well. She would be his future. This future would be exclusive to him and Lian Er!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the young lady looked at him doubtfully. \u201cSo how did you end up in a cage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan had thoroughly immersed himself in his new identity. He smiled and said, \u201cBecause I am too powerful. This is the Nether Realm, the place where the process of reincarnation takes place. Me coming here for you violated the laws. Mhm\u2026 Therefore, I have to seal up my own strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d the young lady exclaimed in admiration. How romantic! He had traversed through a different world just for her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your name Chen Yuan, then?\u201d The young lady pondered before continuing, \u201cI recall this not being your name in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I want to sever my connection with the past,\u201d Chen Yuan said with a smile. \u201cJust like you said, the past is nothing but memories. I remember them, and you might only remember some of them, but what does this matter? The moment I set eyes on you, I decided that I like the present you. Therefore, I am now Chen Yuan. Our past story is a tragedy. Let that tragedy be gone with the wind. I am not the youth in that story; I am the powerful Chen Yuan. Together with you, I am willing to create a new future,\u201d Chen Yuan said confidently. As he looked straight at this young lady while uttering these words, he felt refreshed. So it turned out that uttering these words with his very own identity felt like this? It was truly\u2026 quite a different feeling.</p><br/><p>The young lady stretched her hand out. \u201cFine. I shall try dating you for a bit then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan took her hand, his heart pounding. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAs per the laws of the Nether Realm, to take her, a contract of life and death must be signed so as to confirm that you will share life and death with her.\u201d Ming Yue looked at Chen Yuan. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan knew that this arrangement had to be the work of Chen Feng. However, so what?</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Ming Yue nodded and personally helped them sign the contract. From today onward, Chen Yuan was officially bound together with this young lady, sharing life and death.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>And thus, the two started dating. One day, one month, and one year later, the two grew closer to each other. Many locations within the world of The Crystal Palace had come to contain sweet memories for the two of them. Traces of love were left everywhere. Chen Yuan had truly become a part of the world of The Crystal Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, I will take you to see an even bigger world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow big is that world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuch bigger than this world. So big that even in a lifetime, one can\u2019t fully traverse the whole world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have something to do, though. Wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take you as my wife when I return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

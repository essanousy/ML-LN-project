Regardless of their opinions of the fast guy, regardless of how much they looked down on him, when he could endure doing it with even such a life-form, they had to feel heartfelt admiration toward him. With one look, everyone knew that this was a person with great perseverance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the winner of this divine seat has already been determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done about it. His willpower is incredibly firm. Nobody can contend against him in terms of willpower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? Isn\u2019t it just sleeping with a male of a certain race? What\u2026 Ughhh\u2026 No, don\u2019t show me the video. Why is he so disgusting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy else would everyone admire him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Swish! Swish!</p><br/><p>Almost everyone had already stopped advancing. They looked toward the end of the world, at that distant place where the divine seat sat. They watched on as the streak of light that was the fast guy pierced through space and headed toward that place. If the fast guy was truly going to be the one to obtain this divine seat, it would be pointless for them to continue fighting.</p><br/><p>As such, all the apostles stopped and only watched on silently as that dazzling streak issued a challenge to the divine seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis strength is very weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has been speeding through the entire time and has exhausted too much godly power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not stop and take a rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suppose he is afraid of being overtaken. After paying such a heavy price, he has to ascend in this trial. However, it does not matter even if he is exhausted. After all, this is a low-tier trial.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Swish! Swish!</p><br/><p>The streak shone dazzlingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis speed is even faster now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally thought that he would only be slightly faster than us. Surprisingly, his speed has already reached this level. Nobody is even capable of catching up to his shadow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s mood became solemn at this moment.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>That white clump charged toward the divine seat.</p><br/><p>He had to emerge victorious in this trial. And thus, with his superb speed, he charged at the divine seat, which had seemingly boundless godly power. He was taking on the trial\u2019s final challenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mirror image is going to appear from the divine seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how strong the mirror image will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt does not matter, as it will only exhibit 1% of the original god\u2019s strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is simply free for the taking.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the apostles started to lament this.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The entire world trembled as the white streak charged onto the divine seat like a meteor. However, neither the expected fight over the divine seat nor the mirror image of the original god appeared. The only thing they could see was the fast guy mustering all his godly power and colliding with the divine seat. And then\u2026 he died from the impact of the collision.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The loud clang and the splattering of blood that followed stunned everyone.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence. The apostles were all stupefied. Even the observing gods were stupefied. Everyone was stupefied. Dead\u2026 from the collision? That\u2019s right. Their eyes had not failed them. Even if that divine seat was so far away, at the other end of the world, they were still able to capture this terrifying sight with their senses. The fast guy had died by way of collision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe beat himself to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fast bro here is so fast that he killed himself with his speed?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the apostles blanked for a long time before erupting into a clamor. What was going on here? Dying from a collision?</p><br/><p>\u201cHas anyone here challenged a divine seat before?\u201d they asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe,\u201d a certain apostle answered, yet his voice was filled with doubt as well. \u201cFor a divine seat challenge, normally, one only needs to reach the vicinity of the divine seat and issue a challenge. The mirror image will then appear. The so-called \u2018issuing a challenge\u2019 is a simple act of transmitting one\u2019s thoughts to the divine seat. After all, mirror images are created for the sake of being challenged. So long as it senses hostility, it will appear to accept the challenge. What happens next depends on the strength of the challenger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe few divine seat trials I have encountered all progressed similarly. There were some who directly attacked the seat in the past. However, generally, the mirror image appears automatically to receive the attack. After all, the act of attacking is similar to the act of challenging. But this situation\u2026 I can\u2019t make sense of it. The mirror image was supposed to come out when the fast guy charged at the seat. But now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That apostle appeared utterly confused. The other apostles chilled as they heard this. Could it be that this was a different type of trial?</p><br/><p>A certain apostle spoke meekly. \u201cDo you guys feel that\u2026 there is a possibility? Perhaps the fast guy moved so fast that the mirror image couldn\u2019t even react to it before he was already dead\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>The entire world lapsed into silence. The apostles looked at each other. After thinking about it, when they recalled the two deeds the fast guy had performed on his way to the divine seat, they felt like this was probably what had happened. Since a mirror image was a challenge for the apostles, it signified that a mirror image\u2019s strength would be between the realm of a god and an apostle, not something an apostle could never defeat. And this time, the mirror image would most definitely be incredibly weak, since Chen Feng was the one who had unlocked this trial.</p><br/><p>With such a weak mirror image, it was quite likely that it had indeed failed to react to the fast guy\u2019s approach in time. As the apostles thought of this possibility, they did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is truly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dying by collision\u2026 This could actually happen. What more could they say? Within the divine seat, Ye, who had been about to make a move, was also stupefied. That\u2019s right. Ye had already prepared to make a move. Even though he had no intention of revealing himself before that culprit and that silhouette revealed themselves, he had no intention of letting these apostles off. That was why he had been prepared to make a move against the fast guy.</p><br/><p>Alas, he had not seen this coming. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t been able to react in time. Rather, he had been planning to kill that fast guy after he broke the divine seat. Unexpectedly, the illustrious apostle had actually killed himself with the collision. Perhaps this was because of the exhaustion of his godly power, or perhaps it was because of the individual\u2019s direct personality. Nevertheless, this truly caused him to be speechless.</p><br/><p>Ye sighed deeply. \u201cIs this what the apostles that my era has created are like?\u201d</p><br/><p>One ought to know that back then, in the era of the Creation God, the world had been filled with geniuses. In this trial, he had initially been scared that too many apostles would die, affecting his plan. Now that he looked at it, he had truly been overthinking it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye inhaled deeply.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bro here just killed himself trying to show off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, the divine seat is still up for grabs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the gazes of all the apostles burned with passion.</p><br/><p>Even though that bro\u2019s death had been rather tragic, thanks to that, the divine seat was still there, waving its hand at them. With this, this alien world, which had calmed down, bustled yet again.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Numerous figures started heading toward the divine seat. However, their speeds were not even one-tenth of the fast guy\u2019s speed. Therefore, battles between apostles erupted yet again. All the apostles were charging crazily at the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Some of the god\u2019s descendants sneered. \u201cHehe.\u201d These pathetic apostles had yet to realize where they stood. No matter how weak this god\u2019s mirror image was, it was not something they could hope to lay their hands on. They were ultimately nothing but cannon fodder. Naturally, not even these god\u2019s descendants realized that, all along, the Sin God\u2019s gaze had been focused on the slowly approaching silhouette. This trap that had been activated with Chen Feng as the bait\u2026 Who exactly was this silhouette?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

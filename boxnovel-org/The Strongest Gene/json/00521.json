Such majesty truly caused him to feel fear.</p><br/><p>The ice-cold voice descended like the descent of winter. \"Humans\u2026 have actually walked an entirely different path?\" They were aware that no S classes existed among humans. With the short life span of humanity, by the time one of them reached peak A class, that person's life span would already be ending soon. The remaining time would not be sufficient for that person to actually break through the barrier and reach S class.</p><br/><p>But then, they had never expected that humans would actually walk a different path, the path of the power of beyond. The appearance of this power caused the power of humans to rise greatly. The previous limit of humanity was A class, yet now, it had changed into beyond A class. With the present classification humans had for their warriors, the strongest existence should be classified as beyond A9?</p><br/><p>Naturally, regardless of how powerful the power of beyond was, it was nothing compared to S class. The effect brought forward by the power gene of S class far surpassed the ordinary genetic realm of genetic warriors. This single advancement was supposed to be something none of the genetic warrior's previous advancements could compare with.</p><br/><p>Of course, they were not worried about this, as humans couldn't really enter S class. The only thing that worried them was the appearance of this power of beyond. This might very well increase humanity's cultivation speed by two times, three times, or perhaps even more. The time required for them to reach their present limit of beyond A class would also decrease, and the act of reaching humanity's limit would also be easier. At that time, S class would no longer seem that far away.</p><br/><p>\"Go investigate. I want to know, what exactly this so-called beyond X gene reagent is.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Two gusts of mist drifted through the air.</p><br/><p>Presently, at the Genetic Union.</p><br/><p>\"Are you done?\" Chen Feng glanced at them with a doubtful expression. What were these fellows muttering about at the corner?</p><br/><p>\"Yes, we're done.\" The person from the Genetic Union adjusted his expression. \"Everything is already prepared. You can start consuming the gene reagent.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" Chen Feng started consuming the gene reagent immediately.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Gold radiance erupted from him.</p><br/><p>The unique radiance shone brightly as the power within Chen Feng's body transformed in a flash. All his energy changed qualitatively. In that single instant, he had a feeling that he was incomparably powerful. Beyond, this was an entirely different power.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, have you felt it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm, your power is transforming under the effect of this power. However, if this power disappears, this transformation will disappear as well\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Correct.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shut his eyes. The formidable power had already ended. However, he was still immersed in the comprehension of that power. With both his eyes shut, he recalled the feel of this power without stop. If that power could be blended into his body and he no longer needed to rely on external power to maintain that state, making it a true fusion\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, analyze my earlier status.\"</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Countless data flicked past the screen, indicating all the minute changes in Chen Feng's body earlier.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's gazed ahead sharply. One ought to know that this beyond X gene reagent was something he had personally created. Even the formula had been created by him. As such, he was aware that the main function of this gene reagent had always been its function as a catalyst. Everything that brought about the power of beyond was already within Chen Feng's body, waiting to be activated by some catalyst. When these things bloomed with the power of beyond, the entire process had been recorded by Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"Let's see\u2026 how to complete this transformation without using any catalysts.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng stepped into this bizarre world. For others, their comprehension of this power of beyond relied on talent, seeking that faintly discernible yet mysterious feeling. The moment one found the correct feeling, one would be able to break through easily. As for Chen Feng, he preferred doing things from the basics, understanding exactly how the process went, looking for the exact trigger.</p><br/><p>\"Found you!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone. Presently, the people present looked at the motionless Chen Feng and started exchanging glances.</p><br/><p>\"I suppose Boss has yet to discover that he has a low potential.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, Boss has always been busy with research. I suppose he never expected that his potential would actually be this low. With this, I truly have no idea how long he will require to grasp the power of beyond.\"</p><br/><p>They all felt rather regretful.</p><br/><p>\"Prepare more gene reagents for him.\"</p><br/><p>The person from the Genetic Union glanced at the people from the Gene Production Association, \"No matter what, he is still humanity's strongest producer.\"</p><br/><p>The Gene Production Association spoke tyrannically. \"Don't worry. Even if he can't reach beyond B class naturally, we will still produce a sufficient number of gene reagents, enabling him to trigger the power of beyond any time he wants.\"</p><br/><p>However, the power of beyond one had comprehended was still different from the power of beyond triggered by a gene reagent. Chen Feng had contributed greatly to this project, yet unexpectedly, this contribution of his couldn't really help himself.</p><br/><p>\"What a pity\u2026\"</p><br/><p>They exchanged glances and saw the regret in their eyes. Right this moment.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a flash of gold erupted from Chen Feng's body. That dazzling radiance was akin to a surging river, almost blinding the people there.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The gold radiance surged. That comparatively ordinary power around Chen Feng became extremely terrifying. This remained for a short instant before his power returned to its previous state. He opened his eyes. A terrifying gold radiance shone from his eyes. This was the remaining power from his eruption earlier.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone widened their eyes and watched this scene with unbelieving expressions. Chen Feng had not said anything, yet they had still felt that powerful and familiar power. That was the power of beyond B class! He had actually broken through just like that?</p><br/><p>They gulped and asked cautiously, \"Have you broken through?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Chen Feng looked at them with an odd expression. \"What were you guys muttering about earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone sunk into silence. They all exchanged glances and remained in a long stupor. One single attempt, and just like that, he'd broken through? Was this the one who had scored one point for his potential? Was this the so-called \"nearly impossible to comprehend\" as stated by the chip? They all looked at the person from the Research Agency.</p><br/><p>The person from the Research Agency panicked as well. \"Has there been an error?\"</p><br/><p>The data they had used as a basis had been collected from a sample size of several tens of thousands of people. It was supposed to be correct. Hastily, he told the researchers to once again verify their data. Alas, after the verification, no problems whatsoever were found. Nowadays, their sample size was no longer that small. No less than 10 million people had used their chip and uploaded their results. Even with such a large sample size, no problems were found with their calculation. This was especially true for those who had scored similarly to Chen Feng. Nearly all of them were commoners, and none of them had any chance of breaking through.</p><br/><p>\"That Chen Feng\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The person from the Research Agency was dumbstruck. If news of someone with such a low score comprehending the power of beyond in a single attempt spread, the accuracy of their chip would most probably start being doubted.</p><br/><p>The boss of the Research Agency sighed. \"Change the data for Chen Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\"Change to what?\"</p><br/><p>\"Change his rating to legendary.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Only now did the people there recover from their stupor and start congratulating Chen Feng. Chen Feng curled his lip, as he was aware of what these people had been thinking earlier. However\u2026</p><br/><p>He clenched both his fists tightly. He could clearly feel that power coursing within him. If the power coursing within him could have been described as a clear spring previously, presently, this power could be described as a violent tsunami. Even if he was still a B class, his power now\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>With a single punch, the earth seemed to quake. This was the power of beyond B class. When wielded by someone like Chen Feng, who had initially already been capable of transcending classes when battling, this power appeared even more powerful.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like I have reached the bottleneck to A class.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. From A1 to A9, from beyond A1 to beyond A9, he truly wanted to see how far could he reach. Right at this moment, an employee rushed into the room, \"Boss Chen, headquarters sent us a message. Traces of the ancient race have been found at the marketplace.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was over. Chen Feng's mouth curled up, forming a smile. His consciousness and Xiao Ying's were connected in the first place. Therefore, all the charm and spiritual attacks launched by senior apprentice sister had all been transferred over to Xiao Ying. This was also the reason for Xiao Ying's bizarre actions\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng acted and destroyed everything.</p><br/><p>The senior apprentice sister's mournful scream reverberated through the air. \"No!\" She stared on blankly as her world of charm collapsed and her body received heavy injuries instantly. She had never imagined that even after her rebirth, she would have to suffer this. This was not supposed to be possible. She was the strongest existence. Even her master had fallen under her control. How could she suffer at the hands of a mere human?</p><br/><p>No! Impossible! She went crazy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sneered and ignored her. \"Ah.\" He focused on the memory fragments and looked for the real source of her strength. There had to be a reason for her abrupt increase in strength. Chen Feng's sharp gaze swept past the memory fragments before stopping on a certain fragment. It was a pink fragment, yet the pink on this particular fragment was deeper and had a slight glossy tint to it. Even amid the sea of countless pink fragments, it appeared unordinary.</p><br/><p>\"Related to this?\" Chen Feng instinctively reached out to grab it. Astonishingly, just as his hand was about to land on that fragment, the fragment streaked away and instantly vanished over the horizon. The speed it had moved at was petrifying.</p><br/><p>\"This thing\u2026\" Chen Feng was shocked. It actually had an independent consciousness?</p><br/><p>\"A primordial power could be felt,\" the little turtle said as his head popped out of his shell behind Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the vanishing ray of light with his brows knitted together tightly. Primordial power? Why had this power appeared here? Why had it appeared in the body of Qin Hai's senior apprentice sister? Chen Feng sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>The sharp voice of the senior apprentice sister resounded. \"Chen Feng!\" She was already heavily injured and hadn't noticed the departure of that pink energy at all. She was trying to regain control of the situation. A mere human\u2026</p><br/><p>She reasoned that since Chen Feng had personally left his sea of consciousness and had separated from that tiny snake, her charm would most certainly work on him now.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Once again, the power of charm bloomed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng snorted. \"Ridiculous.\" With a light jab of his finger, all of her power disintegrated. Indeed, after losing the support of that wondrous energy, the present senior apprentice sister had returned to how she had been before, a peak beyond A class. She was still extremely formidable, but against Chen Feng\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>With a random wave of Chen Feng's hand, she was blasted away.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered about.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"It's finally over.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swept out. The earth trembled and the pink energy receded. Slowly, the world returned to normal. All the pink started to vanish. The center of the Land of Legacy returned to normal.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed upon the sky. \"The sky is clear now.\"</p><br/><p>The sky, which had been enveloped in pink for a long time, was once again blue and sunny.</p><br/><p>Qin Hai sighed. \"Yeah.\" They hadn't been in this Land of Legacy for long, yet what they had experienced made it feel like several years had passed. The numerous unimaginable abilities that they'd had to deal with had caused them extreme exhaustion. Fortunately, it had all ended.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng noticed some movement. \"The Genetic Union is coming.\" Since the abnormality surrounding the Land of Legacy had vanished, the Genetic Union would most certainly enter shortly.</p><br/><p>\"I know,\" Qin Hai said. \"I will take them away first. You can come later.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng nodded slightly. \"Mhm.\" With Qin Hai's identity, it was indeed rather unsuitable for him to appear before the other humans.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Qin Hai vanished with Duma and the rest. After a short while, the Genetic Union members arrived.</p><br/><p>They were all overjoyed to see him. \"Chen Feng!\"</p><br/><p>\"Clear up the things here,\" Chen Feng said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\"It's good that you are fine.\" Li Lei was incomparably agitated. Shortly after, he looked around the Land of Legacy. \"What in the world happened here, exactly?\"</p><br/><p>\"Some minor problems.\" Chen Feng gave a rough description.</p><br/><p>Li Lei gasped in astonishment. \"Pink origin\u2026 Primordial power\u2026\" He had never expected that in such a short period of time, so many things had happened. He had also never expected that the primordial power was the reason for all of this.</p><br/><p>\"I will let you handle the rest over here,\" Chen Feng said. \"I still have something I need to do.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\" Li Lei paused and continued, \"Remember to be extra careful.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Chen Feng left. Qin Hai was waiting for him at the ancient race's palace. When he arrived, Duma and the rest were already regaining consciousness.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng cupped his hands and greeted Duma. \"Senior.\"</p><br/><p>He wasn't particularly afraid of this Duma. The present Duma had been greatly weakened and was not as powerful as he had once been. Otherwise, Chen Feng would probably have killed him off earlier when he'd had the chance.</p><br/><p>\"Many thanks\u2026\" Duma said with a complicated expression. At this time, Qin Hai's other fellow apprentice brothers woke up, exchanged glances, and thanked Chen Feng before leaving. Regardless of how much they were against the integration of humans and ancients, as Chen Feng had saved them during this incident at the Land of Legacy, they were no longer qualified to object to the integration.</p><br/><p>\"Yo, old turtle, you're awake?\" The little turtle clicked his tongue in wonder. \"How does it feel, for your body to be fully exhausted of energy?\"</p><br/><p>Duma: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng did not know whether to laugh or cry either.</p><br/><p>\"Senior,\" Chen Feng said with a solemn expression. \"May I ask, what exactly happened?\"</p><br/><p>Everything that had happened at the Land of Legacy had originated from the mysterious pink energy. However, where had the mysterious energy come from? Why had it appeared? How had it happened? Chen Feng was clueless.</p><br/><p>Duma sighed. \"Due to my greed. I once saw an item somewhere. From it, I sensed primordial power. As such, I wanted to take it for my own use. Unfortunately, even with my strength, I was unable to approach that item. As such, I unsealed a remnant item of the Primordial Era that I had, trying to fight poison with poison. As a result\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Duma shook his head. \"I received grave injuries, and the energy contained in the remnant item from the Primordial Era escaped.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng contemplated. So the pink energy was what escaped?</p><br/><p>\"I was gravely injured at that time, and that girl was good at controlling others\u2026\" Duma laughed bitterly. He had never expected that a day would come when he would fall under the control of one of his disciples. Initially, he had only wanted to use the power of the Primordial Era to obtain that stone that similarly contained the power of the Primordial Era. Unexpectedly, he had still overestimated himself\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Although I lived through the Primordial Era, at that time, I was a newborn. Otherwise, I wouldn't have escaped the calamity that happened to everyone else. I don't have much understanding of that era\u2026 However, that pink energy is definitely not something ordinary. Even back in the Primordial Era, it should have been qualified to be listed in the ranks of the strongest powers. Otherwise, it could not possess such strength. Now that it has escaped\u2026\" Duma was deeply worried. \"Things will be extremely dangerous.\"</p><br/><p>If it was able to find another person like Qin Hai's senior apprentice sister, it might be able to control the entire world for real.</p><br/><p>\"My strength will not recover anytime soon. I'm afraid you will have to be the one to deal with this.\" Duma looked at Chen Feng. \"I have seen the rise and fall of countless eras. It has indeed been hard for humans and ancients to reach this level. Hopefully, you will not turn on each other. Naturally, as the price for this peace, you can ask me anything you want to know. I can tell you everything I know about the awakened.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes shone.</p><br/><p>He knew nothing about the awakened. If Duma could teach him, perhaps he could truly improve and become even stronger.</p><br/><p>As for that pink energy\u2026 he had never intended to leave it alone anyway. The so-called primordial power gave him an extremely ominous feeling. He could not allow such a mysterious and peculiar power to continue existing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain city, Han Yula returned home after finishing his work for the day.</p><br/><p>\"Little Tong.\" [1] 1 He opened the door, filled with expectations. Unfortunately, nobody was found.</p><br/><p>Is she out?</p><br/><p>His heart chilled. He knew that Little Tong was \"playful\" in nature and enjoyed \"those activities.\" However, they had already been married for a month, and he was capable of cloning himself now, capable of fulfilling her desires.</p><br/><p>\"Little Tong?\" Han Yula called out several times, and his heart chilled when he received no response. Just as his heart chilled, suddenly, his expression became solemn. With his powerful senses, he discovered something abnormal.</p><br/><p>Above their bed, on their wedding picture, two sweetly smiling people could be seen. Different from the past, in this picture, a different color had appeared: pink.</p><br/><p>\"Little Tong\u2026 What happened?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

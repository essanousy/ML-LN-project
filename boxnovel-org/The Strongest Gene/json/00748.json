Looking at the bead in his hand, he proceeded to start pushing the bead toward his eyes.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was shocked. \"What are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>Spirit's eyes went wide. \"A world into an eye\u2026 He is trying to devour the entire human world! He is trying to use this method to transform the entirety of humanity into a resource that will provide him a steady and unending flow of godly power and faith!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Boundless black godly power could be clearly seen seeping into the world. That was the power of the Sin God. With this, all of humanity's greed, evil, and desire was evoked. The instant this godly power seeped into the world, chaos erupted.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Next, a huge amount of godly power started flowing out of the world.</p><br/><p>\"What is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"The godly power of sin! The Sin God used a small amount of godly power to induce the entire population of this world to start committing sins. From this, a huge amount of the godly power of sin is being generated and supplied to him. The entire world has transformed into his slave.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>At the center of the human territory, a huge pitch-black sculpture descended. That was the sculpture of the Sin God, signifying the end of humanity.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The entire human world had actually transformed into a bead that had subsequently transformed into the Sin God's eye. One could even clearly see the numerous landscapes within the Sin God's eye.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The entire world started rotating, seemingly searching for the most fitting position to settle itself into the Sin God's eye. Chen Feng chilled. Through his godly power, he could clearly sense the never-ending flow of godly power from this bead that was subsequently pouring into the Sin God. As of now, this world was like a seed pulsing with a never-ending supply of power for the Sin God.</p><br/><p>The human world would not be destroyed, as the Sin God would not allow it. However, as Chen Feng looked at the world ridden with sin, he wondered if this was still the Genetic Era he knew. Humanity was finished, and he could only watch on helplessly. He couldn't even put forth any sort of resistance, since he was too weak.</p><br/><p>In this situation where the powers of luck and misfortune couldn't achieve anything, it would be a joke to hope that Chen Feng's own strength would be capable of contending against this Sin God.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit\u2026\" Chen Feng was hoping that his Luck Aura could still do something. Alas, Spirit could only shake her head. The Sin God's excessive strength had reduced all probabilities into nothing but a joke.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>The bead's rotation was slowing down. The godly power of sin still poured out unceasingly. At this time, the entire world slowed down, as it seemed to have finally found a fitting position to settle itself in.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The godly power started consolidating as everything seemed to start calming down. The border at the edges of the world became distinct. Chen Feng knew that this was the prelude for the full integration of the human world into the Sin God. When the border fully solidified, this world would completely become part of the Sin God, becoming a world within his eye.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Kong Bai pulled at Chen Feng. \"Go. We must leave.\"</p><br/><p>A battle at this level was not one they could get involved in. The only thing they could do was flee before the entire world was fully locked down.</p><br/><p>\"This world\u2026 has to suffer such a fate?\" Chen Feng muttered.</p><br/><p>\"The world will not be destroyed. So long as the Sin God remains alive, he will not allow this world to be destroyed. However, to generate the godly power of sin for him, the entire world will be filled with slaughter and sin\u2026\" Qin Hai sighed. \"Humanity shall enter the darkest of ages.\"</p><br/><p>\"The darkest of ages?\" Chen Feng muttered. He looked at the world before him, looking on as the humans, who had finally obtained peace after great difficulty, started killing each other again. Suddenly, he asked, \"Spirit\u2026 do you trust me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Without hesitation, Spirit replied, \"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed at this world silently. \"I will return again.\"</p><br/><p>\"I will most definitely return! Before I return, I hope you can protect this world\u2026 At the very least, protect those you are capable of protecting. Allow those people a lifeline amid all this madness. That is all I ask of you.\"</p><br/><p>As Chen Feng spoke, a stone hovered out of his hand, flickering with the glow of the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>Spirit laughed bitterly. \"I don't know if I can do that.\" She had zero confidence, as the opponent this time was the Sin God, and this was a world within his body.</p><br/><p>\"Therefore, allow her to assist you.\" Chen Feng's other hand stretched out, the Misfortune Pen hovering out of his hand.</p><br/><p>\"I hope you can assist Spirit\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"She will help those that require help. As for you\u2026 Try your best to stop those damnable evildoers from bringing disaster to others, even if this is now a world of sin. My only hope is that when I return, this world will still exist. After all, in this world, there are still people with kindness in them.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>The Misfortune Pen started glowing brightly.</p><br/><p>Spirit looked at Chen Feng solemnly. \"I will be waiting for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Go!\" Chen Feng shut his eyes slowly.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Noiselessly, the Fate Stone departed his body and the Misfortune Pen vanished. Two gods that had yet to fully recover slowly fused with the world. The faint radiance of their godly powers slowly dispersed, noiselessly influencing this world without being detected by the Sin God.</p><br/><p>Ka! Ka!</p><br/><p>It was at this time that the rotation of the world became slower and slower. Gradually, the bead settled within the Sin God's body. Slowly\u2026 slowly\u2026</p><br/><p>With a loud boom.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>At the instant of the loud boom, Kong Bai grabbed Qin Hai and Chen Feng. \"Now!\"</p><br/><p>Swish!</p><br/><p>The three of them vanished. Instantly, the entire world trembled, and the Sin God's eyes shone brightly. When he opened his eyes, what he saw was an unending supply of godly power from the human world. As for that particular human? Chen Feng? What did he count as? All along, the Sin God had never been bothered about him. Even several thousand gods were nothing but bugs for him, let alone a mere mortal.</p><br/><p>For him, a single wave of his hand was sufficient to make the entire human world his. To be more precise, all the life-forms of the Genetic Era were now his.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Forest Goddess watched on silently. She wanted to ask about Chen Feng, as she was still worried about that fellow. However, as she looked at the radiant Sin God, suddenly, she had a feeling that inquiring about a weak mortal would in itself be an act of insult to the Sin God. Since everything was already a foregone conclusion, what was the point of asking about Chen Feng? He was but a mere mortal.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Numerous gods appeared behind the Sin God. These were the final 100 surviving gods from earlier. Ultimately, they had not had the courage to battle the Sin God and had opted to submit to him. This would be the era of the Sin God.</p><br/><p>The Sin God waved his hand. \"Go.\" The humans and ancients would belong to him alone. As for those unintelligent animals and mutated beasts, they were given as believers to the gods that had submitted to him.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>The gods saluted him deferentially before leaving. They started traversing the whole world, reining in their believers.</p><br/><p>\"Almost done,\" the Sin God said as he looked at the world below him.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He waved his hand. The ground started trembling. With the humans and the Genetic Era out of the way, this world now belonged to him alone. Within this world, too many gods were sealed, including those gods who had once battled for him.</p><br/><p>\"Awaken\u2026\" he muttered.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Countless divine beams surged out. Finally, this planet had once again returned to the Primordial Era, returning to the era of gods. As for the humans, ancients, and the other intelligent life-forms, they were all contained within the Sin God's eyes. They were still within their respective cities, which had seemingly not changed. They were killing each other, fighting constantly, generating an unending supply of the godly power of sin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The mysterious stone had revealed itself, and the aura of a god had once again appeared. There had been no further absurd difficulties or hurdles to get through before reaching this stone. They had only needed to pass through the quagmire and kill a couple monsters to arrive here, to see this stone left behind by a god. Just like that, it floated there, causing one's heart to flutter.</p><br/><p>Thomas's eyes gleamed brightly. \"This aura\u2026\" This was absolutely the aura of a god! He had once experienced a similar aura from his lord. If he could make this stone his, perhaps he could help his lord recover even earlier. The rest of them were incredibly tempted by this stone as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart jolted furiously. \"This stone\u2026\" The moment he saw this stone, he was incomparably certain that this was most definitely another fate stone, one even more powerful than the one he'd had. The Luck Aura within him started bubbling up.</p><br/><p>Spirit could no longer hold back her emotions. \"Ah ah ah ah\u2014this is it! I can feel it. With this, our strength will transform qualitatively, achieving true resonance!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng narrowed his eyes. \"Resonance?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Spirit was agitated. \"Not only Luck Aura. The power contained within this stone is capable of increasing the strength of both of us greatly.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng maintained his narrowed eyes. \"Is that so?\" Was that because this was also a fate stone? The shape of this thing was rather unique. It was a stone, yet there was a depression on it, leaving one-fifth of it empty, looking incredibly wondrous. Chen Feng looked at the indentation on it. It seemed like\u2026 his fate stone was of this shape?</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Chen Feng finally understood. In short, his fate stone would only be a true fate stone after reuniting with this stone, truly possessing the power of a god. It was no wonder he could feel the agitation of his Luck Aura, akin to two pieces of a magnet that longed after each other, attracting each other incessantly.</p><br/><p>Letting them combine was the only path he could take.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was looking pensive. Is this why you summoned me?</p><br/><p>Grasping her tiny fists tightly, Spirit spoke in excitement. \"Snatch! Snatch! Snatch! The fate stone will definitely side with us. Regardless of how strong the four of them are, this stone will belong to us! Hmph! So long as we get to touch this stone\u2026 those three will have no hope.\"</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the mood became tense. This temporary team of five had only been established shortly, yet just like that, it was dissolved. There was truly no helping it. Since the mysterious stone had appeared, what was the point of further cooperation? This was something none of them had seen coming.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Just as Chen Feng was contemplating without stop, Thomas moved against the stone, trying to snatch it. At exactly the same time, Wu Liang moved without hesitation as well.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The two level 10 awakened started battling. By the side, Wealthy Zhao, Sakata Chuunibyou and Chen Feng looked at each other, and killing intent bloomed in the air.</p><br/><p>\"Come! For Lord Goddess!\" Sakata Chuunibyou howled heroically before moving.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The battle erupted.</p><br/><p>With this, the present combat power of Sakata Chuunibyou was clearly displayed: level-nine awakened.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng frowned and unleashed his resonance combat power without hesitation: level-nine awakened. Similarly, Wealthy Zhao unleashed his combat power, also level-nine awakened. The three of them were actually all at level-nine awakened.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The three fought each other. Not far away, Thomas and Wu Liang fought each other as well. The five surrounded the mysterious stone. Anyone that tried to approach the stone was attacked by everyone else. This was a chaotic battle. The only constant was that no one was allowed to approach that stone.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>People were blasted away from the stone without stop. However, whoever was blasted away would charge back into the battle tenaciously. For resonators like them, so long as their energy wasn't exhausted, they would not suffer any true injury.</p><br/><p>At this time\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was blasted away. The rest glanced at him, then ignored him.</p><br/><p>However, something that alarmed all of them happened. The instant Chen Feng was blasted away, the mysterious floating stone, which had remained still all this while, moved. With a flash, it streaked straight at Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not good!\"</p><br/><p>Their expressions sank.</p><br/><p>This thing\u2026 was actually capable of moving? They were all alarmed, and they charged at Chen Feng at the same time.</p><br/><p>Within Chen Feng, Spirit was ecstatic. \"Here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>Indeed. She knew that this stone belonged to Chen Feng. Regardless of how powerful those damnable resonators were, they could not hope to lay their hands on it.</p><br/><p>\"Haha. You can kill them all upon your breakthrough into the realm of resonance,\" Spirit said proudly. Right at this moment...</p><br/><p>Thomas sneered. \"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Radiance swirled around him, emanating the aura of a resonator.</p><br/><p>They had yet to recover their full strength. As such, if possible, none wished to utilize the true power of resonance, only utilizing the power of an awakened one. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Thomas's eyes gleamed coldly. \"Resonance: War God's Power!\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura surged out. Resonance was so scary only because it was a power that utilized the strength of a god, a power capable of utilizing those incredibly alarming powers!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The heavens and earth seemed to roll over before this power. The initially spotlessly white clouds in the sky started condensing before assuming the shape of a huge hatchet, and the blue sky turned into a blue cloth that wrapped around the immense hatchet, transforming the hatchet into a huge sky-blue hatchet. One could vaguely see that above the hatchet, the blue sky and white clouds remained.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 was the hatchet of the skies.</p><br/><p>\"Slash!\" Thomas said with a cold gaze.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The earth trembled. The hatchet landed, leaving an immense gorge in the ground, cutting off the path of the stone toward Chen Feng, forcing the stone to retreat. Both Chen Feng and the stone could only stare at each other with a gorge between them, yet the gorge appeared like a precipice. Around the gorge, the aura of the War God swirled around. If the stone insisted on charging through, it would definitely be infected with the aura of the War God.</p><br/><p>Hence, it had no choice but to stop.</p><br/><p>Thomas sneered. \"Hehe. I don't know what you have done to attract it, but aren't you being too arrogant if you are thinking of monopolizing this stone in front of us four resonators?\"</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou erupted with a similarly terrifying power. \"By the name of god, dimensional rampart!\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swirled around, instantly blockading the space three meters around the mysterious stone.</p><br/><p>Sakata Chuunibyou smiled. \"Or perhaps this divine stone itself was selecting its master? It does not matter. Although I don't know the reason you moved yourself, the power of a god about you has been locked. Within the dimensional rampart, the powers of all gods are rendered ineffective. For now, you are but a mere regular stone.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Liang and the rest sneered as well. With this, before the fusion process of the stone had even started, it ended. Spirit's watery eyes were filled with fury. Finally, she understood why Chen Feng hadn't charged directly toward the stone. That was because the strength of these resonators was indeed incredibly terrifying. The borrowed powers of the gods were indeed dreadful.</p><br/><p>The mere sight of the gorge left behind by the hatchet was sufficient to plant fear in Spirit's heart. What should they do, then? She felt conflicted. They were only around 10 meters away from the stone, but that damnable gorge was between them. They could see it, but they couldn't touch it!</p><br/><p>Spirit pouted. \"So angry!\"</p><br/><p>However, right at this instant, she found with surprise that Luck Aura had been reactivated!</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Spirit told Chen Feng with joy.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was surprised as well. \"Reactivated?\" This power that had remained still for so long had actually been reactivated right at this moment of crisis? Was this the work of that stone?</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026 you both are the same thing.</p><br/><p>Spirit was happy. \"This is a temporary reactivation. Looks like the fate stone is helping us. It does not matter. Even if it is only a temporary reactivation, it is already sufficient. With this\u2026 hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Spirit waved her tiny hands around proudly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, a random spatial current appeared beside Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was sucked within and instantly vanished.</p><br/><p>When he appeared once again, he was beside the stone. That's right. Here at this place with no traces of spatial power, a spatial current had been created by utilizing the spatial power someone else was using in another part of the world, channeling it over \"coincidentally,\" creating this spatial current that had instantly placed Chen Feng right beside the stone. Transforming an impossibility into a possibility! This was exactly what Chen Feng had guessed long ago. With sufficient luck value, Luck Aura was undefeatable.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng appeared beside the fate stone.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint radiance swirled about. Both the Luck Aura within Chen Feng and the fate stone were radiating the exact same radiance.</p><br/><p>\"Not good!\"</p><br/><p>Finally, the expressions of Wealthy Zhao and the rest changed.</p><br/><p>It's over!</p><br/><p>None of them had expected that even during such a crucial moment, Chen Feng had this trick hidden up his sleeve. He could actually cause that damnable spatial current to appear at any time. Instinctively, they tried charging forth to stop Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 it was too late. They could only stare on blankly as that mysterious stone streaked toward Chen Feng, trying to fuse into his chest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, their eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Huh???</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>That was because, right as the stone was about to fuse with Chen Feng, just as it was about to enter Chen Feng's body, Chen Feng leaped and avoided the stone by himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

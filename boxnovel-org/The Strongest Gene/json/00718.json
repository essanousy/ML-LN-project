However, none of you are aware that he was also my father\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's eyes went wide. Dang, there was this inside story? He had originally believed that gods appearing in the mortal realm with numerous identities and fathering numerous kids was something that only happened in the Greek mythology of his previous life. Surprisingly, it existed here as well.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye gazed at Chen Feng coldly and gloomily said, \"I will definitely kill the Luck Goddess. This includes you as well.\"</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His intense killing intent surged. At this moment, even the others outside the barrier could sense this killing intent.</p><br/><p>\"Tsk tsk, Zhou Ye is losing his temper.\"</p><br/><p>\"Old Zhou's temper is still as bad as ever\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe. This foolish kid is still thinking of convincing us all with his words alone? How ridiculous.\"</p><br/><p>The first batch of resonators contacted by Zhou Ye were waiting for the result of this negotiation with an expression of disdain. As for those who had been gathered into Chen Feng's camp, they had a bad feeling and wanted to enter, but they were stopped from entering.</p><br/><p>One of them glanced over and said, \"Hey, bro, that fellow from your side is the one who suggested a one-minute discussion. What's the rush?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Those who had already signed Chen Feng's contract of a god could only stop and watch on anxiously. They truly had no idea why Wang Feng had insisted on negotiating this. What was there to talk about with these people? They should just kill these people and get it over with.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Forty seconds.</p><br/><p>Fifty seconds.</p><br/><p>Everyone waited anxiously. The killing intent that had appeared suddenly vanished, and afterward, no other signs of activity could be detected. Everyone was curious as to the content of their negotiation. None of them had any idea, but they were all sure that Zhou Ye would not agree to whatever it was.</p><br/><p>\"That is, after all, a grudge arising from the murder of one's father\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Everyone lamented. Back then, countless casualties had arisen in the chaotic war. The power of the Luck Goddess was too unique and had been capable of enveloping the entire battlefield, affecting everyone. As such, nearly every death had thus been related to her in some way or another. This blame had to be shouldered by the Luck Goddess alone.</p><br/><p>\"Negotiations are nothing but a waste of time\u2026\" one person said. However, before he could even finish his sentence, he saw both Chen Feng and Zhou Ye leaving the room.</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye had an odd expression on his face\u2014somewhat stupefied, somewhat shocked\u2014and was staring ahead vacantly. On the contrary, opposite him, Chen Feng had an expression of utmost bliss.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>What's going on? Everyone was stupefied.</p><br/><p>\"The negotiation\u2026\" someone probed cautiously.</p><br/><p>\"I agreed,\" Zhou Ye said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone's eyes widened, and a lot of them were furious when they heard this.</p><br/><p>\"Old Zhou, what are you doing?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, you are the one who gathered us in the first place!\"</p><br/><p>\"You have actually betrayed us?\"</p><br/><p>They could not understand the reason for this.</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2014\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Ye had a strange expression and shrugged, not knowing how to explain this. He could only say, \"He indeed persuaded me. Any of you who do not find this satisfactory can enter the room with him.\"</p><br/><p>One person stood up in anger. \"Let me in, then.\" He was also someone whose family members had perished in that world. He similarly had a grudge that could not be erased. He refused to believe that a mere one-minute negotiation would be able to erase it.</p><br/><p>He walked into the room as everyone around stared with wide eyes. After one minute\u2014no, to be more precise, after a mere 40 seconds, he similarly walked out with a bewildered, stupefied, and odd expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Old Zhang\u2026\" the rest asked.</p><br/><p>Old Zhang smiled bitterly. \"I agreed.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>This time, everyone was dumbstruck. Agreed as well? Another one? What in the world was going on here? Everyone was clueless. Since this fellow was the spokesperson of the Luck Goddess, his power was naturally be related to luck. They had all experienced it before and were aware that as fellow resonators, they all had rather impressive combat power and would not agree to this Chen Feng by threat of force. Was he offering them some benefits to get them to agree?</p><br/><p>That did not seem possible either. What kind of benefits could get one to forget about the death of one's family? And thus, one indignant resonator after another entered the room. Next, one stupefied resonator after another exited the room. This caused those resonators that had zero trust in Chen Feng to be thoroughly dumbfounded. Of course, even those resonators that exited the room had the same dumbfounded expression. Even when questioned, they had no idea how to answer. What could they say?</p><br/><p>Should they tell them that Chen Feng had not even spent much time trying to convince them? He had merely spent some time gaining understanding of their hatred toward the Luck Goddess before passing some information to them in a profound manner.</p><br/><p>\"Let me introduce you to the Misfortune Goddess.\"</p><br/><p>And next\u2026 Well, there were no next.</p><br/><p>When they saw that document emanating the power of misfortune, when they realized that this fellow was using the name of the Luck Goddess to scam the people here, they did not know whether to laugh or cry. They were sure that from the Primordial Era until now, never had they encountered such a shameless person\u2026 apart from the Luck Goddess.</p><br/><p>At present, most of those that had not been gathered under Chen Feng's camp were hostile toward the Luck Goddess. As such, using the Misfortune Goddess, 80% of them were dealt with easily. As for the rest of them\u2026</p><br/><p>Mhm\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Feng checked the list of names that had signed his contract. Nearly 80% of the people here had already signed the contract, agreeing that they would advance or retreat together with him. Those refusing to sign? Well, they would not be able to even leave alive. Ultimately, this bunch of 30-odd resonators was dealt with by Chen Feng.</p><br/><p>These resonators had no choice but to obey Chen Feng's commands and move together with him on this salt lake. However, this was limited to only this operation. After leaving, all of these resonators would regain their freedom. This was a rule Chen Feng had personally set. Otherwise, who would have agreed to sign the contract?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at everyone with a wide smile. \"Well then\u2026 I suppose we will all be working together temporarily. Since everyone has entered a temporary alliance, I shall speak the truth. The Luck Goddess is too weakened presently and doesn't have much godly power left. She will not be able to help us all enter. Therefore, this trip through the salt lake will still be filled with danger. However, we only need to survive this until the awakening of the Forest Goddess. The moment she awakens, I believe our spring will arrive as well. I trust that with so many resonators here, with all our godly powers, we will be able to traverse this salt lake.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was filled with fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>All the resonators nodded their heads. Even if this salt lake was laden with danger, when so many resonators who would normally not work together decided to work together, they would be unequaled.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Godly powers erupted. Numerous formidable godly powers swirled about. This last-minute alliance organized by Chen Feng was unprecedentedly formidable.</p><br/><p>\"May the goddess be with you,\" Chen Feng said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\"May the goddess be with you,\" countless people chanted together. As for Zhou Ye, he exchanged glances with Chen Feng and smiled profoundly. They were the only ones who knew which \"goddess\" they were talking about.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The alliance set forth. At present, within the forest, the Luck Goddess was frowning. She did not have too much godly power left and could not observe the happenings at the salt lake. If she used her godly power for observation, the exhaustion rate would be too immense for her liking. Moreover, these resonators were but mere bugs\u2026</p><br/><p>Alas, something did not seem right there. She could feel the surging godly powers there even from this far away. She could clearly feel the momentum... and that incredibly familiar aura and godly power!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

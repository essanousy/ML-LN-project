Now that their bodies were much stronger than those of regular people, there was an innate resistance built into their bodies toward such external effects. As such, they hadn't paid it much attention. Now that they focused their attention on their bodies, they noted that the gravity here was indeed much lower than other places.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng tried punching forth and was welcomed with a soft feeling, as if he had just punched cotton. Indeed, the environment here was very different.</p><br/><p>\"It seems like there's no oxygen here either,\" Si Fan pointed out.</p><br/><p>\"Oxygen\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Their hearts jolted. With the powerful bodies they had as peak beyond B classes, their bodies only required oxygen when training or improving themselves. For normal operations, their bodies could nearly stop using oxygen. However, they had only reached a state where they were nearly free of their dependence on oxygen rather than absolute freedom. Without oxygen, their bodily functions would not be able to recover and they could only maintain their present states. The moment they suffered any injuries or accidents, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\"Let me take a look.\" Once again, Qian Chen sensed around. After a while, he opened his eyes. \"Oxygen is not the only thing missing here. To be exact, we are currently in a vacuum. There isn't any energy in the air either.\"</p><br/><p>No energy! Their hearts sank as they heard this. They could accept the lack of oxygen and being in a vacuum. To a certain degree, energy would be able to replace these bodily needs of theirs. However, without energy\u2026 That signified that they would be truly incapable of recovering here at this place. This also signified that after their energy was exhausted, they would be truly finished. This was the scariest aspect of this place. Chen Feng pondered. Was this the type of tempering this place offered?</p><br/><p>Qian Chen's gaze became resolute. \"It looks like, in essence, this is a training camp that will force us to break through by subjecting us to such harsh conditions.\" Despite the harsh environment here, his gaze was now burning. He trusted deeply that he could most certainly break through here.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go. We are now only at the outer zone. When we reach there\u2026\" Qian Chen pointed forward. \"When we reach the inner zone, we can start cultivating.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng gazed over. There, the place Qian Chen was pointing at, was the area with the highest frequency of rocks streaking about. In this unique environment, all their senses were greatly restricted, and their bodily functions had dropped drastically as well. Despite all of this, they would still need to face those terrifying rocks\u2026 This was truly an environment of utmost harshness.</p><br/><p>\"There's no need to worry,\" Si Fan stated with a low voice. \"In fact, we still have a secret mission while we are here.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng was surprised. \"Oh?\"</p><br/><p>\"To protect you.\" Si Fan sighed. \"Both my family and Qian Chen's are underlings of the Genetic Union. Before coming, our families issued an absolute command that we must assure your safety. If something happens, we must assure that you can return alive before thinking about ourselves.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng wiped his sweat. Unexpectedly, his present status had reached the height where he was akin to a national treasure, and these two were his protectors?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled. Who would be doing the protecting was not a sure thing yet.</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Chen Feng did not bother giving them an explanation. They continued forward. Soon, they reached the inner zone.</p><br/><p>\"Let's start,\" Qian Chen stated flatly.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>He sat down cross-legged and started cultivating.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng and Si Fan were already used to his cold attitude. After exchanging glances, they both sat down and started cultivating as well. With this, their special training began.</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>Numerous rocks streaked back and forth midair. The three of them dodged the stones with utmost difficulty. This was a place where their senses were greatly reduced, a place where regular B classes would most probably suffer greatly. However, the three of them were ultimately elites among peak beyond B classes. The three of them were existences capable of battling those of a higher rank.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Slowly, their strength increased. In this unique environment, the nature of their energy transformed slowly. The beyond B class energy was slowly transforming, approaching the standard of a beyond A class. This place was indeed worthy of being the best rapid-growth training camp. Everything progressed smoothly. If there were no mishaps, Chen Feng would most certainly enter beyond A class this time.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>A faint energy bubbled up. The radiance surrounding their bodies started becoming mystical and powerful. After 10 minutes, Chen Feng became stronger. After half an hour, Chen Feng completed the transformation of his energy.</p><br/><p>After an hour, Chen Feng could feel that there was only a barrier separating him from beyond A class.</p><br/><p>After two hours, Chen Feng could feel that there was only a barrier separating him from beyond A class.</p><br/><p>After three hours, Chen Feng could feel that there was only a barrier separating him from beyond A class.</p><br/><p>???</p><br/><p>Chen Feng awoke from that mysterious state of mind. This feeling\u2026 Something seemed off? He could sense clearly how near he was to breaking through, yet he'd been stuck at this final step for two hours. He turned around and looked at Si Fan and Qian Chen. The both of them had seemingly entered beyond A class, as the energy surrounding them was changing qualitatively. If everything progressed smoothly, when they both awoke, they would both be fully fledged beyond A classes.</p><br/><p>Is my talent so poor?</p><br/><p>Chen Feng smiled bitterly. He was aware that he was not a genius. For him to have reached this height, apart from his hard work, the contribution of Luck Aura could not be neglected. After all, even if he had his Luck Aura, the other geniuses were all constantly working hard as well. As for Luck Aura, it had merely been able to make up for the talent that he so very lacked.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed. \"I didn't originally plan to use it.\" </p><br/><p>\"Spirit, activate Luck Aura,\" Chen Feng urged inwardly. \"Calculate the amount of luck value required for me to reach beyond A class.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit nodded. \"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Light swirled around. Spirit finished her analysis, yet an ugly expression appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\"What's up?\"</p><br/><p>Curious, Chen Feng took a look. Instantly, he was stunned. The amount shown was an extremely huge amount, an amount of luck value Chen Feng might not be able to obtain even after a lifetime of accumulation.</p><br/><p>\"9,982,333?\" Chen Feng's face darkened. Was this number meant to insult him or something like that? He was aware that he might lack talent. However, it shouldn't be this bad, right? This was too excessive! This appeared impossible now. Nearly 10 million luck value\u2026 What the heck? If he had that much luck value, rather than working hard like this, he could merely wish for world peace and then let luck deal with everything, right? That much luck value would be sufficient to even allow all the programmers in this world to finally obtain girlfriends.</p><br/><p>How excessive! Chen Feng was extremely disappointed.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng looked at Spirit. \"Spirit, have you optimized the Luck Aura inversely instead?\" In his memories, something like this was possible. In his previous life, there had been the sixth edition of a certain game, which the developers had forgotten to optimize prior to release, as they had been too busy thinking of ways to scam money out of the gamers. Ultimately, the released version had been so filled with bugs that it was worthy of being a legend in itself. Not only had the computer requirements for the game not lowered, they had increased by more than a hundredfold. Even the best graphics card of that time had not been able to run the game smoothly. This game had subsequently been known dearly by the consumers as Chinese Paladin, Sword and Fairy 6: The Fall of Titan.</p><br/><p>Spirit felt wronged. \"How is that possible?\" Let alone reverse optimization, for such a result, she couldn't even begin optimizing Luck Aura to reduce it.</p><br/><p>\"Try optimizing it, then,\" Chen Feng said after some thought.</p><br/><p>\"Mhm.\" Spirit waved her hand.</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the number rose from 9,982,333 to an eight-figure number.</p><br/><p>Spirit: \"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng: \"\u2026Inverse optimization indeed.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>\"How can you say that?\" Spirit pouted, feeling so wronged that she nearly cried.</p><br/><p>Chen Feng shook his head. \"It's not your fault.\" He knew himself how good Spirit's optimizations were. It was truly unexpected that when used to work on something concerning his talent, it would work inversely instead. Was his talent really so poor?</p><br/><p>This amount of luck value\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Feng felt like something did not seem right. One ought to know that even back then when he calculated the amount required to kill Lu Hun with bad luck alone, the amount given wasn't even this high. At that time, only 100,000 luck value had been required.</p><br/><p>If he had 100,000 luck value, Chen Feng would not even have needed to do anything. Lu Hun would have died purely from accidents. Naturally, it was simply impossible to obtain such a luck value. And now, just to break through into beyond A class, it would require nearly 10 million luck value? Something had to be wrong here. Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua!</p><br/><p>Chen Feng's heart trembled as he thought of a certain possibility.</p><br/><p>\"Spirit, investigate for me if anyone is causing a disturbance here,\" Chen Feng requested.</p><br/><p>\"All right.\"</p><br/><p>Spirit activated Luck Aura.</p><br/><p>Hum\u2014</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the red light blazed without stop in his illusory world. Chen Feng's expression changed instantly. Red light\u2026 this was the alarm signifying the highest degree of danger!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He looked in the mirror and smiled smugly at their son.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy, my hair is still wet,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018When your mummy first dried daddy\u2019s hair, you won\u2019t born yet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Stinky little boy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle is a stinky old man,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you say?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You need to speak louder. You sound like a mosquito.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle is a deaf old man,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stinky little demon\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun suddenly turned off the hair dryer and stood in between the duelling father and son.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m hungry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed and held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled her hand out of Han Yan Che\u2019s hand. She walked to the bed, picked up Na Liu Hao and put him down next to Hao Yan Che. She wrapped Hao Yan Che\u2019s big hand around Na Liu Hao\u2019s small hand, and held Na Liu Hao\u2019s other small hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018We can go now,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held his son\u2019s chubby hand. He was scared if he held too tight, his son\u2019s hand would break.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao couldn\u2019t deny how warm and protective the old man\u2019s hand was. He thought the old man was hateful, but he felt safe holding the old man\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>In the dining room, Yuan Gun Gun was used to feeding Na Liu Hao on her lap.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up his son from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lap and put his son on a chair.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t coddle our son forever,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You should let him sit on his own chair.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I like feeding Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He took the spoon out of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s and gave it to their son. \u2018He can eat on his own, and you should eat more.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun saw Na Liu Hao eat on his own so she didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put a lot of food into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bowl. Then he put some food into their son\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao looked at his small mountain bowl and at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s big mountain bowl. Then he scoffed at Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, what are you looking at?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You should eat your food, and you\u2019ll grow stronger.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Na Liu Hao quietly ate his small mountain bowl.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put a hand above her big mountain bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Enough,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I can\u2019t eat it all.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You need to put more food in your stomach,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che grabbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bowl and put more food into her bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need to eat that much,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sighed and accepted her bowl from Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Quickly eat everything,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know where to start eating.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought Yuan Gun Gun was too skinny. He missed his little rice ball.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun began eating the biggest mountain bowl she had seen.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao finished eating his small mountain bowl. Then he picked up his glass of milk and watched Yuan Gun Gun battle the big mountain bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, do you want me to take you back to your room to sleep?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sit and finish eating,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I need to take Hao Hao back to his room to sleep,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Our son isn\u2019t a pig,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018He doesn\u2019t need to sleep after eating.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, do you want to sleep?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was unhappy Yuan Gun Gun only ate half her bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eat more,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m full,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che slammed the dining table, and startled Yuan Gun Gun. He smiled, and held the bowl in front of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Open wide,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened her mouth a bit, and Hao Yan Che fed her food.</p><br/><p>Suddenly faint memories flew past Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mind. She wanted to hold onto the faint memories, but couldn\u2019t remember anything.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was sad she couldn\u2019t remember.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che touched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you feel sick?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 189</p><br/>\n</div>"}

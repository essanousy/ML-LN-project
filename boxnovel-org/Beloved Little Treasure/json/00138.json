Yi Tu didn\u2019t make a sound or defend himself while Hao Yan Che whipped him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held onto Hao Yan Che\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, don\u2019t hit,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun pleaded.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands away, and continued to whip Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun knelt at Hao Yan Che\u2019s feet, and she held onto his leg.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, don\u2019t hit,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re going to kill big brother Yi Tu. Che, I\u2019m begging you don\u2019t hit big brother Yi Tu.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Move out of the way,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Later it\u2019s your turn.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che whipped Yi Tu\u2019s ear. Yuan Gun Gun let go of Hao Yan Che\u2019s leg, and she knelt in front of Yi Tu to protect Yi Tu. Yi Tu hugged Yuan Gun Gun and protected her from Hao Yan Che\u2019s whip.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che immediately pulled back the whip. He was worried it struck his wife.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun freed herself from Yi Tu\u2019s embrace. She knelt in front of Yi Tu and begged Hao Yan Che again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, don\u2019t hit big brother Yi Tu,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Is your skin itchy?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Mrs Chen called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che raised the whip. Yuan Gun Gun covered her face, and waited for the whip to strike her. She waited a while, and nothing hit her. She uncovered her face, and didn\u2019t know how Hao Yan Che wrapped the whip around her without hurting her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che slung Yuan Gun Gun over his shoulder, and he carried her to their bedroom.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen sighed in relief. She was relieved Hao Yan Che loved Yuan Gun Gun and wouldn\u2019t whip Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu helped Yi Tu stand.</p><br/><p>\u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 Jia Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I feel loved,\u2019 Yi Tu said sarcastically.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can young master punish you this cruelly?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Jia Tu, help bandage Yi Tu\u2019s wounds.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not all the lashes were painful,\u2019 Yi Tu joked. \u2018When Gun Gun was protecting me, young master\u2019s whip felt like a feather scratching me. Young master sure plays favoritism.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you young master\u2019s wife?\u2019 Jia Tu asked sarcastically.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun was tossed on the bed and still bound.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 husband\u2026 Che\u2026 I\u2019m scared,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t hit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You know how to admit you\u2019re wrong quickly,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018But you know how to cause trouble quicker.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018But I didn\u2019t know my mummy would come here today to take me out,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying I misunderstood you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m saying I didn\u2019t intentionally leave,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s never a time you intentionally disobey me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018But every time I ask you to do something to keep you safe, my words fly out of your ears.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to go out. It\u2019s because mummy looked sad, and I agreed to go out with mummy to cheer her up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that why you chose to forget my words and went outside?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her mouth. She knew her husband was extra angry that day.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think would have happened if you didn\u2019t meet Long Liu Bao today?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you know what would have happened to you if you were kidnapped? How many times have I told you that it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re not smart as long as you listen to me and stay safe? Do my words reach your heart? Or is it if I don\u2019t let you do something, it makes you want to defy me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thumped the bed a millimetre from Yuan Gun Gun. The rope flew off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body. Yuan Gun Gun jumped off the bed and hid in a wardrobe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come out,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know I was wrong,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She whimpered in the wardrobe. \u2018Don\u2019t hit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Come out,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Don\u2019t make me say it a third time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened the wardrobe doors. She hid in the corner behind clothes, and looked pitifully at her husband.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun outside the wardrobe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t forget Yi Tu was punished because of you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you don\u2019t want the people around you that you care about be punished then you need to be good. Understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head, and Hao Yan Che wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, the truth is big brother Yi Tu didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Big brother Yi Tu made me promise not to leave while he went to buy food for me. I didn\u2019t listen to him. I went out to eat lunch with mummy. I thought I would be back home soon. I didn\u2019t think those scary men would capture me and mummy. They hit me. I was really scared. I didn\u2019t want to die, because I haven\u2019t given birth to your baby yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 138</p><br/>\n</div>"}

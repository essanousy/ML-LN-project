She had snow white skin, her body was like a little round ball. The black and white maid\u2019s uniform made her look like a seaweed wrapped rice ball. No matter what angle he looked at her face, she looked like a dummy, which meant she must be his parents\u2019 ideal daughter-in-law.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Hao Yan Che looked more handsome with his eyes opened. His eyes were violet like violet eyes she had seen somewhere buried deep in her memories.</p><br/><p>\u2018How will you turn me into paper?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018First I\u2019ll chop off your arms and legs,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Then I\u2019ll poke out your eyes, cut off your tongue, hammer your ears off, and lastly I\u2019ll nail your head to a wall.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun dropped the plunger and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Ting\u2026 big sister Wen\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Hao Yan Che was a scary beautiful monster.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che considered calling someone to whip Yuan Gun Gun for daring to wail in front of him.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen heard Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cry. They ran into the room and they were sad to see Yuan Gun Gun crying pitifully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 the Chen sisters greeted and bowed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to the Chen sisters, she hid behind them and her round face looked over their shoulders at the scary Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is she?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018She is Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018It\u2019s her first day working as a maid her. Young master if she offended you, forgive her first offence.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting was scared Hao Yan Che would vent his anger on Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Close your mouth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you don\u2019t stop crying, I\u2019ll sew your mouth close.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her mouth, and too scared to make a sound.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take her outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting was relieved Yuan Gun Gun got to stay alive.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched the little round ball leave his bedroom. He hated females like Yuan Gun Gun the most, a dummy who only knew how to cry.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, inside Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun hugged Chen Jia Ting on the bed and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><div></div><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, young master has a bad temper,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018He\u2019s good at cursing people, and punishes people cruelly. Apart from those traits, he isn\u2019t scary. Don\u2019t cry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If he isn\u2019t scary then nothing is scary,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, think about what you did wrong,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018Why did you want to poke young master with a plunger?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t find anything else to wake him up with,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I listened to big sister Ting, I didn\u2019t touch him. Besides, I didn\u2019t poke him with the plunger.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018Young master was lenient on you. If someone else cried in front of him, they would be dragged outside and be whipped.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Whip?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I want to go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, if you\u2019re good, no one will whip you,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Ting, can I be a maid for someone else?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018You\u2019re young master\u2019s maid. In the future you\u2019re responsible for serving him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be his maid. He\u2019ll turn me into paper.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018All the maids and butlers here needs to listen to Mrs Chen. There are no exceptions.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018Young master was only scaring you. He won\u2019t turn you into paper.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Wen gave Yuan Gun Gun an apple.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked and bit the apple.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m telling you the truth,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Wen thought Yuan Gun Gun was like a scared chubby deer.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quietly ate the apple.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Wen threw the apple core in the bin.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s late,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018Gun Gun, you need to serve dinner to young master.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How do I serve him?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Do I feed him food?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018You only need to carry the tray of food to his bedroom. Wait for him to finish eating dinner. Then take the tray away.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Hao Yan Che had a strange habit of wanting someone to watch him eat dinner.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Twenty-One</p><br/>\n</div>"}

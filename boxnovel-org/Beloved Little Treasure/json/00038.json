There was a big unused drawer beneath the book shelf furthest from Hao Yan Che\u2019s bed. The drawer could fit five people. There were decorative holes outside the drawer. It was a perfect hiding spot for her small friends. She lined the bottom of the drawer with blankets for them to sleep on, and she put food and water inside the drawer for them to eat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018At night, big sister will bring you back to my room. Don\u2019t let anyone see or hear you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran back to the pink bedroom before Chen Jia Wen knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, young master is back,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018He wants to see you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master is back early,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped sweat off her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun picked up the three tier meal box, and she followed Chen Jia Wen to the study room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you\u2019re back,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and put the box on the desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018My mummy made it to bribe you\u2026 I mean mummy wanted me to give this to young master as a gift,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened the box, and she took out a hot bun. Hao Yan Che slapped her right hand away from the box, and he put the hot bun back in the box.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 it hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She rubbed her right sore hand. \u2018Why did you hit my hand?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go wash your hands,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then why aren\u2019t you washing your hands?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed, and Yuan Gun Gun followed him to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun washed her hands, and ran back to the desk. She picked up the hot bun again, but Hao Yan Che was glaring at her. She smiled at him and heled the bun in front of his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, eat this,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che bit the bun, chewed and swallowed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your mum is a better cook than you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course my mummy is a better cook than me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun picked up another hot bun, and her white teeth chomped the bun into her mouth. Hao Yan Che thought she looked like she was eating her own kind.</p><br/><p>\u2018You and the bun are cast from the same mould,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Why are you eating your own kind?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yi Tu laughed at Hao Yan Che\u2019s joke.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand Hao Yan Che\u2019s words. She picked up a tier of food, and offered the food to Jia Tu and Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Jia Tu and big brother Yi Tu, taste my mummy\u2019s cooking too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knocked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 why did you hit my head?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che grabbed the tier of food from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands, and ate it by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Save some for me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to eat too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che closed the box, and he gave Yuan Gun Gun a warning look. She smiled at him, and patted his hand with her greasy fingers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hehe\u2026 I meant my mummy\u2019s dishes are for young master to eat,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go wash your hands,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked to the bathroom and mumbled she wanted to eat too.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you two giving me that look?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked Jia Tu and Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, how do you feel after eating a little round bun for the first time?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Jia Tu and Yi Tu said and left.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ignored Jia Tu and Yi Tu\u2019s laugher from outside the door. He opened the box again, and looked at the hot buns. He wondered if their big sister would taste delicious like them.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

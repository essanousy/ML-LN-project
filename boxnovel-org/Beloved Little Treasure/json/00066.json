Then he knelt in front of Yuan Gun Gun and caressed her hot face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want me to help you take a bath?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 Hao Yan Che teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and pressed her hand against her chest to calm her racing heart.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let Yuan Gun Gun off the hook. He stood and walked outside to the bed. If he turned around, he would have saw her collapsed because of her stiff muscles, especially her tightened heart.</p><br/><p>In the bedroom, Hao Yan Che sat on the bed and he turned on the TV. Remembering Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s rosy shy face in the bathroom made him smile.</p><br/><p>Seconds later, Yuan Gun Gun ran to the bedroom to blindly grab her underwear and nightshirt from a drawer. Then she ran back to the bathroom and hit her head on a wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard Hao Yan Che got out of bed, she suppressed her pain and ran back to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>On the bed Hao Yan Che smiled, because he felt his rice ball was amusing.</p><br/><p>One hour later, the rice ball didn\u2019t come out of the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the rice ball still didn\u2019t come out of the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, Hao Yan Che walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know what Yuan Gun Gun was thinking sitting on the bathroom floor. He pulled her up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you intend to sleep here?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bedroom and tossed her onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pounced onto Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body, and kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun moaned.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s soft body under her nightshirt, and his whole body lit on fire. His lips trailed kissed down to her neck.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body tensed when she felt Hao Yan Che\u2019s hand moved below her stomach, and she gripped his shoulders.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 young master\u2026 you can\u2019t\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che continued to nibble Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck, and his fingers caressed the honeypot between her legs.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 young master\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun bit her lips and shook her head. She couldn\u2019t stop the tingling sensation in her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Tears of pleasure and pain flowed slowly out of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes looked unsatisfied at Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che unbuttoned Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nightshirt, and tossed it on the floor. Her hands covered her breasts, he pulled her hands up and pinned her hands above her head. He breathed heavily, it was the first time he experienced a painful erection.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s soft breasts and suckled her nipples.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun moaned.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why her body felt strange.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 I don\u2019t want to\u2026 not like this\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried. She didn\u2019t want to give herself to Hao Yan Che, because he didn\u2019t love her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s heart tightened to see fear in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes. He endured his painful desire and let go of Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet and sleep,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che jumped out of bed, strode stiffly to the bathroom and slammed the bathroom door closed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped her tears and stared at the closed bathroom door, Hao Yan Che was angry. She put her nightshirt back on, and buttoned her nightshirt. She remembered her mummy told her that two people could only be intimate with each other if they loved each other. There was no reason for Hao Yan Che to be angry, because he didn\u2019t love her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got out of bed, and walked back to the pink bedroom. She laid on the comfortable pink bed, and thought about the way Hao Yan Che touched and kissed her body. When she rubbed his kiss marks on her neck, she felt her body turn hot.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom, Hao Yan Che\u2019s body was still stiff after coming out of the bathroom. He didn\u2019t see his rice ball on the bed and stiffly strode to the pink bedroom.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Sixty-Six</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was natural for accidents to follow nervous people. Yuan Gun Gun tripped over her feet, an omelette flew up in the air and landed on Hao Yan Che\u2019s handsome face while she fell onto his chest.</p><br/><p>What shocked the servants in the Hao Mansion was their young master didn\u2019t kick the little round ball into space.</p><br/><p>In Hao Yan Che\u2019s memories no one could touch him and be unharmed. He didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t make Yuan Gun Gun fly out the window.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared of her own hands on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zip your mouth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to stand behind Mrs Chen. Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know why he was displeased Yuan Gun Gun acted like she was running away from a monster.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun gripped the back of Mrs Chen\u2019s dress. Her eyes peaked over Mrs Chen\u2019s shoulder. She was scared Hao Yan Che would hit her with a whip.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun acted like she couldn\u2019t hear Hao Yan Che\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t make me tell you a second time,\u2019 Hao Yan Che threatened.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen gave Yuan Gun Gun a nudge in Hao Yan Che\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nervously put a bowl and chopsticks in front of Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t hit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the plate of bacon and the steaming hot bowl of noodles Yuan Gun Gun put on the dining table before she dressed his face with an omelette.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2026 accidently touched your chest,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Your chest isn\u2019t soft. I wouldn\u2019t touch a hard chest on purpose.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want everyone to leave,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 the servants said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wanted to run away with the servants.</p><br/><p>\u2018You, stay here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun acted like she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><br/><p>\u2018The little round ball with long hair, stay here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at the servant\u2019s slim backs. She was disappointed the little round ball wasn\u2019t someone else.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around, and slowly walked back to the dining table.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s waist and he pulled her to sit on his lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zip it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun immediately closed her mouth.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s soft body left to right. He wondered if she was a soft plush toy.</p><br/><p>\u2018It tickles,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face curiously. He didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t hate touching her body.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped drool off her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Touch me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said touch me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I touch you, will you kick me like a ball?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then I don\u2019t want to touch you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t touch me right now, I\u2019ll kick you out the window,\u2019 Hao Yan Che threatened.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun tentatively touched Hao Yan Che\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t hit her. She squeezed his face boldly. She was envious of his smooth firm skin.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che creased his brows. He couldn\u2019t believe his body allowed Yuan Gun Gun to touch him freely.</p><br/><p>Since Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t react, Yuan Gun Gun played with his cheeks. Suddenly he pushed her off his lap and onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out and rubbed her sore bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside and tell another maid to come in here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked outside and mumbled curses under her breath, like Hao Yan Che the temperamental monster.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen was waiting outside the dining room for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Mrs Chen, young master asked for another maid to come into the dining room,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen sent a beautiful maid with a slim waist into the dining room.</p><br/><p>Half a minute later, a body was heard crushing into a table followed by a scream of pain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mrs Chen, call the doctor,\u2019 a servant said.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen pitied the sacrificial maid. Mrs Chen wondered why Yuan Gun Gun could touch Hao Yan Che\u2019s body and remain in one piece.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen instructed some servants to take the sacrificial maid to see the doctor for bandaging. Afterward Mrs Chen led the rest of the servants back to the dining room.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun would rather die than stand in front of the crowd. She stood hidden behind the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard her name. She clutched onto Chen Jia Ting\u2019s body and shivered.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting poked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s waist. Yuan Gun Gun understood, and went to stand in front of the scary Hao Yan Che again.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was in a good mood to see the little round ball walked to him like she was going to be executed. But he knocked on the dining table and spoke coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where\u2019s the omelette?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It flew,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2026 don\u2019t be angry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go cook the same dishes for me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If my stomach rejects your food then I\u2019ll order someone to give you good service.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How will they serve me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019ll use a whip to serve you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and smiled like the devil.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand why such a cruel beautiful monster existed.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happens if your stomach thinks the food I cook is delicious?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll forgive your offences,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled at Hao Yan Che, cooking was her forte.</p><br/><p>\u2018One more thing,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018In the future if you walk like you\u2019re crawling when I call you, I\u2019ll chop off your legs. I\u2019ll be doing a good deed, because it\u2019ll help you crawl like the paste you like to walk.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen who helped raised Hao Yan Chen since he was a baby, thought Hao Yan Chen was being naive if he didn\u2019t hurry up and accept Yuan Gun Gun. She could see clearly, Hao Yan Chen treated Yuan Gun Gun differently compared to how he treated everyone else.</p><br/><p>Thirteen minutes later, a proud Yuan Gun Gun brought plates of food she cooked to the dining table. She bravely cut the omelette, used a fork to pick up a piece of omelette and held it in front of Hao Yan Che\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Have a bite,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My daddy always say my cooking is delicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yan Gun Gun\u2019s smiling face, and he didn\u2019t know what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun remembered where she was and her smile disappeared. She put the fork back down on the plate, took a step back, lowered her head and wrung her wrists nervously. She wasn\u2019t at home with her family who loved her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up the abandoned fork, and put the piece of omelette in his mouth. He chewed and swallowed. He noticed Yuan Gun Gun stole glances at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che began to eat the other dishes Yuan Gun Gun cooked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled again. She was happy Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t hate her cooking.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che quickly emptied the plates of food on the dining table into his stomach and used a napkin to wipe his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to eat more,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head, and ran into the kitchen to cook more dishes for Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>That day Yuan Gun Gun was immortalized as a legend in the Hao Mansion, because it was the first time Hao Yan Che ate three portions of food in one sitting.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Twenty-Two to Twenty-Three</p><br/>\n</div>"}

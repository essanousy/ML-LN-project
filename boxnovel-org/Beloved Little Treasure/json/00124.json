By the following day she would be Hao Yan Che\u2019s wife. She felt like he didn\u2019t want to marry her. But she was happy in three years she didn\u2019t have to be separated from him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you smiling like a fool?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, when will you love me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018When\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sleep,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun slept soundly that night. Hao Yan Che looked at her sleeping face in the dark and sighed. He didn\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t feel how much he loved her.</p><br/><p>The morning of Hao Yan Che\u2019s and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wedding day, Yuan Gun Gun had a final wedding dress fitting.</p><br/><p>In a room at the Hao Mansion reserved for Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s personal fitting room, Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her flat stomach. She was hungry, and wondered when she could eat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Miss Yuan, all these wedding dresses are designed by Mr Hao,\u2019 an assistant said. \u2018Which wedding dress do you like?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The wedding dresses are all beautiful,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s hard for me to choose. I don\u2019t mind wearing any of the wedding dresses.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What about this dress?\u2019 the assistant asked.</p><br/><p>The assistant held a collar laced white wedding dress with embroidered diamond beads and a wide tail that flowed to the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll take this wedding dress.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao instructed for the wedding dresses Miss Yuan didn\u2019t want to be taken to room fifty-five,\u2019 the assistant said to the servants.</p><br/><p>The servants took the other wedding dresses to room fifty-five in an orderly fashion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are all the wedding dresses mine?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 the assistant said. \u2018Mr Hao also designed dresses for Miss Yuan to wear tonight at the wedding reception.\u2019</p><br/><p>The assistant smiled at Yuan Gun Gun, and went to store the wedding dress Yuan Gun Gun chose in a safe place. The assistant knew Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t have to worry about the diamond beads that all the servants\u2019 lifetime work pay combined wouldn\u2019t be enough to buy the wedding dress.</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wanted to call Hao Yan Che. She picked up her phone, and received an international caller ID.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was sad and happy to hear Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, why did you have to move to Paris?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you need your little sister anymore? Why did you leave without saying goodbye?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re about to get married,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018You\u2019re not a little girl anymore. You shouldn\u2019t cry so easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, can\u2019t you come back?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018If you stay in Paris, how do I see you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, if you could only choose one person between me and Hao Yan Che, who would you choose?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I choose both,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, since you were a little girl I gave you everything you wanted,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018On this occasion you can only choose one person between me and Hao Yan Che. If you choose me, I\u2019ll come back home and I\u2019ll deal with the consequences. If you choose Hao Yan Che, I won\u2019t come home and I\u2019ll wish you happiness.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her mouth and muffled a cry.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du gambled everything one last time. He looked at the smiling photo of Yuan Gun Gun he carried around everywhere with him, and he knew he lost everything.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll help you choose,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I choose to wish you eternal happiness.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the floor and cried a river of tears.</p><br/><p>On the other end Na Liu Ting Du laughed sadly at himself. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have called Yuan Gun Gun one last time. But he wanted the glimmer of hope that Yuan Gun Gun would choose him to come true. He regretted he had to wake up from a fleeting beautiful dream, and lost the most important person to him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 124</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s habit was to kiss Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s cheek bye. But she remembered how he suddenly kissed her in Ting\u2019s Cafe, and decided to only wave bye to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Ting Ting said. \u2018Don\u2019t overwork yourself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du pecked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips while she waved to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t forget what I said,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I wasn\u2019t joking.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her lips, and nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should go,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said and rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du watched Yuan Gun Gun walk into the building. He thought about Hao Yan Che\u2019s words, wanting to be with someone for three hundred years was a long time. If Hao Yan Che loved Yuan Gun Gun and she loved Hao Yan Che\u2026 did it mean everything he was doing for Yuan Gun Gun was meaningless?</p><br/><p>On the one hundredth floor, Yuan Gun Gun ran out of the elevator and ran into Hao Yan Che\u2019s office. She prayed to the heavens that Hao Yan Che wasn\u2019t inside his office. Unfortunately, her prayer wasn\u2019t answered.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened his office door, and saw his rice ball gasping for air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 you\u2019re back,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re dead,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun took one step back, and Hao Yan Che pulled her into his office.</p><br/><p>The employees who saw the pitiful Yuan Gun Gun being captured by their icy boss had wanted to save her but didn\u2019t dare. They silently said a prayer for her life.</p><br/><p>Behind closed doors, Yuan Gun Gun protected her head and begged for mercy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I was wrong. Don\u2019t hit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did you go?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wanted to say she went to eat desserts, but she remembered Hao Yan Che made her promise not to eat desserts behind his back.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I went for a walk,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I didn\u2019t eat anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A walk?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She raised her left hand. \u2018I didn\u2019t eat anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair and pulled her to the connecting bedroom. He pushed her onto the bed, laid on top of her and bit her lower lip until he tasted her blood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s dress.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 you can\u2019t,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared Hao Yan Che would rip her underwear too. He held her wrists in one hand and unhooked her bra with his other hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and her face turned red.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s breasts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s underwear off.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. I didn\u2019t go for a walk. I went to eat desserts.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che saw the fear in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s teary eyes and he stopped moving on top of her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Big brother Du came to ask me to eat a meal. I didn\u2019t want to come back to work late so I took big brother Du to Ting\u2019s Cafe nearby. All the desserts at Ting\u2019s Cafe are delicious. I\u2019m sorry I ate desserts behind young master\u2019s back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know what to think, Yuan Gun Gun lied to him because she was scared he would find out she ate desserts.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her chest and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I told you that you\u2019re not allowed to see Na Liu Ting Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026 I didn\u2019t agree,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly.</p><br/><p>Cold steam came out of Hao Yan Che\u2019s nose and mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have eaten desserts behind your back,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But you shouldn\u2019t bully me. If you bully me again\u2026 I\u2019ll tell my daddy.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighty-Six</p><br/>\n</div>"}

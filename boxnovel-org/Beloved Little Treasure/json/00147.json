I don\u2019t want to stay here for Che to kill me. Besides, it\u2019s more comfortable to be a perverted monster at home. Isn\u2019t that right An An?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going home!\u2019 Su An Luo said.</p><br/><p>Su An Luo looked pleadingly at Mrs Chen to save her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not listening to your husband is breaking the rules,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re a pig!\u2019 Su An Luo said. \u2018Let me go.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait until we\u2019re at home and you can call out my name in bed,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018I promise I\u2019ll let you be as wild as you want in bed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming and Su An Luo disappeared. Mrs Chen shook her head, Hao Yan Ming was still a robust man. Mrs Chen wondered where Yuan Gun Gun ran off to. The only place Mrs Chen could think of was Yuan Gun Gun running to her parents\u2019 home. Mrs Chen hoped Hao Yan Che found Yuan Gun Gun soon and coax her home. Mrs Chen believed after Hao Yan Che cleared Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s misunderstanding then there would be peace inside the Hao Mansion.</p><br/><p>Outside the Hao Mansion, Yuan Gun Gun wandered around in the crowded streets. She couldn\u2019t erase the image of Hao Yan Che sleeping with another woman. She couldn\u2019t deny someone handsome like Hao Yan Che should be with the beautiful woman he slept with. Even the way Hao Yan Che kissed the beautiful woman was like a stunning painting. It made her ashamed of herself. She was only an unwanted leftover. She didn\u2019t know where she should go.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao called Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s phone. Yuan Gun Gun answered her phone in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun are you there?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Why are you crying?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, he\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Where are you? I\u2019ll come pick you up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m on my way to your home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Come here soon. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hung up the phone, and she got into a taxi without a dollar in her pockets.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Long Liu Bao paid Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s taxi fare.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao took Yuan Gun Gun to the Long Mansion\u2019s living room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Your face is all puffy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, can I stay here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to go home. She wanted to divorce Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You can stay here for as long as you want.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t tell Che I\u2019m here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t want him to find me. I want to divorce him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Divorce?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t stop crying every time she remembered Hao Yan Che\u2019s betrayal.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao poured Yuan Gun Gun a glass of water, and passed the glass to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take your time to explain,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018He slept with a beautiful woman in the living room,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Even the way they kissed was beautiful.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao and the Long brothers grew up with Hao Yan Che. Hao Yan Che hated people touching him since he was a little boy, and he would always kick anyone who touched him. Even the Long brothers and Hao Yan Che\u2019s parents needed Hao Yan Che\u2019s permission before touching Hao Yan Che. Long Liu Bao heard from the Long brothers that Yuan Gun Gun was the only person Hao Yan Che let touch him freely. Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t believe Hao Yan Che would cheat on Yuan Gun Gun. Hao Yan Che hated hugging or kissing anyone except Yuan Gun Gun. Hao Yan Che loved Yuan Gun Gun crazily, he wouldn\u2019t cheat on Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s possible,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Che is handsome and rich. I\u2019m an ugly rice ball. Of course he would choose to be with a beautiful woman. But I love him so much. How can he treat me like this? I don\u2019t care anymore. I don\u2019t want anything from him. What\u2019s so good about being handsome? I want to divorce him. After I divorce him, I\u2019ll find a good man to marry. I\u2019ll have a baby with my husband, and forget about Che.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who said you\u2019re ugly?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018I love you the way you are. You\u2019re not allowed to call yourself ugly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you\u2019re a good friend,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can I marry you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao laughed, and patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018When we\u2019re free we can go to the registry to lodge our marriage registration form.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Forget it,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Big brother Lang and big brother Bo will skin me if you marry me.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 147</p><br/>\n</div>"}

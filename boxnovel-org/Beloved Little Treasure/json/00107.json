Also, Mr Hao, you being rough with the patient caused the patient more pain.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Does she have a permanent injury?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Physically the patient\u2019s body will recover,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018But it\u2019s the patient\u2019s mental state that worries me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened the master bedroom door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodbye Mr Hao,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018How can I prepare her body to get used to my body?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Longer foreplay and lubricant will help,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018During sex be gentle with patient too. It\u2019ll help the patient both physically and mentally.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll ask someone to buy the prescription for her.\u2019</p><br/><p>The following afternoon past four, Yuan Gun Gun woke up. She saw Mrs Chen sitting on a chair beside the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re awake,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She wiped sweat off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead. \u2018I\u2019ll help you take a bath, apply cream then I\u2019ll cook your favorite dishes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen helped Yuan Gun Gun sit up on the bed, but Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face winced.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you in pain?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Do you want me to bring your toothbrush and a small tub for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head. She got out of bed, and stumbled a step back. Mrs Chen supported her to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>In the bathroom, Yuan Gun Gun brushed her teeth and washed her face while Mrs Chen prepared a warm bath for her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried after she got out of the bathtub.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, are you crying?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Take this painkiller and it\u2019ll help your pain.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, I don\u2019t want to swallow the pill,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the floor and cried. Mrs Chen rushed to help her stand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018You don\u2019t have to take the painkiller. Come outside, and I\u2019ll help you apply cream.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen supported Yuan Gun Gun to the bed, and Yuan Gun Gun laid on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, spread your legs and I\u2019ll help you apply cream,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019ll help you have babies in the future,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head and moved back on the bed.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen didn\u2019t want to force Yuan Gun Gun. Mrs Chen put the cream on the bedside table, and chose clothes for Yuan Gun Gun to wear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, change your clothes,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I\u2019ll go cook a meal for you. Then I\u2019ll come back and help dry your hair.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen walked outside the master bedroom. Yuan Gun Gun picked up the phone on the bedside table. She dialled a number, but there was no answer. She dialled several more times, still no answer. She sat on the bed and stared at the phone in her hand.</p><br/><p>One hour later, Mrs Chen returned with a tray of food. She was worried to see Yuan Gun Gun sitting in a daze on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, why didn\u2019t you change your clothes?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun changed clothes, and crawled under the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, eat something then sleep,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Mrs Chen called.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen was about to pull the bedsheet, but Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s pitiful cry made her sad.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen walked to the living room, and called Hao Yan Che on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, Gun Gun refused to take the painkiller,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018She won\u2019t let me apply the cream for her and she refused to eat too. Young master, do you think Gun Gun needs to see a psychologist?\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 107</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The next moment she was shipped into the Rolls-Royce.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, be good and if anything happens, you need to tell mummy,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, mummy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stuck her head out of the window and she kissed Feng Du Du\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun\u2026 my little girl\u2026\u2019 Feng Du Du said in between sobs.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu held Feng Du Du\u2019s waist to stop her from jumping into the car with Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, remember to listen to daddy\u2019s advice,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Learn to take care of yourself and others. Don\u2019t cause trouble.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Daddy, don\u2019t forget\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Baby panda and baby fox,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018White fur baby fox,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun reminded.</p><br/><p>\u2018I promise,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, mum go back inside,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019ll take Gun Gun there and I\u2019ll come back.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu sadly pulled Feng Du Du inside their home.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du sat in the car and closed the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Zheng, you can drive now,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Mr Zheng drove and hummed the phantom of the opera tune.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun knelt on the car seat like a little puppy. She stuck her head out of the window until she couldn\u2019t see Yuan Ting Liu and Feng Du Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, do you remember everything I told you last night?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>The last thing Yuan Gun Gun remembered was she slept on Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s lap in the car.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun wake up,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. He patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s biteable pink cheek. \u2018We\u2019re here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re here already?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked in a drowsy voice.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du helped Yuan Gun Gun out of the car.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stand straight,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at the Hao Mansion. It looked like a painting of a mansion in a forest.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du rolled Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s suitcases to the front door where a crowd was waiting for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>The caretaker Mrs Chen was a forty-year-old woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello Miss Yuan,\u2019 Mrs Chen greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty you can call me Gun Gun,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m the caretaker,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Miss Yuan, you can call me Mrs Chen. Come with me inside.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, I have to go,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. He passed the suitcases to Yuan Gun Gun. \u2018Be good. If anything happens call me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye big brother Du, I\u2019ll miss you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t care about the crowd, she kissed Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>After Na Liu Ting Du left, Yuan Gun Gun ran to Mrs Chen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mrs Chen, I\u2019m sorry I made you wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Years later, Yuan Gun Gun looked back at her time being a maid as the most painful period of life when she was bullied the most.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s dad was a rich man. She wasn\u2019t shocked by how big the interior of the Hao Mansion was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone can go back to their duties,\u2019 Mrs Chen said to the maids and butlers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes Mrs Chen,\u2019 the maids and butlers said together.</p><br/><p>\u2018Miss Yuan, follow me,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun followed Mrs Chen to a princess bedroom. The walls were pink, and the curtains were white silk. In centre the bedroom was a canopy bed and a vanity table.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen closed the door and she assessed the chubby little girl in front of her. The little girl owned a good pelvis, good for child bearing. The little girl had ample breasts, an average waist, average legs and a round bottom. The little girl had beautiful hands and a loveable round face. Mrs Chen loved the little girl\u2019s big round eyes with long eyelashes. Mrs Chen also loved the little girl\u2019s small straight nose and apple red lips. Mrs Chen concluded the little girl was an innocent chubby beauty.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun widened her eyes, swallowed her saliva and looked at the stern Mrs Chen. She wasn\u2019t certain if Mrs Chen liked her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Mrs Chen pulled Yuan Gun Gun to sit on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re the type of girl I like,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018In front of other people, call me Mrs Chen. When it\u2019s only us, you can call me aunty Chen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun would forget everything if someone smiled at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re a loveable girl,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I want you to hear you call me again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018You make me want to squeeze your cheeks,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks. \u2018You have adorable soft cheeks.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled and let Mrs Chen squeeze Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks. Mrs Chen thought Yuan Gun Gun was too good for Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, if you\u2019re the caretaker, does that mean in the future you\u2019ll be training me to be a maid?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked and rubbed her sore cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She patted her chest. \u2018As long as you follow aunty, your work life here will be smooth under my watch.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, what will I be doing each day?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll talk about it another time,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s irresistible cheeks again. \u2018You can unpack first. Later you\u2019ll serve young master dinner.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Serve?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll find out later,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She smiled cryptically. \u2018I\u2019ll leave you here to unpack. Someone will come soon to bring your uniform.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uniform?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Everyone here wears a uniform according to their status. After you change into your uniform, I\u2019ll take you to young master\u2019s bedroom for you to wake him up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun\u2026 remember you can\u2019t touch young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Young master is a clean freak, he doesn\u2019t like people touching him. If you touch young master, he\u2019ll take you out to play golf. But you\u2019ll be his golf club.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pictured her head hitting a golf ball and she gulped.</p><br/><p>\u2018Remember, in front of everyone you need to call me Mrs Chen,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Hurry up and pack.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen left Yuan Gun Gun to sit on the floor and pack. Yuan Gun Gun thought Na Liu Ting Du was right, Hao Yan Che was a scary man. Thinking about being used as a golf club again made Yuan Gun Gun shivered.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighteen to Nineteen</p><br/>\n</div>"}

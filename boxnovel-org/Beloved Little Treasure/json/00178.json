When you didn\u2019t want her anymore, I protected and loved her. You\u2019re the one who abandoned her. Now you want her back, how shameless can you be?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked resentfully at Na Liu Ting Du for lying to Yuan Gun Gun and stealing Yuan Gun Gun and their son from him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, let go of my wife\u2019s hand,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Our son is waiting for his mum at home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Your son?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018He\u2019s my son. He has my violet eyes and white hair. He also has my powers. Did my son with my wife inherit his genes from you or my wife?\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du knew it was over, Hao Yan Che knew the truth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Na, do you not feel guilty deceiving a woman who lost her memory?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018A woman who is another man\u2019s wife? Now you\u2019re standing in front of her husband and still denying the truth, how shameless can you be?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I protected and loved my wife and son who you didn\u2019t want,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018It was you who let her go. Where were you these two years? You didn\u2019t care about her. You didn\u2019t look for her. Where were you while she lost her memory? I was with her when she lost her memory, and I held her hand when she had a difficult labour. I was the first dad our son saw, and the man who our son calls dad. What right do you have to ask me if I feel guilty?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re all liars!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled her arm out of Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s hold, and she pushed Hao Yan Che away from her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to the bathroom. She locked the door, and cried in the bathroom. Na Liu Ting Du lied to her. She wasn\u2019t his wife, and Na Liu Hao wasn\u2019t his son. If everything was a lie then who was she? She couldn\u2019t remember anything. How could she believe all the lies? Everyone lied to her.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du and Hao Yan Che glared at each other, and they knocked on the bathroom door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, come out and I\u2019ll explain everything,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, come out and I\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re all liars!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Stay away from me!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>\u2018I only want my parents,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Stay away from me!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hit her head against the door. Lies! Why couldn\u2019t she remember her past?</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call dad and mum to come here right now,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du pleaded. \u2018Don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrenching cry answered Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s plea.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was scared Yuan Gun Gun would do something crazy if she didn\u2019t open the door.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes later, Yuan Ting Liu arrived at Hao Yan Che\u2019s office. Yuan Ting Liu was displeased to see his son and son-in-law.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is Gun Gun?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>A year ago, Na Liu Ting Du brought Yuan Gun Gun to the Yuan Mansion. Yuan Ting Liu wanted to kill Na Liu Ting Du for not telling him about Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lost memory, and about his grandson. If Na Liu Ting Du wasn\u2019t his son, he would have killed him for deceiving Yuan Gun Gun and deceiving him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu knew Na Liu Ting Du loved Yuan Gun Gun, but he didn\u2019t approve of Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s deceit. It hurt him to see his daughter anxious, and scared of him and Feng Du Du. He missed his daughter. The situation escalated, he didn\u2019t want his daughter to live a lie.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, did you know long ago that Gun Gun lost her memory and gave birth to my son?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s priority was Yuan Gun Gun. He would explain everything to Hao Yan Che later.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Gun Gun is my wife. I\u2019m the father of her son.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Two years ago you said to me you want to return my daughter. In other words, you and my daughter are strangers.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s words stung.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, Gun Gun locked herself in the bathroom,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Dad, convince Gun Gun to come home with me. Hao Hao is waiting at home for her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bring Hao Hao to the Yuan Mansion,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Starting from today, Gun Gun and Hao Hao will live at the Yuan Mansion.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad\u2026\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, do you remember what you did two years ago?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked. \u2018I called you, and you didn\u2019t tell me Gun Gun lost her memory. You fed lies to Gun Gun while she lost her memory. One year ago, you brought Gun Gun back to me. I didn\u2019t curse you because I knew you loved Gun Gun. But it doesn\u2019t mean I approve of your deceit, and it doesn\u2019t mean I forgive you. Ting Du, do you understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du understood he disappointed Yuan Ting Liu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Both of you have hurt Gun Gun,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018I know both of you love Gun Gun. But I\u2019m using my status as Gun Gun\u2019s father to ask both of you not pressure Gun Gun. Give her space to calm down. Give her space to decide who she wants to be with. I\u2019ll support her decision. If she decides she doesn\u2019t want to be with any of you then both of you need to respect her decision. Mr Hao, let me take my daughter home.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 178</p><br/>\n</div>"}

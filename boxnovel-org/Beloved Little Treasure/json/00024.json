He liked to work at home, and if he went to Hao Yan\u2019s company headquarters, two handsome men followed him. The first man was Jia Tu, he was a quiet man. The second man was Yi Tu who was friendly, and reminded Yuan Gun Gun of Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat in the study room as usual while Hao Yan Che worked on his laptop. She didn\u2019t understand the strange beautiful monster who wanted her to watch him work and eat every day.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around to look at Jia Tu and Yi Tu standing still. She wondered why how they could stand still all day and not feel frustrated.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu smiled at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s curious face looking at him and Jia Tu.

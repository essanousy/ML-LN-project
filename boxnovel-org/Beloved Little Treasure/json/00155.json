She remembered Long Liu Bao told her to slowly rub her hand up and down Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little rice ball, I like you making me happy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He stood and carried Yuan Gun Gun in his arms. \u2018I want you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018What about dinner?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll eat later,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to their bedroom.

Yuan Gun Gun looked at the curve of his back, and remembered what Long Liu Bao taught her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist, and pressed her body against his back. One of her hands caressed his toned stomach. Her other hand slowly rubbed his hardness between his legs and felt his erection.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s body stiffened under Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s touch. Her technique was clumsy, but her touch turned him rock hard.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her breasts against Hao Yan Che\u2019s back, and slowly licked his ear.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was under Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s spell. All she needed to do was touch him, and he would melt under her touch.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gave in, he turned around and pinned her body under his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hehe\u2026 Che, your face is pink,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think it\u2019s funny?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Funny,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said carelessly.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kneaded Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s breasts.

She hugged Yuan Gun Gun. \u2018You finally succeeded.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao knew the monster Hao couldn\u2019t resist his loveable little rice ball\u2019s seduction.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers were suspicious why Hao Yan Che would release his little rice ball. They expected Hao Yan Che would at least lock his little rice ball in the bedroom for half a year.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 155</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She thought Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s baby was going to grow up loved by Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yi Tu called.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu knew as long Yuan Gun Gun was by Hao Yan Che\u2019s side, everyone living at the Hao Mansion had Yuan Gun Gun to control Hao Yan Che\u2019s mood swings.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you heard the doctor,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Gun Gun is pregnant with young master\u2019s second child. Young master needs to be patient with Gun Gun, and not fight with her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s Gun Gun who always picks fights with me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you know it wasn\u2019t easy for Gun Gun to come back to you,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Young master, if you don\u2019t compromise then you\u2019ll lose Gun Gun again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If she dares runaway again, I\u2019ll break her legs so she can\u2019t run,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu sighed. In front of Hao Yan Che\u2019s subjects, he was the invincible werewolf king. In front of Yuan Gun Gun, Hao Yan Che was a clueless puppy. Yi Tu thought love could drastically change a person.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what I should do to make Gun Gun happy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu smiled at the way Hao Yan Che failed to hide his embarrassed face. Yi Tu thought love could make a smart person turn into a fool too.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you should tell Gun Gun the good news that she is pregnant with your second child,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Secondly, young master should let Gun Gun see your son again. Thirdly, young master needs to say sorry to Gun Gun, sweet talk her and let her know you care about her. I remember Gun Gun said in the past that she loves seeing you in your werewolf form, but you rarely change into a werewolf for her. If young master change into a werewolf for Gun Gun, you\u2019ll make her happy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It looks like you and my wife have a good relationship,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018She tells you everything.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Hehe\u2026 Jia Tu knows too,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>If Yi Tu had to drown, he wanted to pull Jia Tu into the deep end with him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu quickly left the jealous Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid on the bed next to Yuan Gun Gun. He stroked her hair, and waited for her to wake up.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, Yuan Gun Gun woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re awake,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned her back to Hao Yan Che, ignored him and he hugged her from behind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, let\u2019s call a truce,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pretended she couldn\u2019t hear Hao Yan Che. He rubbed her stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re pregnant,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Inside your stomach is our baby.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Hao Hao is mine and big brother Du\u2019s son. Hao Hao isn\u2019t Mr Hao\u2019s son.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che remembered the doctor\u2019s advice, and suppressed his anger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say nonsense,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the truth,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, don\u2019t spit lies on my face,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around to face Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Force yourself on me like before? Better yet, why don\u2019t you kill us?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m saying I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018What more do you want?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you call this saying sorry?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun bickered like children on the playground.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s angry face was adorable like her crying face.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was angry and tired. Suddenly she burst into tears.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mood swings could change faster than his mood swings.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 206</p><br/>\n</div>"}

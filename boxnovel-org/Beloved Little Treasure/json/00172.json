I\u2019ll take care of Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao couldn\u2019t believe what her ears heard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, I\u2019m sorry I have to cut our lesson short today,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My son is awake. He\u2019s a mischievous baby.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, you have a son?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao followed Yuan Gun Gun to the bathroom, and they washed their hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My son is more than two months old now.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Can I meet your son?\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t want me to,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My son is different to other babies.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, I don\u2019t mind,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I love all babies.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll take you meet Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao walked into Na Liu Hao\u2019s bedroom, and she froze. Na Liu Hao was the monster Hao\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun carried Hao Hao in her arms. She patted his back, and the flying objects fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, don\u2019t be angry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy loves Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun kissed Na Liu Hao\u2019s cheek. He turned his head away from her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, I need to go home,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I\u2019ll come back tomorrow to continue the lesson.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, thank you for today,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018See you tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018See you tomorrow,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Take care of your loveable son.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao walked to the car. She didn\u2019t know what to do. Should she tell Hao Yan Che that Yuan Gun Gun lost her memory, and gave birth to his son? Hao Yan Che would go crazy if he found out another man deceived Yuan Gun Gun into believing Yuan Gun Gun and Na Liu Hao were another man\u2019s wife and son.</p><div></div><br/><p>Later at the Long brothers\u2019 home in Paris.</p><br/><p>\u2018Baby?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Bo, calm down,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018It\u2019s not your baby.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you say?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo knocked Long Liu Bao\u2019s head. She slid off Long Liu Bo\u2019s lap, and sat on Long Liu Lang\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018We need to tell Che,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018If anyone tells him, I\u2019ll run away from home again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to see what happens if you run away again?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018It was Hao Yan Che who said he didn\u2019t want Gun Gun anymore. It\u2019s his fault for being heartless. He didn\u2019t even look for Gun Gun, and he doesn\u2019t let anyone mention Gun Gun in front of him. If he turned his back on Gun Gun then he doesn\u2019t deserve to know. Even if he knew Gun Gun gave birth to his son, he wouldn\u2019t care. Gun Gun made the right decision to leave him. Gun Gun is living a happy life without him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, stop lying to yourself,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018You know Che loves Gun Gun deeply. Can you honestly say that Gun Gun is truly happy right now even if she lost her memory? Bao Bao, you know if Gun Gun regained her memory, she would want to see Che.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you need to reunite Gun Gun and Che,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wasn\u2019t it you who said I should stay out of Gun Gun and Che\u2019s business?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao this is a serious matter,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Do you know how powerful Che\u2019s son is? Che\u2019s son needs to be with him before Che\u2019s son turns five. Like how Che needed to be by his mum\u2019s side before he turned five.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 172</p><br/>\n</div>"}

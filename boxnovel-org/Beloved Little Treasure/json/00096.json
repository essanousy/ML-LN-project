I don\u2019t like it here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t care about the guests staring at him and Yuan Gun Gun. He kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Later I\u2019ll let you eat dessert at home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to bite Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s adorable face, but he held back because of where they were.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s waist while the guests greeted him and praised Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, I want to go to the bathroom,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair. \u2018Do you know the way?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My daddy took me to here before.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You can go,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming had ebony hair. He greeted Hao Yan Che after he saw Yuan Gun Gun left Hao Yan Che\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you dead yet?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll be heartbroken if I die,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Find a place far away from me to die,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018Don\u2019t contaminate my eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, you\u2019re icy as usual,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018If you truly don\u2019t need me anymore, why are you here?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I came to see if you died yet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It looks like someone with your hateful face won\u2019t die easily.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m back in my district,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming raised his wine glass and clinked Hao Yan Che\u2019s wine glass.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun came out of the bathroom, and she was happily surprised to see Luo Qing Qing. She ran toward Luo Qing Qing, but took a step back after she heard someone insulting Luo Qing Qing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Luo Qing Qing, you slut,\u2019 Yu Cheng Su said. \u2018Will it kill you if you don\u2019t seduce the men around you? You\u2019re nothing but dirt.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Yu Cheng Su, is an eloquent name,\u2019 Luo Qing Qing said. \u2018Too bad it\u2019s wasted on you. No wonder Jian Qi wants to come to me. Don\u2019t you own a mirror at home? Thanks to you, today I realised how exceptional I am after standing next to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu Cheng Su didn\u2019t have a combat to win against Luo Qing Qing. Yu Cheng Su raised her arm to slap Luo Qing Qing\u2019s face, but a woman in a violet dress suddenly stood in front of Luo Qing Qing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay away from Qing Qing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Luo Qing Qing recognised her adorable little savior was Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get lost bitch,\u2019 Yu Cheng Su said.</p><br/><p>Yu Cheng Su vented her anger on Yuan Gun Gun. She pulled Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026 it hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let go of my hair.\u2019</p><br/><p>Luo Qing Qing was about to make Yu Cheng Su regret hurting Yuan Gun Gun. But a shadow appeared, pulled Yuan Gun Gun to their chest and kicked Yu Cheng Su onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che and cried on his shoulder. He stroked her hair and glared at Yu Cheng Su.</p><br/><p>Luo Qing Qing looked at Yu Cheng Su who was lying on the floor and spitting blood. Luo Qing Qing thought Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s man was a merciless man.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, she insulted Qing Qing and attacked me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He wiped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tears. \u2018You\u2019re safe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Whispers of Hao Yan Che defending his beautiful girlfriend spread like fire among the guests. That night Hao Yan Che unintentionally stole Zhao Rong Fen\u2019s thunder at the hotel reception.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked up at Luo Qing Qing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qing Qing, are you OK?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019 Luo Qing Qing said. \u2018Thanks to Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>The bystanders thought Luo Qing Qing\u2019s words were laughable. One glance at Yuan Gun Gun and Luo Qing Qing, and anyone could see who needed protecting.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qing Qing, you saved me at school,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But I didn\u2019t get a chance to repay you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Tonight you saved me,\u2019 Luo Qing Qing said and rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t care about anyone else. He only wanted to take Yuan Gun Gun home.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Ninety-Six</p><br/>\n</div>"}

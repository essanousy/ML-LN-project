When her son was born, the doctor wanted to examine Na Liu Hao\u2019s bottom. Na Liu Hao levitated a heavy object and knocked the doctor unconscious. It made the nurses scared to touch Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du was happy to take care of Na Liu Hao at the hospital. Yuan Gun Gun remembered how Na Liu Hao opened his beautiful violet eyes the moment he was born. Na Liu Hao was an otherworldly beautiful baby. But Na Liu Hao didn\u2019t look like Yuan Gun Gun or Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun asked Na Liu Ting Du often why Na Liu Hao didn\u2019t look like them. Na Liu Ting Du would always answer because Na Liu Hao inherited genes from an older generation.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s violet eyes were beautiful when he was happy. If he was angry, his eyes would turn a different color. Yuan Gun Gun took him to see a paediatrician, but the paediatrician told her that he had healthy eyes.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was a stubborn baby. He only wanted Yuan Gun Gun or Na Liu Ting Du to hold him. If he was unhappy about something, he would levitate objects into the air. If he didn\u2019t get his way, he would make objects fly into walls or make the window glass shatter.</p><div></div><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du opened the bedroom door. Yuan Gun Gun jumped off the bed, ran to him and hugged him. He pecked her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao hates the fairy tales I read to him,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He wants me to read the books you read to him. But those books are hard for me to read.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du smiled. He walked to the bed, picked up Na Liu Hao and kissed Na Liu Hao\u2019s chubby cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018My darling son, daddy will give you a bath then daddy will read you the books you want to hear,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao smiled at Na Liu Ting Du, and made Yuan Gun Gun jealous of the father and son\u2019s harmonious relationship.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to help bathe Hao Hao too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du. \u2018Even though you make the bathroom messier every time you help bathe Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao nodded his head, because he agreed with Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018You father and son pair are picking on me again,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>In the bathroom, the family of three laughed together while giving Na Liu Hao a bath.</p><br/><p>At midnight, Na Liu Ting Du came out of the bathroom. Yuan Gun Gun was waiting for him on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, I made your side of the bed warm for you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du laid on his side of the bed, it was warm. He rolled onto Yuan Gun Gun and kissed her lips. She pushed his chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, no,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, let me love you,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I promise I won\u2019t hurt you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t regain her memory. Na Liu Ting Du loved her, and she convinced herself she loved him. But she didn\u2019t want to sleep with him. She felt guilty for always rejecting her husband. She knew her husband restrained himself since she was pregnant with Na Liu Hao. But her heart always hurt at the thought of sleeping with Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 169</p><br/>\n</div>"}

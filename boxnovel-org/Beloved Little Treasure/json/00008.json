She licked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Li are you the big dog?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo howled softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Li, you\u2019re a beautiful big dog,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Aunty Li if you come home with me, I\u2019ll marry aunty Li\u2019s son.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wanted to climb onto Qiu Li Luo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo wanted the innocent Yuan Gun Gun to be her daughter-in-law. Where else would Qiu Li Luo find such a loveable daughter-in-law who loved werewolves instead of being scared of werewolves? Qiu Li Luo believed Yuan Gun Gun would love Hao Yan Che too. Hao Yan Che needed someone warm and loving like Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Li, I want to sit on your back,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo\u2019s tail lifted Yuan Gun Gun onto her back.

He pulled the bedsheet over Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo rubbed her head on Han Yan Que\u2019s leg, and she walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Han Yan Que followed Qiu Li Luo outside and he closed the guest room door.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom, Qiu Li Luo jumped onto the bed and she transformed into a naked woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, are you seducing your husband?\u2019 Han Yan Que teased.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo crawled under the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>\u2018You perverted wolf,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que slowly took off his clothes and smiled at Qiu Li Luo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, you should know I\u2019m a demon not a wolf,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You perverted demon,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018Why are you taking off your clothes?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll find out soon,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que crawled under the bedsheet and kissed Qiu Li Luo\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, your first sin was leaving the bed before me,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018Neglecting me to be with the little round ball is your second sin. Calling your husband a perverted demon is your third sin. What can you say to defend yourself?\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo pouted her lips and hugged Hao Yan Que\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are all vampires like you?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked. \u2018Only loves to drink blood and sleep with their lover?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not an ordinary vampire,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018I\u2019m a vampire king. My head doesn\u2019t lust for blood and naked bodies.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Then what\u2019s in your head?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s only you in my head,\u2019 Han Yan Que said. \u2018I want to sleep with you so there is only me in your head.\u2019</p><br/><p>Han Yan Que bit Qiu Li Luo\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, then vampire king, you should punish me,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, it\u2019s good you admitted your sins,\u2019 Han Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>Han Yan Que enjoyed punishing Qiu Li Luo.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The vampire king thoroughly punished Qiu Li Luo, and she laid on his chest.</p><br/><p>Han Yan Que stroked Qiu Li Luo\u2019s hair. He loved to see how relaxed she looked after each time they were intimate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Que, have you heard of a family household named Fat?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t you say I\u2019m a foreigner?\u2019 Hao Yan Que asked. \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you know the family names of your own nationality?\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo bit Hao Yan Que\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018How many years have I been alive?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked. \u2018How many years have you been alive? You\u2019re an ancient vampire and lived through history. You\u2019ve travelled everywhere too. Of course you would know more than me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Luo Li Qiu!\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018I think your heart and head isn\u2019t with me. Let\u2019s frolic on the bed until you only think of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo knew Hao Yan Que was angry whenever he mixed up her name.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018You\u2019ve exhausted my body.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you don\u2019t want to, you have to want to,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018It\u2019s your fault for biting me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que began to tease Qiu Li Luo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Han Yan Que!\u2019 Qiu Li Luo called. \u2018Do you know how to be reasonable?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018So you don\u2019t need to open your mouth.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que kissed Qiu Li Luo\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo turned her head to the side.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018Answer my question first.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There isn\u2019t a family called Fat,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018The little round ball\u2019s mum is Feng Du Du and the little round ball\u2019s dad is Yuan Ting Liu. Her dad is the CEO of Yuan\u2019s company. I\u2019ve notified her dad that she is safe here with us. He\u2019ll come here to pick up the little round ball soon. You saved the little round ball\u2019s life, her dad will grant any request you want.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que held Qiu Li Luo\u2019s face, and he kissed her senseless.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the master room became steamy again.</p><br/><p>At Yuan\u2019s company, Yuan Ting Liu looked suspiciously at the letter he received early in the morning, \u2018Mr Yuan, if you want to know where your daughter is, wait outside Yuan\u2019s company headquarters tomorrow morning at nine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then Yuan Ting Liu picked up the strange plaque left on his office desk.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du knocked on Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s office door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, it\u2019s me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.

Do you think it belongs to the kidnapper? Do they want money or is this a trap? Dad, don\u2019t go see the owner of this plaque tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, if you can\u2019t find out news about this plaque by tomorrow then I need to go see the owner of this plaque,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018I don\u2019t care of it\u2019s a trap.

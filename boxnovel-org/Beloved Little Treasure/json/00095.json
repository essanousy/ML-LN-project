Aunty Chen is the best. She made all my favorite dishes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che smiled at the way Yuan Gun Gun forgot all her grievances at the sight of food. He was happy to have Yuan Gun Gun in his life, and asked himself if it was a symptom of love.</p><br/><p>Three blissful months later, Hao Yan Che escorted Yuan Gun Gun to the car after a work day.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, where are you taking me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Somewhere to torture you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No reason,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>During the car trip Yuan Gun Gun was too anxious to talk.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun refused to get out of the car.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I won\u2019t eat junk food again.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held the gullible Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand and led her inside the boutique.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao,\u2019 the shop assistants greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018She\u2019s all yours.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes Mr Hao,\u2019 the shop assistants said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun clutched onto Hao Yan Che\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, don\u2019t make me suffer,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll wait for you outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>The three beautiful shop assistants took Yuan Gun Gun to a private room.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, a blushing Yuan Gun Gun stepped out of the private room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s violet dress that matched his violet eyes. His brows creased, the dress accentuated her body and showed too much cleavage for his liking. At the back of her dress was a butterfly bow. She looked alluring and dainty in the dress. The violet heels elongated her milky smooth legs. On her hands were two thin violet gloves. He looked at her face and frowned, because makeup enhanced her natural beauty.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun fiddled her fingers. She was nervous about Hao Yan Che\u2019s reaction.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Change the dress,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun lowered her head and quietly cried.

They chose the best dress that suited Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s beautiful complexion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, why aren\u2019t you satisfied with this dress?\u2019 the brunette asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che and the brunette shop assistant had a silent standoff.</p><br/><p>The blonde shop assistant went to get a violet shawl. Then she draped it over Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulders and tied a butterfly knot in front of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, what about now?\u2019 the blonde asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che nodded his head at Yi Tu. Then Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand and took her outside the boutique.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu gave the blonde shop assistant a cheque.</p><br/><p>\u2018My young master is satisfied with yours and the other two women\u2019s artful skills,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao is a generous man,\u2019 the blonde said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu smiled and left the boutique.</p><br/><p>The brunette shop assistant looked at the signed blank cheque the blonde assistant held and gasped.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao is a generous man,\u2019 the brunette said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister,\u2019 the raven called the blonde. \u2018Didn\u2019t you want to ask Mr Hao if he\u2019ll let his beautiful girlfriend enter the national beauty contest?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why should I ask when we know Mr Hao wouldn\u2019t give his permission?\u2019 the blonde asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister,\u2019 the brunette called the blonde. \u2018Mr Hao is a strange man.

After she woke up, he took a bath with her, fed her and was intimate with her again. She thought he lost his conscience. How could he sleep with another woman, and slept with her like he didn\u2019t betray her? How could he say hurtful words to her and not feel guilty?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at his wife\u2019s crying face. He was angry she ran away from home. Why didn\u2019t she trust him? Why did she say she wanted to divorce him? Why couldn\u2019t she see there was only her in his heart? Why couldn\u2019t she understand that he wouldn\u2019t betray her? How could he betray someone who was everything to him?</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, let go of me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Why do you have to treat me this way?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you know what\u2019s good for then cooperate with me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, I was wrong,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it again. Let go of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Too late,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I gave you a chance, but you didn\u2019t take it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at his wife\u2019s face. She looked like was going to faint. He kissed her lips and continued to move inside her body.</p><br/><p>A long time later, Hao Yan Che lifted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom and planted his seed inside her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun lost count how many times her body and Hao Yan Che\u2019s body reached ecstasy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Remember that I don\u2019t want to hear divorce come out of your mouth again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You know what happens if you say divorce again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I promise I won\u2019t say it again,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun. The moment he got out of bed to go to the bathroom, she fell asleep.</p><br/><p>At ten in the morning, Hao Yan Che woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little rice ball, wake up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018No\u2026 no,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che regretted he was too rough with Yuan Gun Gun last night. She wasn\u2019t an ordinary person. She drank his blood so he thought she could endure more than an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun and stroked her back.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to be scared,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You can sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che loved how vulnerable Yuan Gun Gun looked when she cried. But it didn\u2019t mean he wanted her to feel sad. He wanted her to feel how much he loved her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che felt Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body relaxed. He kissed her forehead, let go of her and prepared for work. He planned to come home early to be with her.</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che left for work, Yuan Gun Gun was woken up by the nonstop ringing of her phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello, who is it?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, it\u2019s me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you OK?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Last night I was one step away from dying.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, listen to me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Right now you need to act like you want to please Hao Yan Che.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018So we can runaway together,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018First we need to give them a false sense of security. We wait until they are deliriously happy that we\u2019re doing everything to please them. When they put their guards down is the perfect time for us to escape. We need to show them they shouldn\u2019t bully us, and take us for granted.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Runaway?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018If I runaway again, Che will kill me after he finds me.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 152</p><br/>\n</div>"}

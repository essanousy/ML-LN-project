She wiped her forehead. She didn\u2019t know why she dreamt of Hao Yan Che who was a stranger to her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned to look at Na Liu Hao sleeping soundly. She kissed his forehead. He inherited his violet eyes and white hair from Hao Yan Che. He also inherited Hao Yan Che\u2019s mood swings and impatience.</p><br/><p>At breakfast, the Yuan family ate together in the dining room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, mummy made your favorite rice balls,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Look how skinny you are. You should eat more.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du put a lot of food into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you mummy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ate and gaged Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu poured a glass of chocolate milk, and put the glass in front of Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy isn\u2019t angry at you,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018You don\u2019t have to keep glancing at me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was embarrassed she got caught. Yuan Ting Liu smiled and she buried her head in her bowl and ate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is big brother Du still sleeping?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s gone and left you a letter,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu put a rice ball into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018The letter is on your bedside table,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018You can read it after breakfast.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun lost her appetite. She forced herself to swallow the food in her bowl. Then she walked to her bedroom and read the letter.</p><br/><p>My dearest Gun Gun,</p><br/><p>Your past is with Hao Yan Che and your future is in your hands.</p><br/><p>If you want to remember your past, go to Hao Yan Che because your most precious memories are with him. I know remembering your past is important to you. Take good care of yourself.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t always let Hao Hao have his way if you don\u2019t want him to grow up rotten.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll visit you and Hao Hao when I\u2019m free.</p><br/><p>Bye from your big brother Du.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the bed next to the sleeping Na Liu Hao. Her tears smudged the words on the letter.</p><br/><p>At midday, Hao Yan Che visited the Yuan Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, didn\u2019t you hear what I said yesterday?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, I heard everything you said yesterday,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019m not here to pressure Gun Gun to make a decision. I came here to see Gun Gun and see our son.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu and Hao Yan Che heard Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sob and they ran to her bedroom.</p><div></div><br/><p>In Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun was crying in a corner. Na Liu Hao shattered the window glass and broke most of the furnishings in the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che leapt to Yuan Gun Gun. He protected her, waved his hand and the flying objects fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun and Na Liu Hao looked curiously at Hao Yan Che who had powers like Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was the first to react. She pushed Hao Yan Che off her, and looked at Yuan Ting Liu for answers.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao is angry because he couldn\u2019t find big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at his son who looked exactly like him. He regretted letting Yuan Gun Gun go. If he went to find her and take her back home, their son wouldn\u2019t call another man dad and wouldn\u2019t be angry because their son couldn\u2019t see Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy hug,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was scared to see a man who looked exactly like him and had his powers too.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to the pink bed and hugged Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao pointed a chubby finger at Hao Yan Che like a little king.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy walk to him,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun carried Na Liu Hao to Hao Yan Che, and she avoided looking at Hao Yan Che\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao pointed at Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle, you look like me,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt embarrassed Na Liu Hao called his father uncle.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son you should say you look like your dad,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Rubbish,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was unhappy his subject dared to talk back to him. Na Liu Hao levitated the objects in the bedroom again.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che waved his hand and the flying objects fell down on the floor again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little boy, don\u2019t make a mess,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao made objects smash into the walls.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, stop breaking things,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao ignored Yuan Gun Gun, and continue to smash objects into the walls.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che lost his patience. He levitated Na Liu Hao and Na Liu Hao suspended in the air upside down.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 182</p><br/>\n</div>"}

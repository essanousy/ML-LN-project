He looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes. She looked like she didn\u2019t recognise him. Why did she say her name was Na Liu Ling Yan? If big brother Du was Na Liu Ting Du then who was Hao Hao?</p><br/><p>For two years Hao Yan Che failed to forget Yuan Gun Gun. He wanted to hug Yuan Gun Gun, hit her bottom for leaving him and love her more.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared of Hao Yan Che. She didn\u2019t know why he was staring at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, is there something you want?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what is going on,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I\u2019m just taking my friend out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand, and pulled her away from Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, tell me who I am,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re the fat round ball,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers and Long Liu Bao resisted laughing.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s answer made Hao Yan Che speechless.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let go of my hand,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why she thought Hao Yan Che would bully her, but she didn\u2019t hate him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked coldly at Yuan Gun Gun and like in the past, she closed her mouth.</p><br/><p>After a tensed silence, Yuan Gun Gun spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t let go of my hand, I\u2019ll tell big brother Du to hit you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes changed color.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your eyes change color like Hao Hao too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Na Liu Hao\u2019s eyes were the only eyes in the world that changed color.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che deduced from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s odd behavior that she lost her memory. Her eyes didn\u2019t lie. She had forgotten him, and even forgot who she was. Thinking about her forgetting their life together made him crazy. How could she forget him?</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. She turned to look at Long Liu Bao. \u2018Bao Bao, I want to go home. I don\u2019t want to go out anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao wanted to live. If she saved Yuan Gun Gun, she wouldn\u2019t live.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, can you let go of Ling Ling\u2019s hand?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked softly. \u2018You\u2019re scaring her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s staying with me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You can all go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling is someone else\u2019s wife,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Say it again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018What do you mean someone else\u2019s wife?\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao stepped closer to the Long brothers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if she\u2019s not someone else\u2019s wife, she\u2019s precious to them,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018What am I supposed to say to her boyfriend?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you find a new man this quick?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t know you. I want to go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Home?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Where is your home?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, let go of Ling Ling\u2019s hand,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You\u2019re going to make her cry. She needs to go home. Her son is waiting for her at home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che heard son. He felt like lightning struck his heart. Did Yuan Gun Gun had a son with another man?</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao knew if she didn\u2019t clear Hao Yan Che\u2019s misunderstanding then no one would leave his office alive.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Ling Ling\u2019s loveable son is older than one year. He has white hair and violet eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che jumped from hell to heaven. White hair and violet eyes meant he was the father of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s son. He was happy and angry at the same time. Why did Yuan Gun Gun leave him if she was pregnant with his son? Why did Yuan Gun Gun take their son to live with another man?</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, I want to go home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looking coldly at Yuan Gun Gun made her cry.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018He is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Long Liu Lang interrupted.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 176</p><br/>\n</div>"}

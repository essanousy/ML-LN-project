Then he silently watched his dummy rice ball focus her attention on remembering what dishes she tasted to feed him.</p><br/><p>Later in the study room, Yuan Gun Gun fell asleep on Hao Yan Che\u2019s lap while he worked. He poked her loveable face, and realised how she trained her body to turn into a rice ball.</p><br/><p>At midday Yuan Gun Gun woke up from her nap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018You know how to live a good life,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and kept his eyes on the laptop.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go find aunty Chen to teach you how to tidy a room properly,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>In Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s drowsy state she walked toward the bathroom instead of the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come back,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked back to Hao Yan Che, and he pinched her adorable bottom.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018The door is that way,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and smiled.</p><br/><p>At eleven at night, Yuan Gun Gun followed Hao Yan Che from the exercise room to the master bedroom.

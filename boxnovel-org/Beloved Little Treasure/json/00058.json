The kitchen was on fire. She panicked when she saw two bodies lying outside the kitchen door. A little boy was protecting Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body, but she didn\u2019t recognise the little boy.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ran to the kitchen, and he felt like the blood in his body was drained out the moment he saw Yuan Gun Gun lying in front of the burning kitchen. He pushed the little boy off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body, and he hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called. \u2018Gun Gun, talk to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, take Gun Gun to the hospital,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I\u2019ll take care of the fire.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun, and Jia Tu carried the little boy to the car.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu noticed Qiang Jia Tao crying in a corner. He slapped her face and blood dripped out the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re going to die a painful death,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Qiang Jia Tao silently wiped blood off her mouth.</p><br/><p>At the hospital, Hao Yan Che sat outside the operating room. It was the first time in his life he felt like his body was cut into pieces. He knew his body would break down if he lost Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>The operating room door opened, a doctor pushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stretcher outside. Hao Yan Che leapt to Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s side, and he held her hand. Hao Yan Che looked at the doctor to say if anything happened to Yuan Gun Gun, he would bury the doctor with Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018The patient is stable\u2026 but unconscious,\u2019 the doctor stammered.</p><br/><p>\u2018When will she wake up?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps tonight or tomorrow morning, the doctor said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If she doesn\u2019t wake up tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to a VIP hospital room.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wasn\u2019t injured, another person was injured. In another VIP room, the little boy woke up with fifteen stitches on his head.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I knew my head would be shaved,\u2019 the little boy said.</p><br/><p>\u2018How else are the doctors going to stitch up your head?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where\u2019s my Gun Gun?\u2019 the little boy asked. \u2018Is she OK?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Your Gun Gun?\u2019 Yi Tu asked. \u2018Don\u2019t let a certain someone hear you say that.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s OK and she\u2019s staying in the room next to your room,\u2019 Jia Tu said. \u2018Young master is taking care of her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Can I visit big sister?\u2019 the little boy asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um, after you change back,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>Seconds later, Yi Tu, Jia Tu and a dog with a shaved head walked toward Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hospital room.</p><br/><p>In Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hospital room, Hao Yan Che stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair. He laughed at his foolish self. She had his heart yet he didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you belong with me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che whispered. \u2018Three years later, I\u2019ll give up my freedom to be with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che heard a knock on the door, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu, Jia Tu and Xiao Yuan walked into the room. Xiao Yuan wanted to jump onto the bed, Hao Yan Che\u2019s deadly gaze made Xiao Yuan obediently sit on the floor. Xiao Yuan barked softly like Xiao Yuan was begging Hao Yan Che to let Xiao Yuan lie next to Yuan Gun Gun on the bed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ignored Xiao Yuan, and kept stroking Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I deserve to be punished,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018This time I\u2019m partly responsible for endangering Gun Gun\u2019s life.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently looked at Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Also, I hid something from young master about the swimming pool incident,\u2019 Yi Tu confessed. \u2018I knew who the culprit was. But I wanted that person to help bring young master and Gun Gun together. I didn\u2019t think this would happen\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>A second later, Hao Yan Che kicked Yi Tu onto the floor. Even Xiao Yuan didn\u2019t anticipate Hao Yan Che\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu stayed on the floor and wiped blood off his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, you\u2019re still alive but it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t suffer,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said coldly. \u2018When did you start thinking you can scheme against me?\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Fifty-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

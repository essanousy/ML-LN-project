He let go of Long Liu Bao and followed Long Liu Bo outside the bedroom. It was Hao Yan Che\u2019s fault for making Long Liu Bao angry at him and Long Liu Bo.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao heard the door closed, and thumped the bed. She was angry at Hao Yan Che\u2019s arrogance. It made her remember Long Liu Bo\u2019s words, \u2018Long Liu Bao is my woman, if I want her dead then no one can stop me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hated being under the thumbs of rotten men like Long Liu Bo and Long Liu Lang.

She huddled on the edge of the bed, and looked wearily at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you bully me, I\u2019ll tell my daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che threw his phone at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s feet on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll give you one chance,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun called Yuan Ting Liu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy, it\u2019s me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Che wants to hit me.

Readers not of a mature age, skip chapter 142.</p><br/><p>In the Hao Mansion\u2019s master bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun sat on the edge of the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018How much did you hear?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everything,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened her mouth again after a tensed silence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, big sister Jia Tao\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is dead,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled Yuan Gun Gun onto his lap, and pinched her bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018That hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare eavesdrop yet you\u2019re scared of pain,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you let me hear then I wouldn\u2019t need to eavesdrop,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t a husband and wife meant to be honest with each other and not hide secrets?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I tell you about everything I do, but you tell nothing about what you do. That\u2019s not a fair exchange.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you tell me everything?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018The other night you secretly ate cheesecake. Last night you dare give medicine to Yi Tu behind my back. Today you ate junk food like crazy at the Long Mansion. Can you say that you tell me everything?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How did you know?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think everyone has your intelligence?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pouted her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018There is no one in the world who isn\u2019t hiding a secret,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I only explain when necessary. Why do I need to explain to my dummy?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun slid off Hao Yan Che\u2019s lap, and laid on the bed with her back facing Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun from behind. She let him fondle her breasts since it would be futile to push his hands away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 Che, was big sister Jia Tao the person who wanted to kidnap me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does big sister Jia Tao hate me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018She hates you bone deep,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But in the past she was good to me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018She put on an act,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re in a good mood,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Let\u2019s exercise a bit.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s dress.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I still want to talk with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You can ask,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018And I\u2019ll exercise. We won\u2019t disrupt each other.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sighed. She hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s neck and let him exercise inside her body.</p><br/><p>A while later Yuan Gun Gun orgasmed and cried out Hao Yan Che\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, do you love me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che moved deeper inside Yuan Gun Gun, and rubbed against her sensitive spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 Che, be gentle,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pushed Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest back. She couldn\u2019t get used to his strength even after being intimate with him every day for more than three years.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s glazed eyes. Couldn\u2019t she feel how much he loved her? Didn\u2019t her heart know she was the most important person to him? What else could he do to make her feel his love for her? Why did she doubt him? Should he give her a baby to erase her doubts?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body accepted Hao Yan Che\u2019s seed. But her heart craved for his love. They were married for more than three years yet he didn\u2019t love her. She loved him deeply. She didn\u2019t know what would happen to her if one day he didn\u2019t need her anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I hurting you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wiped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tears. She usually cried a little after he stopped, but not while he was still moving inside her.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to have a baby with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you want a baby, I\u2019ll give you a baby,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been three years but I\u2019m not pregnant,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I promise this year you\u2019ll be pregnant,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you promise?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you say another word, I\u2019m not going to give you a baby.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thrusted hard into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tight passage.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun muffled a cry.</p><br/><p>The master bedroom became quiet except for the sounds of the bed springs creaking. The creaking sounds lasted throughout the night.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 142</p><br/>\n</div>"}

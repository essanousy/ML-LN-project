She didn\u2019t register she was lying underneath him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s finger brushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. His lips slowly moved toward her lips. She closed her eyes, and felt like the beautiful face in front of her would disappear if their lips touch.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gently kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. She opened her eyes, and pushed his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just one kiss,\u2019 Hao Yan Che pleaded. \u2018One kiss is enough.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why her heart hurt hearing Hao Yan Che\u2019s desperate plea. It was like he waited forever to kiss her lips.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s gentle kiss became rougher. His tongue wouldn\u2019t let Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tongue rest. She liked him kissing her unlike when Na Liu Ting Du kissed her.</p><br/><p>A long time later, Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head spun and Hao Yan Che let go of her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your kissing skills are still poor,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You need more practice.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was too lost in Hao Yan Che\u2019s kiss to register his words.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face. When did he fall in love with her? Was it when she held a plunger in front of his bed? Or when she fell onto him and touched his chest? Perhaps it was when she risked her life to stop him from taking painkillers. Could it be when she sweetly bickered with him? Maybe it was when she cried and asked him why he must bully her. He didn\u2019t know when he fell in love with her. He only knew the moment he realised he loved her, it was too late to late to escape.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s late,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You should go to a different room and sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where do you want me to sleep?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018This is my room.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll go sleep in Hao Hao\u2019s bedroom. Tomorrow you can choose another room for me.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Remember this is our room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t let Yuan Gun Gun leave the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018That was in the past,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Get off me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to see what happens if you move again?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laid frozen underneath Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t remember what we did together on this bed,\u2019 Hao Yan Che whispered in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear. \u2018But I remember everything. If you don\u2019t want me to help you remember right now then listen to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand why Hao Yan Che was gentle one moment, and turned into someone unreasonable the next moment.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want me to help you remember right now?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried and made Hao Yan Che want to tease her.</p><br/><p>\u2018On this bed we loved each other,\u2019 Hao Yan Che whispered in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear. \u2018There wasn\u2019t a part of our bodies that didn\u2019t touch. Our rotten little demon son is proof of our love.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wiped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, even if you lost your memory, you can\u2019t deny the truth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019ll always be my wife.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her face and cried. Hao Yan Che pulled her hands away from her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I love seeing you cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you keep crying, I\u2019ll show you how we conceived our rotten little demon son.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re a perverted monster,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s good you know the truth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Don\u2019t provoke a monster like me, because I won\u2019t show you mercy.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 187</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yi Tu told her a ghost story about a hungry dead ghost looking for people to eat at night, and asking them to come out of their bedrooms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come out,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held Xiao Yuan and cried because she was scared of being eaten.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t hear Yuan Gun Gun respond so he unzipped the tent.</p><br/><p>\u2018No!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to come in here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want to hear Yuan Gun Gun crying.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t eat me. I\u2019m an only child, I have elderly parents to take care of. I have a young master I need to serve, and my small friends need me. I have meat on my body, but I hate showering. People say it\u2019s not good to eat fatty meat. You shouldn\u2019t eat a fatty meat body like mine. You should go find my young master. He has a lean masculine body, no fat. He\u2019s a beautiful man. He exercises every day, and he\u2019s a clean freak. The meat on his body would taste delicious. I\u2019m not lying. Go and find him to eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You certainly think highly of me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun crawled out of the sleeping bag, and clung onto Hao Yan Che\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it\u2019s you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You scared me to death.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s body disobeyed him. His body sat down, held her on his lap and let her cry on his shirt.</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought I was going to be eaten,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back. \u2018You\u2019re so noisy\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s small friends looked at their pitiful young mistress. Only Xiao Yuan licked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun picked up Xiao Yuan. She hugged Xiao Yuan, and Hao Yuan Che hugged her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Have you cried enough?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her face on Hao Yan Che\u2019s shoulder.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Put it down,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put Xiao Yuan on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it\u2019s late,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Why did you come out here to scare me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you say?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che threw his rice ball onto the sleeping bag.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sleeping,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t there a room for you to sleep in my home?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Why are you sleeping in the garden?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged a pillow.</p><br/><p>\u2018You said my small friends are not allowed to sleep inside,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018So I pitched a tent in the garden to sleep with them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who owns this tent?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Yi Tu,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who does the torch belong to?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Jia Wen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you angry?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You look angry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knocked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 it hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She rubbed her sore head. \u2018Why did you hit my head?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laid on top of Hao Yan Che\u2019s body to stop him from leaving the tent. He didn\u2019t know what the strange feeling in his heart was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, don\u2019t leave,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why shouldn\u2019t I leave?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t leave,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m scared. Stay here and sleep with me. I\u2019ll be your pillow.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need you to be my pillow,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. She pinched her cheeks. \u2018Look at the meat on my body. I\u2019ll be a comfortable soft pillow for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Forty-Two</p><br/>\n</div>"}

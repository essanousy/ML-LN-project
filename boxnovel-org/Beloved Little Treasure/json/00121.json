Qi Tu had changed into a golden werewolf. The golden werewolf viciously bit off the French woman\u2019s flesh piece by piece. The French woman\u2019s blood shot eyes were opened and looked in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun screamed.</p><br/><p>The golden werewolf looked at Yuan Gun Gun. It widened its mouth, bit another flesh chunk off the French woman\u2019s body, spat it out in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s direction and blood dripped onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Qi Tu, are you crazy?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Don\u2019t do that to the woman!\u2019</p><br/><p>The werewolf bit off the French woman\u2019s chest, and ate her heart.</p><br/><p>The werewolf jumped off the bed, and changed into the naked Qi Tu. He stood drenched in blood in front of Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026 Che\u2026 Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called and cried.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu dressed, and his bloodied hands clutched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xue Yi is more beautiful than you,\u2019 Qi Tu said.</p><br/><p>The moment Yuan Gun Gun blinked again, Hao Yan Che knocked down the door and glared at Qi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu, what do you want?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s bloodied hands rubbed blood on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to be the werewolf king,\u2019 Qi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t hesitate to take off the werewolf ring on his left thumb. He threw it and Qi Tu caught it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let her go,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s fingernails cut the ropes binding Yuan Gun Gun. She stood, and took a step toward Hao Yan Che. Qi Tu pulled her long hair, held her neck and licked blood off her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s bloodied body made Yuan Gun Gun nauseous.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu, don\u2019t take it too far,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s voice was calm, but his clenched hands betrayed his true feelings.</p><br/><p>\u2018What sort of a king are you?\u2019 Qi Tu asked. \u2018Why did you make this pathetic woman your queen? Why did you let her drink your blood and made her an immortal? Yet you let the beautiful Xue Yi die in front of you and refused to save Xue Yi.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu, you know clearly Xue Yi killed herself,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s heart hurt to see how scared Yuan Gun Gun was.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xue Yi killed herself because of you,\u2019 Qi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s bloodied hands rubbed blood on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Its\u2019 Xue Yi\u2019s choice whether she wanted to live or die,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018She choice to die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You are the Vampire King\u2019s son,\u2019 Qi Tu said. \u2018Your blood could have saved Xue Yi. Why did you refuse to save her?\u2019</p><br/><p>Qi Tu squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck. A second later Hao Yan Che stood behind Qi Tu and aimed a silver gun at Qi Tu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu, don\u2019t force me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu let go of Yuan Gun Gun, and turned around to face Hao Yan Che. Bloodied tears flowed down Qi Tu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know how important Xue Yi is to me?\u2019 Qi Tu asked. \u2018I love her. I love my twin sister. I\u2019ve loved her since we were children. But she loved you since she was a little girl. I thought if she married you, I would be happy to see her happy. You\u2019re my king and friend. We grew up together. How can you be this cruel to us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che threw the gun away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xue Yi said if I don\u2019t love her then I shouldn\u2019t save her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s shocked eyes looked at Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu, do you understand how hard it is to live forever?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che tried to put the werewolf ring onto Qi Tu\u2019s left thumb, but a bright white light emitted from the werewolf ring and the werewolf ring rejected Qi Tu\u2019s left thumb.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu stood in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now do you understand?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu laughed despairingly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I never wanted this but I can\u2019t escape my fate,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put the werewolf ring back on his left thumb, and stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shivering back.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu picked up the silver gun. Yuan Gun Gun fainted in Hao Yan Che\u2019s arms. Someone behind Qi Tu flung the silver gun out of Qi Tu\u2019s hand and knocked Qi Tu unconscious.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the silver Rolls-Royce.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 121</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sometimes talking to Yuan Gun Gun was like talking to a hot dog.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, do you love Na Liu Ting Du?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I think I love big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I must have loved him. He\u2019s my husband, and Hao Hao\u2019s daddy. If I didn\u2019t love him in the past then I wouldn\u2019t have a baby with him.\u2019</p><br/><p>In that moment Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t know if she should tell Yuan Gun Gun the truth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, can you imagine how you would feel if you lost your memory like me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I\u2019m lucky to wake up and see big brother Du. He\u2019s gentle and caring. Apart from asking me to stay at home, he gives me freedom. He loves me, and he loves Hao Hao. I think he is the most caring husband in the world. I should love him. But losing my memory makes me anxious. I always feel like I lost something important to me like how I carve DOVE on the pots I make. Not knowing what that something important to me is makes me anxious. Bao Bao, every day I feel anxious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, I believe one day you\u2019ll remember,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried on Long Liu Bao\u2019s shoulder. Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t show how scared she was in front of Ba Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao cried too. She was sad to see Yuan Gun Gun hurting because Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t remember Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Yuan Gun Gun massaged Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s shoulders. Suddenly he pulled her onto his lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, it\u2019s over a year now,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Do you want to meet your parents?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared to meet her parents.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, are you still not prepared to meet your parents?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t remember my parents,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t want them to be sad because I can\u2019t remember them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Your parents will be sad you can\u2019t remember them,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018But they love you unconditionally.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you avoid them for the rest of your life, it\u2019ll make your parents really sad,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want them to be sad,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then come with me to see your parents this weekend,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is the person who doesn\u2019t want you to visit your parents\u2019 home the most is me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m scared after you meet your parents then you won\u2019t need me anymore,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du lied.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll always need big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du closed his eyes. The real reason he didn\u2019t want Yuan Gun Gun to visit the Yuan Mansion was that she would remember Hao Yan Che. He knew he had to take a gamble. If Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t regain her memory after visiting the Yuan Mansion then he wouldn\u2019t need to worry anymore, and he could be with Yuan Gun Gun for the rest of her life. He didn\u2019t mind if Hao Yan Che was important in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s subconscious as long as she didn\u2019t remember Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>The following afternoon, Yuan Gun Gun told Long Liu Bao about her weekend plans.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you remember your parents?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But big brother Du said my parents miss me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t know if it was the right time to tell Hao Yan Che the truth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, I won\u2019t be gone long,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re my only friend. You can stay here, and wait for me to come back.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, the truth is I\u2019m in Paris on a holiday,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018My home is near your parents\u2019 home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, you don\u2019t need to worry that you\u2019ll be separated from me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What a coincidence,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018We\u2019re born to be friends.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 174</p><br/>\n</div>"}

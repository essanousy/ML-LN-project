We need to live with respect and dignity.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How do I make Che happy?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He always looks unhappy being with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re going to die of cluelessness,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not like I chose to be born this way,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao pulled her hair, and took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, think about the times when your monster Hao is the most gentle toward you,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>A while later, Long Liu Bao thought Yuan Gun Gun hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, are you there?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m still trying to remember the times when Che is gentle toward me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you live a pitiful life,\u2019 Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018I remember now,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018When?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018After Che hits me, he is gentle with me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Does that count?\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hit her head against her knees. How could such a person like Yuan Gun Gun exist?</p><br/><p>\u2018Apart from those times, when is Che most gentle toward you?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Long Liu Bao\u2019s voice sounded different than usual.</p><br/><p>\u2018Forget it,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Tell me something you do that doesn\u2019t make Che angry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018When he tells me to kiss him, I\u2019ll kiss him,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What else?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao wholly believed birds of a feather flock together and share the same interests.</p><br/><p>\u2018When he wants more and I don\u2019t runaway,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Forget birds, Long Liu Bao thought monsters were indeed monsters.</p><br/><p>\u2018I understand,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Do you know how to cook?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you what you need to do. Cook meals for Che. Take the initiative to feed him, kiss him and offer your body to him. I guarantee if you do everything I told you to do, he\u2019ll be a happy man. When he puts his guard down, ask him sweetly to let you spend time with me at the Long Mansion. He\u2019ll say yes to you in a heartbeat. Then we\u2019ll runaway together. Don\u2019t forget to pack your passport.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Take the initiative to kiss and offer my body to Che?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun liked Hao Yan Che kissing her. It was how he tired her out in bed afterward that scared her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know how to seduce your husband,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know how\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018OMG,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018What cave did you crawl out of? Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t eaten pork and seen pigs run.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve eaten pork,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But I haven\u2019t seen pigs run.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao began to sympathise with the monster Hao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Listen up,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Pucker your lips, brush your lips against your husband\u2019s lips, stick out your tongue and slowly lick his lips. Kiss him a bit, and look shyly into his eyes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao\u2019s specialty was seduction. Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s innocent appeal was the best weapon to use on the monster Hao.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019ll do my best,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018At night take the initiative to snuggle with your husband then slowly rub your hand up and down his chest,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Whisper in his ear\u2026 I want to do a role play with you in bed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Play what?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You don\u2019t have to do anything else after you whisper in your husband\u2019s ear what I taught you. He\u2019ll direct you how to play.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, do you think this is a good idea?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You need to sacrifice your body a bit if you want to win the war. Who knows, by tomorrow your monster Hao will become gentler than big brother Lang.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 153</p><br/>\n</div>"}

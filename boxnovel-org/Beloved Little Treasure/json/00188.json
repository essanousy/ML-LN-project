Hao Yan Che kissed her forehead, hugged her and pulled the bedsheet over their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodnight,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and turned off the light.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her eyes. She found a comfortable spot on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest and slept.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed the top of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head. After two years, he finally got to have a goodnight sleep.</p><br/><p>In the morning Hao Yan Che reached for Yuan Gun Gun. He sat upright, because she wasn\u2019t lying next to him.</p><br/><p>In Na Liu Hao\u2019s bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun was feeding Na Liu Hao breakfast.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy, I can eat breakfast on my own,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, why did you grow up so fast?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You can talk and walk.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao grabbed the bowl and spoon from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands and fed himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao if you\u2019re unhappy then mummy is unhappy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I know you miss big brother Du. Mummy doesn\u2019t know where big brother Du went or if he\u2019s coming back. We need to learn to live without big brother Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao ignored Yuan Gun Gun and continued eating.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, mummy thought big brother Du was your daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Now mummy knows big brother Du lied to mummy. Mummy is hurting. But we need to learn to accept the truth. Hao Hao, you look exactly like your daddy. We can\u2019t deny the truth. You\u2019re his flesh and blood\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The bedroom door slammed open. Hao Yan Che strode to Yuan Gun Gun, and he pulled her up.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you\u2019re going to leave the bed, why didn\u2019t you say something?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was scared Yuan Gun Gun left him again.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why Hao Yan Che was angry.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s bowl of food fell on top of Hao Yan Che\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026 Hao Hao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was too scared to look at Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle is not allowed to bully mummy!\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know if he should praise his son\u2019s bravery or strangle his son.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun brushed the food off Hao Yan Che\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m really sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Hao Hao is young and doesn\u2019t understand the situation. You should go take a bath.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked to his son, and they silently glared at each other.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s violet eyes glared at Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes like he was calling Hao Yan Che a hateful man.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want Hao Yan Che and Na Liu Hao to fight. She walked to Hao Yan Che and pulled his shirt sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao is your son,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t be angry at him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s mood brightened after he heard Yuan Gun Gun acknowledged he was the father of her son.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up his son, and wiped the food stains on his head onto his son\u2019s clothes. Then he put his son down, and happily walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao glared at Hao Yan Che\u2019s back, and fisted his small hands.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t believe what happened.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao held a fist up.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hate that old man!\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laughed at Na Liu Hao\u2019s antics. She picked up Na Liu Hao and kissed his chubby cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, don\u2019t be angry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy will give you a bath. Then mummy will cook you delicious food.\u2019</p><br/><p>Later Hao Yan Che returned to his son\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little demon, daddy is taking mummy to eat breakfast,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you want to come too?\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao ignored Hao Yan Che, and let Yuan Gun Gun dry his white hair with a towel.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can we eat here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned on the hair dryer and blow dried Na Liu Hao\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He frowned at the gentle way Yuan Gun Gun took care of their son. \u2018We need to eat in the dining room.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll finish drying Hao Hao\u2019s hair. I\u2019ll see you in the dining room.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want to leave without Yuan Gun Gun. He sat on the bed and waited for her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let Hao Yan Che sit on the bed. When she was about to turn off the hair dryer, Hao Yan Che opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018My hair needs drying too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 188</p><br/>\n</div>"}

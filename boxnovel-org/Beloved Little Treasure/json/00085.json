That way we\u2019ll always be together.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Impossible,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s not practical if we\u2019re always together. What happens when you want to eat, but I want to go to the bathroom?\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du laughed. Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s backward way of thinking dispelled the romantic atmosphere he weaved.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re amazing,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018What should I do with you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you saying?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, forget I\u2019m your big brother,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019m Na Liu Ting Du, and you\u2019re Yuan Gun Gun. I\u2019m a man, and you\u2019re a woman. In your heart, I don\u2019t want to be your big brother. I want to be your husband.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying you want to take me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to marry you,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Not take you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I understand,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Like how if you take mummy away from daddy, daddy will kill you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du was lost for words.</p><br/><p>\u2018But big brother Du, you can\u2019t marry me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re my big brother.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Starting from today, don\u2019t think of me as your big brother,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you don\u2019t need to give me an answer today,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019ll wait three years to hear your answer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat in silence. She didn\u2019t know what to say or think.</p><br/><p>At half past one, Hao Yan Che returned to his office but he didn\u2019t see his rice ball. He immediately called her phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du greeted. \u2018Are you looking for Gun Gun?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is she?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does she need your permission to see me?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t provoke me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you do, you\u2019ll only make her suffer.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why don\u2019t you ask her if I dare or not?\u2019 Hao Yan Que asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be delusional,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018You only have three years with her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I get to decide whether I\u2019m with her for three years, thirty years or three hundred years,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019re the delusional one.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du saw Yuan Gun Gun coming back from the bathroom. He hung up and put the phone in its original spot.</p><br/><p>On the other end, Hao Yan Che smashed the phone against a wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, Jia Tu, go find her and bring her back here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu and Jia Tu didn\u2019t want to end up like the broken phone. They quickly left Hao Yan Che\u2019s office to look for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>At Ting\u2019s cafe, Yuan Gun Gun looked at the clock above the counter and panicked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, I need to get back to work,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eat your meal first,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I need to go,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said eat your meal,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was shocked. She didn\u2019t know when Na Liu Ting Du turned temperamental like Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t waste food,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s usual gentle tone, and felt like she was seeing things before.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ate her meal and occasionally looked at Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s face to be certain it was Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du broke the pair of glasses in his hands, and vowed to be himself.</p><br/><p>At ten to two in the afternoon, Yuan Gun Gun ate a plate of egg tarts, a sundae and drank milk tea.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, I\u2019m done eating,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019ll take you back to work.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighty-Five</p><br/>\n</div>"}

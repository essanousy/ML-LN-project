She hugged Yuan Ting Liu. \u2018Daddy is my daddy. I really missed daddy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought you forgot you\u2019re daddy because you didn\u2019t see me in the living room,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who said?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I called daddy at the door. It\u2019s daddy who forgot me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu noticed Hao Yan Che\u2019s kiss marks on his little girl\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why Yuan Ting Liu was quiet.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du saw the kiss marks on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck too. He picked up a cookie from the coffee table and put it in his sour mouth.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du sensed the tension in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, come shopping with mummy,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Mummy will cook dinner for you before you leave.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled, and ran to Feng Du Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes mummy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu, Ting Du, do you two want to join us?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018We\u2019ll give you and Gun Gun privacy to spend time together.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du knew Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s answer before she asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018We\u2019ll see you and Ting Du at dinner time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Bye big brother Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>Only two solemn men were left in the living room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kiss marks,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du heard Yuan Ting Liu state the truth and the pain in his heart increased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, Gun Gun has always been a simple girl,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018She doesn\u2019t need designer clothes, jewellery and gourmet food. Do you understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, I understand,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018But right now she\u2019s receiving the best of everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018In the past I had doubts,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018But now I\u2019m certain that Hao Yan Che loves Gun Gun. Ting Du, ask yourself what chance you have left. Ting Du, I know you\u2019re more capable than me and on par with Hao Yan Che. But success is meaningless if you\u2019re wasting precious time being away from Gun Gun. While you\u2019re building your career, Hao Yan Che and Gun Gun\u2019s bond deepens. Perhaps in Gun Gun\u2019s heart, Hao Yan Che is her man and you\u2019re her big brother for life.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, you\u2019re right,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Perhaps I don\u2019t have a chance left.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu wanted both his children to be happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, even if it\u2019s true,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I want to use my last chance.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, like I told you before,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018No matter what happens, you\u2019ll always be my son.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du smiled bitter sweetly at Yuan Ting Liu. Na Liu Ting Du believed Yuan Ting Liu truly loved him as a father.</p><br/><p>In the dining room at ten at night, Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her satisfied stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m full,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy\u2019s food tasted delicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, do you want to eat ice-cream?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But Che only lets me eat ice-cream once a week.

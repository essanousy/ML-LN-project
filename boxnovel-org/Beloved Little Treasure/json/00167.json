But there is a higher chance your wife won\u2019t get her memory back.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018When can I take her home?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your wife needs to stay here for another two days for monitoring,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Thank you doctor,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>The doctor said bye to Na Liu Ting Du and walked outside Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hospital room.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du took out his phone to call Yuan Ting Liu.

You were robbed. The thief pushed you onto the road, a car hit you and you lost your memory. Don\u2019t be scared, and trust me. I\u2019ll protect you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du hugged Yuan Gun Gun.

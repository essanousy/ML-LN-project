They didn\u2019t want to offend CEO Hao, and they also didn\u2019t see Yuan Gun Gun injure Yang Wen. But they witnessed flying objects hitting Yang Wen.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re all lying!\u2019 Yang Wen said. \u2018Yuan Gun Gun injured me!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I saw what happened,\u2019 an employee said. \u2018Miss Yang wanted to push Yuan Gun Gun. But the files on the desks fell onto Miss Yang\u2019s feet, and Miss Yang fell onto the floor. Miss Yang picked up a glass vase and threw it at Yuan Gun Gun. Then I don\u2019t know how the glass vase flew backward and hit Miss Yang\u2019s forehead. Yuan Gun Gun wanted to help Miss Yang stand up, but Miss Yang hit Yuan Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, did she hit you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Where did she hit you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Hao Yan Che looked like he wanted to kill someone.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che smiled coldly at Yang Wen.</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare hit my wife?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yang Wen said. \u2018CEO Hao, I\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Throw her outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered. \u2018Make a public announcement that anyone who hires her is my enemy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yang Wen crawled to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, I\u2019m begging you not fire me,\u2019 Yang Wen said.</p><br/><p>The only woman in the world Hao Yan Che cared about was Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yang Wen grabbed onto Hao Yan Che\u2019s pants. He kicked her into the air, and she fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t touch me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t hurt her,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to help her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand, and carried their son in his other arm. \u2018Come with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took his wife and son to the elevators.</p><br/><p>The security guards dragged Yang Wen outside like she was a rubbish bag.</p><br/><p>The employees saw the trail of blood on the floor and winced.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is everyone standing idle for?\u2019 Feng Ting asked coldly. \u2018Get back to work.\u2019</p><br/><p>The employees wisely returned to their desks, and acted like nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting walked to her office, and thought about what delicious food to buy to entice her dummy friend to come see her so they could catch up on old times.</p><div></div><br/><p>In Hao Yan Che\u2019s office, Yuan Gun Gun stood in front of Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Hao Hao didn\u2019t mean to harm anyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Move away,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t believe Yuan Gun Gun was scared of him that much.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun refused to move away from Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che easily picked up his son.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018We can slowly talk about this.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, you did a good job,\u2019 Hao Yan Che praised. \u2018Next time if anyone bullies your mummy, you have daddy\u2019s permission to kill them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was surprised by the old man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth opened wide. She couldn\u2019t believe Hao Yan Che would teach their son to kill people.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gently poked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you as smart as our son?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can you say this?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked and rubbed her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want me to say?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018How can you be a dummy, and let anyone bully you? Yuan Gun Gun when will you understand how important your status is? You can bully other people, but other people are not allowed to bully you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put his son down on the floor, and continued to poke his wife\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you bullying me right now?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Apart from me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao let the old man pinch his mummy\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 it hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear, and he rubbed her ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not injured,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Spare Yang Wen. If you fire her, no other company will dare hire her. If she doesn\u2019t have a job, how is she going to make a living to support herself?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you know what\u2019s good for you, don\u2019t ask me to spare her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you think she would be grateful toward you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I don\u2019t want to fight with you over someone insignificant.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 193</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He wanted to marry her but she dared to say she didn\u2019t want to marry him.</p><br/><p>The following day at Han Yan\u2019s company, Yuan Gun Gun hid in a bathroom and cried. She wanted to have a marriage like her parents who loved each other. When she heard Hao Yan Che wanted to marry her, she was happy enough to fly. She thought the kind of like toward Hao Yan Che was love. It was a one sided love. She loved Hao Yan Che, but he didn\u2019t love her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun washed her hands at the sink, and looked at herself in the mirror. She couldn\u2019t marry someone who didn\u2019t love her. She washed the tears off her face and walked outside the bathroom.</p><br/><p>At midday, Hao Yan Che was worried why Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t return to his office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go find her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, perhaps Yuan Gun Gun is in the women\u2019s bathroom,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018There are women at Hao Yan\u2019s company you can ask any of them to look for Yuan Gun Gun in the women\u2019s bathroom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Jia Tu reported to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019ve searched two hundred bathrooms,\u2019 Jia Tu said. \u2018I didn\u2019t find Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che called Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s phone. She didn\u2019t pick up, and he hung up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go find her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu left Hao Yan Che\u2019s office, but Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t sit still while Yuan Gun Gun was missing. Hao Yan Che grabbed the key for the silver Rolls-Royce and walked to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che drove around restaurants Yuan Gun Gun liked to eat. At the red lights he received a phone call, and put it on speaker.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao,\u2019 the caller said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Are you looking for your little treasure?\u2019 the caller asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is she?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to see her?\u2019 the caller asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s the address?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>The caller hung up the phone and sent a photo of where Yuan Gun Gun was held captive.</p><br/><p>At a secret location, Yuan Gun Gun woke up. The back of her neck hurt like someone struck her neck, and her wrists and ankles were bound.</p><br/><p>The door opened and Qi Tu walked in with a beautiful French woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Qi Tu?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s smile was scarier than frostbite.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Qi Tu, was it you who struck me and took me here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu whispered something into the French woman\u2019s ear. She giggled and kissed him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt Qi Tu\u2019s behavior was creepy. The ropes around her wrists and ankles were too tight for her to free herself.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu\u2019s lifted the French woman\u2019s short dress and put his hand into her underpants.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Qi Tu, let me leave!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu tossed the French woman onto the bed. She took off her short dress and spread her legs. While he took off his shirt and pants.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t want to witness Qi Tu and the French woman\u2019s perverse behavior.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun could close her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t cover her ears. The French woman\u2019s moans made her body shiver. The last thing Yuan Gun Gun remembered was she walked out of the bathroom. Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why Qi Tu held her captive, and wanted her to witness him with the French woman in bed.</p><br/><p>The French woman\u2019s moans grew progressively louder. One hour later, she screamed like someone was cutting her body flesh into pieces. After her screams was dead silence.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 120</p><br/>\n</div>"}

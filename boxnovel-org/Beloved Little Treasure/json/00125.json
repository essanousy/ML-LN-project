He snatched her phone and smashed it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, what are you doing?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun picked up the broken phone. Hao Yan Che destroyed the phone Na Liu Ting Du gave her. She lost her big brother like she lost the phone.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrist and she dropped the broken phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026 what are you doing?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I was talking to big brother Du. Why did you break the phone big brother Du gave me as a birthday gift?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know you\u2019re about to marry me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course I know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you calling another man before you\u2019re about to marry me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t care Hao Yan Che was hurting her wrist. Her heart hurt a lot more.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did it have to be like this?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u2018I only have one big brother\u2026 he\u2019s the person who loved me since I was a little girl,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Why did it turn out like this? My big brother doesn\u2019t need me anymore. My big brother never cries. That night he cried. I believe he truly didn\u2019t want to hurt me. He was in pain. He knew I didn\u2019t choose him. I chose you. After that night, he left. I\u2019ve hurt the person who loved me the most. Why does everyone forces me to choose between my big brother and you? Why won\u2019t my big brother come back?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was angry and heartbroken to see Yuan Gun Gun devastated. He hugged Yuan Gun Gun. He was angry she was upset with him for breaking another man\u2019s gift to her, and she was crying because of another man. His heart hurt because she was in pain.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let Hao Yan Che constrict her body in a tight hug. There were no ifs left. Ifs were in the past. If she didn\u2019t meet Hao Yan Che, perhaps she would have married Na Liu Ting Du and Na Liu Ting Du wouldn\u2019t have gone to Paris all alone. There were no ifs left, because she did meet Hao Yan Che. Hao Yan Che was in her life and in her heart.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Right now it doesn\u2019t matter if you say you won\u2019t marry me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It\u2019s too late.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you betray me, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018I won\u2019t betray you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was never going to let Yuan Gun Gun leave him. He held her face, and kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>In Paris, Na Liu Ting Du licked his heart wounds. He listened to the phone disconnection signal. He asked himself when he became so blind and petty. There was only one answer, he became blind and petty the day he acknowledged he loved Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>On the other side of Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s phone, Hao Yan Che took Yuan Gun Gun to room two. In room two servants clustered around Yuan Gun Gun and fussed over her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know how long he waited to see Yuan Gun Gun wear the wedding dress to marry him. She looked beautiful and delicate in the white lace wedding dress.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, when can I eat?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I\u2019m really hungry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che unwrapped a chocolate and put it in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait a bit,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was satisfied how beautiful Yuan Gun Gun looked in the wedding dress and the light makeup that didn\u2019t hide her natural beauty.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to eat more,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put out her hand, and Hao Yan Che patted her hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018None left,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re lying,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun searched for chocolates in Hao Yan Che\u2019s pockets.</p><br/><p>\u2018There really is none left,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ready?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 125</p><br/>\n</div>"}

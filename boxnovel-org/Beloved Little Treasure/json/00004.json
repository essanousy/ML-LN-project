She felt nothing else in the world could make her happier.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, is the food delicious?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s delicious,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She bit another chicken wing, and smiled at Qiu Li Luo. \u2018Aunty Li why aren\u2019t you eating?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Because aunty loves watching Gun Gun eat adorably and aunty forgot to eat,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo picked up a napkin, and she helped wipe grease off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth and clothes.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put a chicken wing in Qiu Li Luo\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Li needs to eat too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy said a person needs to eat breakfast if they want to be beautiful. Look how beautiful aunty Li is. If aunty Li doesn\u2019t eat breakfast then aunty Li won\u2019t be beautiful anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s innocence made Qiu Li Luo laughed. Qiu Li Luo ate the chicken wing Yuan Gun Gun put in her bowl.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que strode into the dining room. He was angry at Qiu Li Luo. Everything he said to his wife last night, went through one ear and out the other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good morning uncle Que,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good morning husband,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo greeted. \u2018Why\u2026 didn\u2019t you sleep in?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que walked to Qiu Li Luo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, your heart didn\u2019t hear what I said to you last night,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 didn\u2019t,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, last night I said you can\u2019t leave the bed before me,\u2019 Hao Yan Que. He stroked Qiu Li Luo\u2019s long white hair. \u2018If you do, you have to pay the price.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Que!\u2019 Qiu Li Luo called. \u2018Gun Gun\u2019s here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo didn\u2019t want Hao Yan Que to corrupt Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s innocent eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018Look at the hearty way Gun Gun is eating. She can\u2019t hear us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que was impressed with Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eating skills.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo watched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chubby hands hold a bowl of vegetable soup, and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s white teeth fought to chew on the vegetables.</p><br/><p>\u2018Luo Li Qiu!\u2019 Hao Yan Que called.</p><br/><p>\u2018That isn\u2019t my name,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Luo, stop avoiding the evitable,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018What do you think your punishment is?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Que, I promise I won\u2019t leave the bed before you again,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018I left the bed early because I was worried Gun Gun was hungry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que scoffed. Qiu Li Luo tugged his shirt sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be angry,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018Sit down and eat with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que sat next to Qiu Li Luo and he began eating breakfast.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo ate breakfast in between putting food into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bowl and wiping Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ate heartily, she didn\u2019t know her parents were having nervous breakdowns because she was missing.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the Yuan Mansion, there was tension between Feng Du Du and Yuan Ting Liu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where\u2019s my Gun Gun?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu silently rubbed his tensed temple.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care if you hate me and flaunt your women in my face,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018But you can\u2019t hide Gun Gun from me. I can\u2019t live without Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu didn\u2019t know what to say to comfort Feng Du Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are you hiding Gun Gun?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked. \u2018If you hate me, why did you marry me and wanted to have children with me? I left to give back your freedom. If you hate me, why did you force me to come back?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du closed her eyes and cried. She loved Yuan Ting Liu, but he treated her cruelly.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu avoided looking at Feng Du Du\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Gun Gun will stay with you. I know you\u2019ll treat Gun Gun well. I\u2019ll leave. This time don\u2019t look for me. You can\u2019t use Gun Gun to blackmail me.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Feng Du Du wiped her tears, and she walked past Yuan Ting Liu.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu captured Feng Du Du\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to leave,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can either let me go or kill me,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du picked up the knife from the dining table to slit her wrist. Yuan Ting Liu immediately disarmed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Feng Du Du, are you crazy?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Being played by you made me crazy,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Are you happy? You can kill me. I don\u2019t want to live like this. I\u2019m tired of suffering. Why are you this cruel to me? Five years ago I loved you, but you pretended you couldn\u2019t see. You\u2019re always icy cold toward me. You\u2019re a scar in my heart. For five years, Gun Gun and I lived a happy life together but you forced us to come back here. Then you brought another woman here to pour salt onto my scar. Why are you treating me this way? What have I done wrong except love you? What do you want? Do you want me to die?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du pounded Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s chest, and she cried all the tears she bottled up. She couldn\u2019t live in Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s cold home.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu let Feng Du Du hit him as much as she wanted. He hugged her, he didn\u2019t want to hurt her. He was naturally born a cold person. He didn\u2019t know how to love another person.</p><br/><p>Years ago, Yuan Ting Liu didn\u2019t know what to do with Feng Du Du who used to always smile at him. Even if he was cold toward her, she used to smile at him and stayed with him. He didn\u2019t know why, but slowly he could only see her. If he couldn\u2019t see her, he would feel lost. He thought she knew he cared about her, and they would always be together.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu thought Feng Du Du would always smile, cook and eat dinner with him. But five years ago Feng Du Du left him. When he found out, he fell into pieces. He didn\u2019t understand why. The night before she left, they slept together but the next morning she secretly left him. She didn\u2019t take anything he gave her. Then he slowly resented her. He fooled himself into thinking he didn\u2019t need her, and he could live without her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu didn\u2019t look for Feng Du Du for four years. He thought he could forget Feng Du Du by four years. He failed, he went to look for her after five years. He told himself he only wanted to bring her back and make her suffer for leaving him. But when he found her, she gave him a happy surprise. He found out they had a daughter together, Yuan Gun Gun. He was happy she gave birth to their daughter, and he brought her and their daughter home. He used their daughter to blackmail her to stay, and he did everything to make her suffer for leaving him and hiding their daughter from him.</p><br/><p>If Yuan Ting Liu was honest with himself, he would see that he wanted to forgive Feng Du Du and wanted to learn how to treat her better. But she didn\u2019t want to accept him in her life. She made him angry by putting distance between them. So he did something childish. He brought a woman home to make her jealous, and show her she still loved him like she did five years ago. But she wasn\u2019t jealous. She calmly walked past the living room and upstairs to her bedroom. She didn\u2019t know the moment he couldn\u2019t see her, he pushed the woman off his lap onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Two days ago, Yuan Ting Liu wanted to confess to Feng Du Du that he didn\u2019t do anything to betray her. But he discovered Yuan Gun Gun was missing. He didn\u2019t want her to worry so he let her misunderstand him that he was hiding Yuan Gun Gun from her.</p><br/><p>When Yuan Ting Liu saw Feng Du Du picked up the knife to harm herself, he realised he loved her. He didn\u2019t know what he did to make the woman he loved changed from a lively woman to a woman he didn\u2019t recognise.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Four to Five</p><br/>\n</div>"}

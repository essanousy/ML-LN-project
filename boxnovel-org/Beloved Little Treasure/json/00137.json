She lifted her dress above her scraped knees. \u2018Do you mean this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao covered her eyes. She couldn\u2019t believe how honest Yuan Gun Gun was.

Hungry? Tired? Do you want to sleep?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du didn\u2019t look like a mother of a grown woman. But her husband was immune to her sweet deposition when he was angry at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu held Feng Du Du\u2019s hand, and they walked to his car.</p><div></div><br/><p>Long Liu Bao pitied Yuan Gun Gun. Yuan Gun Gun grew up with a cold dad, and Yuan Gun Gun married a monster.</p><br/><p>Later at the Hao Mansion\u2019s living room, Yi Tu was kneeling on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, why is big brother Yi Tu kneeling?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll know soon,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Aunty Chen, bring it here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bring it here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen reluctantly gave Hao Yan Che a silver box.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun knew any beautiful boxes that appeared inside the Hao Mansion held deadly contents.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took out the long whip from the silver box.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, who am I?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, you willingly serve under me and know what happens if you defy me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che. \u2018Today if you don\u2019t want to admit you disobeyed me, you\u2019re free to leave. Do you want to leave or stay and face the whip?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I choose to receive my punishment,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che whipped Yi Tu\u2019s left shoulder. Yi Tu\u2019s left shoulder bled, but Yi Tu endured the pain silently.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che saw the wound on Yi Tu\u2019s shoulder and he suppressed their bond over the years. Hao Yan Che needed to stay indifferent, he whipped Yi Tu\u2019s back four times. Yi Tu\u2019s bloodied skin peels stuck to the whip.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t standby to witness Yi Tu being whipped. Yuan Gun Gun knew that if anyone disobeyed Hao Yan Che\u2019s orders, they would be whipped. Hao Yan Che threatened to whip Yuan Gun Gun often, but she never seen him take out a whip to whip anyone until that day. The sounds of the whip lashes, and the sight of Yi Tu\u2019s blood made Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head dizzy.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 137</p><br/>\n</div>"}

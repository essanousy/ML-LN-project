The bride in the portrait had her face, but a rice ball body unlike her stick body. The rice ball bride was smiling and hugging the groom\u2019s neck.

But Na Liu Hao jumped off the bed, and followed Hao Yan Che outside. She signed and followed the father and son.</p><br/><p>A while later, Hao Yan Che opened a bedroom that was nearby the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, this is your bedroom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao walked into his bedroom, and locked the door.</p><br/><p>Outside Na Liu Hao\u2019s bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun smiled apologetically to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Hao Hao is upset because he wants to see big brother Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, do you need to be this courteous with me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t remember my past.

He held back his anger because home came out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her sore chin. Suddenly Hao Yan Che pulled her to the bedroom, and pushed her onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026 are you doing?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ripped Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s shirt to pieces.

Yuan Gun Gun looked at the shirt pieces on the floor, wiped sweat off her forehead and felt grateful he didn\u2019t hit her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che exercised, took a bath and laid in his bed. He thought about Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sweet smile, her scared face, her sleepy face, the bruises on her body and her wearing another man\u2019s shirt. He punched a wall. Didn\u2019t she know how to take the initiative to makeup with him? Why didn\u2019t she come wake him up? Why didn\u2019t she look for him?</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got out of bed, and he stared at his phone for a long time.

Then he quietly walked to the pink bedroom to check that his rice ball was sleeping on the pink bed.</p><br/><p>The next day, the servants gossiped about how their young master punished their future young mistress. The maids who helped clean Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom saw the sacrificed shirt on the floor, and Yuan Gun Gun naked on the pink bed. The maids were shocked their young master would punish Yuan Gun Gun in that way when Yuan Gun Gun was injured. So most of the servants cooked nutritious food to nourish Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>During the period Yuan Gun Gun took leave from school, she was responsible for cooking three meals a day again. The servants advised Yuan Gun Gun not to bow to Hao Yan Che, and to watch Hao Yan Che eat instead of running to her bedroom. But Yuan Gun Gun refused.</p><br/><p>One early morning, a person snuck into the kitchen, turned on the gas stove, walked outside the kitchen and closed the kitchen door.</p><br/><p>At eight in the morning, Yuan Gun Gun fed her small friends and Xiao Yuan followed her to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Fifty-Seven</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She turned around and glared at her laughing friend.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you actually think the heavens can\u2019t control their bladder, farts and bowel?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, everyone has the same three kinds of emergencies,\u2019 Long Liu Bao. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t assume the heavens can control every emergency.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What a hateful friend you are,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can\u2019t you sympathise with me a bit?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Your husband at most would pat you two times if he\u2019s angry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018His heart would break if his little treasure is in pain. Not like me, I\u2019ve been given beatings since I was a little girl.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do they break your phone?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s a broken phone?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018They\u2019ve broken my laptop before.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was grateful Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t break her laptop.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does your husband threaten to lock you in the bedroom with him if you don\u2019t cooperate with your husband?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Usually he doesn\u2019t threaten to lock me in our bedroom with him,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He takes me to bed and keeps me in bed with him for a long time. Even if I beg him to spare me, he won\u2019t let me go until he\u2019s satisfied.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang thought Hao Yan Che was a true monster.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do they hit you there?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 Long Liu Lang asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018On your round place.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you mean my bottom?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Yes they\u2019ve hit my bottom right in front of the servants.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sympathised with Long Liu Bao\u2019s plight. The Long brothers were too much.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does your husband hit your head with his knuckles?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then you\u2019re luckier than me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018He hits my head with his whole hand,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><div></div><br/><p>The two women exchanged a sympathetic look with each other. They were born to be friends. Who else suffered the same fate as them?</p><br/><p>\u2018But isn\u2019t big brother Lang gentle?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018At least if big brother Bo is angry at you, you have big brother Lang to protect you. If Che is angry at me, I have no one to protect me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you actually think big brother Lang is gentle?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Big brother Lang is gentle and caring.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun had dreamt of marrying a gentle and caring man.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, big brother Lang is gentle and caring,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018But if he loses his temper, he\u2019s scarier than big brother Bo.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun popped a chocolate in their mouths.</p><br/><p>\u2018At least there are times when big brother Lang is gentle and caring,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018But have you thought how scarier it is for me when they\u2019re angry at the same time? At least you only have to deal with one Hao Yan Che no matter his mood swings. When big brother Bo and big brother Lang are angry at the same time, the person who\u2019s dead is me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It sounds like you live a more dangerous life,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s wrong for them to be with me?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong about it?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think it\u2019s normal for two men to be with the same woman?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018As long as you love them then there is nothing wrong,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t think there is anything absolutely right or wrong in the world. It depends on each person if they think what they do with their own life is worth it. You and big brother Lang and big brother Bo are compatible with each other and love each other. There is nothing wrong with you being with them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you my dear friend,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is there to thank me for?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said and pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is I wanted a husband who is gentle and caring like big brother Lang,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want me to help you find a gentle and caring husband?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Long Liu Bao. Why did Hao Yan Che always appear at the wrong time? Yuan Gun Gun wondered if there was bad blood between her and the heavens.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 140</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yuan Gun Gun quietly got out of bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to take a bath?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quietly followed Hao Yan Che to the bathroom. She turned on the tap, waited for the bathtub to be full, tested the water and quietly walked out of the bathroom.</p><br/><p>One hour later, Hao Yan Che walked out of the bathroom and sat on the bed. Yuan Gun Gun knelt behind him and blow dried his hair.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che felt the way Yuan Gun Gun touched his head was indifferent. Since their argument that day, she didn\u2019t bicker with him, didn\u2019t ask him for dessert, didn\u2019t cry, and quietly performed her duties like there was nothing between them. She acted like a doll without a soul. He was frustrated he couldn\u2019t vent, because she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. There was a ticking bomb in his stomach.</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, Yuan Gun Gun put the dryer in a drawer, and laid in bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to sleep yet?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not yet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then can I watch TV?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che moved closer to Yuan Gun Gun on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun moved to the edge of the bed to distance herself from Hao Yan Che, and turned on the TV.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took a deep breath, and told himself to be patient. He got out of bed, got a pudding out of the fridge and put it in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you young master\u2026 Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che missed the way Yuan Gun Gun called his name sweetly. He fisted his hands, and laid close to her. He didn\u2019t expect she would get out of bed and sit on a chair to eat the pudding.</p><br/><p>\u2018I remember you said I\u2019m not allowed to eat on the bed,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to kill someone. How often did he feed Yuan Gun Gun in bed? Yet she suddenly wanted to abide by the rules. She broke all his rules. So he got rid of the rules. He wanted to go back to the period they were happy together.</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun threw the rubbish in the bin, washed her hands in the bathroom and laid on the edge of the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to sleep,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She closed her eyes. \u2018You can turn off the TV when you want to.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun fell off the bed. Hao Yan Che got out of bed and carried her back to the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was unlucky. Hao Yan Che startled her, and made her fall off the bed. Her forehead hurt, but he was pain free yet he acted like she was in the wrong. She should be the one who asked what he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what you want,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I don\u2019t want anything,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then smile,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth up. She didn\u2019t know why he was acting odd, but she forced herself to smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you call this a smile?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Who do you want to scare? It\u2019s hard to look at.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled wider.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not like this,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Like how you usually smile.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun had enough and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pushed Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest hard.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to smile!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ve done everything to appease you, but why are you picking fights with me? Does watching me suffer make you happy? If you don\u2019t want to see me, you can pick up the phone and call my daddy. Tell my daddy that you hate me, and you want to send me back to the Yuan Mansion. There is no reason for you to treat me like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 111</p><br/>\n</div>"}

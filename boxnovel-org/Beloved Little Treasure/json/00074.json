But their lives are short. I\u2019m scared of losing Xiao Yuan when Xiao Yuan dies. If all my small friends die in front of me like in the movie, I\u2019ll be heartbroken.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018What will happen if my family dies before me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know how Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s brain jumped from animals to humans.</p><br/><p>\u2018You must have a lot of free time to sit here and think about hypothetical situations,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was lost in her sad thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I die, will you be sad?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019ll be sad,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Why?

He knocked her head, opened the drawer and took out a chocolate from the chocolate box\u2026 Yuan Gun Gun immediately stopped crying, and jumped out of the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m going to prepare your bath,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Where are the chocolates?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018In here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and rubbed her stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018All the chocolates?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun took steps back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like it,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said sarcastically and clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and ran. Hao Yan Che caught her and carried her back to the bed. That night she knew she couldn\u2019t escape punishment.</p><br/><p>A couple of days later Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s period left, and scheduled another visit for the following month.</p><br/><p>On a sunny day Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand and they walked to the dining room. She let go of her hand after she saw Yi Tu. She ran to Yi Tu, shook Yi Tu\u2019s arms and Hao Yan Che\u2019s good mood soured.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Yi Tu,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Yi Tu greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where have you been?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Did you go on a trip?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yi Tu lied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Was it fun?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s waist and pulled her to his side.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, my waist hurts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed and Yuan Gun Gun sat on Hao Yan Che\u2019s lap at the dining table. She tasted the dishes before feeding Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>The servants believed miracles existed after they witnessed their icy young master being tamed by their warm future young mistress.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, what happened to big sister Jia Tao?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen her for a long time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, the truth is she\u2026\u2019 Yi Tu interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Resigned,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did big sister Jia Tao resign?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yun Gun Gun bit half a spring roll, and fed Hao Yan Che the other half.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to know,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and chewed the spring roll Yuan Gun Gun fed him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun remembered Qiang Jia Tao told her that Qiang Jia Tao used to be Hao Yan Che\u2019s maid. Yuan Gun Gun wondered if in three years times Hao Yan Che would be as nonchalant after she returned to her family. She looked at Hao Yan Che\u2019s cold eyes, and it made her sad thinking he wouldn\u2019t care if she was gone.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put half a random dish in her mouth, fed the other half to Hao Yan Che and he didn\u2019t ask her about why she looked sad again.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Yuan Gun Gun waved bye to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m going to class,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu waited until Yuan Gun Gun left before opening his mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you want to hide the truth about Qiang Jia Tao from Gun Gun?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qiang Jia Tao is in hiding,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018What happens if she comes back here and harms Gun Gun? Young master, you should tell Gun Gun the truth so Gun Gun will keep her guard up against Qiang Jia Tao.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It looks like you care too much about Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Seventy-Four</p><br/>\n</div>"}

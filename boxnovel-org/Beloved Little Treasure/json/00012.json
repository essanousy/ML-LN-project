If it\u2019s something I can give, I won\u2019t withhold it from you two.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s good we\u2019re straight forward like each other,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018My wife and I only have one request. We want Gun Gun to marry our oldest son.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, my husband and I truly love Gun Gun,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018All we want is you to give your blessing for Gun Gun to be our daughter-in-law for saving her life. We promise we\u2019ll be good in-laws to Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t decide Gun Gun\u2019s fate,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018What if your oldest son doesn\u2019t love Gun Gun? It\u2019s not enough if you and your husband love Gun Gun. I don\u2019t want Gun Gun to be unhappy in the future.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que saw disappointment in Qiu Li Luo\u2019s violet eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, how do you want to repay my wife for saving your daughter\u2019s life?\u2019 Hao Yan Que asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018When Gun Gun is eighteen, I\u2019ll let her come here to be your oldest son\u2019s maid for three years,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018If your oldest son and Gun Gun love each other then I\u2019ll give my blessing for your oldest son to marry Gun Gun. If your oldest son rejects Gun Gun then Gun Gun can return to her family, because taking care of your oldest son for three years is enough to repay your wife for saving her life.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why does Gun Gun need to be my oldest son\u2019s maid?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a good cover for Gun Gun to live here and spend time with your oldest son,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo nodded her head at Hao Yan Que.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s settled,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018In thirteen years, I\u2019ll ask someone to escort Gun Gun here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a promise,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Since there is a chance your oldest son will be my son-in-law, can you tell me his name?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu heard the twelve-year-old Hao Yan Che was CEO of Hao Yan\u2019s company.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can you tell me if there is a rift between you and your oldest son?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, why do you think there is a rift?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your oldest son is a successful genius,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018My daughter\u2019s IQ is in the bottom end of the spectrum. She\u2019s only good at taking care of animals, and knowing how to empty a fridge of full of food into her stomach.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I love Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s simple mind and her gentle soul,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu drank his cup of coffee. He didn\u2019t admit how much he loved Yuan Gun Gun. Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t need to be smart and successful. It was enough Yuan Gun Gun was his and Feng Du Du\u2019s daughter. In his heart he only had room for Feng Du Du and Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, I believe Gun Gun will be mine and my husband\u2019s daughter-in-law,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu smiled politely at Qiu Li Luo and Hao Yan He. Yuan Ting Liu knew intelligent men didn\u2019t want a dummy wife. But they wanted a wife with a pure heart. Yuan Ting Liu was a prime example, he lost his heart to a simpleton like Feng Du Du.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Thirteen years later.</p><br/><p>A chubby young woman snuck out to the garden of strange animals. There were rabbits, chipmunks, mice, snakes, birds, dogs and cats. The animals were strange because they didn\u2019t eat each other, and lived in harmony with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t lick big sister,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said to the animals. \u2018Big sister just washed her face. Don\u2019t make noises. If you do, big sister can\u2019t sleep with everyone, because daddy and big brother Due will come out here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here already,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said to Yuan Gun Gun who was lying on the grass with the animals.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Due,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, how many times have I said you can\u2019t sleep out here with them?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stood, and a chipmunk perched on her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But you don\u2019t let me sleep with you. So I came out here to sleep with them. I\u2019m not used to sleeping alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du untangled knots out of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re grown up now,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018You need to learn to sleep by yourself. Be good. Come inside, dad\u2019s looking for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt sad to part with the animals. She slowly followed Na Liu Ting Du into the Yuan Mansion.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du suddenly turned around and he brushed the chipmunk off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>The chipmunk picked up its fallen nut, and glared at the man who knocked the chipmunk off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah, Xiao Bi\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du pulled Yuan Gun Gun inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad will be angry if you make him wait,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Twelve to Thirteen</p><br/>\n</div>"}

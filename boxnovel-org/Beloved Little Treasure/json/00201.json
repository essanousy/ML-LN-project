His gentleness always made her flustered.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I tell you my wish, it won\u2019t come true,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to make Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face turn a brighter red. His lips moved closer to her lips. When she couldn\u2019t tilt her head back any further, his lips moved to her ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018How many planes have you captured?\u2019 Hao Yan Che whispered in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was disappointed Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t kiss her. He carried her in his arms like how he carried their son.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, if you want your wish to come true,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Tomorrow I\u2019ll take you to the Hao Household\u2019s airport, and you can capture one thousand planes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That won\u2019t count,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You ask for too much,\u2019 Hao Yan Che teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can I ask you something?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hey,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Call me by my name.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018I see,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I didn\u2019t satisfy you last night, and you forgot what I said to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hit Hao Yan Che\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop teasing me like this,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then say my name,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Ask me anything.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know what DOVE means?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do you ask?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because the doctor told me if I remember DOVE then it must be something important to me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took off his jacket and draped it around Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is after you left, I discovered you embroidered and wrote Dove everywhere around our home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You wrote it on my clothes, your clothes, towels, the ceilings and even on the rugs. Every day I thought about what DOVE meant to you. I thought perhaps you love DOVE chocolates. Because I don\u2019t let you eat chocolates every day, it was your way of saying you want to eat chocolates every day.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s what big brother Du said too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me in everyone\u2019s eyes I\u2019m someone who loves eating.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You do love eating,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>In the past Hao Yan Che would be angry to hear Yuan Gun Gun mention Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s name. But he knew he shouldn\u2019t be too greedy. He was a thousand times more blessed than Na Liu Ting Du, because Yuan Gun Gun chose him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sleepy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to go home and sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018We\u2019ll go home and sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Several days past, Yuan Gun Gun was happier each day living with Hao Yan Che. But no one expected their son would stir up their blissful life together instead of Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want daddy,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ha turned his face violet and looked coldly at his mummy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, didn\u2019t mummy say that daddy left us?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want daddy,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy knows you miss daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy miss daddy too. If daddy left us, how can mummy find him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was sad Na Liu Ting Du left without saying goodbye to her and Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, don\u2019t cause trouble,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Uncle Hao will be unhappy if he hears you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao made a wardrobe topple between him and his mummy.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want daddy!\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her ears. Na Liu Hao\u2019s booming voice shattered the window glass and mirrors in the room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kicked open the door, walked to his son and slapped his son\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s heart broke to see her husband hit their son\u2019s cheek. She ran to their son, and hugged him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, how old are you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t know you can\u2019t use your powers to harm your family members. You could have injured your mummy.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 201</p><br/>\n</div>"}

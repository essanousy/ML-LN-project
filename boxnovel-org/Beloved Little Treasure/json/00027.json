A moment ago, she was crying and the next moment she was smiling happily at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is this?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Congee,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Of course Hao Yan Che knew it was a bowl of congee.</p><br/><p>\u2018When did I say I wanted to eat congee?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I broke many of your possessions but you\u2019re not angry with me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun whispered in Hao Yan Che\u2019s ear. \u2018I made this congee especially for you. It tastes delicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>The servants were flabbergasted. Even Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen thought Yuan Gun Gun was brave to change Hao Yan Che\u2019s strict diet. Mrs Chen stood sternly, but inwardly she was happy to see Yuan Gun Gun and Hao Yan Che get along.</p><br/><p>\u2018Taste it,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll cook something else for you to eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che ate a spoonful of congee, the servants\u2019 mouths gaped open. Hao Yan Che wasn\u2019t angry at Yuan Gun Gun, he ate the congee.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it delicious?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently ate the congee gracefully.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stomach rumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you hungry?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head. She skipped breakfast and lunch. She anticipated Hao Yan Che would ask her to sit and eat with him like in fairy tales.</p><br/><p>\u2018Continue being hungry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and ate another dish.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stood watching Hao Yan Che eat. Na Liu Ting Du was right, reading fairy tales would give her false expectations.</p><br/><p>The servants pitied Yuan Gun Gun. Since Yuan Gun Gun arrived at the Hao Mansion, Hao Yan Che talked more. Hao Yan Che only talked to Yuan Gun Gun, but only to say cruel things to her. They pitied Yuan Gun Gun being treated special by Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought it was a beautiful day. He even liked looking at the sky he usually hated.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Yuan Gun Gun stood like a sleepy mummy in the study room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered Jia Tu and Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Jia Tu and Yi Tu said and left the room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che poked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sleepy face. He was impressed she could sleep standing.</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare sleep?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m really sleepy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled Yuan Gun Gun down to sleep on his lap. He looked closely at her face. He stroked her soft cheeks. She snored out of her small straight nose. Her eyes were big and she pouted her lips in her sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When Yuan Gun Gun woke up, she scratched her head. She didn\u2019t know how she ended up sleeping on the big pink bed in her bedroom. She looked at the pig clock on the bedside table, it was eight in the morning.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun jumped out of bed, ran to the bathroom to wash and dress. She was starving, but she had to wake up Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>At eight-thirty in the morning, Yuan Gun Gun walked into Hao Yan Che\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, wake up!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled at Hao Yan Che, and she followed him to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, what do you want to eat and drink for breakfast?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your choice,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to eat fried mung bean donuts, a vegetarian dish or bacon for breakfast?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018One portion of each dish,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to drink soy bean milk? It\u2019s good for your skin. But you have smooth skin already. Drinking coffee isn\u2019t good for you. What about drinking hot chocolate?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che quietly brushed his teeth in front of the sink.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around and looked coldly at Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re in the middle of brushing your teeth. It\u2019s not good to speak and spit toothpaste everywhere.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laughed awkwardly, and went to make Hao Yan Che\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che walked out of the bathroom, Yuan Gun Gun was waiting for him at the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about drinking milk tea?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Water,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and walked outside his bedroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun followed Hao Yan Che to the dining room.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Hao Yan Che worked in the study room. When he had a headache, Jia Tu gave Hao Yan Che two pills. Yuan Gun Gun grabbed the pills from Hao Yan Che\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you have a headache?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ignored Yuan Gun Gun, he took out another two pills from a drawer. Yuan Gun Gun grabbed the pills from his hand again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, do you want to die?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Give me the pills,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it\u2019s not good to take painkillers,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let me help you use natural ways to ease your headache.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I said give me the pills,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared, but she held her hands behind her back.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck. She gasped for air and tears flowed out of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Jia Tu and Yi Tu called.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu and Yi Tu didn\u2019t dare touch Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>A couple of seconds later, Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the floor and coughed. After she breathed steadily again, she wiped tears off her face and stood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Painkillers are bad for the body in the long term,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let me help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered Jia Tu and Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu and Yi Tu left. Yuan Gun Gun held Hao Yan Che\u2019s arm and took him to the spa room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid on the massage table. Yuan Gun Gun oiled her hands, and massaged his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I don\u2019t know what is giving you stress,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But if you don\u2019t think about it, you won\u2019t get headaches.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che relaxed. It was the first time someone massaged him in his life. Since he was a child his body\u2019s natural defence mechanism wouldn\u2019t let anyone touch him without them being flung away from his body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you want to play a game of riddles with me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kept his eyes closed and Yuan Gun Gun continued to massage his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do Chinese men eat more rice than Japanese men?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because there are more Chinese men than Japanese men in the world,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, why are you so smart?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you a dummy?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pouted her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you want me to tell you a funny story?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kept silent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Listen carefully,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s a tragic comedy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened his eyes, he was curious to hear Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s story.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long, long ago there was a scary monster,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said in a serious tone of voice. \u2018No one could slay the scary monster. But the scary monster had one weakness, its one weakness killed it. One day long, long ago the scary monster released its deadly fart and died.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laughed at her own funny story.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a funny story?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Only a dummy would think of a dummy story,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t make Hao Yan Che laugh. At home her family loved to hear her tell funny stories and they laughed with her.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Twenty-Seven to Twenty-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

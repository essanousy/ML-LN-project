She thought he dyed his hair, but there was no sign of dye in his hair roots. Like his violet eyes, he didn\u2019t wear contacts and sometimes she could see specks of amber in his violet eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t answer Yuan Gun Gun. She walked to a cupboard, took out two bedsheets and two pillows. She covered his body from the neck down and propped a pillow behind his head. Then she slept on the chair next to him.</p><br/><p>Several days past. Since the day Yuan Gun Gun massaged Hao Yan Che\u2019s head. He didn\u2019t cause her trouble anymore. Except she hated the nickname he gave her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t call me Little Chub,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018At home my family call me Little Rabbit.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Massage my back,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pouted her lips, and massaged Hao Yan Che\u2019s back. He secretly looked at her reflection in the mirror. Looking at her adorable face put him in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, there is a young man named Na Liu Ting Du waiting outside,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018He wants to see Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun immediately let go of Hao Yan Che\u2019s shoulders. She ran to Mrs Chen and kissed Mrs Chen\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran toward the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around, and looked confusedly at Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I give you permission to leave?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know why he suddenly felt angry.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes stung. She didn\u2019t walk toward Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che slammed the reports on the desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body trembled, and she slowly walked to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mrs Chen, tell Mr Na that he can\u2019t see my maid and escort him to his car,\u2019 Hao Yan Che instructed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled Hao Yan Che\u2019s shirt sleeve and looked at him pitifully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I really miss big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let me see big brother Du for a little while.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yuan Chen said. He turned around and looked at Mrs Chen. \u2018Mrs Chen, why aren\u2019t you leaving?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen was sad to see Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s teary eyes. Mrs Chen turned around and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mrs Chen\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the floor and cried. She missed her family. Why wouldn\u2019t Hao Yan Che at least let her see Na Liu Ting Du?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled Yuan Gun Gun up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t forget your status,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019re my maid. You have to obey to my orders. If you don\u2019t have my permission then you can\u2019t take a step away from me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried and didn\u2019t answer Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you understand?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hate you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tears fell onto Hao Yan Che\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hate you too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun, and looked at the reports on the desk.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked toward the door. She wanted to be sad in her bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you dare take another step?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stood still.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here and massage my back,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked back to Hao Yan Che. She cried and pounded his back.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu and Yi Tu thought Hao Yan Che was being unreasonable. Yuan Gun Gun was only an eighteen-year-old who missed her family after being away from her family for a long time.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put down the reports on the desk and turned around to face Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is your skin itchy?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Is that why you want to hit another person\u2019s back?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, take her to her room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Don\u2019t let her go outside.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu led Yuan Gun Gun to her bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, listen to young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Don\u2019t provoke him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to see big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t mention that again in front of young master,\u2019 Yi Tu advised.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand why the last several days she and Hao Yan Che were getting along, but he wouldn\u2019t let her see Nan Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He suppressed his anger, and acted like he didn\u2019t hear his wife say to him to sleep with another woman.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let Hao Yan Che have his way with her body. In her heart she was frustrated about being too scared to say everything she bottled up to him. She remembered what happened at work, and what he said to her. Her heart hurt, and she didn\u2019t know what else she could do except cry.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid still on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body. He was unhappy to see her cry and look so sad.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che rolled off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body. She moved to the edge of the bed, and turned her back toward him. He got out of bed, walked to the door, kicked the door open and left their bedroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged a pillow and sobbed. She didn\u2019t want Hao Yan Che to be angry, and she didn\u2019t want to fight with him. His words cut her. Why were two boxes more important to him than her? It hurt her to think he was sleeping with other women while married to her. It hurt her the most to hear he didn\u2019t love her.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Yuan Gun Gun woke up alone. Did Hao Yan Che spent the night with another woman? She shook her head, got out of bed and walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>In the living room, Hao Yan Ming sat on the sofa next to Su An Luo who wore a red dress.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming looked like Hao Yan Che, except they had different color eyes. Hao Yan Ming\u2019s eyes were silver.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Su An Luo said. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be like this in someone else\u2019s living room.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hey,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018You can only call me husband or Ming.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming pushed Su An Luo onto the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be such a monster,\u2019 Su An Luo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little girl, how can you call your husband a monster?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked. \u2018You need to be disciplined.\u2019</p><br/><p>Su An Luo closed her mouth. Her man\u2019s mood swings were unpredictable. She didn\u2019t want to provoke his anger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let your husband hear you call him husband,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Su An Luo rolled her eyes.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018What a naughty girl,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018But I love you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming kissed Su An Luo\u2019s lips. He always wanted her to be bound to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Ming, not here,\u2019 Su An Luo said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming\u2019s lips swallowed Su An Luo\u2019s protests. He stroked her soft body under her red dress to numb her thoughts.</p><br/><p>In that moment Yuan Gun Gun stood frozen near the living room. Her husband was kissing another woman on the sofa. She was an outsider looking at her husband loving another woman. The pain she felt witnessing her husband\u2019s betrayal was a thousand times more painful than picturing him with another woman.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re awake,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, why are you crying?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head, and ran away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, where are you going?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen didn\u2019t know why Yuan Gun Gun ran away. Mrs Chen walked into the living room. Su An Luo was gasping for air, and Hao Yan Ming looked like a satisfied man. Mrs Chen understood Yuan Gun Gun must have mistaken Hao Yan Ming for Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master Ming, the guest bedroom is ready,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Do you want to go rest or have afternoon tea? Young master hired a French chef who makes delicious desserts.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che hired a French chef to make desserts?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked. \u2018If I remember correctly, he hates eating sweets.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master Ming remembered correctly,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Young master hired the French chef to make desserts for Gun Gun who loves eating sweets.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked. \u2018Then is the woman who ran away crying before is my monster big brother\u2019s little treasure?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you know who the real monster is?\u2019 Su An Luo mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think your husband is a monster?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Su An Luo said. \u2018A perverted monster.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming carried Su An Luo in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you think your husband is a perverted monster then I don\u2019t want to disappoint you,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Ming, put me down,\u2019 Su An Luo said. \u2018I don\u2019t want to go back home with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 146</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She didn\u2019t have a big brother to rely on anymore. Na Liu Ting Du was the one person in her life who used to love her and took care of her since she was five. But she couldn\u2019t rely on him anymore.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Hao Yan Che returned to the bedroom. Yuan Gun Gun was crying in her sleep. He sat on the bed next to her, and patted her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun murmured on a pillow. Hao Yan Che helped her sit up on the bed. She opened her eyes and looked at him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up a warm bowl of herbal broth, and began feeding the broth to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tastes bad,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put another spoon of broth into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to eat,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Eat,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>A while later, the bowl of herbal broth was empty.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took the empty bowl outside, and Yuan Gun Gun slept.</p><br/><p>At eleven at night, Yuan Gun Gun woke up naked in Hao Yan Che\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun screamed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet unless you want me to drown you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s neck.

He carried Yuan Gun Gun out of the herbal water, helped rinse and dry her body and carried her to the bed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che went back to the bathroom to rinse the herbal water dung smell off his body. After he returned to the bed, Yuan Gun Gun rolled the bedsheet around her body like an Eskimo.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 109</p><br/>\n</div>"}

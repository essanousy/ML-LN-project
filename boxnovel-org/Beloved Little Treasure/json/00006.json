For you it doesn\u2019t matter who you marry, you can still live with any woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du cried on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u2018For years I did everything to please you,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018But if we weren\u2019t sleeping together, you would be cold toward me. You didn\u2019t love me. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong by leaving you. When I found out I was pregnant. I didn\u2019t want the baby to find out their parents had contract marriage. I told Gun Gun that her dad was missing. At least in Gun Gun\u2019s heart, her dad loved her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How can you say you didn\u2019t do anything wrong?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked. \u2018You secretly took our daughter away and left me. You said you loved me for five years. But you don\u2019t understand me. If you did understand me then you wouldn\u2019t have left. You would have known I care about you, and I like being with you. Yes, I\u2019m a cold person. But it doesn\u2019t mean I hate you, and don\u2019t need you and our daughter. You\u2019re my wife. If you think our relationship is only a contract marriage then don\u2019t think about seeing Gun Gun again.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu wiped Feng Du Du\u2019s tears. He wouldn\u2019t have said such embarrassing words if he wasn\u2019t talking to Feng Du Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying you like you?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t hate you,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du looked away from Yuan Ting Liu.</p><br/><p>\u2018I love you,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu whispered.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du looked at Yuan Ting Liu. She thought she heard him say he loved her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu blushed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if what I said was true, for now you can\u2019t see Gun Gun,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018It\u2019s your punishment for leaving me. I\u2019ll let you see Gun Gun after you reflected about what you did wrong. You\u2019re not allowed to leave me again.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du hugged Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s neck, and she cried on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu, I won\u2019t leave you again,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu was happy to hear Feng Du Du agreed to stay with him. He must love her if he wanted to change to make her happy.</p><br/><p>\u2018When can I see Gun Gun?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked. \u2018I admit it was wrong of me to leave you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you be good, I\u2019ll let you see Gun Gun in a few days,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Promise?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then you can\u2019t bring your women here\u2026 no, you can\u2019t see your women outside either,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018If you do, I\u2019ll take Gun Gun and we\u2019ll run away where you can\u2019t find us.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re the only woman in my life,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018That day\u2026\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018That day I was angry and I brought a woman here to make you jealous,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything with that woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That day I put laxatives in the tea for you and her to drink,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu was happy Feng Du Du didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Don\u2019t be angry.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not angry,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu hugged Feng Du Du.

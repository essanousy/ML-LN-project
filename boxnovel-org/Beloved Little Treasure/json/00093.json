He patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back. \u2018I\u2019ll wake you up when the dishes are cooked.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head, and drifted off to sleep.</p><br/><p>After the dishes were cooked, Hao Yan Che woke up Yuan Gun Gun and he fed her the dishes she wanted to eat.</p><br/><p>For a week, Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body drifted in and out of consciousness. Hao Yan Che stayed by her side, and fed her during the times she was awake.</p><br/><p>It took Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body a week to recover after receiving Hao Yan Che\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you giving me that look?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat up on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you call me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You and aunty Li can turn into snow white werewolves,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Are you and aunty Li humans or demons?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s curious eyes. She behaved differently to other people. She was curious about his roots instead of being scared of him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun straddled Hao Yan Che\u2019s thighs, and used a towel to dry his wet hair as an incentive for him to answer her question.</p><br/><p>If Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know Yuan Gun Gun had an innocent mind, he would have thought she was seducing him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun focused on drying Hao Yan Che\u2019s hair that she didn\u2019t realise she dangled her breasts in front of Hao Yan Che\u2019s mouth. But Hao Yan Che noticed. His mouth opened on its own and bit one breast.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pushed Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest, and she fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che jumped out of bed to help Yuan Gun Gun up.

But Hao Yan Che caught her, and slung her body over his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Put me down,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che dropped Yuan Gun Gun on the bed.

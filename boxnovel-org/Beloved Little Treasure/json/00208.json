She covered his eyes, and he gently bit her wrist.</p><br/><p>\u2018You played dirty by changing into a big dog,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should compensate me for taking advantage of me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands, rubbed his face on her palms and kissed her neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re hateful,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s call a truce,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the future you\u2019re not allowed to say hurtful things to me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not allowed?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Since when are you allowed to make rules?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t want to have a truce then forget it,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I promise,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to hit Hao Hao anymore,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t test my limits,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026 then you\u2019re not allowed to hit Hao Hao\u2019s face or use force to hit him if he misbehaves,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I promise,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you feeling smug?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is I do love big brother Du but only as a big brother,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s not the same as how I feel about you. So don\u2019t accuse me of things I didn\u2019t do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che regretted the hurtful things he said to Yuan Gun Gun. She slept in the same bed with Na Liu Ting Du for two years, but he knew nothing happened between them. It was him who she gave her body and heart to. He should let go of the past, and make a fresh start with her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to see Hao Hao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s late,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Our son is sleeping right now.

An image of his and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s daughter popped in his head, \u2018Daddy, I want candy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che smiled. He wanted an adorable daughter who looked exactly like Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Several days past. Since Hao Yan Che found out Yuan Gun Gun was pregnant, every day he fed her nutritious meals, he took her for walks to capture planes and their son was like a small bodyguard protecting her.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, do you want a little brother or a little sister?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018A little sister,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was surprised Na Liu Hao agreed with his daddy.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong with having a little brother?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, are you scared your little brother would be stinky like you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018So you want an adorable little sister to bully?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I don\u2019t want my little brother to be stinky like old man,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up his son, and pinched his son\u2019s chubby cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little stinky boy, do you think you look like daddy?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s small hands pinched Hao Yan Che\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s daddy who looks like me,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled at the identical father and son pinching each other\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard a plane. She turned around and ran to capture her thousandth plane. Suddenly a Mercedes-Benz zoomed past her, and memories flashed through her mind.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che leapt with his son in one arm to pull Yuan Gun Gun away from the Mercedes-Benz.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you so careless?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked blankly at Hao Yan Che. He hugged her with his free arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know how scared you made me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was lost in deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be scared,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019m taking you and our son home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand, and carried their son to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>A while later Hao Yan Che took his son and Yuan Gun Gun to the master bedroom. He let his son lie on the bed. His son was still scared about the Mercedes-Benz nearly hitting Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid next to Yuan Gun Gun and caressed her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun burst into tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you crying?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nose. \u2018No one is cursing you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao squeezed in between his parents\u2019 bodies, and hugged his crying mummy too.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugly mummy,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laughed and cried at the same time.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held his son and his wife in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s time for an afternoon nap,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao looked at his parents hugging him.

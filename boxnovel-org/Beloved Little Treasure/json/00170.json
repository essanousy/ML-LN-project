She clenched her hands and cried. She turned her head to the side so Na Liu Ting Du wouldn\u2019t see her tears.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du left kiss marks on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt Na Liu Ting Du pull down her underwear for the first time, and more tears flowed down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips, and tasted her salty tears. He turned on the light, and she covered her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du pulled Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands away from her face, and wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know a husband and wife sleeping together is normal,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But I lost my memory. I\u2019m scared.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to explain,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I understand. You can relax.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du adjusted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s clothes and hugged her.</p><br/><p>A faint memory flashed past Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mind. She was sad she couldn\u2019t hold onto that faint memory long enough to remember something about her past.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s my fault,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have pressured you when you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019m sorry for scaring you. Don\u2019t cry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m just scared,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, I don\u2019t want you to force yourself to do anything you don\u2019t want to when you\u2019re with me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Do you understand I love you, and I\u2019m willing to wait for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun avoided looking at Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s eyes. She felt guilty she couldn\u2019t make herself want to sleep with him.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, I love you,\u2019 Na Liu Ling Yan said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I love big brother Du too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du laughed at himself. He knew the way he and Yuan Gun Gun loved each other was different. She always loved him like a big brother. She lost her memory, but her subconscious didn\u2019t forget Hao Yan Che and told her to protect her innocence.</p><br/><p>At the Hao Mansion, Hao Yan Che stared at the bathroom ceiling. Etched on the ceiling corner was the word DOVE. Yuan Gun Gun wrote DOVE under his shirt collars, on towels, on the corners of ceilings, he lost count of how many items she wrote DOVE on. For a year he thought about what Yuan Gun Gun wanted to tell him. Did Yuan Gun Gun wanted to tell him that she wanted to fly free like a dove? Or did she graffiti when she was upset with him every time he didn\u2019t let her eat dessert like dove chocolate?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got out of the bathtub, dried himself and dressed. What was he doing thinking about Yuan Gun Gun? Yuan Gun Gun left him for a year. Why couldn\u2019t he forget Yuan Gun Gun?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid in bed. He closed his eyes, and told himself to forget Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>At the Long Mansion, Long Liu Bao was packing her belongings into a suitcase.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, I said you\u2019re not allowed to go,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018It took me a long time to find one clue about where Gun Gun disappeared to. I\u2019m going.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How many times have I told you to stay out of Che and Gun Gun\u2019s business?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 170</p><br/>\n</div>"}

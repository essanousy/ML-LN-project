She couldn\u2019t match up to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che calling Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s name made her bones tingle.

She wondered if it was lust.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does it still hurt?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened her eyes. She saw the anticipation in Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes, it made her want to tease him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun lied. \u2018It really hurts.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked suspiciously at the gleam in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where does it hurt?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It hurts everywhere,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said sternly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Everywhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun lied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then endure the pain,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che withdrew and thrusted hard into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wet passage. She gripped his back, and he moved faster in and out of her. Her body was pleasured and tormented from night to dawn.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Yuan Gun Gun laid limp in bed. She couldn\u2019t believe she was alive.</p><br/><p>In contrast Hao Yan Che felt reenergised like he sucked someone\u2019s blood. He happily walked to the dining room.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen saw Hao Yan Che\u2019s smile, and she understood why. The Hao Mansion was cold since the day Yuan Gun Gun left. Mrs Chen was happy the Hao Mansion was finally given a breath of fresh air.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu put a wedding invitation on the dining table.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, the Long brothers want to invite you and Gun Gun to the wedding,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 198</p><br/>\n</div>"}

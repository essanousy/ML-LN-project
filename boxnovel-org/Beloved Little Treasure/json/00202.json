At least when Hao Hao and I lived with his daddy, his daddy didn\u2019t do anything to hurt us. Hao Hao\u2019s daddy is a gentle man unlike Mr Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019m not a gentle man like his daddy. You chose to crawl onto my bed. What does that make you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t expect Hao Yan Che\u2019s words would cut her heart deeply.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao didn\u2019t understand what the old man\u2019s words meant, but he understood it made his mummy sad. He levitated a chair and aimed it at the old man\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che waved a hand and the chair flung against a wall. Then he picked up his son from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018You exist because of me and I can take away your life too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che choked his son\u2019s neck. But his son didn\u2019t beg him to spare his life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Let go of your son!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che heard Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s anxious voice, and he immediately let go of their son\u2019s neck. He looked at their son gasping for air, and regretted using force on their son.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held Na Liu Hao in her arms. She stroked his small face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, don\u2019t be scared,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Mummy will take you back to grandpa Yuan\u2019s home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stood in front of Yuan Gun Gun, and she moved a few steps back.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want Yuan Gun Gun to be scared of him and runaway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where do you think you are?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Do you think you can come here and leave anytime?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, where my son and I go is none of your business,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re not my son\u2019s father?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sounded calm, but her heart panicked. She hugged Na Liu Hao tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It looks like we understand each other.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I wish Hao Hao and I were still living in Paris and never met you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Say it again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che grabbed Na Liu Hao from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s arms again, and he pulled her dress collar.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wish I killed you the first time I met you six years ago,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to believe the cruel man in front of her was the same gentle man she lived with for weeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, you should know what happens if you provoke me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che raised his arm, Na Liu Hao closed his eyes and Yuan Gun Gun hit Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, starting today, you\u2019ll never see Na Liu Ting Du and your son again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried his son, held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand and took them outside the room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yi Tu and Jia Tu called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pushed Yuan Gun Gun toward Yi Tu and Jia Tu like he was throwing away rubbish.</p><br/><p>\u2018Lock her up in the master bedroom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018No one is allowed to open the master bedroom without my permission.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun fought to free her arms from Yi Tu and Jia Tu\u2019s hold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che, you have no right to treat me like this,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You should know under my roof there is nothing I can\u2019t do,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried his son away from Yuan Gun Gun. He wished he was capable of being drunk and forgetting about his son and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s existence. They couldn\u2019t hurt him if they never existed.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu and Yi Tu didn\u2019t know what happened. A moment ago, Hao Yan Che, Yuan Gun Gun and Na Liu Hao were a happy family together. Why did they suddenly turn their backs on each other?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 202</p><br/>\n</div>"}

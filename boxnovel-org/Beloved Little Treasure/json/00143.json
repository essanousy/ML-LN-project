It\u2019s lunch time, eat together with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Sorry big sister Feng,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018If I don\u2019t have lunch with Che, he\u2019ll be angry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 Feng Ting asked. She took out the boxes of sushi from a drawer and showed them to Yuan Gun Gun. \u2018I bought it just then.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hesitated to eat lunch with Feng Ting.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go eat together to the tea room,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I\u2019ll make us hot green tea to eat with the sushi.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the tearoom, two female workers gossiped about Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so good about Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 the brunette woman said. \u2018She doesn\u2019t deserve to be married to our CEO Hao. I pity CEO Hao has to be married to a woman like Yuan Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not only is she ordinary,\u2019 the drag queen woman said. \u2018She\u2019s been married to CEO Hao for three years, and hasn\u2019t even laid a rotten egg. I think CEO Hao has no interest to sleep with her. The only reason he would marry her is that someone forced him to marry her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who knows,\u2019 the brunette said. \u2018She must have drugged him, and he was forced to marry her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What man would love a woman who is ugly and dumb?\u2019 the drag queen asked. \u2018Who knows, by the end of this year we\u2019ll hear news about them divorcing. Besides a handsome and successful man like CEO Hao would have mistresses. So it wouldn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s married or divorced. To him, a marriage or a divorce certificate is a piece of decoration.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey you gossipmongers, don\u2019t you two have work to do?\u2019 Feng Ting asked. \u2018Why are you two so free to gossip about other people? What can\u2019t lay a rotten egg? Can you two lay a fried egg? We\u2019re all women. There is no need to talk trash about each other.\u2019</p><br/><p>The brunette and the drag queen stopped laughing the moment they saw Yuan Gun Gun. They were jealous of Yuan Gun Gun, but they didn\u2019t want to lose their jobs. They quickly left the tea room.</p><br/><p>Only an angry Feng Ting and a quiet Yuan Gun Gun were left in the tea room.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting put the sushi on the table, poured two cups of green tea and consoled Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t take their words to heart,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018Most people are ruled by jealousy. Because they see other people have what they want, they trash talk about people out of jealousy to make themselves look good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head and forced a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018What they said was true. Che and I\u2026 the distance between us is the same distance as the sky and the ground. Sometimes standing next to him, I feel that I\u2019m not worthy to be with him. Che married me to take responsibility. But I didn\u2019t drug him or use any other scheme to force him to marry me.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you don\u2019t need to explain,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I understand. I believe CEO Hao would scheme to get you to marry him. But I don\u2019t believe you would ever scheme to get him to marry you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Ting patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s eat,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018If CEO Hao chose you then it shows how important you are in his heart. Don\u2019t underestimate yourself, you have more good traits than you think.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Ting put an Aburi Salmon Nigiri on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Feng, do you think one day Che won\u2019t need me anymore?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, no one can predict a person\u2019s heart in the future,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018Love comes and go in a blink of an eye. Underneath CEO Hao\u2019s status, he is just like other ordinary man. Whether a man is gentle and caring or not, a person\u2019s heart is still the fastest thing that can change in the world. So you shouldn\u2019t be stubborn. If that day comes, you should let go. If you hold on, you\u2019ll only be hurting yourself.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Feng, are you saying one day Che will have a change of heart?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018And I should listen to him and let him go?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No little dummy,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I meant no one can predict what will happen in the future. You only need to worry about appreciating every second and minute of the day. It doesn\u2019t matter what will happen in the future. You only need to go with the flow. Don\u2019t worry about what you can\u2019t control, and don\u2019t put pressure on yourself. Understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is there something I can do so Che won\u2019t ever leave me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018If such a way existed then there wouldn\u2019t be so many people in the world who kill themselves over love,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018Holding someone\u2019s hand for a whole lifetime is something precious. Not everyone is that blessed. But I believe you\u2019re that blessed so you don\u2019t need to worry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because the heavens loves dummies,\u2019 Feng Ting said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun frowned. She was unhappy with Feng Ting\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>After lunch, Yuan Gun Gun ran to Hao Yan Che\u2019s office. She couldn\u2019t believe she took half an hour to eat sushi.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened Hao Yan Che\u2019s office. There was no one inside. She sighed in relief, and sat at her desk. She noticed two wrapped boxes on Hao Yan Che\u2019s desk. Did someone sent Hao Yan Che gifts?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was curious, and walked to Hao Yan Che\u2019s desk. It looked like a woman gave him the gifts.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 143</p><br/>\n</div>"}

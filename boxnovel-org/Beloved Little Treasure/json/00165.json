He was both worried and happy to hear Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s news.</p><br/><p>\u2018I just landed in Paris,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m outside the airport.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are you at outside the airport?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026 ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun\u2026\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du called.</p><br/><p>On Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s end, she held onto her bag that a thief wanted to steal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let go of the bag!\u2019 the thief said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You can\u2019t take my bag.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun dug her fingernails into the thief\u2019s hands. The thief cursed, and pushed Yuan Gun Gun onto the road, and a car hit her.</p><br/><p>The airport security guards stopped the thief from running away.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laid on the road. She didn\u2019t register her head was bleeding. The last thing she remembered was that she didn\u2019t want anyone to steal her bag. Inside her bag was a photo she secretly took of Hao Yan Che. She didn\u2019t need to be scared of losing Hao Yan Che, and didn\u2019t need to be sad he didn\u2019t love her if she was dying.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to die. She didn\u2019t get to tell Hao Yan Che that she loved him. She didn\u2019t get to have a baby with Hao Yan Che. She wanted their baby to have his eyes, nose, mouth\u2026 was it too late?</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du was grateful he was in the Luxembourg Garden looking at the Statue of Liberty replica of the original statue in New York instead of being thousands of miles away from Yuan Gun Gun when she was in danger. Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s scream, and the sound of a car braking abruptly made his heart stopped.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du parked at the airport where a crowd surrounded Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body on the road.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du got out of the car, and ran to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, it\u2019s me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Talk to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Sir, we need to take her to the hospital,\u2019 a paramedic said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m her family,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I want to stay with her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 the paramedic said. \u2018You can stay with her in the ambulance.\u2019</p><br/><p>In the ambulance Na Liu Ting Du held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s limp hand. Her head was bleeding.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you better wake up,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du whispered in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear. \u2018You can\u2019t cause trouble and disappear. Gun Gun, I promise nothing will happen to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Later that day at the hospital, Yuan Gun Gun laid on a bed in the ICU.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you have to wake up,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s doctor examined Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body condition.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sir, you need to prepare yourself,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018The patient suffered a serious head injury. There is a high chance that the patient will lose their memory after waking up or suffer permanent brain damage. The patient\u2019s physical condition is stable, and the patient\u2019s baby is healthy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Baby?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Did you know your wife is three weeks pregnant?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can organise a counsellor to help you decide whether you want to prioritise your wife or the baby,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who said I wanted to abort the baby?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sir, don\u2019t misunderstand,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018No one is forcing you to abort the baby.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sir, call a nurse if anything happens to the patient,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018The nurse will call me to come here.\u2019</p><br/><p>The doctor left the ICU to examine another patient.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, did you know inside your stomach is your baby with Hao Yan Che?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du thought Yuan Gun Gun lived a happy life with Hao Yan Che. He didn\u2019t understand why she ran to Paris by herself if she was happy. Did she regret choosing Hao Yan Che over him? Or did she come to Paris to visit him? Why did he still hope she came to Paris to be with him?</p><br/><p>The following morning Hao Yan Che visited Yuan Ting Liu at the Yuan Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you abandon my daughter?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, your daughter abandoned me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did you come find me instead of looking for Gun Gun?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 165</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She regained her memory.</p><br/><p>Days later, Yuan Gun Gun was often in deep thought about the past.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knocked the dining table to get Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been an hour but you barely touched your bowl of food,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put food into her mouth like a calf taking its first step.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t stand Yuan Gun Gun not eating. He held her on his lap, and fed her food.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Are you feeling pain anywhere?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head. She wasn\u2019t used to Hao Yan Che\u2019s gentleness after he found out she was pregnant with their second child.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then why do you look sad the last several days?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can we discuss something?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, if this time we have a daughter, can our daughter take after my maiden surname?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I want our daughter to have a cute name,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t you think Hao Qua Te, Hao Man Cai or Hao Long Quan sound a bit rough for our daughter?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun like she was lost in her own world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you looking at me like this?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Did I say something wrong? I don\u2019t care. I want to change Hao Hao\u2019s name to Hao Yan Hao, and our daughter to have my maiden surname.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sighed. He accepted his wife\u2019s intelligence couldn\u2019t grow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Our daughter will have your maiden surname. What do you want to name our daughter?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Qiu Qiu,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pitied his adorable daughter.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a good name for our daughter?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s a beautiful name for our daughter,\u2019 Hao Yan Che lied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che lied again.</p><br/><p>\u2018What if we have twin daughters?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then we\u2019ll think of another name,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I think Yuan Dao Dao is a cute name for our second daughter,\u2019 Yaun Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes it\u2019s a cute name,\u2019 Hao Yan Che lied again.</p><br/><p>\u2018What if we have triplets?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ll think of another name for our youngest daughter,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled sweetly at Hao Yan Che. Should she tell him she regained her memories that night?</p><br/><p>At ten at night, Yuan Gun Gun laid on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest and watched an animation movie with him while eating nutritious snacks.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s time for bed,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He put Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s snacks on the bedside table. \u2018Go brush your teeth.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you brushing your teeth?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun licked her fingers. Hao Yan Che grabbed a tissue and wiped her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I brushed my teeth earlier,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018And don\u2019t lick your fingers.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to move or brush my teeth,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get up and brush your teeth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che helped Yuan Gun Gun out of bed, he followed her to the bathroom and helped her brushed her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Husband, hug me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun outside the bathroom, he laid next to her in bed and hugged her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, do you want me to tell you a tragic old folk story?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018In 1919 Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg married Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Their chef Leon became a busier chef. He met a little girl named Tao who asked him for dessert. Every day he gave her dessert, and taught her how to speak English. The little girl\u2019s identity was Princess Tao. After Prince Tao grew up, she and Leon became secret lovers. But he didn\u2019t get to see her often like he used to when she was a little girl. A few days before her wedding, Leon made her a creamy chocolate dessert, he wrote DOVE in a letter and concealed it inside the creamy chocolate desert. DOVE is a code for, \u2018Do you love me?\u2019 Leon hoped she reciprocated his love. A few days later Princess Tao was forced to enter a political marriage.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t expect Yuan Gun Gun would actually tell him a tragic story. The last tragic story she told him, a beast died from its deadly fart.</p><br/><p>\u2018One year later, a depressed Leon left the palace and worked in a small patisserie,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018The owner of the patisserie thought Leon was a gifted pastry chef, and he gave his daughter to Leon. Leon\u2019s wife gave birth to their son. But Leon couldn\u2019t hide his broken heart from his wife. Leon\u2019s wife loved him, but she didn\u2019t have his heart so she left him in secret. Leon took care of their son. Years later, Leon took his son for a walk. His son chased an ice-cream truck, because he stopped making creamy desserts since the creamy chocolate incident.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently listened to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Leon decided he couldn\u2019t let the past haunt him anymore,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He took his son back to Luxembourg. A chef gave Leon the letter Princess Tao sent him a day after he left the palace. Leon\u2019s son only saw the word DOVE on the letter, and asked him the meaning of DOVE. Years past, Leon finally found Princess Tao. By then she was old and sick. On her deathbed she confessed back then she loved Leon. That year she was locked in her room for a month because she refused to marry her husband. She hoped Leon would ask her to elope with him. But Leon never told her that he loved her. She ate half of his creamy chocolate dessert, but she didn\u2019t find the letter. She froze the dessert. A year later, she let it melt and found the letter. By then it was too late, because Leon had left the palace. Three days later, Princess Tao died in Leon\u2019s arms. Leon created a new creamy chocolate dessert recipe with the word DOVE written on every dessert to represent his and Princess Tao\u2019s love. Leon hoped lovers who eat his dessert would think about his and Princess Tao\u2019s tragic love story, and never let go of their true love.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped tears off her face. She took out a chocolate from her shirt pocket, and gave it to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you love me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che calmly accepted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chocolate, but his heart was deeply moved.</p><br/><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled like a fool. Hao Yan Che\u2019s shaky arms hugged her tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you such a dummy?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wanted to ask you this question a long time ago but I was too scared to ask you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I was scared you would say no. You\u2019re a brilliant person, and I\u2019m an ordinary person. The distance between as is the same as the sky and the ground. Everyone around me said that you only married me to take responsibility. They said you\u2019re a beautiful rose, and I\u2019m cow dung. I would hear them gossip about me every day. I was hurting, but I couldn\u2019t deny what they said was true. Che, you live somewhere I can\u2019t reach you. I was tired of being scared of loving you. I was scared one day you would regret marrying someone like me. I\u2019m not smart, I can\u2019t help your career and I\u2019m not beautiful. But I truly love you to the point it hurts.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 209</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One moment Yuan Gun Gun was dying of a broken heart, and the next moment Yuan Gun Gun wanted to satisfy her hunger to live.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come with me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I\u2019ll ask aunty Li to make you something to eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you Bao Bao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao couldn\u2019t believe the happy Yuan Gun Gun following her to eat was the same heartbroken Yuan Gun Gun crying on the sofa.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers returned to the Long Mansion. They saw two little monkeys chit chatting and tearing their husbands\u2019 bad traits apart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you don\u2019t know the half of it,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I can\u2019t reason with big brother Bo. Don\u2019t be fooled by big brother Lang\u2019s mask. Big brother Lang has two faces. Look at my neck. Big brother Lang almost choked me to death.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was appalled by the bruises on Long Liu Bao\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can they do that to you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You\u2019re more fortunate than me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re more fortunate than me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Have you seen my bruised bottom? Che pinches my bottom every day. Look at my neck. Che does it with me every day. Even if I feel dizzy, he won\u2019t spare me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun showed the kiss marks on her neck, shoulders and collar bone.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers didn\u2019t understand why Hao Yan Che would let his little treasure come alone to the Long Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, we\u2019re home,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you two home early today?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you have a lot of grievances about us,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about it?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018If you two mistreat me, aren\u2019t I allowed to voice my grievances? You men are the same. There is no such thing as a good man.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was in awe of Long Liu Bao\u2019s bravery.</p><br/><p>\u2018You!\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang patted Long Liu Bo\u2019s shoulder.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, we brought two desserts home,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018You can share the desserts with Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao stood, and kissed Long Liu Lang\u2019s cheek. She sat back down and ate the desserts with Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo told himself not to be petty and angry. He sat on a chair, pulled Long Liu Bao onto his lap and licked the cream off her lips.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo smiled at the blushing Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, why did Che let you come here today?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che is busy sleeping with a beautiful woman,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He doesn\u2019t care about me. Besides, I ran away from home so I don\u2019t need to let him know where I am.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked. \u2018Che is sleeping with another woman?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You ran away from home?\u2019 Long Liu Lang asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun wants to stay here,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Tonight I\u2019m sleeping with Gun Gun. You two are not allowed to tell Che. If you two tell Che then suffer the consequences.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, Gun Gun can stay here,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018But it\u2019s the right thing to do to tell Che that Gun Gun is here so he doesn\u2019t worry crazily about Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018If Che\u2019s wife is missing even for one day, he\u2019ll go crazy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che is busy sleeping with a beautiful woman,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He won\u2019t notice I\u2019m not home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You two are not allowed to tell Che,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I won\u2019t pay attention to you two if Che knows Gun Gun is here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao put a piece of dessert in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth to stop Yuan Gun Gun from crying. Then Long Liu Bao gave the Long brothers a warning look. If the Long brothers dared to make Yuan Gun Gun cry, Long Liu Bao would kill them.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers exchanged a knowing look with each other. They knew Hao Yan Che would go crazy if his wife was missing. They didn\u2019t want Yuan Gun Gun to suffer after Hao Yan Che discovered she was ran away from home.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018We won\u2019t pay attention to bad men. Let\u2019s go to our room and eat.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Long brothers watched Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun walk upstairs, and they anticipated trouble would arrive to the Long Mansion soon.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 148</p><br/>\n</div>"}

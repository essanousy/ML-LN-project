They would have peeled off your fingernails, scratch your lips off, cut off your ears, pour hot coal on your head, they would starve you and not let you have a bath.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held his wife\u2019s whitened face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you dare not listen to me again?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried out of fear of what would have happened if she was kidnapped.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che flipped Yuan Gun Gun under him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t think because your family and everyone around you here love you that everyone else in the world will love you too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018There are bad people in the world, and scary demons who lurk in the shadows. Do you think they would spare you if you cry in front of them?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you want to be safe then stay by my side,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you don\u2019t listen to me, I won\u2019t need you anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was happy to see Yuan Gun Gun looked sad after he threatened he wouldn\u2019t need her anymore. He kissed her lips. He didn\u2019t care if she truly loved him or not, as long as she didn\u2019t want to leave him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun kissed Hao Yan Che back. He released her lips, and nibbled her lips while she breathed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want a baby?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know why his childish wife wanted to have his baby. It wouldn\u2019t matter if their daughter inherited her intelligence. But it would matter if their son inherited her intelligence. He didn\u2019t care, he wanted to have a baby with her.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t cry halfway and say you don\u2019t want to,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face turned red.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you hear me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to do it today?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Yesterday we did it many times.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If yesterday you ate dessert, would you still want to eat dessert today?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do we do it every day but there\u2019s no baby?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It means we\u2019re not doing it often enough,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um\u2026 don\u2019t leave marks,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018People will see.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you always noisy in bed?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took off his and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s clothes.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018After what happened today, you should cooperate with me if you don\u2019t want me to stay angry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you cry halfway, I won\u2019t let you sleep tonight.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, wait\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>That night Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t let Yuan Gun Gun sleep.</p><br/><p>The following afternoon, Jia Tu captured Qiang Jia Tao and her two minions and brought her to see Hao Yan Che in a secret location.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao asked. \u2018What do you want?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jia Tu took off Qiang Jia Tao\u2019s blindfold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Qiang Jia Tao, I gave you a chance but you didn\u2019t cherish it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I can\u2019t have you, she can\u2019t have you,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said. \u2018I want her to die suffering. Yesterday she was lucky she escaped. I had prepared ten men to rape her, a knife to cut her face and let her take a bath in boiling water. What a waste she didn\u2019t come.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll return the favor. Jia Tu, go find ten men to play with her. Don\u2019t forget to bring back the sharpest knife and prepare a tub of boiling water. Use the knife to help her exfoliate her face and her scalp. Let her soak in boiling water. Afterward you can take her back to Daniel\u2019s place. Tell Daniel I don\u2019t care what he does. But he\u2019ll suffer painfully for daring to hurt my wife. If there is a next time, he\u2019ll pay with his life.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018As for the two men, chop off their arms and legs,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Put their arms and legs through the mincer and make them eat their minced arms and legs. Then return them to Daniel alive.\u2019</p><br/><p>The two minions\u2019 bodies shook with tribulation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018After you\u2019re done, remember to take a bath,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I don\u2019t want to smell fresh blood on you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked out of the secret location. His ears didn\u2019t care about the screams of pain. No one was allowed to hurt his little rice ball.</p><br/><p>At the Long Mansion, Long Liu Bao looked out the window at the stormy night and lightning bolts. Whoever was behind Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s failed kidnapping wasn\u2019t going to survive the storm.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao picked up a chocolate and popped it in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth. In the morning, Hao Yan Che dropped off his little treasure at the Long Mansion. Hao Yan Che explained he wanted his little treasure to have a friend so she would be less lonely. Long Liu Bao wouldn\u2019t believe Hao Yan Che\u2019s lie even if the sky fell down. Long Liu Bao knew Hao Yan Che was up to no good, and he wanted Long Liu Bao to babysit his little treasure and ensure his little treasure didn\u2019t run away. Long Liu Bao lived with the Long brothers long enough to recognise a ruthless man like Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 139</p><br/>\n</div>"}

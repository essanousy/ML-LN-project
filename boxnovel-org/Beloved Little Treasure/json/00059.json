He closed his eyes. \u2018I deserve to be punished.\u2019</p><br/><p>Luckily for Yi Tu, Yuan Gun Gun chose that moment to wake up. Hao Yan Che ran to the bed, and stroked her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be noisy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Usually Hao Yan Che would knock Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head, but he resisted. He turned around and glared at Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, you know what you should do,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said coldly. \u2018There won\u2019t be a next time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu pulled Yi Tu up from the floor, and he helped Yi Tu walk outside the room.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuan looked at its mistress lying on the bed then Xiao Yuan looked outside the door. Xiao Yuan debated whether to go or not to go. Hao Yan Che\u2019s glare helped Xiao Yuan\u2019s brain decide, to go was the right answer and Xiao Yuan ran after Jia Tu and Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che closed the door, and he laid in bed face to face with Yuan Gun Gun. She hugged his waist to sleep and he stroked her hair. When he heard her sleeping, he kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>At eleven at night, Yuan Gun Gun woke up again. She felt like someone had beaten up her whole body.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re awake,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought she was dreaming. She poked Hao Yan Che\u2019s hard chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you taking advantage of me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun retrieved her hand, and Hao Yan Che frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, is it you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who did you want to see?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her face. She didn\u2019t want Hao Yan Che to hate seeing her, and she wanted to move away from him. But he held her waist tightly.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Where do you want to go?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun avoided looking at Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you deaf?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Did I do something wrong?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che tucked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair behind her ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I remembered I heard a loud explosion\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um, the gas stove exploded,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun vaguely remembered the fire.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun tighter.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re safe,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s teary eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let me go home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I know your father is forcing you to let me stay in your home. I\u2019ll talk to my daddy, and I\u2019ll ask my daddy to let me learn how to take care of myself at another person\u2019s home. It\u2019s the best solution for everyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around, her back faced Hao Yan Che and she cried softly. He turned her around to face him again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crying is useless,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why won\u2019t you let me go home if you hate me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Does it make you happy to bully me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her face. Hao Yan Che pulled her hands away from her face. He rolled her over, laid on top of her and kissed her lips. He slipped his tongue into her mouth before she decided whether to push him away or hold onto him. He held her hands above her head, and he didn\u2019t let her escape his kiss.</p><br/><p>Later, Hao Yan Che released Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips to let her breathe. He stroked her rosy cheeks, and licked her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, you\u2019re mine,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Fifty-Nine</p><br/>\n</div>"}

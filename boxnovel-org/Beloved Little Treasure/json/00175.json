If big brother Du comes home and doesn\u2019t see me, he\u2019ll be angry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want to out?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go out,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then let\u2019s go,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018We\u2019ll come home early.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao thought making Hao Yan Che suffer another year was enough revenge on behalf of Yuan Gun Gun. Long Liu Bao decided to take Yuan Gun Gun to see Hao Yan Che that day.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du will be angry if he finds out,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t want to go out today then we don\u2019t need to be friends anymore,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled at Long Liu Bao and held her hand.

Then Long Liu Lang looked at the clock on the wall, Long Liu Bao would arrive with a surprise for Hao Yan Che soon.</p><br/><p>Downstairs in the lobby, Yuan Gun Gun was confused why Long Liu Bao took her to a work building.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, where are we?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Why did you take me here?

The Long brothers almost spilt wine on their clothes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you\u2019re not a little girl anymore,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao kissed the Long brothers cheeks. Then she went outside to bring Yuan Gun Gun into Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello big brother Bo, big brother Lang,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of his pen. He thought he heard Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, this is my friend Na Liu Ling Yan,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Isn\u2019t she loveable?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the face he dreamt of every night. Why did Yuan Gun Gun look too skinny? Did Yuan Gun Gun come back to be with him?</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, do you remember who this man is?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know what game Yuan Gun Gun and Long Liu Bao were playing.</p><br/><p>\u2018I remember this man,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t understand why Yuan Gun Gun needed to confirm she knew him.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s CEO Hao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ve seen him on TV. I remembered he has violet eyes like Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018What else do you remember?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I remembered I told big brother Du that CEO Hao looked like Hao Hao and big brother Du got angry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, you remembered enough,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Let\u2019s go to the pet cafe. Big brother Che, you can work in peace now. We\u2019re leaving.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, what\u2019s the matter?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 175</p><br/>\n</div>"}

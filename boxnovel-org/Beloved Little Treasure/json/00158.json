She won\u2019t let anything happen to Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>After an awkward silence, Hao Yan Che opened his mouth again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think she\u2019ll kick the bedsheet at night?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, only you know if Gun Gun kicks the bedsheet at night,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Na Liu Ting Du would know too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to kill Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu didn\u2019t know why the murderous look in Hao Yan Che\u2019s eyes looked adorable in that moment. Yi Tu laughed at himself for thinking the monster Hao had an adorable side.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to kill my wife,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Where did she go to die?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yi Tu didn\u2019t know without Yuan Gun Gun, Hao Yan Che would be depressed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, don\u2019t sleep tonight,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Stay here and gaze at the moon with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes\u2026 young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu\u2019s suspicion was confirmed. Hao Yan Che was depressed, because it was the first time he wanted to gaze at the moon.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You don\u2019t want to?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018It\u2019s my privilege to gaze at the moon with young master.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently looked at the full moon. He didn\u2019t want to return to the bedroom that didn\u2019t have Yuan Gun Gun. He didn\u2019t want to sleep on a bed that didn\u2019t have Yuan Gun Gun. He wanted to stay awake and wait for Yuan Gun Gun to come home. Perhaps Yuan Gun Gun went for a walk, and got lost. He told himself he wanted Yuan Gun Gun home so he could kill her.</p><br/><p>In the sin city Las Vegas, Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun toured the casinos and chapels where people got married under fifteen minutes and divorced under five minutes. It was a city full of temptations like gambling, beautiful hostesses and hosts and alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Las Vegas was a beautiful city, but the strangers\u2019 stares on the streets made her scared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t be scared,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018They\u2019re looking at you because you\u2019re attractive. If anyone dares to touch you, I\u2019ll kick them home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, where are we going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018If we don\u2019t go to the best casino, it\u2019ll be a waste of a trip here,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do we have to gamble?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, sometimes I wonder what you use to think and speak,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Do you use your lungs or bottom? Do you think casinos are built to hire people to count money?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, if Che finds out I gambled, he will kill me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you don\u2019t have to worry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Your husband\u2019s heart will break if he kills you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yan Gun Gun anxiously followed Long Liu Bao into the best casino.</p><br/><p>Inside the casino Yuan Gun Gun linked arms with Long Liu Bao, and she looked at all the different kinds of people around them.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao felt like she was in heaven. Long Liu Bao led Yuan Gun Gun to a crowded table to test their luck.</p><br/><p>A couple of minutes later, Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun had a taste of their first win.</p><br/><p>\u2018Twenty, pair,\u2019 the dealer said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, we won,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>The exotic looking Long Liu Bao and the innocent looking Yuan Gun Gun attracted a bigger crowd.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fifteen, odd,\u2019 the dealer said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, we won again,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Do you think I have a knack for gambling?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head. Yuan Gun Gun relaxed after seeing how happy Long Liu Bao looked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao was having a blast winning with Yuan Gun Gun until a thief spoiled their good mood.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao twisted the thief\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018F\u2019k,\u2019 the thief cursed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to steal my money?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018F\u2019k you bitch,\u2019 the thief said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you say?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018F\u2019k you bitch,\u2019 the thief said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao smiled at the thief, cracked the thief\u2019s arm and a scream came out of the thief\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, let\u2019s leave,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018We didn\u2019t lose anything, and it\u2019s scary here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao wanted the break the thief\u2019s other arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t be scared,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I was helping the thief to wash their mouth with soap. Remember Gun Gun, we don\u2019t harm people who don\u2019t harm us. But if people harm us, we\u2019ll return the favor.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Long Liu Bao\u2019s smile at the thief was scary compared to all the times Long Liu Bao smiled at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Miss, our boss wants to invite you to have a private drink with him,\u2019 a guard said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What if I say I don\u2019t want to?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Our boss only has good intentions,\u2019 the guard said. \u2018Boss has prepared the best tea for Miss. Don\u2019t make things harder for yourself.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, let go of the thief,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao let go of the thief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Next time remember to wash your mouth before you walk out the front door,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>The guard led Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun to a private room. Nan Gong Yuan was waiting inside the private room.</p><br/><p>If Long Liu Bao knew Nan Gong Yuan was a beautiful man, she would have ran to the private room sooner.</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan thought the two little monkeys in front of him were loveable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Miss,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said.</p><br/><p>\u2018My name is Long Liu Bao,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You can call me Bao Bao. Miss doesn\u2019t suit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018My name is Nan Gong Yuan,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018You can call me uncle Gong Yuan.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018I was about to call you little brother.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m forty this year,\u2019 Nan Gong Yan said. \u2018Do you still want to call me little brother?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Forty?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Uncle are you a demon? Why do you have such a youthful face?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re a straight talker,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018Uncle is really forty.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan didn\u2019t know why he felt a close connection to Long Liu Bao. As though he should love Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, can you adopt us orphans?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t know why she felt a close connection to Nan Gong Yuan. As though he would protect her.</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan was surprised Long Liu Bao wanted him to adopt her and Yuan Gun Gun after their first meeting.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, do you know how much loveable orphans like us suffer on the streets?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, do you want to see orphans like us be robbed, raped, tortured and beaten to death on the streets? If our parents in heaven saw us die suffering, their hearts can\u2019t RIP anymore.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018Uncle will adopt you two.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan didn\u2019t know how Long Liu Bao\u2019s parents\u2019 raised such a sweet talker like Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, you only need to feed and shelter us,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You don\u2019t need to give us an allowance.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or faint.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, I\u2019m hungry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, my big sister is hungry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister?\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan asked. \u2018You\u2019re her little sister?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, don\u2019t you know these days how smart kids are?\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan had never seen such a big smart kid until he met Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, you can call me Bao Bao and call my big sister Gun Gun,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao felt like she hit the jackpot. She had a feeling Nan Gong Yuan was going to let her and Yuan Gun Gun live in paradise.</p><br/><p>At the Nan Mansion, Long Liu Bao wondered where she would find a rich, handsome and gentle man like Nan Gong Yuan. Nan Gong Yuan treated his wife like gold.</p><br/><p>In the guest room Long Liu Bao watched over Yuan Gun Gun while she slept.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao regretted taking Yuan Gun Gun to escape with her. The only times Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t miss the monster Hao was during meal times.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao shook her head. Those three monsters needed an incentive to change for the better.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao went for a walk around the Nan Mansion garden then she returned to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, wake up,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Your home is on fire.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, wake up,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Your bottom is on fire.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, wake up,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018It\u2019s meal time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao was in awe of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>After breakfast Nan Gong Yuan took three women out sightseeing and to watch live music concerts. A large group of guards followed them around Las Vegas. Nan Gong Yuan was a rich and famous man, he didn\u2019t want anyone to kidnap the three women under his protection.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you tired?\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan asked Xiao Lu Zhu. He wiped sweat off his wife\u2019s forehead. \u2018We can go home and rest if you\u2019re tired. Tomorrow I\u2019ll take you out again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I still want to play,\u2019 the three women said.</p><br/><p>The guards knew their renowned ruthless boss was famous for doting on his wife. The guards were surprised their boss also doted on Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun like they were his and his wife\u2019s daughters.</p><br/><p>\u2018Piglet, your body health isn\u2019t good,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018We need to go home and rest. I promise I\u2019ll take everyone out again tomorrow.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to play,\u2019 Xiao Lu Zhu said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Lu Zhu didn\u2019t look like a thirty-five-year-old married woman. Strangers would have thought Xiao Lu Zhu and Nan Gong Yuan were young lovers.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao was envious of her closest friends\u2019 adorable names. Feng Du Du, Yuan Gun Gun and Xiao Lu Zhu\u2019s names meant round ball, little chub and piglet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, can you take us to one more place today?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where do you want to go?\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Stratosphere Tower,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan took the three women to the Stratosphere Tower.</p><br/><p>The Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas was famous for its extreme rides, entertainment and dining.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao dreamt of sitting on the ride at the top of the Stratosphere Tower for years.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, I\u2019m not going to give up going on this ride,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I didn\u2019t say give up, I said Che. Look over there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming and Su An Luo went out together to search for Hao Yan Che\u2019s runaway wife. Hao Yan Ming could smell Hao Yan Che and the Long brothers\u2019 scents on Yuan Gun Gun and Long Liu Bao from a far distance. Hao Yan Ming was certain Yuan Gun Gun was Hao Yan Che\u2019s runaway wife, because Hao Yan Che only slept with his wife.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t stop herself from crying. It hurt her to see her husband with another woman.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t believe Hao Yan Che would let another person touch him who wasn\u2019t Yuan Gun Gun. Long Liu Bao looked closely at Hao Yan Che\u2019s lookalike\u2019s eyes. Instead of Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes, the man had silver eyes. Heavens knew how to play a deadly joke, the man was Hao Yan Ming.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming and Su An Luo walked toward Yuan Gun Gun and Long Liu Bao. Hao Yan Ming was surprised to see them with Nan Gong Yuan, a renowned boss in Las Vegas.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, has your health been good?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018What about you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan smiled at Las Vegas\u2019 famous young boss Hao Yan Ming.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018Uncle, are these two women yours and your wife\u2019s daughters?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018These two loveable little girls are my guests.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018They are loveable.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun recognised the beautiful woman was the same woman Hao Yan Che slept with in their living room. Why did Hao Yan Che act like he didn\u2019t know who she was?</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, why are you crying?\u2019 Xiao Lu Zhu asked. \u2018Do you feel sick?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called sadly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, Gun Gun is sick,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018We should take aunty Lu Zhu and Gun Gun home. Let\u2019s go out another day.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao knew the three monsters would drag her and Yuan Gun Gun home within twenty-four hours, because Hao Yan Ming recognised the three monsters\u2019 scents on their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, there\u2019s no rush,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming found the Gun Gun and Bao Bao who he was looking for.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kids these days are always in a rush,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018You two have a goodnight.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan turned around and followed Long Liu Bao who looked like she was kidnapping his wife.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming smiled at Su An Luo.</p><br/><p>\u2018An An, looks like we\u2019ll get to see a good performance soon,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Su An Luo ignored her two faced husband. At home he bullied her, and on the streets he acted like a gentle husband.</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018Is my little trouble maker still angry?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Someone call the cops!\u2019 Su An Luo said. \u2018There is a pervert on the prowl!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Little trouble maker, why are you so aggressive?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aggressive?\u2019 Su An Luo asked. \u2018I\u2019m not aggressive as you. You only know how to hit me. I hate you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s your fault for touching another man,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>\u2018So what if I like touching another man?\u2019 Su An Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you like touching another man, you won\u2019t step a foot out of our home again,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 158</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ll explain everything to uncle Gong Yuan later.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said.</p><br/><p>In the guest bedroom Long Liu Bao patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, the man you saw isn\u2019t Che,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018He is Che\u2019s little brother Hao Yan Ming. Didn\u2019t you notice Ming\u2019s eyes were silver instead of violet?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you don\u2019t need to lie to me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018They look identical.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, look at my twin monsters,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018They are identical except their eye color is different.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Twins?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018But Che never told me he has a twin brother.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The man you saw sleeping with his wife in your living room last time was Hao Yan Ming,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Your monster Hao was angry at you for saying you want to divorce him so he let you misunderstand. Hao Yan Ming lived away from home since he was a little boy. I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you that your monster Hao has a twin brother.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Does that mean I misunderstood Che?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao used a wet towel to wash Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face like she was Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, what do I do now?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I really miss Che. I want to go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Even if you didn\u2019t want to go home, at the latest the monsters will come here tomorrow morning and take us home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao sighed. Yuan Gun Gun must be a masochist if she loved a sadist like Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, your eyes will be puffy if you keep crying,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018What if your monster Hao sees your puffy eyes and don\u2019t want to take you home?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stopped crying, and she hugged Long Liu Bao. Yuan Gun Gun was happy she would see Hao Yan Che in the morning.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back. Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t know if Yuan Gun Gun loved food or Hao Yan Che more.</p><br/><p>At the Hao Mansion, Hao Yan Che received a visit from Hao Yan Ming.</p><br/><p>\u2018My darling big brother, have you been well lately?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming taunted.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you have nothing to say then leave,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held a glass of red wine and sat depressed on a chair. He hadn\u2019t seen Yuan Gun Gun for three days. She was gone for three days. Was she well? Did she drink a glass of milk in each morning? Did she fall into the hands of evil people? Did she kick the bedsheet at night? Did Long Liu Bao corrupt her? Where was his little chub? As long as she returned home, he would forgive and forget everything.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother why are you so cold toward your darling little brother?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked. \u2018I wasted my time coming here to visit you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Ming if you\u2019re smart then you shouldn\u2019t come here to cause trouble at this time,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming leisurely poured a glass of champagne.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother, do you know who I saw today?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who else do your eyes see apart from Su An Luo?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t mention my bad wife,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently drank his glass of red wine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother, stop looking like you lost your soul,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said. \u2018Today I saw a dummy little round ball who has your scent on her body. Next to the little round ball was a beautiful woman with a fire tattoo on her forehead. Big brother, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a small world?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che shot out of the chair, and aimed a punch at Hao Yan Ming\u2019s face. Hao Yan Ming dodged Hao Yan Che\u2019s punch, and he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother, just because you\u2019re not a person, it doesn\u2019t mean you can bully me,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming joked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che glared at his trouble maker little brother who deserved a beating.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think you\u2019re a person?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You knew long ago, why did you wait until now to tell me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I wasn\u2019t certain she was your wife,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming denied. \u2018I was scared big brother would think I was lying to you if she wasn\u2019t your wife, and I would be killed by you. Big brother, I know how unpredictable you can be if someone disappointed you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me where you saw them!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Las Vegas,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che vowed to kill Long Liu Bao for taking his wife to sin city.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother, do you know who they are staying with?\u2019 Hao Yan Ming asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nan Gong Yuan,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>\u2018The famous boss in Las Vegas?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>At the biggest casino in Las Vegas, Long Liu Bao took Yuan Gun Gun out for their last outing as free women.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, why did you take me here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Today is our last day of freedom,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Do you think after tomorrow, you\u2019ll ever get an opportunity to come here again?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like being here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then do you want to go upstairs to find uncle Gong Yuan?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I like being with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Let\u2019s play here a little longer then we\u2019ll go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun watched Long Liu Bao win another card game. Neither of them saw a hidden killer aiming a gun at Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>Gun shots were heard. Everyone in the casino screamed and scattered away from the sounds of the gun shots. Long Liu Bao pulled Yuan Gun Gun below a table. Long Liu Bao shielded Yuan Gun Gun, and took out a gun from under her dress. Another gun shot was heard, and the killer fell from an upper floor. Long Liu Bao regretted she didn\u2019t get to shoot the killer herself. But Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t understand why a foreigner wanted to kill her.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao was at eye level with a tall man\u2019s long legs. She couldn\u2019t see his upper body, but she could see his big muscle between his legs. Was he a potential pet or someone who wore pants?</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Come out,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao thought it was her unlucky day.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao pulled Yuan Gun Gun out from under the table.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me this is just an illusion,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, what illusion?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao prayed to every God from every religion under the sun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, are you sick?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m exorcising a demon,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Demon?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. She hugged Long Liu Bao\u2019s waist. She didn\u2019t want to die. \u2018Where?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let go of Long Liu Bao. Yuan Gun Gun was happy to see Hao Yan Che. Yuan Gun Gun ran to Hao Yan Che. Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t care if Hao Yan Che looked coldly at her, she wanted to hug him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che slapped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao ran to Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s side, and she helped Yuan Gun Gun stand up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hey!\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Why did you hit Gun Gun? She didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She utters your name every moment of the day except when she\u2019s eating. Do you know how much she missed you? Do you have a conscience? How can you hit her the moment you see her?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took no notice of Long Liu Bao. He pulled Yuan Gun Gun away from Long Liu Bao, and he hugged Yuan Gun Gun tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know how much danger you were in before?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You almost died.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know how scared Hao Yan Che was to see a gun aimed at her. He almost changed into a werewolf to save her. Why didn\u2019t she understand that he couldn\u2019t lose her? How could she put herself in danger time after time? Why did she smile at him like nothing happened?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried uncontrollably. She didn\u2019t know what she did wrong to be slapped on the face. Hao Yan Che never slapped her face before that day.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao looked closely at the dead killer. The killer was the thief who she caught last time. She broke the thief\u2019s arm, but the thief wanted to kill her. Suddenly she sensed a different kind of danger. She turned around, and saw the Long brothers. Her life was over.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers looked coldly at Long Liu Bao who ran away to Las Vegas to gamble, and be acquainted with Nan Gong Yuan.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao ran to Nan Gong Yuan, and hid behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, save me,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hiding behind another man sealed her fate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, come here,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Even if someone beats me to death, I don\u2019t want to go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you say you\u2019re not coming here even if someone beats you to death?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming was the only one who dared to laugh out of the guards.</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan smiled at Long Liu Bao\u2019s antics.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed at Long Liu Bao. Then he checked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek for swelling.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao looked away from Long Liu Bo\u2019s intimidating face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Lang and big brother Bo can go home first,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I\u2019ll protect your backs.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The Long Household\u2019s little princess is a rarity,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers glared at the trouble maker Hao Yan Ming. Even Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t resist looking at the man who made her misunderstand her husband betrayed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Gun Gun, you have a loveable face that makes people want to bully you,\u2019 Hao Yan Ming said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist. She was scared Hao Yan Ming would actually bully her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun tighter, and he gave Hao Yan Ming a warning look.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Ming wasn\u2019t scared. He turned his head to look at Long Liu Bao\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, if you don\u2019t let go of uncle\u2019s clothes, uncle\u2019s clothes will be ripped,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018If I rip uncle Gong Yuan\u2019s clothes, I\u2019ll buy you new clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan could only pray to the heavens. The Long brothers looked like they wanted to take turns to kill Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Long Fei Liu and Long Wu Mac walked toward their family, and they frowned at the dead killer who wanted to kill Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where\u2019s mummy\u2019s Bao Bao?\u2019 Long Wu Mac asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao was happy to hear Long Wu Mac\u2019s voice. She let go of Nan Gong Yuan and ran to Long Wu Mac.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy, daddy,\u2019 Long Liu Bao called.</p><br/><p>Long Wu Mac pushed her husband away, and spread her arms to hug Long Liu Bao. But the Long brothers grabbed hold of Long Liu Bao\u2019s dress collar, and stopped Long Liu Bao from escaping.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, it\u2019s time to go home,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, be good and go home,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018When uncle and aunty are free, we\u2019ll come visit you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Nan Gong Yuan felt like he was losing a daughter. But he and his wife couldn\u2019t keep someone else\u2019s daughter by their side.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, don\u2019t you need mummy anymore?\u2019 Long Wu Mac asked.</p><br/><p>Long Wu Mac cried because her little girl didn\u2019t need her anymore. Who else could she watch boy love movies with?</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao took a deep breath. She loved her mummy, and thought a beating was worth to see her mummy smile. Besides, it wasn\u2019t the first time her body would be stretched.</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, you have to promise that you\u2019ll bring aunty Lu Zhu to visit me when you\u2019re free,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018The Long Mansion\u2019s address is\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao whispered something else in Nan Gong Yuan\u2019s ear, and the Long brothers were tempted to hit Nan Gong Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Nan Gong Yuan said. \u2018Go home safely.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Uncle Gong Yuan, thank you for taking care of Bao Bao,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Uncle Gong Yuan and your wife are welcome to visit the Long Mansion anytime.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Long brothers dragged Long Liu Bao all the way home like she was a criminal.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che also took Yuan Gun Gun home where a good talk awaited her.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chaper 159</p><br/>\n</div>"}

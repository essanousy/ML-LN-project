Someone was blowing air into her ears, and thought she heard someone calling her name. She covered her ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked innocently.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stopped herself from running into Hao Yan Che\u2019s arms. She remembered how cruelly he treated her, and reminded herself she was nothing to him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard someone calling her name again, \u2018Yuan Gun Gun, my face hurts. Yuan Gun Gun, give me your face.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt like someone was pulling her face. She looked at Hao Yan Che\u2019s cold face, and wanted to ask him if he heard someone calling her name too.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che could clearly see Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body shaking. He wanted to ask her why she didn\u2019t want to come to him when she was scared.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laid back in bed. She hid under the bedsheet, and pretended she couldn\u2019t hear someone crying.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che lost his patience. He stood, walked to the bed and pulled the bedsheet off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you this stubborn?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was more scared of Hao Yan Che than the crying sounds.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on the bed and held her chin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you hate me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Is that why you don\u2019t want to come to me when you\u2019re this scared?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want to be patient anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you want to be stubborn then I\u2019ll show you how stubborn I can be too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nightshirt, and he cupped her breasts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun dug her fingernails into Hao Yan Che\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018What sort of a man are you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You make me sick! I hate you!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If I\u2019m not a man then who is a man?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Na Liu Ting Du? You\u2019ll never see him again!\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gripped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrists.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026 let me go,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hated she couldn\u2019t win a fight against Hao Yan Che\u2019s physical strength.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re mine!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hated Yuan Gun Gun ignoring him and not talking to him. He missed her smile and her warmth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a bright violet light shone from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s stomach and protected her body.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrists. He was confused why there was a violet light shining from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled the bedsheet over her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018I hate you!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I hate you\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head spun, and she fainted.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun. He was relieved her body was warm. He thought it was too soon for her to have powers, which meant she was pregnant with their second child.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che dressed Yuan Gun Gun, he tucked her in bed and called Yi Tu\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bring a doctor here right now,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hung up the phone, and Yi Tu called a doctor immediately. Yi Tu was worried his plan backfired, and Yuan Gun Gun fainted out of fear.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes later, a female doctor smiled at the anxious Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, it\u2019s good news,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018Your wife is pregnant.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll give you a pamphlet of nutritious meal recipes for you to prepare for your wife,\u2019 the doctor said. \u2018During the first and third trimester don\u2019t let your wife over exert herself. You can sleep with your wife during the second trimester, but you need to be gentle with your wife. Don\u2019t cause your wife any stress. It\u2019s not good for your baby. Apart from that you have nothing to worry about. Your wife and baby are healthy.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 205</p><br/>\n</div>"}

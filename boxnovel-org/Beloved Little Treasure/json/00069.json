She went to the pink bedroom and returned to the master bedroom with a bedcover, a bedsheet and a pillow. He immediately put the work papers on the bedside table. Then he watched her spread the bedcover on the floor near the bed, pulled the bedsheet over her body and laid her head on the pillow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodnight young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was frustrated Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t figure out why he was angry with her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I say you can sleep?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened her eyes, and stood to look at Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you scared I\u2019ll kill you by stepping on you in the middle of the night?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at the distance between the bedsheet and the bed.

Hao Yan Che wasn\u2019t satisfied and he pinched her bottom. She rubbed her face and her bottom while looking pitifully at Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you looking at?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and closed her mouth. Hao Yan Che turned her around, and was angry to see her cry.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is there to cry about?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t wipe her tears fast enough.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re always bullying me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if it\u2019s true, you\u2019re not allowed to cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It hurts when you pinch me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You deserve it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was used to Hao Yan Che\u2019s mood swings.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to mention him again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Na Liu Ting Du,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018All you need to know is you\u2019re not allowed to mention his name,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Did you hear me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head even though she disagreed with Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Sixty-Nine</p><br/>\n</div>"}

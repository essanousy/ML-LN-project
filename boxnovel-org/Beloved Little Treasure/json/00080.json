Was she an animal?</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know what animal you are?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pig,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to be a pig!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun protested.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You can be a dog.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018A pug,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let go of Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist, and turned away from him. What like her? She was a rice ball to him, he didn\u2019t like her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around, and hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to see Na Liu Ting Du,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s my big brother,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Of course I want to see my big brother. How would you feel if someone told you, you couldn\u2019t see your family?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mind,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I mind,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My family and small friends are everything to me. In this world only they love me, and treat me good.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018And young master too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Even though you\u2019re temperamental and like to bully me, I\u2019ll be sad when that day comes and I can\u2019t see you anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her teary eyes on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest. The thought of leaving him in three years made her sad.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun waited a long time for Hao Yan Che to say something. But sleep won over her before he said anything.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sniffed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck. He loved her body scent, it soothed him and helped him sleep.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Yuan Gun Gun opened her eyes and immediately looked for Hao Yan Che. She was disappointed he wasn\u2019t lying next to her.</p><br/><p>At five that day Yuan Gun Gun only walked Tan Tan to the front door, because Mrs Chen guarded the front door and told Yuan Gun Gun that Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t let her go outside.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen led Yuan Gun Gun to the dining room, and served Yuan Gun Gun a meal.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, this French cheesecake tastes delicious,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master hired a French chef just to make French desserts for you,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Where\u2019s young master?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018How come I didn\u2019t see him today?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master is at Hao Yan\u2019s company,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Why? Do you miss him?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, your smile is scary,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen looked stern again. Yuan Gun Gun finished eating the small slice of French cheesecake, looked at her surroundings and smiled at Mrs Chen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, I want to eat more desserts,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Young master said you\u2019re only allowed to eat this much.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, young master isn\u2019t here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He won\u2019t know if you let me eat more desserts. I want to eat pudding.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen felt like she was under Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s spell. When Mrs Chen was about to cave, Hao Yan Che walked into the dining room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to eat pudding?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted sweetly.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked past Mrs Che, sat down on a chair and held Yuan Gun Gun on his lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Mrs Che said and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at Hao Yan Che like there was something different about him that day while he looked at her cheeks that weren\u2019t swollen anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, your hair,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She pulled Hao Yan Che\u2019s hair. \u2018Why did you dye your hair? I love your white hair.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let Yuan Gun Gun pull his hair, and he carried her to the spa room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018To wash hair,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>In the spa room, Yuan Gun Gun washed the dye out of Hao Yan Che\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, why did you dye your hair black?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che closed his eyes, and enjoyed the relaxing sensation of Yuan Gun Gun massaging his head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it looks like you stopped having headaches,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighty</p><br/>\n</div>"}

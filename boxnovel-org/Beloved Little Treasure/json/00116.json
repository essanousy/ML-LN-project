She looked at the people staring at them and felt embarrassed. Some people smiled at her, and others looked enviously at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Seen enough?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But I want to go to the toilet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked with Yuan Gun Gun to the toilet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, I can go to the toilet on my own,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che waited for Yuan Gun Gun outside the toilet.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun went to the toilet, and washed her hands. She heard groaning and moaning from a cubicle, and ran outside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face was bright red.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.

She ate popcorn and laughed while watching the movie. Her good mood was the opposite of Hao Yan Che\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, taste the popcorn,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t mind if Hao Yan Che refused to eat the popcorn. It meant more popcorn for her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tomorrow you don\u2019t need to go to work,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you taking me out tomorrow?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I have somewhere I need to be tomorrow,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019re staying at home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes\u2026 wait,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Where are you going? Take me with you. I\u2019m scared of being alone.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Qi Tu and Jia Tu will be home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about big brother Yi Tu?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen him for a long time.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sensed Hao Yan Che was in a bad mood so she closed her mouth.</p><br/><p>The sounds of the TV filled the tensed silence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can you come home early?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll stay home and wait for you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You have to keep your word and come home early.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s smile made Hao Yan Che want to tease her. He grabbed her box of popcorn.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go brush your teeth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t finish eating,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held the box of popcorn above Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head. She didn\u2019t want to give up, and kept reaching for the box for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go brush your teeth,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun crawled out of bed, and walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che threw the half eaten box of popcorn into the bin.</p><br/><p>After Yuan Gun Gun returned to the bed, she regretted not eating the popcorn faster. It made her sad to waste good popcorn.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned off the TV and hugged Yuan Gun Gun. She was used to sleeping on his warm chest. She felt sad thinking about being separated from him in another three years. She wondered since she liked being with a sadist like Hao Yan Che if that meant she was a masochist.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 116</p><br/>\n</div>"}

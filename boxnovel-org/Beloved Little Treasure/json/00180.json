She didn\u2019t want to see Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, even if you don\u2019t want to see me, don\u2019t you want to see Hao Hao?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du didn\u2019t care Na Liu Hao had violet eyes and white hair. He loved Na Liu Hao like his son, because half of Na Liu Hao was a part of Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened the door, and she looked at Na Liu Ting Du like he was a stranger.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s heart hurt to see Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s indifference toward him. He put Na Liu Hao on the pink bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling, can\u2019t you forgive me?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not Ling Ling,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m Yuan Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If Gun Gun loved me, I wouldn\u2019t have lied to you that you\u2019re Na Liu Ling Yan,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s heart received another punch by Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if I lied that you\u2019re Na Liu Ling Yan, you still didn\u2019t love me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Whether you\u2019re Yuan Gun Gun or Na Liu Ling Yan, in the last two years I couldn\u2019t live in your heart. Even if you were separated from Hao Yan Che, and you couldn\u2019t remember Hao Yan Che, your heart didn\u2019t allow room for me. You\u2019ll always see as your big brother, someone you turn to if you\u2019re hurting. But you gave your body and soul to Hao Yan Che. Gun Gun, if you love me a bit of how much you love Hao Yan Che, I wouldn\u2019t have lied to you. I wouldn\u2019t worry every day that you\u2019ll remember. I lied to myself every day that one day you\u2019ll love me. I couldn\u2019t escape how much I love you. Gun Gun, can you forgive me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t remember the past. But looking at Na Liu Ting Du suffering made her think she had seen him suffer in the past. She cried because he was hurting too.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why can\u2019t you live without Hao Yan Che?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked. \u2018I met you first. I protected and lived with you from when you were five to eighteen. Why didn\u2019t you choose me?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Na Liu Hao elevated the objects in the room. He was unhappy Na Liu Ting Du and Yuan Gun Gun neglected him.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du let go of Yuan Gun Gun. He walked to the bed, and coaxed Na Liu Hao.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked the bed, and held Na Liu Hao in her arms.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s small hands wiped the tears off Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugly mummy,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sniffed her nose, and she kissed Na Liu Hao\u2019s chubby cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s late,\u2019 Na Liu Tin Du said. \u2018You and Hao Hao should sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, what about you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll sleep in the guest room,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du turned around and walked slowly to the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, I don\u2019t blame you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du turned around and looked at the mother and son.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 Na Ling Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy, kiss,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Ling Ting Du felt a knife stabbed his heart. He walked to Na Liu Hao and kissed Na Liu Hao\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodnight Hao Hao,\u2019 Na Ling Ting Du said. \u2018Hao Hao needs to listen to mummy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Goodnight,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao let the flying objects fall onto the ground. He was happy Na Liu Ting Du and Yuan Gun Gun said goodnight to him.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du rubbed Na Liu Hao\u2019s cheeks. He turned around and walked outside.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun considered continuing to live with Na Liu Ting Du because he loved her and Na Liu Hao. Since she couldn\u2019t remember the past, perhaps she could start a new life with Na Liu Ting Du and Na Liu Hao. But she remembered Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes looked at her like she betrayed him, and made her heart break.</p><br/><p>At the Hao Mansion at midnight, Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nightshirt. He looked at the DOVE she wrote on her nightshirt collar. He wanted to take Yuan Gun Gun home, and ask her if she remembered what DOVE meant.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, Na Liu Ting Du is here to see you,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let him in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 180</p><br/>\n</div>"}

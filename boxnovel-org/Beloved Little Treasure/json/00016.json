Suddenly two figures appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Che,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo called. \u2018Mummy really missed you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo wanted to hug her oldest son who grew more handsome by the day. But Hao Yan Que held her waist too tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, why are you and dad here?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying mummy and daddy can\u2019t see you unless it\u2019s important?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it the truth?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s parents\u2019 burning love for each other, let him live independently at an early age.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo glared at Hao Yan Que. She wanted to visit her sons often, but Hao Yan Que didn\u2019t let her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, tell me why you and dad are here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tomorrow, mummy will bring a loveable young woman here to be your maid,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo waited thirteen years for Yuan Gun Gun to be with Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need a maid,\u2019 Hao Tan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if you don\u2019t need her, you have to accept her,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018Mummy wants her to be my daughter-in-law.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, Hao Yan Ming is your son too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che signed a reviewed report.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018This young woman is suited to you. Xiao Che, if you\u2019re not good to her, mummy will make you suffer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo snatched the reports out of Hao Yan Che\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, what makes you think I\u2019ll agree?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m your biological mother,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently looked at Hao Yan Que. Qiu Li Luo hid behind Hao Yan Que\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because\u2026 Que is your biological father,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said softly.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo pulled Hao Yan Que\u2019s shirt sleeve and she looked pitifully into his amber eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Three years,\u2019 Hao Yan Que negotiated. \u2018Xiao Che, after three years, you\u2019re free.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, what do you mean?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let the little girl stay with you for three years,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018If after three years, you feel nothing for her then I\u2019ll give the CEO position of Hao Yan\u2019s company to someone else.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Deal,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018If you love the little girl then you need to be CEO of Hao Yan\u2019s company until you have an heir.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, that day won\u2019t happen,\u2019 Hao Yan Chen said. \u2018After three years I won\u2019t be CEO of Hao Yan\u2019s company anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Che, what have I taught you?\u2019 Hao Yan Que asked. \u2018Don\u2019t be too cocky before the end. There are no guarantees in life.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the reports Qiu Li Luo put back on his desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018The little girl\u2019s name is Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que and Qiu Li Luo disappeared from the room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che reviewed the reports like nothing happened. Except he thought Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s name was a laughable name.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At night at the Yuan Mansion, Yuan Gun Gun listened to the animals snore. She wasn\u2019t sleepy.</p><div></div><br/><p>The animals saw Na Liu Ting Du walked into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom, and they hid under the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du laid on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bed, and he hugged her from behind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, didn\u2019t you say I can\u2019t sleep with you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t I say you\u2019re not allowed to sleep with them either?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and hugged Na Liu Ting Du like she did when she was younger.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair and she cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, does daddy not love me anymore?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Impossible,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Don\u2019t you know how much dad loves you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If daddy loves me, why is he forcing me to live in another person\u2019s home?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave. I want to stay her with everyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, three years will fly by,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du felt he was comforting himself more than comforting Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happens when I miss home?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du let Yuan Gun Gun play with his long hair.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll come and visit you,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happens when I miss my small friends?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take you home to visit them when I\u2019m free,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, when you\u2019re living in Hao Yan Che\u2019s home, you need to be careful,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Hao Yan Che has a bad temper. You should keep your distance from him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who is Hao Yan Che?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s the young master of the place you\u2019re going to,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he scary?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Does he hit people?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018If he hits you, tell me straight away.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go to sleep,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, are you sleeping here with me tonight?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nose. \u2018Can\u2019t I sleep here?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018But you said I had to sleep on my own,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du glared at the animals behind Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tonight\u2019s an exception,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018You\u2019re leaving tomorrow. Don\u2019t you want to sleep with me tonight?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, you\u2019re the best,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I love big brother Du the most.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um, I love Gun Gun too,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. He patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back. \u2018Go to sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du listened to Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s steady breathing. He suspected his feelings for Yuan Gun Gun surpassed a brother\u2019s love, he loved her like how a man loved a woman.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Sixteen to Seventeen</p><br/>\n</div>"}

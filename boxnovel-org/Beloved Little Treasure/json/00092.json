She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back. A long time later, he licked her lips, and let go of her lips to let her breathe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did you bite me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you dare receive another gift from another man, I\u2019ll bite you to death,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head felt dizzy, and she pressed her hand on her forehead.</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, my head feels dizzy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid Yuan Gun Gun on the bed, and pulled the bedsheet over her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sleep,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun clutched Hao Yan Che\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to stay here by myself,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got into bed, laid under the bedsheet and hugged Yuan Gun Gun.

You\u2019re not married to Na Liu Ting Du. Your name is Yuan Gun Gun. You\u2019re Feng Du Du and my daughter. You\u2019re Hao Yan Che\u2019s wife. To be exact, you\u2019re Hao Yan Che\u2019s runaway wife.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Runaway wife?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018At eighteen you married Hao Yan Che. At twenty-two you ran away to Paris to find your big brother Du. The day you arrived in Paris, you were hit by a car and lost your memory.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy, why did I runaway?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Why did I look for big brother Du? What is my relationship with big brother Du? Daddy, if I\u2019m married to Hao Yan Che, why did I go to look for big brother Du?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, calm down,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018It\u2019s not what you think.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was scared she was a bad wife who ran off to be with her lover.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you grew up with your big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Since you were a little girl, you always saw your big brother Du as your big brother. But your big brother Du always loved you. After you chose to marry Hao Yan Che, your big brother Du chose to live in Paris. Daddy doesn\u2019t know why you ran away. But daddy can promise you, you weren\u2019t unfaithful to Hao Yan Che.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy, you knew big brother Du gave me a false identity,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Daddy, why didn\u2019t you tell me big brother Du lied to me? Daddy, why are you a liar too?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, think about it,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018If in the past you didn\u2019t runaway then you wouldn\u2019t be in this situation today. Do you think you\u2019re the only one who was deceived, the only one who is hurting? Gun Gun, after you married Hao Yan Che, you knew your big brother Du loved you and left for Paris because of you. Why did you choose to go look for your big brother Du in Paris, and gave him hope? The car accident was unexpected. Think about it, if you were in your big brother Du\u2019s shoes, and the woman you love lost her memory, wouldn\u2019t you be tempted to use it as an opportunity to be with the woman you love? Gun Gun, you\u2019re in this situation today is because of the choices you made in the past. Daddy didn\u2019t tell you the truth, because daddy wanted to protect you. Daddy didn\u2019t want to cause you more pain.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s trembling back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu\u2026\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, daddy only wants you to be happy,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018It\u2019s up to you to decide what will make you happy, and how you want to live your life. Whoever you choose to be with or not to be with, daddy and mummy will support your decision. If you don\u2019t want to be with Na Liu Ting Du or Hao Yan Che, it\u2019s OK. Daddy only hopes that you can learn from this situation, make the right choice for you and take responsibility for the choices you make.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 179</p><br/>\n</div>"}

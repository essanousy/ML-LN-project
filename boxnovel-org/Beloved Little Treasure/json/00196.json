When would Yuan Gun Gun understand how much he loved her? He was willing to go through an embarrassing plan to get Yuan Gun Gun to pay attention to him.</p><br/><p>Two nights later, there was a soft knock on the master bedroom door. To Hao Yan Che it was a loud knock he anticipated.</p><br/><p>Outside the door was Yuan Gun Gun. She hugged a pillow, her feet were bare and the wind sounds scared her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened the door, it was his scared little rabbit wife. He forced himself to look indifferent.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s coldness made Yuan Gun Gun sad.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the middle of the night,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hesitated to open her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought Hao Yan Che sounded like he wanted a nuisance like her to leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m going back to my room.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and walked away.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun take each step away from him. He wanted to pull her back, but he was worried he would scare her and chase her away.</p><br/><p>The sounds of a woman crying were heard. Yuan Gun Gun turned around, and ran to Hao Yan Che. She jumped into his arms, hugged his neck and wrapped her legs around his waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s a demon crying,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can you hear it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s round bottom, and acted like he was unaffected by her.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che denied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Listen carefully,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Can you hear it now?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried on Hao Yan Che\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun into their bedroom, he closed the door and smiled.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put Yuan Gun Gun on the bed. He wanted to kiss her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you crying?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You\u2019re really ugly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Demon\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wiped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s endless tears.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Did you watch too many horror movies?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018How did you know I watched horror movies?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s obvious,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018How can you watch rubbish?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone asked me to watch with them,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Aunty Chen, big brother Yi Tu, big brother Jia Tu, big sister Jia Ting, big sister Jia Wen and everyone else watched too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to argue about watching rubbish with me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought Yuan Gun Gun looked adorably vulnerable in that moment.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you supposed to be giving me the cold shoulder?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Why did you come find me for?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to look for you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I went to look for aunty Chen and everyone else. But I don\u2019t know where they went out tonight. They even took Hao Hao to go out with them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s good mood was broken by Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who do you think I am?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Did you come to see me because there was no one else around?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun. Even though he knew it was a plan, he hated hearing he meant nothing to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I want to sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to sleep with you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then you can sleep with me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got out of bed, and walked to the door.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid on the bed. He opened his mouth when Yuan Gun Gun was close to the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018I forgot to warn you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If in the middle of the night you hear someone calling your name, don\u2019t answer them. If you answer them, I don\u2019t know what will appear in front of you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun froze on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u2018I remembered someone died in room seventy-four,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I think it was a maid. She used to be responsible for cleaning room seventy-four. No one knew why she hung herself from the ceiling. I forgot about it because no one dares to go in room seventy-four. Tomorrow I\u2019ll ask Yi Tu to find someone to get rid of the blood stains on the carpet.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 196</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m coming home now,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hung up the phone, and Mrs Chen paced back and forth in the living room.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes later, Hao Yan Che walked into the living room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master you\u2019re home,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018What should we do now?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go reheat the food and bring it to my room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom Yuan Gun Gun was depressed. The two most important men in her heart abused her on the same night. One was her big brother who had loved her since she was a little girl, and the other man was Hao Yan Che. Hao Yan Che bullied her, but he didn\u2019t injure her before. Hao Yan Che\u2019s abuse caused her the most pain. Why did Hao Yan Che had to be so cruel and cold toward her?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wanted last night to be a nightmare. She lost her big brother Na Liu Ting Du, he didn\u2019t answer her calls. If she didn\u2019t step foot into the Hao Mansion, perhaps she would have married Na Liu Ting Du and have babies with Na Liu Ting Du. But she wouldn\u2019t have met Hao Yan Che\u2026 was that the best outcome?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che slammed the door opened. He walked to the bed, and pulled Yuan Gun Gun out of the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want a confrontation?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wrapped her arms around her knees.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, it\u2019s best for you if you cooperate,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her eyes, and propped her head on her knees.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Open your eyes and talk,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun like she was the one in the wrong. She cried bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can you hear me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Say something.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her eyes again and refused to open her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen called.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen, Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen carried trays of food into the room for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard Mrs Chen\u2019s voice, and opened her eyes to look pitifully at them.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018This is your last chance,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Are you going to talk or not?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, don\u2019t treat Gun Gun like this,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get out!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>The women in the room were scared of Hao Yan Che\u2019s intimidating voice. Chen Jia Ting was the first to recover.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you\u2019re not behaving like someone befitting of your status,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got up from the bed, and walked to Chen Jia Ting.</p><br/><p>\u2018My status?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018What about your status?\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting closed her mouth.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want Hao Yan Che to hurt Chen Jia Ting. Yuan Gun Gun got out of bed, but she couldn\u2019t stand steady and fell face down onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che heard Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cry. He walked to Yuan Gun Gun, and carried her back to the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you can\u2019t stand steady then don\u2019t get out of bed,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her sore forehead. Hao Yan Che held her hand, there was a lump on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, apply the cream for her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hid under the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t let aunty Chen apply cream for you within fifteen minutes, I\u2019ll apply cream for you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stood, and walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Twenty minutes later, Hao Yan Che returned to the room. Yuan Gun Gun was crying on Mrs Chen\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone leave,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Mrs Chen\u2019s waist, and she refused to let go.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let go,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head. Hao Yan Che freed Mrs Chen from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s arms. Then Mrs Che, Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen left the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che picked up a bowl of congee, and he fed Yuan Gun Gun the congee. She looked at him, but she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 108</p><br/>\n</div>"}

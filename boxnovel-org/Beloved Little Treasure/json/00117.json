She dressed and walked to the dining room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little girl, it\u2019s the middle of the day,\u2019 Qi Tu said. \u2018Did your young master tire you out last night?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She sat down on a chair. \u2018Yesterday Che took me to a restaurant, the amusement park and the zoo. It was a fun and tiring day.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qi Tu laughed at himself, and continued eating his steak. He should know better than tease someone who couldn\u2019t understand they were being teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re awake,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018What do you want to eat?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stood and linked arms with Mrs Chen.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, today I want to cook,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Young master said you\u2019re not allowed in the kitchen.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che isn\u2019t at home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Stay here. I\u2019ll go ask someone to cook you a meal.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen made Yuan Gun Gun sit back on a chair, and she walked into the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun propped her chin on the dining table. She was sad she couldn\u2019t go into the kitchen to cook.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little girl, why won\u2019t your young master let you go into the kitchen?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018When I first came here I was responsible for cooking Che\u2019s three meals. But after the kitchen gas explosion incident, Che didn\u2019t want me to cook or let me in the kitchen. Che said he\u2019s scared I\u2019ll put poison in the food. Big brother Qi Tu, what type of person do you think I am? Even though Che is moody and bullies me, I wouldn\u2019t harm him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qi Tu smiled. It was obvious to everyone why Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t let Yuan Gun Gun into the kitchen except Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Qi Tu, are you and Che close friends?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Technically he\u2019s the king and I\u2019m a servant,\u2019 Qi Tu said and drank a glass of red wine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You don\u2019t look like a servant.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There are many things you can\u2019t see,\u2019 Qi Tu said. \u2018A simpleton like you is suited to be under a protector\u2019s wings.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qi Tu put the empty glass on the dining table, and rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little girl, I have a little sister who\u2019s a simpleton like you,\u2019 Qi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is she your biological sister?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Qi Tu said. \u2018Her name is Qi Xue Yi, she\u2019s my twin sister.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Xue Yi must be a beautiful woman,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because big sister Xue Yi is your twin sister,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you sucking up to me?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. She held her nose up high. \u2018I\u2019m being serious.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen brought Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s meal to the table. Mrs Chen was displeased to see Qi Tu teasing and pinching Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, eat your meal while it\u2019s hot,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Mrs Che\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It smells delicious.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, after you\u2019re done eating, go get some sunshine out in the garden,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Jia Ting, Jia Wen and your small friends are waiting for you in the garden.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Can I eat outside in the garden?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. She picked up the tray of food. \u2018Come with me to the garden.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye big brother Qi Tu,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu watched Yuan Gun Gun walk to the garden and smiled.</p><br/><p>At Hao Yan\u2019s company on the one hundredth floor, Yi Tu reported to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, here are the files and photos you wanted,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the photo of the killer\u2019s latest victim, and fumed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is this photo taken yesterday?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018The woman was killed in the zoo\u2019s toilet where young master took Gun Gun yesterday. It hasn\u2019t been confirmed if the woman was killed by the same serial killer. But the woman was killed in the same horrific manner as all the serial killer\u2019s victims.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yi Tu felt nauseous looking at the victims\u2019 photos.</p><br/><p>\u2018Any news about the killer\u2019s identity?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry young master.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s obvious the victims have no connection to Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Yi Tu, why do you think the killer made copies of the victims\u2019 photos and addressed them to Gun Gun?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I think the killer\u2019s real target isn\u2019t Gun Gun\u2026\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 117</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Other people didn\u2019t have the right to insult her unprovoked.</p><br/><p>The three women were speechless.</p><br/><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m ugly and dumb,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m the woman Hao Yan Che chose to marry. Big sisters, you can look down on me. But none of you have any right to bad mouth me behind my back unprovoked.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s tears contradicted the conviction in her voice.</p><br/><p>The three women laughed coldly at the weakling Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you really think CEO Hao chose to marry you?\u2019 the first woman asked. \u2018If you won\u2019t the only one who can touch CEO Hao freely, CEO Hao would have chosen one of us to marry, not you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stumbled back a step.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re only born lucky,\u2019 the second woman said. \u2018Think about it. If he couldn\u2019t stand your touch, do you think he would even take one glance at you? Don\u2019t make us laugh. Look at yourself in the mirror. There is nothing appealing about you. You\u2019re ugly, fat and dumb. Do you think CEO Hao married you because he loves you? Who knows what schemes you used to force CEO Hao to marry you?\u2019</p><br/><p>The women cornered Yuan Gun Gun to a wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to know why we insult you behind your back?\u2019 the third woman asked. \u2018Because we hate you. We have the right to talk about anyone we want to. What are you going to do? Find someone to sew our lips?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at the three women\u2019s scornful faces.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, wake up,\u2019 the first woman. \u2018Do you know how many people hate you? Do you know how many people think you don\u2019t deserve to be CEO Hao\u2019s wife? If you have anything inside your dumb brain, you should leave CEO Hao so he can be with someone worthy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know what to do. She could only swallow the women\u2019s insults.</p><br/><p>The three women left the bathroom like nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat against the bathroom wall and cried.</p><br/><p>At three in the afternoon Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t wait for Yuan Gun Gun to come back to his office on her own. He didn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t shake off a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che called Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s phone, but she didn\u2019t pick up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, go to Feng Ting\u2019s office and bring Gun Gun back here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu bowed and went to Feng Ting\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>A while later, Yi Tu returned alone to Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, Feng Ting said Gun Gun didn\u2019t come to her office,\u2019 Yi Tu reported.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is Gun Gun?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No one knows,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go find her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put on his jacket, and went to look for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu was worried Yuan Gun Gun ran away again.</p><br/><p>Later at the Long Mansion, Hao Yan Che rang the doorbell. The Long brothers opened the door, and he walked past them to confront Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao thought in that moment Hao Yan Che looked the scariest she had ever seen him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, where is Yuan Gun Gun?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Isn\u2019t she at home?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gripped Long Liu Bao\u2019s neck, and lifted her feet off the floor.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers saw Long Liu Bao choking, they ran toward her and fought with Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che released Long Liu Bao\u2019s neck, she fell onto the floor and gasped for air. If the Long brothers weren\u2019t home, she would have died.</p><br/><p>Long Wu Mac rushed to Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, are you OK?\u2019 Long Wu Mac asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao shook her head.</p><br/><p>Long Wu Mac thought Hao Yan Che was too cruel. How could he choke someone he grew up with? Long Wu Mac could see Long Liu Bao\u2019s reddened neck, and she didn\u2019t doubt Long Liu Bao\u2019s neck would bruise for days.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che, are you crazy?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo punched Hao Yan Che\u2019s stomach, but Hao Yan Che deflected his punch.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang wanted to kill Hao Yan Che for almost killing Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che, why are you this crazy?\u2019 Long Liu Lang asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took no notice of the Long brothers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, where are you hiding Yuan Gun Gun?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t tell Long Liu Bao that Yuan Gun Gun planned to escape again. But Long Liu Bao believed Yuan Gun Gun must have had enough of Hao Yan Che\u2019s bullying, and chose to leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even if I die, I wouldn\u2019t tell you,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was prepared to kill Long Liu Bao if she didn\u2019t tell him where she hid Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao!\u2019 Long Liu Lang called. \u2018Why are you lying? You haven\u2019t been in contact with Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che, go ahead and kill me,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think I wouldn\u2019t dare kill you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo pulled Long Liu Bao behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, don\u2019t believe Bao Bao,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018I promise you Bao Bao hasn\u2019t been in contact with Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not lying,\u2019 Long Liu Bao lied. \u2018I hate how you bully Gun Gun. I know where Gun Gun is. But I\u2019ll never tell you where she is.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao couldn\u2019t escape Long Liu Bo\u2019s hold.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, be quiet!\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Don\u2019t make me use force.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo held onto Long Liu Bao. Couldn\u2019t she see Hao Yan Che would kill her the moment she was unprotected?</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you say I bully my wife?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao cried because she was worried how scared Yuan Gun Gun would be running away alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I wrong?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knew Long Liu Bao was lying. Long Liu Bao wouldn\u2019t look worried about Yuan Gun Gun if she knew where Yuan Gun Gun was. If Yuan Gun Gun contacted Long Liu Bao then Long Liu Bao would have known that he hadn\u2019t bullied Yuan Gun Gun for a long time.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around, and walked outside the Long Mansion. He asked himself if it was too late for him to change. After he slapped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek in Las Vegas, he didn\u2019t hit her again. Because he didn\u2019t want her to be scared of him again. He gave her freedom to choose when she wanted to be intimate with him, what she wanted to eat and where she wanted to go. Yet she ran away again. Should he stop being stubborn, let her go and let her be happy without him?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 163</p><br/>\n</div>"}

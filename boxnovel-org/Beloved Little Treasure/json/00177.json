Long Liu Bao didn\u2019t doubt he rushed to Hao Yan\u2019S company to save Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao pitied Na Liu Ting Du. Na Liu Ting Du loved Yuan Gun Gun who didn\u2019t love him. Long Liu Bao thought there was nothing wrong with Yuan Gun Gun living with Na Liu Ting Du except she knew Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s heart was always with Hao Yan Che even if Yuan Gun Gun forgot everyone.</p><br/><p>At Hao Yan\u2019s company, Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bedroom and dropped her on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me, did you run away to be with Na Liu Ting Du?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on the bed and held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018You dare take my son away to live with him?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You dare leave me when you were pregnant with my son? Tell me, what were you thinking?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to calm himself down. But Yuan Gun Gun looking at him like they were strangers made it hard for him to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, tell me you\u2019re lying,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Tell me that you remember me, and remember us.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head. She couldn\u2019t stop crying.</p><br/><p>\u2018How can you forget me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to forget me!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to call him!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her ears, and avoided looking at Hao Yan Che\u2019s eyes.</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che felt Yuan Gun Gun shaking. He hugged her and stroked her back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little rice ball, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It\u2019s all my fault.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sniffed Hao Yan Che\u2019s body. She pressed her body closer to him. Why did his body smell so familiar?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought it was too long since the last time he hugged Yuan Gun Gun, and smell her body scent. In his dreams, if he held her hand, she would disappear. It was painful to wake up, and spend every second and minute of the day without her. His heart and soul left him the day she left him. Why did he do something foolish like letting her go? He should have patiently waited for her to love him. Why did he waste two years? It was one sad joke on him. She came back to him, but she forgot him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun closed her eyes. She listened to Hao Yan Che\u2019s heartbeats, felt relaxed like she was sleeping and forgot that he raised his voice at her.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du slammed the door opened. He caught Hao Yan Che in bed with Yuan Gun Gun. They were holding onto each other tightly, and looked like a beautiful painting of a pair of lovers\u2019 reunion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ling Ling,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s voice, and she realised she was hugging Hao Yan Che. She pushed Hao Yan Che away from her, and looked at No Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du felt like he lost Yuan Gun Gun again.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s calmness disappeared after Yuan Gun Gun pushed him away because of Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know what to say. She willingly hugged Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Let\u2019s go home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why she wanted to hug someone like Hao Yan Che who suddenly looked coldly at her again. She wanted to go home.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun tightly again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your home is here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 177</p><br/>\n</div>"}

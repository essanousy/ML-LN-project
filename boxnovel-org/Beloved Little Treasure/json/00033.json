He pushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand away. \u2018But you\u2019re not allowed to seduce my servants.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re being unreasonable,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take her away,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can walk on my own,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun puffed her chest and walked outside confidently.</p><br/><p>A couple of seconds later, Yuan Gun Gun walked back to her bedroom and held Mrs Chen\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, I don\u2019t know the way there,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen took Yuan Gun Gun to the dark room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che glared at Yi Tu, broke down the door and left.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, do you think this is a good situation?\u2019 Jia Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it good?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think Gun Gun will cope being in the dark room?\u2019 Jia Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m shocked,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018You actually care about another person\u2019s welfare?\u2019</p><br/><p>Jia Tu didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, does she know her own powers?\u2019 Yi Tu asked. \u2018She can capture young master\u2019s heart, and make Jia Tu who hates women care about her too.\u2019</p><br/><p>Jia Tu didn\u2019t let Yi Tu provoke him.

It was dark and cold in the dark room. She reasoned hers and Hao Yan Che\u2019s birthdays weren\u2019t compatible. Why else would Hao Yan Che be angry every time he saw her? Hao Yan Che acted like she stepped on his tail if they were in the same room with each other. She didn\u2019t even need to offend Hao Yan Che, and he would still be angry with her. She vowed to keep her distance from Hao Yan Che. Even if she was beaten to death, she wouldn\u2019t talk to Hao Yan Che again.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged the hot water bottle Mrs Chen left for her in the dark room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du\u2026 save me\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said weakly.</p><br/><p>At twenty past ten at night, Hao Yan Che laid sleepless on his bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master!\u2019 Chen Jia Ting called from outside Hao Yan Che\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting opened the door. It was pitch black in the bedroom. She stood near the door because she couldn\u2019t see in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you think Gun Gun\u2019s body can cope in the dark room?\u2019 Chen Jia Ting asked. \u2018She\u2019s only a little girl.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Have you ever seen such a destructive little girl?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, Gun Gun is the Yuan Household\u2019s little princess,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018Her family didn\u2019t let her lift a finger. She\u2019s been sheltered most of her life. It\u2019s natural for her to make simple mistakes. But she\u2019s slowly maturing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Her growth has nothing to do with me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, what did Gun Gun do wrong?\u2019 Chen Jia Ting asked. \u2018If you let her take time to rest. Then she is free to do whatever she want to do while she\u2019s resting.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Leave,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Because you\u2019re aunty Chen\u2019s daughter, I didn\u2019t tell you to get lost.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun has a fever,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said softly and left.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the moon outside the window.</p><br/><p>\u2018So what if she has a fever?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked himself. \u2018What a weakling.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got out of bed and went to the dark room.</p><br/><p>In the dark room, Hao Yan Che patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun!\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bedroom, and he summoned a doctor.</p><br/><p>At a quarter to eleven at night, the doctor arrived at the Hao Mansion to examine Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018How is she?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018She has a fever\u2026 I gave her pills to help reduce her fever\u2026 she\u2019ll be OK\u2026\u2019 the doctor stammered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get out!\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 the doctor said and ran outside.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sick face, and asked himself if he felt regret for the first time in his life. He wanted to leave, but his body refused to leave her. He thought he had turned strange the moment she entered his life.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid next to Yuan Gun Gun on the bed. He stroked her hair until he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Yuan Gun Gun woke up, stretched her body and walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you young master?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked and rubbed her drowsy eyes.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was naked in the bath tub.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>A second later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun screamed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che calmly got out of the bath tub, picked up a towel, dried his body in front of Yuan Gun Gun and put on a shirt.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought she was dreaming.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che touched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead. He thought she still had a fever because her forehead was hot.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun blushed and avoided Hao Yan Che\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go wash up and come outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che left his little round ball standing in a daze in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che waited a long time, but Yuan Gun Gun refused to come out of the bathroom. He walked back to the bathroom, and carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked fearfully at the person wearing a white lab coat, and she hid under the bedsheet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come out,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018No needles.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll ask them to use the biggest needle to give you an injection,\u2019 Hao Yan Che threatened.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat up on the bed. She stared at the needle and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018Miss, give me your left arm and fist your hand,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Listen to the doctor,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun slowly gave her left arm to the doctor and fisted her hand. Her right hand clutched Hao Yan Che\u2019s shirt while the doctor gave her an injection.</p><br/><p>\u2018All done,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><br/><p>The doctor smiled at the pitiful Yuan Gun Gun who had a fear of pain. The doctor wanted to squeeze Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks and console her. But Hao Yan Che looked at the doctor like Hao Yan Che wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill if the doctor touched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll leave,\u2019 the doctor said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let the doctor leave without thanking the doctor.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Thirty-Three to Thirty-Four</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What\u2019s in the box may cause some readers distress.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked into his office the moment Yuan Gun Gun was about to touch the boxes on his desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can\u2019t touch them!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said sternly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was curious what was inside the boxes. Hao Yan Che rarely forbid her to touch any of his things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you know how to read?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018They are addressed to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t your parents teach you that you shouldn\u2019t open another person\u2019s gift?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun took a step back. Her eyes stung. She was married to Hao Yan Che for more than three years. But in his eyes she was only an outsider.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did you go before?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Feng invited me to eat sushi with her,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go deliver the reports I put on your desk,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun picked up the reports from her desk, and quietly left Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lonely back.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu and Jia Tu looked at each other confusedly. They didn\u2019t understand what happened between Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened the two wrapped boxes. Inside were two fresh bleeding heads. Their mouths were sewed together, their minced brains and blood were mixed together and their eyes were dangling from their eye sockets.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che read the letter attached to the boxes, \u2018Mr Hao, I\u2019ve sent you my sincere apologies. Here the two heads of the men who deserved to die. Believe me, I had no involvement with your wife\u2019s kidnapping attempt. I wouldn\u2019t dare oppose you by causing harm to your wife. Please forgive for my traitorous men\u2019s actions.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are these the two men who kidnapped Gun Gun?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Looks like it,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu felt nauseous. How could Daniel be that cruel to his own men?</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, were you stern with Gun Gun before because you could smell fresh blood from the boxes?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, Jia Tu, go release Daniel\u2019s son,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered. \u2018And give these boxes to Daniel\u2019s son. Tell Daniel\u2019s son to return these boxes to Daniel.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu and Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu and Jia Tu bowed, they each carried a box and left Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>In the women\u2019s bathroom, Yuan Gun Gun sat in a toilet cubicle and cried. She knew it was wrong to touch Hao Yan Che\u2019s things without his permission. But they were husband and wife. Why did he hide secrets from her? She didn\u2019t know what was so important inside the boxes that he wouldn\u2019t even let her see what was inside. Did he want freedom to keep secrets? But he didn\u2019t let her withhold a secret from him. He made all her decisions. He was used to having control over her. But why did he have to scold her over boxes? She only wanted to see what was inside. Was she only someone who helped to guard his home? Did he marry her because someone forced him?</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I heard someone delivered two wrapped gifts to CEO Hao\u2019s office,\u2019 the first woman said. \u2018It must be from a woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018And I saw Yuan Gun Gun crying and running out of CEO Hao\u2019s office,\u2019 the second woman said. \u2018Something must have happened.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun often accidently overhead women gossiping in the women\u2019s toilets. There were many women at Han Yan\u2019s company who were secretly in love with Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did I tell you?\u2019 the third woman said. \u2018Miracles don\u2019t happen in real life. Only princesses gets to marry the prince.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun is a princess,\u2019 the first woman said. \u2018Yuan\u2019s company can\u2019t compare to Hao Yan\u2019s company. But Yuan\u2019s company is one of the top twenty richest companies in the world.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Then I should say, only beautiful princesses gets to marry the prince,\u2019 the third woman said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What is wrong with you women?\u2019 the fourth woman asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you women have anything better to do? Who do you women think you are? I think Yuan Gun Gun is a genuine and caring person. Even if CEO Hao wasn\u2019t married to Yuan Gun Gun, you women have zero chance of attracting his attention.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you implying?\u2019 the first woman asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you mean we don\u2019t have a chance?\u2019 the second woman asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying we\u2019re nosy people?\u2019 the third woman asked. \u2018Who do you think you are to look down on us?\u2019</p><br/><p>While the three women were ganging up on the fourth woman, Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you go to Australia to deliver the reports?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll come back now.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s brows creased after hearing Yuan Gun Gun crying softly. He hung up the phone, and waited for her to return to his office.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got off the toilet seat. She dusted her bottom, and walked outside the toilet cubicle. The beautiful women who were gossiping about her before were washing their hands at the sinks. She smiled at their ashamed faces, washed and dried her hands and walked outside the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to fight with the women who gossiped about her, because it was troublesome and what they said about her was the truth.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of 144</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why do you have to bully me like this? Even if I\u2019m your maid, I have self-respect too. I hate you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although Yuan Gun Gun covered her chest, her ripped underwear barely covered her honeypot. Hao Yan Che thought if someone saw them together in that moment then that person would misunderstand he forced himself on Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>The bedroom door opened, Hao Yan Che immediately hugged his rice ball to shield her body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, get out!\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu closed the door, and prayed for his life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out. \u2018It\u2019s all your fault! They saw everything. Hao Yan Che, I hate you!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018You monster, I hate you!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and slammed the bathroom door close.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che punched a bedroom wall.</p><br/><p>One hour later, Hao Yan Che sat at his desk, held a report in his hand but couldn\u2019t read a single word.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, Hao Yan Che held a pen, but he couldn\u2019t write a single word.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, Hao Yan Che picked up the bedroom key and walked to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun open the door,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, don\u2019t test my patience,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was worried something happened to Yuan Gun Gun. He unlocked the door and stood in front of the sleeping Yuan Gun Gun. She was huddled on the bed, she sucked a finger in her mouth, she was still crying in her sleep and a bedsheet covered below her waist. He thought she looked like an angel that fell from heaven.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laughed at himself. How could he think his rice ball looked like an angel? At the most, Yuan Gun Gun was a rice ball angel. He pictured his rice ball angel attempting to fly and fail because of gravity. It made him smile. If his rice ball angel fell, she would beg him for dessert.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called. He patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead. \u2018Wake up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che shook Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, wake up and go to work,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun mumbled something against the pillow, but she didn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, wake up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid on the bed next to Yuan Gun Gun. It was like she could sense his presence in her sleep. She hugged his waist and moved around to find a comfortable spot on his chest.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun sleep. He finally understood why Hao Yan Que hated anyone hugging Qiu Li Luo, even their sons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, my rice ball angel,\u2019 Hao Yan Che whispered. \u2018Accept your fate, you\u2019ll always be with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>At twenty-eight past six in the evening, Yuan Gun Gun woke up and pushed Hao Yan Che away from her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay away!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to see Hao Yan Che. She turned around, and her back faced him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned Yuan Gun Gun around, and his brows creased.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you cry, I\u2019ll take you outside right now,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her face, but her trembling shoulders betrayed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crying isn\u2019t going to change anything,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s your fault!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018How am I going to look at everyone in the face?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll fire all of them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018How about I poke their eyes out?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re crazy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighty-Seven</p><br/>\n</div>"}

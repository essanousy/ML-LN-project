His wife was a trouble maker. He was worried at work that his wife was crying in their bedroom, and refusing to eat.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked into the Hao Mansion, and Mrs Chen bowed to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, today young master Ming brought his wife here to visit you,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are they?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018They went home,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che frowned. He got a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 Gun Gun saw young master Ming sleeping with his wife in the living room,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Gun Gun must have mistaken young master Ming for you. Gun Gun ran away crying. I\u2019ve asked some people to go look for Gun Gun already.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Have they found her?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I wanted to send someone to the Yuan Mansion to see if Gun Gun\u2019s there. But I didn\u2019t want Gun Gun\u2019s parents to worry if Gun Gun isn\u2019t there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018When did my dummy run away from home?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Around ten this morning,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018They\u2019re all going to die,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kicked the front door open. He wanted to kill his little brother for making his wife misunderstand, and he wanted to kill his wife for not trusting him and running away.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen smiled at Hao Yan Che running to the car. She thought he deserved to be anxious for taking Yuan Gun Gun for granted.</p><br/><p>In the car, Hao Yan Che put his phone on speaker and drove out of the driveway.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, is your loveable daughter at the Yuan Mansion?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018What did she do?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018She\u2019s just missing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked. \u2018Did my little girl run away from home? Have a good talk with her when you bring her home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I promise I\u2019ll have a good talk with her when I bring her home. Goodnight dad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ended the call with his father-in-law. Then he called Long Liu Bo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bo, my little rice ball is missing,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Is she at the Long Mansion?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what to say,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I understand,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll be at the Long Mansion soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, your little rice ball said you have a mistress,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018My little rice ball saw Ming sleeping with his wife Su An Ting in our living room.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ming?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked. \u2018Isn\u2019t he in Las Vegas? When did he come home?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Ming came home today,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018He\u2019s going to die. He hasn\u2019t changed since we were children. Always causing trouble and running away before I can kill him.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo laughed. He understood why Yuan Gun Gun misunderstood Hao Yan Che was cheating.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m hanging up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Keep an eye on my little rice ball.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Go easy on your little rice ball.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I won\u2019t be too cruel.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s scary gentle voice made Long Liu Bo shiver. Long Liu Bo prayed for Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>At the Long Mansion at nine at night, Long Liu Bao showed Yuan Gun Gun playgirl magazines.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, take a look,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018All the photos are of handsome men.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018They are handsome.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018See this man here?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018He\u2019s wearing the pants in the relationship. The man with the long hair is the pet in the relationship.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Like how your monster Hao wears the pants and you\u2019re the pet,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018He bullies you, but you can\u2019t fight back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t understand,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I compiled these magazines myself. Take your time to look through them.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao missed her mummy Wu. She was happy to have Yuan Gun Gun to have girl talks with.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun carefully looked at the magazines. Most of the photos and articles made her blush.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the bedroom door opened. Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun both jumped a little on the bed. Then Yuan Gun Gun hid behind Long Liu Bao\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao glared at the snitching Long brothers who were standing behind Hao Yan Che at the door.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers shook their heads, and they looked innocently at Long Liu Bao like they didn\u2019t snitch.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, roll yourself over here!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body was shaking. But she remembered Hao Yan Che sleeping with another woman in their living room, and she didn\u2019t care if he was cold or angry.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m not coming home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to divorce you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You want to what?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. He narrowed his eyes. \u2018Say it again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I want to divorce you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 149</p><br/>\n</div>"}

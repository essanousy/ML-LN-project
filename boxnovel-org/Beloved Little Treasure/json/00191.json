The first time she visited Hao Yan\u2019s company she was a guest. The second time she visited Hao Yan\u2019s company, she found out she was CEO Hao\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s employees were flabbergasted their CEO Hao held a woman\u2019s hand and a little boy\u2019s hand who looked exactly like him. They remembered since CEO Hao\u2019s wife left him, he was never seen with another woman. But suddenly CEO Hao appeared in front of them with a beautiful young woman and his son. It was a miraculous sight.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was unhappy strangers were staring at him and his parents. Especially women who glared at his mummy.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked coldly at his employees. His employees quickly looked away and they acted busy.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wrapped an arm around Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder. She hid her head on his chest, because she was scared of strangers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did I really come to work with you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because you were my secretary,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Secretary?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018That sounds shady.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knocked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dummy, what are you thinking about?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her head, and smiled shyly.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took his wife and son to the one hundredth floor. His secretaries bowed and greeted him.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao,\u2019 the secretaries greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened his office door, and took his wife and son inside.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put his son on the sofa next to his wife. Then he opened the pig fridge.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are there less employees on this floor compared to the other floors?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018They are my secretaries,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018All of them?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and looked inside the pig fridge.</p><br/><p>\u2018But aren\u2019t you supposed to only have one secretary?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che closed the fridge. He turned around and looked sadly at Yuan Gun Gun. He remembered Yuan Gun Gun asked him the same question when he first took her to his company. He remembered everything about their life together, but she forgot him and their life together.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Did I say something wrong?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Six years ago you asked me the same question,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You were eighteen at the time.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018You have a good memory,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You can remember something that happened six years ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 can\u2019t forget,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard her heart racing. She couldn\u2019t remember the past, but she didn\u2019t fight her attraction to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat next to Yuan Gun Gun on the sofa. He caressed her face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun felt like her heart would jump out of her mouth in the next second.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s lips moved toward Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. When his lips were a millimetre apart from her lips, their son waved his chubby hand in front of the faces.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pushed Hao Yan Che away, and she coughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che regretted he couldn\u2019t kiss Yuan Gun Gun. He took out his phone and called Yi Tu.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Buy fresh milk and pudding.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, is it you?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, did you say you want me to buy fresh milk and pudding?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.

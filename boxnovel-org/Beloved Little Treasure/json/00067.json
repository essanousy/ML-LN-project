She sat up on the pink bed, and looked at the murderous look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who let you leave?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on the pink bed and pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 don\u2019t pinch,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018There are purple bruises there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll help you color the places that aren\u2019t purple,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom left and right.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026 young master\u2026 I was wrong,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled Yuan Gun Gun back to the master bedroom. She didn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. If she could protect her bottom, she would have stayed in the pink bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you on the bed?\u2019 Han Yan Che asked. \u2018Are you waiting for me to serve you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got into the bed, and laid close to the edge.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come closer,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun inched a little away from the edge of the bed. Hao Yan Che lost his patience, he pulled her to his chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you lie close to the edge again, I\u2019ll kick you out of bed,\u2019 Hao Yan Che warned. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom again. \u2018Sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s my bottom,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s yours,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was satisfied, and patted Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I can\u2019t sleep,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nuzzled her face on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, can we talk for a bit?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun tighter.</p><br/><p>\u2018I like having someone to sleep with,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Young master, what about you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Sleeping alone,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then why do you want me to move here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at his rice ball\u2019s innocent eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018When I was a little girl, I loved sleeping with my mummy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But when my daddy found mummy and me, daddy took us back home. Daddy didn\u2019t let me sleep with mummy anymore. So I climbed onto big brother Du\u2019s bed to sleep. Big brother Du used to pat my back and tell me bedtime stories. When I turned fifteen, big brother Du didn\u2019t let me sleep with him anymore. If I snuck into big brother Du\u2019s bed at night, he would carry me back to my room\u2026 young master, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun protected her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Roll over to the floor,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why Hao Yan Che was suddenly angry.</p><br/><p>\u2018Roll over,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got out off bed, and Hao Yan Che turned off the lights. She stood in the dark until her legs were numb then she laid on the floor.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s night vision let him see clearly in the dark. He saw his dummy rice ball\u2019s confused expression. He was still angry from the moment Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s name came out of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, Hao Yan Che laid sleepless on the bed while Yuan Gun Gun slept peacefully on the floor. He looked at his rice ball curled up against the bed, and didn\u2019t know if she was good at adapting to any environment or if her naivety was a blessing. If she had bribed him, he would have let her sleep on the bed immediately. But she didn\u2019t bribe him so he let her sleep on the floor.</p><br/><p>Early morning, Yuan Gun Gun felt someone kicked her bottom and she woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, good morning,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stretched her body, and got up from the floor. Hao Yan Che ignored her and walked to the bathroom. She rubbed her eyes, and made his bed.</p><br/><p>A while later, Yuan Gun Gun brushed her teeth in the bathroom, and secretly glanced at Hao Yan Che shaving his chin stubble.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Sixty-Seven</p><br/>\n</div>"}

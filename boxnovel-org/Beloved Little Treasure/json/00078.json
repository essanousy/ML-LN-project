Ting Du, you\u2019re someone who has good foresight.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you dad,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Dad, is Hao Yan Che an ordinary person?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What makes you think he isn\u2019t an ordinary person?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du took another sip of wine.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018If he\u2019s an ordinary person then you wouldn\u2019t be injured.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought it was an evenly matched fight,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said and rubbed his mouth wound.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du carried a tray of food to the study room, and she was displeased with Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you\u2019re injured, you need to take care of your wound,\u2019 Feng Du Du chastised. \u2018You two don\u2019t know how to take care of yourselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du dragged Na Liu Ting Du to the living room to clean Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s wound. Yuan Ting Liu stayed in the study room, and ate Feng Du Du\u2019s cooked meal even though he wasn\u2019t hungry. Yuan Ting Liu thought Yuan Gun Gun was like Feng Du Du, they were happy simpletons.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom at the Hao Mansion, Mrs Chen visited Yuan Gun Gun who stared blankly at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Mrs Chen called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen sat on the bed, and inspected Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s swollen cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me what happened,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Today big brother Du came to visit me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t know why young master came out or why he was angry. He hit my head. Big brother Du wanted to take me away from him. He kicked big brother Du to the ground. Then they fought. I protected big brother Du, and my face became like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, how is Na Liu Ting Du related to you?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why does everyone ask me the same question?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018He\u2019s my big brother.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is he adopted by your parents?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you\u2019re eighteen,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018You need to be aware of keeping a respectable distance between you and men. Even if he\u2019s your big brother, you shouldn\u2019t kiss and hug each other so freely. If you take away his big brother title, he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re a woman. If you two aren\u2019t together then you should keep your distance from him. You\u2019re not a five or a ten-year-old girl anymore.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018What about young master?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He kisses my lips.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not the same,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Because you\u2019ll be young master\u2019s wife, and the future young mistress of the Hao Household.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who\u2026 who said?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018How come I didn\u2019t know?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, tell me if you like young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun puffed her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018If he says sorry then I\u2019ll like him,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018If he doesn\u2019t then I won\u2019t like him.\u2019</p><br/><p>If Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face wasn\u2019t like a balloon, Mrs Chen wanted to pinch her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, why do you want young master to say sorry?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018He hit my big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Have you forgotten?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Young master\u2019s body doesn\u2019t let people touch him. His body automatically attacked your big brother, because your big brother touched him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought that was a joke,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018If it\u2019s true, how come young master hasn\u2019t kicked me out the window for touching him?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t you see young master gives you special treatment?\u2019 Mrs Chen asked. \u2018Sometimes too special. But can\u2019t you feel young master likes you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen thought the answer was clear on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face, Yuan Gun Gun looked happy to hear Hao Yan Che liked Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here to put soothing cream on your face,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was too happy to hear or feel Mrs Chen applying cream on her face. By the time Mrs Chen left, Yuan Gun Gun forgot what else she wanted to ask Mrs Chen.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Seventy-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

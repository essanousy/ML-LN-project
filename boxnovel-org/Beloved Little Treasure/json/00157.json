He took out his phone, and called Fang Kuang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fang Kuang, I want you to send a search party to the airport,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018Search every corner of the airport. If no one finds Long Liu Bao after half an hour, you know the drill. Stop all planes from arriving or departing the airport. If she protests, you have my permission to knock her unconscious and bring her home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master Lang,\u2019 Fang Kuang said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018It\u2019s the Long Household\u2019s fault for not knowing how to discipline our little trouble maker. I promise I\u2019ll bring your wife back without one hair strand missing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018After my wife returns, I\u2019ll give her an incentive to not runaway again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che understood Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s motivation for wanting to make him happy.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo called Fang Lang on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fang Lang, I want you and Fang Ming to search all departing gates where passengers are scheduled to depart within the next three hours,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Don\u2019t stop looking until you find Long Liu Bao.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master Bo,\u2019 Fang Lang said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo threw the phone onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao, you\u2019re going to die after I find you,\u2019 Long Liu Bo vowed and walked to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll order demons to search for my wife and Long Liu Bao.\u2019</p><br/><p>On a private plane, Long Liu Bao and Yuan Gun Gun ate and drank.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, didn\u2019t you buy plane tickets?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018It\u2019s a waste of money if we\u2019re flying on a private plane.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, it\u2019s called a diversion,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018I bought plane tickets to Paris to make them think we\u2019re going to Paris. Knowing them, they will ask big brother Fang Kuang to search for us at the airport. Big sister Lang has access to all systems at the airport. She\u2019ll find out we bought plane tickets to Paris. Now do you understand why we\u2019re taking a private plane to Las Vegas?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, I miss Che already,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Between five to seven days, they\u2019ll find us. Let\u2019s think of this as work leave and have fun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ate the piece of steak Long Liu Bao held up in front of her mouth, and she smiled at Long Liu Bao.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, we\u2019re going to have fun in a city that never sleeps,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>The two women chatted happily together while their men were going crazy looking for them.</p><br/><p>Two hours later at the Long Mansion the Long brothers were ready to kill someone after receiving bad news.</p><br/><p>\u2018I asked five thousand men to search the airport,\u2019 Fang Kuang said. \u2018No one found Long Liu Bao, which means she\u2019s not at the airport.\u2019</p><br/><p>Afterward Long Liu Lang received a phone call from Fang Lang.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master Lang, young master Bo\u2019s phone is disconnected,\u2019 Fang Lang said. \u2018So I called your phone.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Get to the point,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the airport\u2019s system there are two plane tickets bought under Long Liu Bao,\u2019 Fang Lang said. \u2018The destination is Paris. The plane departed three and a half hours ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018Keep looking for Long Liu Lang.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master Lang,\u2019 Fang Lang said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang hung up the phone and he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Any news?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fang Lang said she found two plane tickets to Paris bought under Long Liu Bao\u2019s name,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018It departed three and a half hours ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Three and a half hours ago?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Impossible,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018Che brought Gun Gun here less than three and a half hours ago. Even if Bao Bao and Gun Gun sped to the airport, it\u2019ll take them at least half an hour.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018It means she didn\u2019t go to the airport.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I checked how much money she transferred to her card,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018She didn\u2019t just buy plane tickets, she bought a private plane.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the Hao Mansion, Yi Tu was a nervous wreck looking at Hao Yan Che brooding on a chair. Like all the servants, Yi Tu didn\u2019t expect Yuan Gun Gun would dare to escape with Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019ve asked all the demons around the world to be on the lookout for Gun Gun,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at the full moon. He knew he couldn\u2019t live without Yuan Gun Gun. That night he found out, being apart one day from Yuan Gun Gun was more painful than he imagined it would be.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu, do you think I mistreat my wife?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 157</p><br/>\n</div>"}

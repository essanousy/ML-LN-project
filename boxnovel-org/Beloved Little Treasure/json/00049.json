She didn\u2019t understand why Hao Yan Che killed Xiao Bi in such a cruel way.</p><br/><p>Two minutes to nine in the morning, Mrs Chen quietly walked into Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom. Mrs Chen sat on the bed, and her heart ached while she gently rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s swollen face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bi jumped onto the bed, and pulled its mistress hair. Yuan Gun Gun opened her eyes, and thought she saw Xiao Bi on her bed holding nuts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Bi?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bi rubbed its head against Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck.

No one dares to raise their finger or raise their voice at young master in his home. Here, young master controls everyone\u2019s fate including whether they live or die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen gave Yuan Gun Gun a red apple. For the first time in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s life, Yuan Gun Gun only held an apple instead of eating it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, I know someone wants to cause discord between you and young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I don\u2019t know their motive.

She thought Hao Yan Che wouldn\u2019t want to see, because she said hurtful words to him.</p><br/><p>At half past eight the next morning, Hao Yan Che woke up in a bad mood because he didn\u2019t see Yuan Gun Gun. He got out of bed, brushed and washed in the bathroom. Then he opened the violet door and saw his rice ball sleeping in front of the violet door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t wake up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun!\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes were firmly closed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wake up and eat,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eat where\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun opened her eyes, and saw a long pair of legs.

He sat back at his desk, read the letter attached to the box of chocolates and fumed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, do my words fly like the wind through your ears?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I told you, you\u2019re not allowed to receive gifts from other men,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and thumped his desk.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu secretly glanced at the letter, \u2018I hope Gun Gun will always be sweet and loveable like this box of chocolates from your big brother San Yuan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yi Tu smiled, because Ning San Yuan didn\u2019t forget Yuan Gun Gun even though Ning San Yuan was transferred to Canberra.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not right,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You said I\u2019m not allowed to receive flowers from other men.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stood, and Yuan Gun Gun took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s true,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che threw the box of chocolates outside his office.

He won\u2019t notice them if you hide them there. Besides, he works or exercise most of the day. He\u2019s only in his room to sleep at night. You can take them to your room at night and bring them to his room before you wake him up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Tao, you know young master\u2019s routine well,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I was young master\u2019s maid before you came here,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But there is a maid who cleans young master\u2019s room during the day,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Become friends with her and she\u2019ll keep them a secret from young master,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you big sister Tao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re a good person.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re friends,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said. \u2018Of course I would help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiang Jia Tao walked outside, and Xiao Yuan licked a paw while watching its mistress think about how to sneak everyone into Hao Yan Che\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><br/>\n</div>"}

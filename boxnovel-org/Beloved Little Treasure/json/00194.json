He put his son on the bed, and turned on the TV.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay here for a bit,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I need to take care of something. Then I\u2019ll come back and take us home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ignored Hao Yan Che. He didn\u2019t make a fuss, and walked outside the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, when you grow up don\u2019t be unreasonable like your daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said sternly.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was lazy to argue with his mummy. He levitated the remote control to his hand.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laid on the bed, and sighed helplessly. Her husband and son were two of a kind.</p><br/><p>Outside the bedroom, Hao Yan Che called a security guard.</p><br/><p>\u2018Call director Feng to come to my office,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes CEO Hao,\u2019 the security guard said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hung up the phone, sat on the sofa and thought deeply.</p><br/><p>A while later, Feng Ting knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, you wanted to see me?\u2019 Feng Ting asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sit,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting sat opposite to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018What you said before,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you mean that people dared to bully Gun Gun in the past?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, it\u2019s better if you talk to Gun Gun about this,\u2019 Feng Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun lost her memory,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Feng Ting asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You heard me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Gun Gun lost her memory. I want you to answer my question.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun made me promise not to tell you,\u2019 Feng Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Two days ago, Gong Shao Jie returned to the city,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you want to go and give Gong Shao Jie a hand?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Ting clenched her hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is even if CEO Hao didn\u2019t use Gong Shao Jie to threaten me, I would have told you eventually,\u2019 Feng Ting. \u2018It was frustrating for me to keep this promise to Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che listened for the answer he wanted to hear.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, think about it,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018You sit high on a pedestal, and you\u2019re exceptionally beautiful. Yet you chose to marry a simple minded and ordinary woman like Gun Gun. Although Gun Gun also has CEO Yuan\u2019s protection, it\u2019s inevitable for Gun Gun to be the target of other women\u2019s envy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018When did it start?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It started on the first day CEO Hao brought Gun Gun here,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018Inside most women\u2019s hearts, you\u2019re an immortal that ordinary people are not allowed to touch. Gun Gun\u2019s appearance broke their hearts. They didn\u2019t hurt Gun Gun physically, but they hurt her mentally. Gun Gun is a genuine dummy. No matter what hurtful things they said to her, she smiled and told them that they only spoke the truth. She would always act like it didn\u2019t hurt her, and go back to you. But you were oblivious. CEO Hao, I\u2019m not someone who likes to interfere in another person\u2019s business. This is an exception. Tell me, were you oblivious or you didn\u2019t care?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re her friend,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You saw her being bullied, but why didn\u2019t you come to me and tell me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I\u2019m Gun Gun\u2019s friend. But you\u2019re her husband. It\u2019s your job to protect her. Why do you expect me to report to you if she is being bullied? Why didn\u2019t you protect her, and find out for yourself if anyone bullied her?\u2019</p><br/><p>It was Hao Yan Che\u2019s turn to clench his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018I wanted to tell you but Gun Gun made me promise not to tell you,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018This is between you and your wife. You live with your wife every day. Didn\u2019t you see the signs? Didn\u2019t you see how anxious your wife was every day coming to work?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought about Feng Ting\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, the truth is I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a blessing or a curse for Gun Gun to marry you,\u2019 Feng Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, you should think about it yourself,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I have work to do. Don\u2019t use Gong Shao Jie to threaten me again. Right now Gun Gun lost her memory. But one day she\u2019ll regain her memory, and she\u2019ll be angry at you if she found out you threatened me. I\u2019ll let today slide, because I know you care about her. I assume a smart person like CEO Hao can understand my warning.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Ting stood and walked outside Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting was lucky she was Hao Yan Che\u2019s wife\u2019s friend. If Feng Ting wasn\u2019t, he would have killed Feng Ting for threatening him.</p><br/><p>Outside Hao Yan Che\u2019s office, Feng Ting\u2019s body shivered. She didn\u2019t pity the women who were nasty toward Yuan Gun Gun in the past.</p><br/><p>A while later, Yi Tu and Jia Tu carried bags of fresh milk and pudding into Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yi Tu and Jia Tu greeted and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu and Jia Tu put the fresh milk and pudding into the pig fridge. They both could smell Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body scent on Hao Yan Che\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, is Gun Gun back?\u2019 Yi Tu asked. \u2018Is that why you asked us to buy fresh milk and pudding?\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 194</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She didn\u2019t understand why a night ago Hao Yan Che held her in his arms and stroked her hair, but the next moment he threw hurtful words at her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hated seeing Hao Yan Che hit their son. She thought their son was still little, and she wanted to explain the situation to their son when he was older. If Hao Yan Che was angry because their son was too young to understand the situation, Hao Yan Che could vent his anger on her instead of their innocent son. How could Hao Yan Che forget he was the father of her son?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t believe the man who hit Na Liu Hao was the same gentle man she thought she lived with. Was Hao Yan Che\u2019s gentleness a mirage? If it wasn\u2019t a mirage, how could Hao Yan Che be so cruel toward her and their son?</p><br/><p>At night, Hao Yan Che returned to the master bedroom after drinking bottles of wine. He wasn\u2019t surprised to see Yuan Gun Gun cried herself to sleep. He laid on the bed next to her. He gently wiped tears off her face.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought Yuan Gun Gun slept the same way she used to in the past. But she was different to her past self, she dared to talk back to him and raise her voice. Why did she take their rotten little demon son\u2019s side over him? Was it because he hit their son, and her maternal instincts took over? He regretted hitting their son. Even though their son was a genius the moment their son was born, their son was still only a bit older than a one-year-old. He was angry at their son for almost injuring her, but he should have reasoned with their son and shouldn\u2019t have punished their son using force.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wondered if Yuan Gun Gun dreamt of him in her sleep. He didn\u2019t care if she was having a nightmare about him as long as she didn\u2019t dream of Na Liu Ting Du. He hated himself for saying hurtful things to her out of anger. He would understand if she hated him. It was his fault for destroying their peaceful life together.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che got out of bed, and went to watch over his son.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao opened his eyes the moment he sensed the old man sitting on the chair in front of his bed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ignored his son\u2019s glare. He gently rubbed soothing cream on his son\u2019s red cheek.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao didn\u2019t understand what the old man wanted. He silently let the old man rub cream on his cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little boy, you should know I\u2019m your daddy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><div></div><br/><p>Na Liu Hao stayed silent.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy hit you because you almost injured your mummy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Daddy won\u2019t let anyone harm your mummy, including you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che continued to rub the cream on his son\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little boy, remember you can only use your powers to protect your mummy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You can\u2019t injure your mummy, not even accidentally. Don\u2019t use your powers carelessly before you know how to control your powers.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Stinky old man,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao pointed at the old man\u2019s hand print on his neck.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your neck doesn\u2019t need cream,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It\u2019ll disappear after two days.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want cream on my neck,\u2019 Na Liu Hao insisted.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gently rubbed cream on his son\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was happy the old man listened to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m hungry,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put the soothing cream in a drawer, and held out his arms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy will take you to eat,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao stood up on the bed, and let the old man carry him to eat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, do you really miss Na Liu Ting Du?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy will find him for you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It\u2019s daddy\u2019s way of compensating you for choking you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Na Liu Hao asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then I forgive daddy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was unhappy to let his son see Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du hugged the old man\u2019s neck. He thought at least he and the old man wanted to protect the same person, his mummy.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hated himself for not bringing Yuan Gun Gun home when she ran away. If he brought her home, his relationship with their son wouldn\u2019t be strained. He hoped one day their son would trust him and feel safe under his watch like how he used to feel safe under Hao Yan Que\u2019s watch.</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che fed his son, he put his son to bed and slept in the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>The following morning, Yuan Gun Gun woke up in the arms of Hao Yan Che. For a moment her hand hovered over his angelic sleeping face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, don\u2019t cause trouble,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun remembered how Hao Yan Che treated her and their son a day ago, and retrieved her hand.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 203</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s enough if you stay by my side, and let me take care of you. Why can\u2019t you understand the only thing I\u2019ll ever want is you? Why can\u2019t you see your own appeal? Why can\u2019t you see the spell you put me under?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you mean it?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Yuan Gun Gun, I love you for who you are.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun tightly because he didn\u2019t want her to see him cry. They both loved each other deeply. He regretted wasting years. Why didn\u2019t he tell her that he loved her long ago? He almost lost her because of his foolish pride. Why was he so blind? Why didn\u2019t he understand that someone simple minded like her would have insecurities too? He was wrong to think that all she needed was delicious food to live a comfortable life. It was his fault for not paying attention to how she felt behind her smiles. It was his fault for not worrying if people would gossip about her behind her back. How sad and lonely did she feel every time she wrote DOVE on their clothes and on the furniture in their home? It was his fault for not giving her a sense of security. Why was he so prideful that he didn\u2019t open his mouth to ask her if she loved him?</p><br/><p>\u2018I thought I wouldn\u2019t hear you say you love me even once,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back, and he laughed at himself. It didn\u2019t matter how smart he was, because when it came to love he was the biggest fool. If he didn\u2019t suffer, he wouldn\u2019t have found out how foolish he was.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che grabbed tissues. He wiped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes and nose. Then he gave her a glass of water to drink. After she drank the glass of water, she cried another bucket load.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you all cried out now?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018When did you remember the past?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018When I was nearly run over by a car,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Then two days later, I remembered everything.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I wanted to give you a surprise,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Two years ago why did you leave?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Why did you look for Na Liu Ting Du? Did you want to leave me forever?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, did you know capturing one thousand planes makes your wish come true?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018My wish was to remember my past\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, don\u2019t change the subject,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I tell you then you have to promise me you won\u2019t get angry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No conditions,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018After Bao Bao and I returned home, you behaved strangely,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You stopped nagging and caring about me. You didn\u2019t touch me or want to sleep with me anymore. I thought you didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore, and it made me depressed. That day I was crying in the bathroom. I heard some women say that if your body didn\u2019t let me touch you freely then you wouldn\u2019t even glance at me, and you wouldn\u2019t have married me. In my emotional state I flew to Paris to find big brother Du.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018When I landed in Paris, I regretted leaving,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I wanted to fly home, but I was scared you would hit me. I also forgot to bring money. I got lost, and I called big brother Du. I wanted to see him, and asked him to take me home. It was my unlucky day. I met a thief the moment I landed. The thief wanted to take my bag, but I held onto my bag. The thief pushed me onto the road. You know what happened afterward.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was angry Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t let the thief take her bag. Her safety was more important than a bag.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I know I was wrong. Don\u2019t hit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you such a dummy?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you let the thief take your bag? What\u2019s inside your head? Why did you risk your safety to hang onto your bag? And you were pregnant with our son at the time too!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018But I didn\u2019t know I was pregnant with Hao Hao at the time,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I didn\u2019t care if the thief took my bag. But I had something important in my purse.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What was so important?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to say,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s just something really important.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took out a photo from a drawer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it this?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why is it with you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. She was happy to see the photo of Hao Yan Che sleeping. \u2018I thought the thief took it with my bag.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know whether to hit Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom or hug her forever.</p><br/><p>\u2018I secretly took this photo of you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t be angry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You misunderstood me and ran away,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You were hurting, but you didn\u2019t tell me. How should I punish you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to hit your bottom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to hit me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m pregnant.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018After you give birth to our second child, I\u2019ll hit your bottom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was happy she got a get out of jail free card for nine months.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che bit Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell me who those women were that gossiped about you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s the same woman you fired and publicly declared no one is allowed to hire her,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who else?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No one else,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun lied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Think about it carefully,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s neck, and kissed his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Spare them,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Think about it as giving our baby an extra blessing. Besides, I don\u2019t think anyone will dare to bully me again.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Spare them,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Che, my husband, my young master and my children\u2019s daddy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. She unbuttoned his shirt, and he held her hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand why the first time she took the initiative, Hao Yan Che rejected her.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 210</p><br/>\n</div>"}

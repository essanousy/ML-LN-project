Even if I can\u2019t protect myself, I didn\u2019t ask young master to protect me. I\u2019m someone who likes getting involved in another person\u2019s business. I\u2019m someone who can\u2019t judge my own strengths and weaknesses. I\u2019m sorry if I embarrassed young master. Next time you don\u2019t need to save me, and let me face the consequences of my actions.\u2019</p><br/><p>Han Yan Che clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Congratulations Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Han Yan Che said. \u2018You have guts. I should reward you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun regretted what she said, and took another step back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you stepping away from me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. He slowly stepped toward Yuan Gun Gun. \u2018Are you scared of me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back touched a wall, she had nowhere to escape.</p><br/><p>\u2018How should I reward you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caged Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body between his body and the wall.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was angry at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s recklessness. But he didn\u2019t want to take it out on Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m useless,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t suit being by your side. I know I can\u2019t protect myself and others, and I overestimate my own strengths. But I couldn\u2019t stand by and watch someone insult Qing Qing. You\u2019re right, I\u2019m useless. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the floor and cried on her knees. She looked like a child who was scolded. Hao Yan Che\u2019s anger diminished. He thought the way she looked vulnerable made her endearing.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want me to punish you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun to the bed.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re too noisy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hugged Yuan Gun Gun on the bed, and wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ugly,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom. \u2018Why are you such a dummy by standing still and letting someone hit you? If you want to interfere in another person\u2019s business then you need to go find a mountain to lean on. Understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018At first I wanted to go find someone to help,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018But I didn\u2019t want to see someone hit Qing Qing, and I forgot to get help. Besides, I didn\u2019t know anyone there to ask to help me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know anyone there?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom again. \u2018Don\u2019t you know how to look for me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I know you don\u2019t like interfering in another person\u2019s business,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018So I was too scared to go find you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you know how to beg me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked and bit Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018If I beg you, would you have helped me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Depends on my mood,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then it\u2019ll be useless to beg you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun mumbled. \u2018I\u2019ve lived with you for a long time. I\u2019ve never seen you in a good mood.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s lips hovered over Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. She thought his face was always beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, your face is all red,\u2019 Hao Yan Che teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m not thinking anything weird,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What weird thoughts?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s lips lightly touched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lips. She gulped. He smiled and caressed her back. His lips touched her lips again, and they kissed each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018Right now I\u2019m not in a bad mood,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Ninety-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

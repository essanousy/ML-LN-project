Yuan Gun Gun looked innocently at Long Liu Bao, and they both sighed together.</p><br/><p>The two Long brothers looked at the two little monkeys, and they thought Hao Yan Che\u2019s taste was unique.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about Du Du?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018Du Du and Gun Gun look like sisters.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty is Gun Gun\u2019s mummy,\u2019 Feng Du Du said and beamed.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao received another shock. Impossible. She couldn\u2019t believe the youthful looking Feng Du Du was Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mum.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty\u2026 you look so youthful,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Aunty, you need to share your beauty secret with my mum.\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du held Long Liu Bao\u2019s hands gleefully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked. \u2018Bao Bao is a loveable girl. Bao Bao can come to aunty\u2019s home anytime. Aunty will cook Bao Bao delicious food.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Long brothers were scared to meet another woman living under her husband\u2019s protective wings.</p><br/><p>At Hao Yan\u2019s company, in Hao Yan Che\u2019s office was an icier atmosphere than at Long Wu\u2019s company.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu kept his head bowed. He was too scared to look at Hao Yan Che\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t find her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yi Tu how long have you served me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018You should know me by now.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018But\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You couldn\u2019t turn down her request and disobeyed me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu knelt on the floor and banged his head on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Fortunately for Yi Tu, Long Liu Bo called Hao Yan Che\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, your loveable wife is with us,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be right there,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your lively mother-in-law is here with us too,\u2019 Long Liu Bo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hung up the phone, put on his jacket and called his father-in-law\u2019s phone on the way to the car.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu looked at Hao Yan Che walking out of the office, and he thanked his lucky star that Yuan Gun Gun was found.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not safe yet,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jia Tu, if you were in my shoes, could you say no to Gun Gun?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu silently agreed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun knows how to give someone a headache,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Jia Tu said. \u2018Later it won\u2019t just be your head that aches.\u2019</p><br/><p>While Jia Tu taunted Yi Tu, Hao Yan Che zoomed to Long Wu\u2019s company. Hao Yan Che kicked opened the CEO\u2019s office door. Long Liu Bao instinctively stood in front of Yuan Gun Gun. Yuan Gun Gun was happy to hide behind Long Liu Bao\u2019s back, because Hao Yan Che looked like he wanted to send everyone to their next life.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao looked at the other beautiful man behind Hao Yan Che. She thought the world was unfair to give men with demon souls such beautiful faces.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu strode toward Feng Du Du. Long Liu Bao couldn\u2019t believe Yuan Ting Liu was Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s dad. Yuan Ting Liu looked intimidating like Long Liu Bao\u2019s dad.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked coldly at Long Liu Bao who dared to hide his wife from him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao shivered in fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello big brother Che,\u2019 Long Liu Bao greeted. \u2018How have you been lately? Has business been good? Did you buy a home and got married? If you haven\u2019t it\u2019s time for you to settle down and have babies.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you sure you want to stand here?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao almost bowed and said no sir. She knew if someone was going to hell, it would be her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be reasonable,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hid behind the Long brothers. She knew what books were forbidden like how she knew she couldn\u2019t save Yuan Gun Gun. She could only ask the Long brothers to save Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was unprotected so she sat on the floor in front of Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao looked at her kindred spirit who sat pitifully on the floor. Her kindred spirit\u2019s pitiful state reminded her of herself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little rice ball, stand up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 136</p><br/>\n</div>"}

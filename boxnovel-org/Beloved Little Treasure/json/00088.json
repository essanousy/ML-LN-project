He went to the pig fridge to get pudding and returned to the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Put on clothes and eat pudding.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What clothes?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You ripped my clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened the wardrobe, and chose one of his black shirts for Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018I can\u2019t see my\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and covered her chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let Yuan Gun Gun off the hook. He looked all over the bed. Finally he found Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s black bra under her bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s flattened,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You flattened it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun frowned. Hao Yan Che took a deep breath to stay calm.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you put it on, it won\u2019t be flat anymore,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun blushed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry and put on clothes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che turned around, Yuan Gun Gun put on her black bra and his black shirt.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s too big,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around. Yuan Gun Gun sniffed her pink nose and her small hands were flapping his black shirt sleeves at him. It was like she was tempting him to come tease her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on the bed, and held Yuan Gun Gun on his lap. He caressed her bottom, and felt she was wearing the bottom half of the dress he ripped under his black shirt. He pulled the ripped dress down her milky smooth legs.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiggled her bottom on Hao Yan Che\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018My bottom is cold,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to wear underwear.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che grabbed the pudding and put it in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>With pudding in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands, she forgot about her cold bare bottom. She slowly ate the pudding bite by bite.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought the hearty way Yuan Gun Gun ate the pudding made him suspect she would betray him for dessert. But he didn\u2019t mind keeping her by his side, he considered it as doing a good deed.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want more,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun licked her lips, and gave the empty box to Hao Yan Che. He didn\u2019t say anything, and she pouted her lips.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Tell me how am I going to face everyone again?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018It\u2019s your fault.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che rolled Yuan Gun Gun onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can stay here and cry all night,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go home too,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I don\u2019t want to stay here by myself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun jumped off the bed, ran to Hao Yan Che and held onto his arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018You can stay here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and freed his arm.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re too noisy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go home with you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist like he could only choose to take her home or choose to stay with her.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you don\u2019t cry, I\u2019ll take you home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t see Hao Yan Che smile when she said she wanted to go home with him, because she was hugging his waist from behind.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun let go of Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I don\u2019t want to go outside like this,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018People will misunderstand.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Then you can stay here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s good mood was wiped away by Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s words. Why wasn\u2019t she worried people would misunderstand when she wore Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s shirt home?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around, and quietly got into bed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che left the bedroom, and slammed the door closed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun crawled under the bedsheet, because she remembered the horror movies she watched about victims staying in an office building alone. In the horror movies there were no one else except the victim, but the victim could hear the sounds of typing.</p><br/><p>At nine at night in the Hao Mansion\u2019s study room, Jia Tu and Yi Tu\u2019s weak souls were more scared of Hao Yan Che looking at them coldly than if Hao Yan Che gave them a beating.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you two know how to knock?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, we\u2019re sorry,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018We searched everywhere outside, we couldn\u2019t find Gun Gun so we came back to your office to search and forgot to knock.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you two have problems using your brains, I don\u2019t mind helping you two wake up your brains,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Eighty-Eight</p><br/>\n</div>"}

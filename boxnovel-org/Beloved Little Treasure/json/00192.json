Out of the one hundred floors, she didn\u2019t know why she chose to visit floor fifty-three. She felt like she visited that floor in the past.</p><br/><p>News of CEO Hao bringing a beautiful young woman and his son to his company spread throughout the building within minutes.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held onto Na Liu Hao tightly. She hated hearing the strangers gossiping. She considered going back to Hao Yan Che\u2019s office, but she felt shy around him. So she carried Na Liu Hao and continued walking around floor fifty-three.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a woman\u2019s scream was heard. Yuan Gun Gun turned around. The heavy files fell onto the woman\u2019s feet and blood oozed out of the woman\u2019s high heels.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s violet eyes looked coldly at the drag queen woman sitting on the floor. No one doubted he was his father\u2019s son.</p><br/><p>\u2018You demoness, you dare throw objects at me!\u2019 the woman said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked innocently at the woman. She didn\u2019t know what the woman was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u2018Slut!\u2019 the woman said.</p><br/><p>The woman picked up a glass vase and threw it at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face. The glass vase froze when it was a few centimetres away from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face. Then it was flung back to the woman\u2019s face, and the woman\u2019s forehead bled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out. She put Na Liu Hao on the floor, and ran to the woman. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Only Yuan Gun Gun knew Na Liu Hao had powers on that floor.</p><br/><p>The woman pushed Yuan Gun Gun away. The woman raised an arm, Yuan Gun Gun covered her face, and the woman slapped Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun cried out, and a knife flew toward the woman\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, no!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun leapt onto Na Liu Hao\u2019s body. The knife fell onto the woman\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The woman screamed, and the employees around her panicked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao, how can you do this?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao scoffed. It was the woman\u2019s fault for wanting to harm his mummy.</p><div></div><br/><p>Feng Ting pushed through the crowd. She helped Yuan Gun Gun stand up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heavens!\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018Gun Gun, is it really you? Are you OK?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting hugged Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, it\u2019s really you,\u2019 Feng Ting said. \u2018I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re back. Dummy, why did you leave?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body tensed. She didn\u2019t know what to say to the strange woman hugging her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Director Feng, there\u2019s a woman injured,\u2019 an employee said and pointed at the woman bleeding on the floor.</p><br/><p>Feng Ting let go of Yuan Gun Gun and she looked coldly at the woman on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u2018Call the ambulance,\u2019 Feng Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Get out of the way!\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao,\u2019 the employees greeted.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked to Yuan Gun Gun. She saw him and wanted to cry. He hugged her and stroked her back.</p><br/><p>The employees were scared of Hao Yan Che\u2019s gentleness.</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>The woman on the floor cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018CEO Hao, look what Yuan Gun Gun did to me,\u2019 the woman lied.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che only cared if Yuan Gun Gun was safe.</p><br/><p>\u2018What about all the things you did?\u2019 Feng Ting asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister, what are you talking about?\u2019 the woman asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know?\u2019 Feng Ting asked. \u2018Miss Yang, don\u2019t you have a good memory?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Ting didn\u2019t want to waste her breath talking to Yang Wen.</p><br/><p>Yang Wen\u2019s tears smudged her thick makeup.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che covered Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why would Yuan Gun Gun do this to you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018How did Yuan Gun Gun injure you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Yang Wen said. \u2018CEO Hao, believe me, Yuan Gun Gun did this to me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Did anyone see Yuan Gun Gun injure this woman?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 192</p><br/>\n</div>"}

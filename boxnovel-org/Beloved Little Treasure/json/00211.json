Usually Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t want to do sleep with him too many times a night. But when she couldn\u2019t, she wanted to sleep with him.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re pregnant,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t we do it if I\u2019m pregnant?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I thought we can.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled the bedsheet over his body and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018We can\u2019t,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>When Hao Yan Che thought Yuan Gun Gun was sleeping, her hand became restless again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, what are you doing?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you angry?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I only want to help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled Hao Yan Che\u2019s underpants down, and massaged his erection.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let me help you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun remembered the play girl magazines and DVDs Long Liu Bao showed her two years ago. She practiced what she learnt on Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che enjoyed being pleasured by Yuan Gun Gun. He was happy she wasn\u2019t shy as she used to be in the past.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun saw Hao Yan Che closed his eyes. She pulled the bedsheet to the side, and her mouth engulfed him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You\u2019re not enjoying it?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know what to say. He liked the feel of her mouth, but he preferred pleasuring her.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Then don\u2019t interrupt me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Don\u2019t make me tire my mouth in vain.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth enclosed him again, and she licked his shaft.</p><br/><p>A while later, Hao Yan Che grunted, he pulled Yuan Gun Gun to his shoulder and spilled on the bedspread. He rubbed her wet lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t need to,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Are you OK?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018If you won\u2019t so big then my mouth wouldn\u2019t be as tired.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know what to do about Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018The truth is I wanted to do this to you that night,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I got to do it tonight. It wasn\u2019t a waste for me to watch the DVDs Bao Bao showed me two years ago.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What else did Long Liu Bao do to corrupt you behind my back\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, I want you to answer me honestly,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ask me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If your body didn\u2019t accept me touching you, would you have married me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want to answer a foolish hypothetical question.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, would you love me even if your body couldn\u2019t stand me touching you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, don\u2019t think about nonsense,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018There are no ifs. Don\u2019t ever think I love you because I don\u2019t have a choice. If I didn\u2019t love you, I wouldn\u2019t think about marrying you and having children with you. Before I met you, I prepared myself to live alone for the rest of my life. I never thought one day I would meet you, fall in love with you and if you left me, you would take my soul with you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand over his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want you to ever doubt that you belong here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Only you will ever live here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead. She smiled, closed her eyes and knew she would have a beautiful dream that night.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun sleep in the dark. He finally understood how happy his parents were together.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 211</p><br/>\n</div>"}

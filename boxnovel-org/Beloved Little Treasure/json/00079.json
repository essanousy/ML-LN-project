His rice ball was lying on the bed. She had kicked the bedsheet below her feet, and looked like she was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard the door open, she sat up on the bed and anticipated Hao Yan Che coming to bed. But he ignored her and walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun got out of bed, and went to stand in front of the closed bathroom door. She didn\u2019t know what she wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sensed Yuan Gun Gun was standing behind the bathroom door, he opened it and looked coldly at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to be a peeping tom?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head. She was disappointed Hao Yan Che looked at her coldly. Her shoulders slumped, she turned around and walked back to the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go ask someone to boil eggs,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and closed the bathroom door.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked back to the bathroom door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to eat boiled eggs or fried eggs?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018How many eggs do you want to eat?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened the bathroom door again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Boil eggs!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was startled, and she ran outside to find someone to boil eggs. After she left, he slammed the bathroom door closed.</p><br/><p>When Yuan Gun Gun returned to the master bedroom, Hao Yan Che was drying his hair with a towel on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held a bowl of boiled eggs and walked to the bed. Hao Yan Che pulled her onto the bed, he put the bowl of boiled eggs on the bedside table and rolled a boiled egg on her swollen cheek.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at Hao Yan Che\u2019s beautiful face, and thought about Mrs Chen\u2019s words. Did the beautiful man in front of her truly liked her? Was she someone special to him? She smiled like a fool at him.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you smiling about?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, am I someone special to you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re the most special person in the world,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019re a special dummy. Other dummies can\u2019t compare to your low intelligence.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun became a deflated balloon. Hao Yan Che rolled the egg on her cheek until it turned cold. Then he put another egg in her hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your reward,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun absentmindedly put the egg in her mouth. Hao Yan Che reached for the soothing cream, and applied it on her face.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun bit half the egg, and gave the other half to Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tastes bad,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at her like he was asking her if he looked like a rubbish bin. She quickly put the other half of the egg in her mouth.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put the cream away and went to the bathroom to wash his hands. Yuan Gun Gun took out the egg in her mouth, put it in the bin and used a tissue to hide the egg.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che returned to the bed, turned off the light and laid next to Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Seconds later, Yuan Gun Gun poked Hao Yan Che\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, why aren\u2019t you hugging me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che ignored Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hug me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you going to hug me or not?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll hug you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and hugged Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t see Hao Yan Che smile in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want to take revenge for him?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen explained your body doesn\u2019t let other people touch you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Now I know you didn\u2019t mean to hit big brother Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m special to you because I can touch you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said proudly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know who else can touch me besides you?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Animals,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you know what this implies?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re no different from an animal,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Seventy-Nine</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Han Yan Che gave her a warning look, and she opened her mouth. He fed her the broth, and her eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, it tastes delicious,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently fed Yuan Gun Gun the whole bowl of broth, spoon by spoon. Afterward he wiped her mouth, took the tray away and returned with a box of chocolates.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes turned into love hearts at the sight of chocolates.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put the box of chocolates in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re only allowed to eat three chocolates,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged the box of chocolates. Hao Yan Che\u2019s brows creased and he walked to the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, where are you going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018To the study room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you need anything, call aunty Chen.\u2019</p><br/><p>After Hao Yan Che left, Yuan Gun Gun opened the box of chocolates. She unwrapped a chocolate, put it in her mouth and it melted deliciously in her mouth. She couldn\u2019t resist unwrapping another chocolate\u2026 moments later, she felt like she was struck by lightning. An image of Hao Yan Che\u2019s violet eyes looking at the empty box of chocolates in her hands made her whole body shiver.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped her hands to get rid of the evidence. Then she carefully rewrapped the wrappers and put them inside the empty box. She was thankful her mummy taught her what to do if she accidently ate too many chocolates.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the phone rang, and startled Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello\u2026 big brother Due!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun greeted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes it\u2019s me,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Have you been well?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018What about everyone?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone is healthy,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Are you sure you don\u2019t want to go to school? Is it because of what happened? Do you want me to change schools for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master won\u2019t let me go to school,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du was unhappy to hear Yuan Gun Gun mention Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, are you there?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018What do you do now?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Young master hired a teacher to home school me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My teacher is training me how to be a secretary.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Na Li Ting Du asked. He gripped the phone. \u2018How are you studies?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My teacher praises me. She said I\u2019m a good student.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Of course my Gun Gun is a good student,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, if you\u2019re free come here to see me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I get to escort my teacher to her car at five every afternoon. I really miss big brother Du.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018In two days I\u2019ll come and see you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, do you have to go now?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. He pictured Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sad puppy eyes and smiled. \u2018I have work to do.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Remember to come to see me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I will,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, hang up first,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du chuckled and hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was excited she would get to see Na Liu Ting Du soon. She laid on the bed and watched TV.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che returned to the master bedroom at ten at night. His brows creased at the sight of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s teary eyes staring at the TV.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you crying?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you\u2019re back,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stop crying,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stretched her arms toward Hao Yan Che. Yuan Gun Gun wanting him to hug her made his anger disappear. He laid on the bed and hugged her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you crying?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Do you have a stomach ache?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m watching a movie called ten rules between dog and me. It\u2019s a really moving sad story.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che inwardly sighed. His rice ball cried over a movie.</p><br/><p>\u2018The dog and the owner have ten rules with each other,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s really sad when the dog died.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What rules?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun recited the ten rules to Hao Yan Che:</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Seventy-Three</p><br/>\n</div>"}

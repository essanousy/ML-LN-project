He opened the drawer, it wasn\u2019t locked and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s passport was missing. If the first time Yuan Gun Gun ran away was influenced by Long Liu Bao then the second time Yuan Gun Gun ran away meant Yuan Gun Gun truly wanted to leave him. Did he change too late?</p><br/><p>Yi Tu knocked on the study room door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master,\u2019 Yi Tu called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu thought Hao Yan Che looked depressed like the first time Yuan Gun Gun ran away.</p><br/><p>\u2018Did you find Gun Gun?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018I even went to the Yuan Mansion. No one has seen her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you know why?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because she ran away,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s voice sounded detached like he was talking about something that didn\u2019t involve him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I don\u2019t want to fall any deeper.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che said the words more to himself than Yi Tu. Hao Yan Che closed his eyes. If Yuan Gun Gun truly wanted to leave him, he should let her go. Letting her go was letting himself go. He was always meant to be alone. She was a short dream in his forever life. He needed to wake up and face his reality alone.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, you shouldn\u2019t say that,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Gun Gun\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018In the future don\u2019t mention Yuan Gun Gun in front of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s voice shook the room.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu covered his ears, and left the room.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned off the lights, and sat alone in the dark.</p><div></div><br/><p>At Paris, Yuan Gun Gun walked around the airport. She was scared to be in a foreign place by herself. She regretted leaving home. Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t care about her, he wouldn\u2019t look for her. She wiped her tears, it was clear he didn\u2019t want to see her anymore.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun held the phone Na Liu Ting Du gave her as a wedding gift, and contemplated whether to call Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>In New York, Na Liu Ting Du was signing a contract with Chang Quan Rui.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Chang, I\u2019m happy to collaborate with you,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I look forward to be the host next time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s my privilege,\u2019 Chang Quan Rui said. \u2018Next time you\u2019re in Beijing, come visit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I will,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019ll escort you out.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du opened the meeting room door for Chang Quan Rui.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 Chang Quan Rui said. \u2018Bye.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du looked out the window. The New York City view was beautiful, but he felt lonely. He picked up his phone, and wanted to call Yuan Gun Gun but hesitated like usual. Suddenly he received a phone call from Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s voice for the first time after she married Hao Yan Che. It was bitter sweet, and she sobbed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, what happened?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked. \u2018Don\u2019t scare me. Why are you crying?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du ran to the parking lot.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Don\u2019t cry. Tell me what happened.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018I\u2019m coming home now to help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, where are you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m in New York,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018But I\u2019m not in New York,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m in Paris,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked. \u2018You\u2019re in Paris?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re in Paris by yourself,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 164</p><br/>\n</div>"}

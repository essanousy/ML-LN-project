He was going to give his little rice ball a good talk that night.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018My little treasure, let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said in a scary gentle voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2026 today I want to stay here with Bao Bao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said let\u2019s go home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes Che,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked slowly toward Hao Yan Che. He lifted her in his arms, wrapped her legs around his waist and carried her like she was his little treasure.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your big brother Che is taking his little treasure home,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Take care my loveable little sister Liu Bao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s scary smile made Long Liu Bao shivered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye big brother Che,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018When you\u2019re free bring Gun Gun here to play.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll try,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018But I have a feeling starting from today my little treasure will be busy for a whole year.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried his little treasure to the car, and Long Liu Bao prayed for Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s life. Long Liu Bao hoped Yuan Gun Gun would accept her own fate caused by her own mouth.</p><br/><p>Later at the Hao Mansion in the living room, Hao Yan Che\u2019s little treasure was happy to see his parents sitting on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mummy, daddy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go to our room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018I want to stay here and spend time with mummy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go to our room,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pouted her lips, and walked to the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Che, I know Jia Tao did the wrong thing,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018But you\u2019re too cruel.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on a chair.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, do you think I\u2019m too cruel?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it true?\u2019 Qiu Li Luo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s true you married the wrong man,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you married a gentle and caring man then you wouldn\u2019t give birth to a son like me. I have no control over the genes I inherited.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che!\u2019 Qiu Li Luo called.</p><br/><p>\u2018Darling son, are you causing trouble?\u2019 Hao Yan Que asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I only wanted her to taste what she wanted to do to Yuan Gun Gun but couldn\u2019t,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Do you still think it\u2019s too cruel? Everything that happened to her is everything she prepared to torture your precious daughter-in-law.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo and Hao Yan Que couldn\u2019t refute Hao Yan Che\u2019s reasoning.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Che, but Gun Gun is safe,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018Why couldn\u2019t you spare Qiang Jia Tao this one time\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018My darling mum, are you sure I didn\u2019t give her a chance?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Mum, have you forgotten I said there won\u2019t be a second time?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que held the crying Qiu Li Luo on his lap.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che, watch your attitude toward your mum,\u2019 Hao Yan Que warned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018It looks like mum wants Yuan Gun Gun to be injured so mum can cry in front of Qiang Jia Tao and tell Qiang Jia Tao how cruel she is.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I would never want Gun Gun to be harmed,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>The sound of a fallen vase was heard. Behind the fallen vase was Yuan Gun Gun. Hao Yan Che caught her before she could escape.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun it looks like your life is too comfortable lately,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2026,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it because you don\u2019t understand what it means to go to our room or you want to see if I\u2019ll whip you to death?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun bowed her head to avoid Hao Yan Che\u2019s cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mum, dad, I need to go make the next generation with my wife,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You two are free to stay here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t wait for his parents\u2019 reaction. He carried his dummy little rice ball to their bedroom.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo hugged her husband.</p><br/><p>\u2018If in the past I didn\u2019t bring Qiang Jia Tao here then today would never have happened,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>\u2018In this world there is no such thing as undoing the past,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018She has to deal with the consequences of her actions.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo didn\u2019t understand why love made Qiang Jia Tao lose her own conscience. How did the sweet and innocent Qiang Jia Tao turn spiteful and vicious to the point of wanting to make Hao Yan Che\u2019s woman suffer?</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 141</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Knowing you, I thought you wouldn\u2019t let your wife out of the bedroom for half a year. I guess I don\u2019t know you that well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The Long Household\u2019s little princess is remarkable,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Bao?\u2019 Long Liu Lang asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018How is she involved?\u2019 the Long brothers asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che played with the werewolf ring on his thumb, and he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018She taught my wife how to make me happy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Make you happy?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked. \u2018How?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Like teaching my wife to touch, bite and lick a bit,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>The Long brothers narrowed their eyes.

Even if you can\u2019t wear the pants after you return home, at least you got to go on a holiday.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks, and took out a bag from a cupboard.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s in the bag?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s to make them sleep,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to put it in their food?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018If they don\u2019t sleep, how are we going to escape?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018But Che has a strong sense of smell,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Time for Plan B. Gun Gun, we only have one chance. We\u2019ll bolt out the back door through the kitchen, and run to the car I prepared. The driver will take us to the airport, and we\u2019ll be free. Understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang put a letter on the kitchen bench.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, what\u2019s in the letter?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018A letter for them to read,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang and Yuan Gun Gun ran to the car, and the driver drove them to the airport.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, where are we going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Las Vegas,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>On hour later, the three monsters became suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why haven\u2019t they come out of the kitchen?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll go check,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang walked into the kitchen and cursed. The kitchen was empty, and he understood what happened.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bo and Hao Yan Che heard Long Liu Lang\u2019s curse, and they entered the kitchen too.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che was the first to notice the letter on the kitchen bench:</p><br/><p>Dear big brother Lang, big brother Bo and big brother Che,</p><br/><p>Your oppressiveness is too overbearing, which is why I\u2019m running away with the loveable Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Big brother Bo, remembered you praised me and said I can protect you and big brother Lang on my own. So protecting myself and Gun Gun won\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>Big brother Bo, I used the card you gave me to fund plane tickets for me and Gun Gun. Thank you for funding our escape.</p><br/><p>If you men want to trace the transactions on the card, it\u2019s going to take time. I transferred money from the card to another card to buy the plane tickets. I got the card from the black market using a false identity.</p><br/><p>Gun Gun and I are independent women. We don\u2019t belong to anyone. We\u2019re not your pets that you men can bully anytime you want.</p><br/><p>If you men want to curse then go ahead and curse. After you men learn how to be less selfish, and treat us decently then come and find us. If it\u2019s impossible for you men to change for the better then let go of us.</p><br/><p>Big brother Che, I promise I\u2019ll sacrifice my own life to protect your little treasure.</p><br/><p>Finally, don\u2019t worry and trust me.</p><br/><p>Bye from your precious darling littler sister Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 156</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then she got out of bed and walked to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che felt Yuan Gun Gun leave the bed. He woke up and followed her to the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quickly brushed her teeth, and ignored Hao Yan Che brushing his teeth next to her. He knew she didn\u2019t want to be in the same room as him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s elbow.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you not want to see me this much?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at the ceiling like she couldn\u2019t hear Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018About yesterday\u2026\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s my mistake,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Hao Hao and I shouldn\u2019t have come to your home. Right now I only want to take Hao Hao to my daddy\u2019s home. Mr Hao, I know you\u2019re the king of your world. But I\u2019m only an ordinary woman. As an ordinary woman, I\u2019m begging you to let go of me and Hao Hao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wanted to say sorry to Yuan Gun Gun, but she threw water back at his face. In the last two years, she became more stubborn than him.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you going to do if I don\u2019t let you go?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, I\u2019m not going to let you leave me again,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you listen to me, I\u2019ll let you see our son. If you keep opposing me then I can make you suffer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put his and Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s toothbrushes down. He held her chin and kissed her lips that she bit.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s rough kiss made Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s heart hurt. He bit her lips hard, let go of her lips and he wiped blood off his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you keep opposing me, you\u2019ll only end up being injured,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che suppressed his desire to hug Yuan Gun Gun and comfort her. He turned around and left the bathroom.</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the bathroom floor. She wiped blood and tears off her face. She realised Hao Yan Che was capable of being cruel or gentle on a whim. He knew how to make her live in hell. But why didn\u2019t she hate him?</p><br/><p>Two days past, and the atmosphere inside the Hao Mansion was tensed like when Yuan Gun Gun was gone.</p><br/><p>In the study room Hao Yan Che knocked everything off the desk. He didn\u2019t know who taught Yuan Gun Gun to be stubborn and unreasonable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, if you want to reconcile with Gun Gun, I have a way,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who said I want to reconcile with her?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I mean Gun Gun wants to reconcile with young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018She needs young master to give her a ladder to climb down.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you want to say?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, why don\u2019t you use Gun Gun\u2019s fear of ghosts to your advantage again?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thought it was embarrassing for everyone to know he would resort to childish tactics to get Yuan Gun Gun to pay attention to him again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go prepare everything,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>At night a full moon shone through the master bedroom window. Yuan Gun Gun thought she saw a reflection of a white dress on the TV screen. She told herself it was only the moon\u2019s reflection.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che sat on a chair and pretended to read reports. He was unhappy Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t jump into his arms. When did she become stronger? He missed the Yuan Gun Gun who used to rely on him.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun chanted to herself, it was the moon\u2019s reflection and not the dead maid from room seventy-four.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 204</p><br/>\n</div>"}

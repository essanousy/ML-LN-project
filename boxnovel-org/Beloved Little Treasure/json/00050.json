Hao Yan Che turned around, hunched over and knocked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who are you calling?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You won\u2019t pay attention to me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who do you think you are?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kicked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stand up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked pitifully a Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stand up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018My legs are numb,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t want to knock Yan Gun Gun\u2019s head again. He pulled her up, and helped her walk back to the pink bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go wash up,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chin. \u2018Can\u2019t you hear me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun mumbled under her breath.</p><br/><p>\u2018What did you say?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I said if you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll go to the bathroom,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun saw Hao Yan Che\u2019s raised arm, she protected her head and ran to the bathroom. He took out the first aid kit from a drawer and waited for her on the pink bed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun brushed, showered and changed clothes. She ran out of the bathroom before drying her hair to see if Hao Yan Che was still in her bedroom. She was relieved to see he didn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go dry your hair,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quickly dried her hair in front of the vanity table, and sat next to Hao Yan Che on the pink bed. He pushed her on the bed, grabbed the first aid kid and gently rubbed cream on her swollen left cheek.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che packed the first aid kit, put it back in the drawer and stood to leave. Yuan Gun Gun held onto his shirt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, where are you going?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around and he looked coldly at Yuan Gun Gun.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have falsely accused you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I misunderstood you, because of what you said\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Let go of my shirt,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know what to say or do.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pushed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand off his shirt.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the future, you\u2019re only responsible for cooking three meals a day,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018The rest of the time is your free time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying in the future I don\u2019t need to be with you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t misunderstand,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019ll always be just a maid. You don\u2019t have the right to be with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand pressed against her chest, and she watched Hao Yan Che leave. She should be happy she didn\u2019t have to follow Hao Yan Che around all day and endure his mood swings. Her heart wouldn\u2019t listen, it felt like someone stabbed a needle through her heart.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked to the study room, and poured a glass of red wine. He drank the red wine, and it past down his hollow heart. He didn\u2019t want to have a weakness. He couldn\u2019t keep letting Yuan Gun Gun make him worry about her if he didn\u2019t see her, keep treating her like she was someone special and keep wanting to be with her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che smashed the glass of wine onto the floor, and covered his eyes. Why did he feel frustrated whenever he didn\u2019t see her?</p><br/><p>\u2018Little Chub, why are you hateful?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked himself.</p><br/><p>Outside, Yuan Gun Gun sat in the garden and absent-mindedly stroked her small friends\u2019 little bodies.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao called. She shook Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulders. \u2018Gun Gun.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh, big sister Jia Tao,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Fifty</p><br/>\n</div>"}

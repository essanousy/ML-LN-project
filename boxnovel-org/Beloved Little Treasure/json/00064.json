Hao Yan Che held her face, and kissed her irresistible lips. He let go of her when she stopped breathing.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you use your nose for?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Breathing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then why aren\u2019t you using your nose to breathe?\u2019 Hao Yan Che teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018I forgot\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun thought it was impossible for her to remember to breathe whenever Hao Yan Che kissed her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che caressed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face. She wasn\u2019t an eloquent speaker, but he loved her being herself. Was it a symptom of love? He contemplated whether he would be charmed by another woman like her, and felt repulsed. The only woman he wanted to be intimate with was Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t do this together,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My mum told me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who do you belong to?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Have you forgotten?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun remembered what happened at the hospital. She covered her face and ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m yours,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 Han Yan Che said. \u2018Between me and your mum, who can make decisions for you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Me\u2026 I mean young master,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed and looked around the pink bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your room is messy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Pack up your belongings.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying I can go home?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che knocked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to see what happens if you mention going home again?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Then why do I need to pack?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re moving rooms,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018To where?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was attached to the pink bedroom, she didn\u2019t want to move bedrooms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master bedroom,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018Master bedroom? But the master bedroom belongs to you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently looked at the dummy in the pink bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you saying you want to swap rooms with me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s patience was running out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Am I wrong?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re sharing a room together,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You and me\u2026 sharing a room together?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mind sharing a room with a dummy,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ow\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hurry up and pack,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Seconds later, Hao Yan Che got a headache watching Yuan Gun Gun make the pink bedroom messier.</p><br/><p>\u2018Now I know why a dummy shouldn\u2019t pack,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll ask someone to pack for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, the meals are cooked,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Help Yuan Gun Gun pack her belongings. Then ask someone to help you move her belongings to the master bedroom.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting bowed and smiled at Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let me pack,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll only make the room messier,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting happily watched Yuan Gun Gun and Hao Yan Che walk outside together. Unlike Yuan Gun Gun, Chen Jia Ting understood why Hao Yan Che wanted Yuan Gun Gun to move to the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>In the dining room, Yuan Gun Gun looked sadly at the food on the dining table. She was going to be used as guinea pig to test if there was poison in the food again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Everyone go outside,\u2019 Hao Yan Che ordered.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pulled Yuan Gun Gun onto his lap. She didn\u2019t know why he liked to hug her to eat. But she loved his body scent, and his warm embrace. Most importantly when he hugged her, she didn\u2019t feel he hated her.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Sixty-Four</p><br/>\n</div>"}

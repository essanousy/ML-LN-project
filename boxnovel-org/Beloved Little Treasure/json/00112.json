She thought he was going to kick down another door. But she felt something heavy jumped onto the bed, and something scratched her back. She couldn\u2019t stand being touched by Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t touch me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and was happily surprised to see a snow white werewolf. The werewolf took up more than half the giant bed. The werewolf\u2019s tail was white and long, and its eyes were violet and arrogant like a king.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Li?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t think it was Qiu Li Luo, because the werewolf on the bed was bigger than Qiu Li Luo and had cold violet eyes instead of Qiu Li Luo\u2019s warm violet eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young\u2026 master?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>The werewolf growled, and its violet eyes looked at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes without blinking.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed the werewolf\u2019s cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>The werewolf stuck out its tongue and wagged its long white tail.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed the werewolf\u2019s back, neck and legs. She smiled for the first time in days.</p><br/><p>The werewolf let Yuan Gun Gun touched it and hug it. If she looked at its face, she could see it raising its eyebrows and twitching its nose.</p><br/><p>A long time later, Yuan Gun Gun had enough fun playing with the werewolf and remembered she was angry. She laid back in bed, and turned her back toward the werewolf.</p><br/><p>The werewolf was unhappy Yuan Gun Gun ignored it after she had her fun. Its paws pushed her back. She continued to ignore it so its paws pushed her head and bottom. Then its front right paw pushed her shoulder and its front left paw rubbed her chest.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Hey\u2026 you\u2019re playing dirty,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>The werewolf wagged its tail happily. Each time Yuan Gun Gun held onto its invasive paw, it would use a different paw to rub her chest and bottom.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re bullying me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>The werewolf\u2019s paws stopped rubbing Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du is my big brother,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019ll always see him as my big brother. That night he overpowered me, kissed me and left marks on me. But you forced yourself on my body, and accused me of seducing you and big brother Du. Why can\u2019t you see the difference between right and wrong? How can you be cruel to me this way?\u2019</p><br/><p>The werewolf\u2019s paws rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks like its paws were wiping her tears. The werewolf curled next to her on the bed, its head rubbed her neck and it howled softly.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged the werewolf\u2019s neck and cried on its head.</p><br/><p>The werewolf waited for Yuan Gun Gun to cry herself to sleep. Then a bright white light emitted from the werewolf\u2019s body and it changed into a naked Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead, got out of bed and put on clothes.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Yuan Gun Gun woke up on Hao Yan Che\u2019s chest. She rubbed her eyes, remembered about last night and felt embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun and Hao Yan Che shared a long awkward silence.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked around the bed, and pointed at the broken bedhead.</p><br/><p>\u2018You broke this,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and looked everywhere else except at Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 112</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although Hao Yan Che was a stranger to her, she couldn\u2019t deny their blood ran through their son\u2019s veins.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t pull daddy\u2019s hair,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and pinched Na Liu Hao\u2019s round bottom.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao bit Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Hao is kissing you,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He rarely kisses anyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pushed his son\u2019s face away, and he pointed at his son\u2019s teeth mark on his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Look at my face,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Does it look like our son kissed me? Our son bit me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun laughed awkwardly. She wanted to hold the mischievous Na Liu Hao but Hao Yan Che wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che wiped his son\u2019s saliva off his face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go change your clothes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019ll change our little demon son\u2019s clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018No need,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You can go change your clothes. I\u2019ll change Hao Hao\u2019s clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll change our son\u2019s clothes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Since Na Liu Hao didn\u2019t protest, Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head and went to change her clothes.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried his son to his son\u2019s bedroom. He put his son on the bed, and chose a black outfit for his son.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che struggled to unbutton his son\u2019s small shirt buttons.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t move,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dummy,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che waved his hand and his son\u2019s clothes were teared to pieces.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao put his hands in front of his underwear, and his face turned angry violet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy is sorry he forgot to take off your underwear,\u2019 Hao Yan Che teased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go outside!\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che crossed his arms and smiled at his son\u2019s violet face.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao ignored the old man.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened a drawer and took out black underwear.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Do you want daddy to help you change your clothes or do you want to do it yourself?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do it myself,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che shrugged his shoulders, and politely turned around.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao\u2019s face changed back to his natural complexion. He changed his clothes quickly, sat on the bed and glared at the old man\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned around and played with his son\u2019s chubby cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little boy, remember daddy\u2019s advice,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018When we\u2019re outside, you can\u2019t use your powers or turn your face violet when you\u2019re angry. The world isn\u2019t tolerant of different people like us. Understand?\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao turned his face away from the old man, and the old man walked outside.</p><br/><p>A while later, Hao Yan Che carried his son downstairs where Yuan Gun Gun was waiting for them.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled at Hao Yan Che. Hao Yan Che held her hand and carried their son in his other arm. She thought she must have loved Hao Yan Che deeply in the past, because she liked being with him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little demon, where do you want to go?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Anywhere,\u2019 Na Liu Hao said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che turned to look at Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to go shopping?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Perhaps you want to go to the zoo or the amusement park.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go to the places we went together in the past,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019ve been to many places together,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Where do you want to go?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Mmm\u2026 I want to go to the places we went together the most in the past,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018We were usually at home together or we were at work together the most,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Let\u2019s go to your company.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018First we\u2019ll go for a walk to help you digest food so you can eat more later.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put his son on the floor, and held his son\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Son, you need to walk and digest your food too,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Hao was happy to walk on his own two feet.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen silently cried happy tears to see Hao Yan Che walk with his wife and son. Mrs Chen hoped the little boy Hao Yan Che would learn to be a good husband and a good father, and that he would always be happy together with his family.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 190</p><br/>\n</div>"}

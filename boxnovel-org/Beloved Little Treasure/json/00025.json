At home, her family loved her. Even the cold Yuan Ting Liu didn\u2019t raise his voice when he spoke to her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. Who wanted to be Hao Yan Che\u2019s maid? If Hao Yan Che punished her because she was chubby then he should ask Mrs Chen to find someone else to be his maid. If Hao Yan Che hated her because of her chubby body then she hated his handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun turned around and saw a young woman with short hair smiling at her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m Qiang Jia Tao,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said. \u2018You can call me Jia Tao.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun wiped her tears.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do you want to see me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t close the door,\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao said. \u2018I heard you crying.\u2019</p><br/><p>Qiang Jia Tao passed Yuan Gun Gun tissues, and Yuan Gun Gun blew her nose.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I forgot to close the door.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019 Qiang Jia Tao asked. \u2018Did young master punish you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun hugged Qiang Jia Tao\u2019s neck and cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand him,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He\u2019s a bully. He asked me to make twenty dishes in one hour. I had to ask big sister Ting to help me. He ate one mouthful and said the food tastes bad. But yesterday he ate a lot of the same food. He made me clean as a punishment. If he finds dust where I cleaned, he\u2019ll ask someone to whip me. He bullies me because my chubby body is an eyesore. Jia Tao, do you think I want to be chubby?

Qiang Jia Tao fisted her hands and left his bedroom.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked into room thirty-five. Yuan Gun Gun was sleeping on the bed in the shape of a little ball, and hugging a pillow. Her sleeping position exposed her white underwear. He looked around the room, it was messier than he remembered.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun slept soundly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun!\u2019 Hao Yan Che called.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che poked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s face to wake her up, but she grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tastes delicious,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laid on the bed next to Yuan Gun Gun. She hugged his waist and purred like a little kitten. Her body felt soft like she didn\u2019t have any bones.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun and kicked her off the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun cried out. She opened her eyes. \u2018Young master?\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che scoffed. Who else did Yuan Gun Gun think was lying on the bed with her?</p><br/><p>\u2018Why did you kick me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. She rubbed her sore body. \u2018It hurts.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You have guts, giving orders to my servants,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun knew Hao Yan Che would find out Qiang Jia Tao helped her clean last night.

Don\u2019t think you\u2019re the mistress in my home. Here you\u2019re nobody.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t know why he was wasting his time with Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s eyes stung and she lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t bother crying,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Your tears are not going to work on me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quietly cried.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re is right,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What did I say to you yesterday?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che didn\u2019t understand why Yuan Gun Gun looked loveable in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t hold back her sadness. She sat on the floor and cried like an abandoned child.</p><br/><p>\u2018I did my best\u2026 don\u2019t hit me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Be quiet,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun covered her mouth and looked at him pitifully.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said and patted the bed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you coming?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun sat on the bed. Hao Yan Che hugged her, and looked at her adorable face.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re really ugly,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun lowered her head to avoid seeing Hao Yan Che\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chin, wiped her tears off her face and let go of her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was awestruck again by the scary monster\u2019s beautiful face.</p><br/><p>\u2018What are you looking at?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked down and twiddled her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u2018How many rooms did you clean?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018One,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun confessed.</p><br/><p>\u2018For the whole night, you only cleaned this room?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Look how messy this room is. Are you lazy or you deliberately made this room messier? Do you want to defy me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m not lazy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said softly. \u2018I promise I did my best to clean this room.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If you did your best to clean this room, what happens when you don\u2019t put effort into cleaning?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Will my home be destroyed by you?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why her best efforts to clean turned into a pig sty. Last night after she cleaned everything in the room, she carried a vase to replace the flowers and tripped. Qiang Jia Tao avoided getting wet, but Qiang Jia Tao knocked over a bookshelf and more than thirty books fell on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You can punish me but don\u2019t hit me. I\u2019m scared of pain.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Go wash up and cook breakfast,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not angry?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled, she got out of bed and walked toward the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Why are there bruises on your legs?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Last night, I was nearly squashed to death by the fallen books\u2026 and the vase\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You deserve it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Go wash your face and brush your hair. You don\u2019t need to strut in front of me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do I still need to cook breakfast\u2026 hehe\u2026 I\u2019ll go\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun leave the room. He didn\u2019t understand why Yuan Gun Gun was someone special to him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Twenty-Five to Twenty-Six</p><br/>\n</div>"}

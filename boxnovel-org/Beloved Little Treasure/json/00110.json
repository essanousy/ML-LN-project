There were another man\u2019s markings on her breast.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du\u2026 he\u2026 I\u2026 he,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun mumbled. \u2018It\u2019s not what you think.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What about kissing lips?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. He held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s throat. \u2018Is it a custom for you to kiss other men\u2019s lips goodbye?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You saw?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t just see,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I saw clearly. Why didn\u2019t you two do it in the car like how we did it together last night?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked down and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che let go of Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s neck. He walked to the door, kicked the door open and walked outside.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun curled up on the bed and cried. She wished the person she liked was Na Liu Ting Du instead of Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>One week later, Yuan Gun Gun became abnormally quiet. She only talked if someone asked her a question. Other times she laid in bed and watched TV.</p><br/><p>On the following Monday, Yuan Ting Liu called Yuan Gun Gun and told her that Na Liu Ting Du moved to Paris. Na Liu Ting Du asked Yuan Ting Liu to pass on a message to Yuan Gun Gun. Na Liu Ting Du wanted Yuan Gun Gun to be happy, and he would buy her French chocolates when he came back home to visit. But she knew that Na Liu Ting Du wouldn\u2019t come back to visit her again.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che noticed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s odd change in behavior. He didn\u2019t want to upset her so he suppressed his frustrations. He hated how she stuck to the rules. The change in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s behaviour was a butterfly effect. Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t vent out his frustrations on Yuan Gun Gun, and as a consequence anyone working under him were affected even if they didn\u2019t provoke him. Some of Hao Yan Che\u2019s employees went to a temple and prayed that a deity would exorcise whatever was possessing Hao Yan Che\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 110</p><br/>\n</div>"}

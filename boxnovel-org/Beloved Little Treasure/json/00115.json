Hao Yan Che gave her a bit of his blood to help her sleep. She was sheltered by her parents, it would be strange if she wasn\u2019t scared of the serial killer.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured in her sleep.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s back and kissed her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I\u2019m here. Sleep.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hours later, Yuan Gun Gun woke up.</p><br/><p>\u2018Today we\u2019re not going to work,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Go change your clothes and I\u2019ll take you out.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where are you taking me?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go change your clothes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun went to the bathroom, brushed, washed and changed her clothes.</p><br/><p>One hour later, Yuan Gun Gun sat next to Hao Yan Che at a restaurant. He fed her sweet and sour ribs. But it was the plates of desserts on the table that surprised her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, there are too many dishes on the table,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018We won\u2019t be able to eat it all.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put a shumai in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t understand why Hao Yan Che took her out to eat a meal at a crowded restaurant. In the past he hated being in noisy places. But the sounds of chatter and glasses clinking helped calmed her anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u2018Eat,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018The food is getting cold.\u2019</p><br/><p>For several days Yuan Gun Gun lost her appetite. She lost a lot of weight and looked sick. Even she didn\u2019t want to look at herself in the mirror.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun eat, and he endured the noisy surroundings.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018This tripe tastes delicious,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun fed Hao Yan Che a tripe. He was relieved to see her smile. If she smiled, he felt his world was at peace.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, Hao Yan Che took Yuan Gun Gun to an amusement park. He was unhappy she was having too much fun and didn\u2019t pay attention to him.</p><br/><p>Five hours later, Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun sat on a bench under a shady tree.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you Che, it\u2019s been a long time since I had fun at an amusement park,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re the best.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun linked arms with Hao Yan Che. Strangers would have thought they were lovers. But she didn\u2019t know how he saw her. To him, was she his lover, maid or secretary?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che opened a bottle of water and passed it to Yuan Gun Gun. She drank half the bottle and felt satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where do you want to go next?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to go to the zoo,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s nose twitched.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t want to go?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>One hour later, Hao Yan Che walked around the zoo and looked like he wanted to vomit. Yuan Gun Gun was right, having a strong sense of smell like Xiao Chi who fainted from vomit odor was a curse.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, are you OK?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked. \u2018You look sick.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s nothing,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hand. He walked quickly to the zoo\u2019s restaurant so his nose could escape the torturous dung odors.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 115</p><br/>\n</div>"}

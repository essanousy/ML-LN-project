They thought her words killed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018Say it again and louder,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was sad and scared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why are you crying?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Come here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called and clutched onto Long Liu Bao\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, I\u2019m here,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018Don\u2019t be scared.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao!\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Che, it\u2019s wrong to cheat on your loveable wife,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018You have no right to be angry at Gun Gun. Didn\u2019t your kindergarten teacher tell you if you do something wrong, you should say sorry and ask for forgiveness\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao\u2019s voice quickly became inaudible. Hao Yan Che looked like he was going to kill Long Liu Bao as a starter.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang held Long Liu Bao\u2019s hand, and pulled her away from the warzone.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao hugged Long Liu Lang. She was scared of the dangerous werewolf king.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che looked at his wife sitting on a corner of the bed. He was angry his wife wanted to divorce him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, this is your last chance,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Come here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun couldn\u2019t believe Hao Yan Che raised his voice at her. He was the one who betrayed her.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m not coming home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Go and be with your mistress. I want to divorce you. I\u2019m going back to live with my parents.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che had wanted to clear his wife\u2019s misunderstanding. But his wife kept saying she wanted to divorce him so he was going to let her keep misunderstanding him.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che walked to the bed, and he held Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s chin.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, who do you think you are?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018Do you need me to remind you? You\u2019re a gift your dad gave me, you\u2019re my maid and my secretary. You have no right to divorce me. Even if you saw me sleeping with another woman, you still need to wait for me at home. Do you need me to remind you what happens if you make me angry?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at Hao Yan Che\u2019s calm face. She finally understood she was no one to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hao Yan Che!\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018How can you treat Gun Gun like this? Gun Gun is your wife! You cheated on your wife yet you have the guts to spit out insults at your wife.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried the speechless Yuan Gun Gun in his arms, and he looked coldly at Long Liu Bao.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019s my woman,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018I can treat her any way I want. I have a score to settle with you, but it can wait for another day.\u2019</p><br/><p>Long Liu Bao could see clearly Hao Yan Che loved Yuan Gun Gun. She didn\u2019t understand if he loved Yuan Gun Gun, how could he say such hurtful words to Yuan Gun Gun?</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s muffled cries made the Long brothers and Long Liu Bao sad.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to cry,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked resentfully at Hao Yan Che. She bit her lips to not let crying sounds come out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, save me,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun begged.</p><br/><p>Long Liu Lang held onto Long Liu Bao tightly, and didn\u2019t let her escape to save Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun, no one can save you,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You\u2019re going to die.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che carried Yuan Gun Gun outside the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let go of me!\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bao Bao, you can\u2019t interfere in Che\u2019s business,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said.</p><br/><p>\u2018He\u2019s bullying Gun Gun,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che loves Gun Gun,\u2019 Long Liu Lang said. \u2018He\u2019s not going to kill her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You rotten men only know how to stick together and hurt someone you say you love,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018How is that love? How is he hurting Gun Gun called love? It\u2019s all a pack of lies.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Long Liu Bao!\u2019 Long Liu Bo said. \u2018If you know what\u2019s good for you then know your limits.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018So what if I don\u2019t know my limits?\u2019 Long Liu Bao asked. \u2018What are you going to do about it?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Can\u2019t you be reasonable?\u2019 Long Liu Bo asked. \u2018Gun Gun is Che\u2019s wife. We have no right to detain Gun Gun here.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You two are brutes,\u2019 Long Liu Bao said. \u2018How can you two standby and watch Che hurt Gun Gun? I hate selfish men like you two and Che who only care about yourselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 150</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I couldn\u2019t keep my head above the water. Young master, I was really scared I was going to die. I didn\u2019t want to die before having children. There are more delicious food I haven\u2019t tasted yet. I can\u2019t die without meeting the baby white fox and baby panda my daddy promised he\u2019ll get me when I return home.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che silently hugged Yuan Gun Gun and let her talk.</p><br/><p>A long time later, Yuan Gun Gun cried herself to sleep. Hao Yan Che helped her lie back down on the bed, he pulled the bedsheet over her body and watched her sleep.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun occasionally sniffed her nose in her sleep. Hao Yan Che caressed her soft face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gently kissed her lips.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master is scary\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun murmured.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che considered knocking Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head. But he didn\u2019t want her to wake up and make a racket.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che watched Yuan Gun Gun sleep until the middle of the night. He carefully got out of bed, and walked to his bedroom.</p><br/><p>The next day the servants gossiped about their future young mistress\u2019 near death experience. They were certain their young master loved Yuan Gun Gun, because he was more worried about her health than his damaged watch that was more expensive than the swimming pool. Yuan Gun Gun quickly recovered from the swimming pool incident, but she didn\u2019t play with water again out of fear of drowning.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuan resembled its young mistress. Xiao Yuan loved to follow beautiful people, especially beautiful cooks. All the kitchen maids loved the adorable Xiao Yuan. Every day Xiao Yuan would stay in the kitchen during the day, and walk out with a bloated stomach at night.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bi was a glutton like its young mistress. Every day Xiao Bi would hide in Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s apron, and Hao Yan Che would toss Xiao Bi out to the garden but Xiao Bi always remembered to hang onto the nuts in its hands.</p><div></div><br/><p>Xiao Chen loved to watch TV in its mistress bedroom. Xiao Chen didn\u2019t like being outside.</p><br/><p>Xiao Gun loved money. Xiao Gun used its spikes to collect money, and stored it under its mistress\u2019 pink bed.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che pretended he couldn\u2019t see the animals\u2019 strange habits as long as they didn\u2019t go into his bedroom or cling onto Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body. If they dared to cling onto Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s body, Hao Yan Che would be angry at them. Behind Hao Yan Che\u2019s back, Yi Tu would say to Jia Tu that Hao Yan Che was displaying symptoms of jealousy.</p><br/><p>One day in the dining room, Hao Yan Che was displaying symptoms of jealousy again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yuan Gun Gun!\u2019 Hao Yan Che called. He pinched Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s ears. \u2018Does everything I say to you go in one ear and out the other?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun rubbed her ears.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s not my fault Xiao Bi likes to hide in my pockets.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che tossed Xiao Bi out the window.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Bi!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bi closed its eyes, and held onto the nuts. Luckily Chen Jia Wen caught Xiao Bi before Xiao Bai fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, don\u2019t throw Xiao Bi outside,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019ll scare Xiao Bi.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Next time I won\u2019t throw it,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Next time I\u2019ll strangle it to death.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che strode to the study room. Yuan Gun Gun looked frustrated at his back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you following me?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018See, it\u2019s jealousy,\u2019 Yi Tu whispered to Jia Tu.</p><br/><p>The following morning at a quarter past eight, Hao Yan Che heard a piercing scream from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom. He ran to her bedroom, and saw the look of devastation on her face.

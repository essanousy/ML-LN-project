She was used to him taking charge, and nagging her. But lately he stopped caring if she ate junk food and that she did nothing productive. Most of all she hated the distance between them. She felt like he didn\u2019t need her. Was he still angry at her for running away, and didn\u2019t want to forgive her?</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che hated when Yuan Gun Gun guarded her feelings, and kept her distance from him. It made him scared that any second she would say she wanted to divorce him, and she regretted marrying him. He didn\u2019t expect the hardest person to hold onto was a simpleton. He didn\u2019t understand what she thought about in her head like how she didn\u2019t understand his thoughts. Should he let her know his feelings toward her directly?</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che saw Yuan Gun Gun forced herself to smile at him, and he had enough. After work, he planned to tell her everything. He wanted to tell her how much he loved her. Tell her that he was willing to change to make her happy for the rest of her life. Then if she was willing, he wanted to sleep with her at night.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun looked at Hao Yan Che\u2019s hand holding her hand tightly. She didn\u2019t want to lose his protectiveness. After work she wanted to say sorry to him for running away. She wanted to tell him how much she loved him. Tell him about her insecurities. That she was scared he was forced to marry her, scared he didn\u2019t need her anymore and scared he didn\u2019t care about her anymore. There were too many other insecurities she bottled up. Like she was scared another woman would take him away from her. Then she would use the other seductive ways Long Liu Bao taught her on him. Would he desire her again?</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun silently planned their love declarations on the way to work.</p><br/><p>Later that morning, one of Hao Yan Che\u2019s secretaries entered his office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Take these reports to the marketing department,\u2019 Hao Yan Che instructed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes CEO Hao,\u2019 the secretary said and left Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, if you want I can help you at work like in the past,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to work,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018If you\u2019re bored, you can browse online or go shopping. I can ask Yi Tu to be your bodyguard.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che saying he didn\u2019t need her made Yuan Gun Gun want to cry.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked. \u2018If you don\u2019t want to go shopping, I\u2019ll ask Yi Tu to buy desserts for you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I want to go see big sister Feng.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Why do you want to see her?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun waited for Hao Yan Che to ask her to stay.</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018You can go see her.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun silently walked out of Hao Yan Che\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu and Yi Tu exchanged another confused look at each other. They didn\u2019t understand why Hao Yan Che and Yuan Gun Gun were behaving oddly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I don\u2019t know why you suddenly behaving strangely,\u2019 Yi Tu said. \u2018Young master, can\u2019t you see how unhappy Gun Gun is by your sudden change? Did something happened between young master and Gun Gun?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che gave Yi Tu a disapproving look.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I\u2019m sorry for overstepping my boundary,\u2019 Yi Tu said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che thumped his desk.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m unhappier,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yi Tu closed his mouth. He was lucky he wasn\u2019t Hao Yan Che\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took a deep breath, and silently worked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t go to look for Feng Ting. Yuan Gun Gun sat on the toilet seat in the women\u2019s bathroom. She didn\u2019t know when it became a habit for her to cry on the toilet seat at work. She hated hearing people gossip about her, but she felt better after crying on the toilet seat.</p><br/><p>\u2018Have you heard CEO\u2019s ugly and dumb wife hasn\u2019t been coming to work with him for a long time?\u2019 the first woman asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 the second woman said. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if CEO Hao had enough of seeing her at work and at home. If he doesn\u2019t let her come to work then he must be seeing his mistress at work.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I heard CEO\u2019s wife ran away,\u2019 the third woman said. \u2018Not only is she ugly and dumb, she\u2019s also a burden. She ran away to get his attention. How laughable, even if she got his attention by running away, it would only make him hate her more.\u2019</p><br/><p>The three women laughed at Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s expense.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun heard enough. She opened the toilet door, and confronted the women who gossiped about her.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 162</p><br/>\n</div>"}

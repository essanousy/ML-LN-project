They both thought Gun Gun Yuan sounded funny, because the priest was asking him if he wanted to marry crying south.</p><br/><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun Yuan, do you take Yan Che Hao to be your lawfully wedded husband?\u2019 the priest asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018The rings,\u2019 the priest said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che put a werewolf ring on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s left thumb. A bright light flashed out of the werewolf ring and bound them together forever.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun didn\u2019t know why Hao Yan Che put a ring on her thumb, but she felt happy when he put a ring on her thumb. She put his werewolf ring he wore since the day Qiu Li Luo gave it to him, on his left thumb.</p><br/><p>The ancient blood inscription on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead shone, but only Hao Yan Che could see the inscription.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo held Hao Yan Che\u2019s hand when Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s forehead shone.

They could only hear each other\u2019s heart beats.</p><br/><p>Rose petals confetti fell from the church ceiling and the wedding guests clapped and cheered.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took Yuan Gun Gun outside the church.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why can\u2019t we use chocolate confetti instead of petals?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chocolate confetti?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want to be kicked?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun quietly got into the car.</p><br/><p>At the wedding reception venue at nine at night, Yuan Gun Gun was hungry and tired of changing into different dresses, shoes and having her makeup retouched. She felt weddings were a curse, and didn\u2019t want to have another wedding. Her head felt dizzy, and her wedding day was a blur. What touched her heart was seeing how happy her parents and Hao Yan Che\u2019s parents were, and when Hao Yan Che put her ring on her left thumb.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018Are you hungry?\u2019 Hao Yan Che asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Look at all the delicious food on the tables. It\u2019s a waste we don\u2019t have time to eat them. Let\u2019s eat at home.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. He rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s flat stomach. \u2018We\u2019ll eat at home.\u2019</p><br/><p>At twenty past ten, Yuan Gun Gun walked through the front door of the Hao Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, I\u2019m starving,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Go take a bath,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018I\u2019ll cook your favorite dishes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you aunty Chen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You\u2019re the best. I\u2019ll never forget your kindness.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun ran to the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, Na Liu Ting Du sent a box of chocolates from Paris to Gun Gun,\u2019 Mrs Chen said. \u2018Do you want to give them to Gun Gun?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll give them to her tomorrow,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes young master,\u2019 Mrs Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Aunty Chen, put a little Mateus in the food,\u2019 Hao Yan Che instructed.</p><br/><p>Mrs Chen understood, and she walked to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>In the master bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun was happy to take off the heavy diamond beaded dress and remove her makeup. She soaked her tired body in the bathtub for half an hour. Then she walked to the bed, and saw paradise. Her favorite dishes were brought to the master bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little hungry demon,\u2019 Hao Yan Che called affectionately.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun smiled and continued eating.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che took an hour bath. By the time he returned to the master bedroom, Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks were rosy from eating Mrs Chen\u2019s cooked dinner dishes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che, my head feels dizzy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Aunty Chen\u2019s food tastes strange tonight.\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 127</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t want to vomit on Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tell Ming to ask his people in New York to find out the killer\u2019s identity,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, do you suspect the killer is one of your subjects?\u2019 Yi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Um,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018In the last few years, demons have kept a low key. But it doesn\u2019t mean their thirst for blood has lessen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che stood, and walked to the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, where are you going?\u2019 Yi Tu asked. \u2018I can take young master there.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to the Yuan Mansion,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said. \u2018Go do your duties. You know I\u2019m not a patient person.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che left his office, and Yi Tu packed up the victims\u2019 files and photos.</p><br/><p>Later at the Yuan Mansion\u2019s living room, Yuan Ting Liu poured the tea he brewed himself into two tea cups. Brewing tea helped Yuan Ting Liu kill time, but the icy young man in front of him didn\u2019t know how to appreciate good tea.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che couldn\u2019t correlate his rice ball and Yuan Ting Liu together. Yuan Gun Gun was right, she didn\u2019t inherit any of Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s intelligence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Hao, why did you come here to see me?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to marry Yuan Gun Gun,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What do you think my answer is?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018You\u2019ll give your answer soon,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you love my little girl?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu and Hao Yan Che were two of the same kind. They didn\u2019t need to mince words with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2018I love her,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu wasn\u2019t surprised by Hao Yan Che\u2019s answer.</p><div></div><br/><p>\u2018What about Gun Gun?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked. \u2018Does she love you?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018She loves me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I promised your parents that if you and Gun Gun love each other during the three years being together, I\u2019ll give my blessing for you to marry Gun Gun,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Besides, you\u2019ve tarnished my little girl\u2019s innocence.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You and your wife can discuss with my parents about her dowry and an auspicious day for you to hand her over to me,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s tone of voice sounded like he was buying a pet at a pet store.</p><br/><p>\u2018Has Gun Gun agreed to marry you?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018She\u2019ll agree,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is that so?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che\u2019s brows creased.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stay for dinner,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018Then bring home a box of your mother-in-law\u2019s dinner dishes for Gun Gun. If you ask Gun Gun to marry you while she\u2019s eating her mummy\u2019s dinner dishes, perhaps she\u2019ll say yes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Alright,\u2019 Hao Yan Che said.</p><br/><p>At the Hao Mansion\u2019s front porch at ten at night, Yuan Gun Gun sat on a chair and waited anxiously for Hao Yan Che to come home.</p><br/><p>\u2018Little girl, what are you doing?\u2019 Qi Tu asked. He sat on the chair next to Yuan Gun Gun. \u2018Did you change professions? Are you a security guard now?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuan sat on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s lap, Xiao Chen was coiled around Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s arm, Xiao Bi sat on Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s shoulder and Xiao Gun rolled in a ball inside Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s pocket.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Che isn\u2019t home,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018He promised he would come home early.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Your young master isn\u2019t home?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said and looked sadly at Xiao Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you miss him?\u2019 Qi Tu asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Tu rubbed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s head and pinched her pink face.</p><br/><p>\u2018Turning pink after someone teases you a little is your specialty,\u2019 Qi Tu teased.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pushed Qi Tu\u2019s hand aways from her head and face.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che arrived home. He wasn\u2019t impressed to see Qi Tu touching Yuan Gun Gun and her small friends on her lap.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter 118</p><br/>\n</div>"}

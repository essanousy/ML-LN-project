But she didn\u2019t know how to refold her clothes. When she was about to give up, she heard a knock on her door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come in,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Two beautiful maids walked onto Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom. The first maid carried a uniform and the second maid carried new shoes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hello Miss Yuan,\u2019 the maids greeted politely and bowed in front of Yuan Gun Gun.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stood and she smiled at the two maids.</p><br/><p>\u2018You two don\u2019t need to call me Miss Yuan,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018You two can call me Gun Gun. What are your names?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m Chen Jia Ting,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018You can call me Jia Ting.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m Chen Jia Wen,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018You can call me Jia Wen.\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun pulled Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen to sit on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you two sisters?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018I\u2019m the little sister.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We\u2019re Mrs Chen\u2019s daughters,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018I\u2019m twenty. Jia Wen is nineteen. We\u2019re both older than you. In the future you can call us big sister.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Ting, big sister Wen,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>\u2018You have adorable soft cheeks,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. She squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek and smiled warmly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Jia Wen, stop,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting pulled Chen Jia Wen\u2019s hands away from Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s sore cheeks.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Wen loved Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s irresistible cheeks. But Chen Jia Ting\u2019s dagger warning was scary.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s OK,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018My family love squeezing my chubby body too.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, go to the bathroom and change into your uniform,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018Mrs Chen asked us to take you to young master\u2019s bedroom.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes big sister Ting,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun jumped off the bed and went to change clothes in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Chen Jia Ting looked at the pile of clothes on the floor and she smiled. Yuan Gun Gun wasn\u2019t someone who knew how to take care of herself.</p><br/><p>After Yuan Gun Gun came out of the bathroom, Chen Jia Wen squeezed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheeks again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, you suit wearing a maid\u2019s uniform,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said. \u2018If you wore a lace hat then you can be cast as a maid in a TV drama where the young master bullies you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Wen, why would I be bullied?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because you have an innocent face that makes people want to bully you,\u2019 Chen Jia Wen said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, don\u2019t listen to Jia Wen\u2019s nonsense,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. \u2018Come here, put on your shoes. Then we\u2019ll take you to meet young master.\u2019</p><div></div><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun put on her shoes, and followed Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen toward Hao Yan Che\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, tonight I\u2019ll help you tidy your room,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big sister Ting, I don\u2019t want to trouble you if you\u2019re busy,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting said. She couldn\u2019t resist squeezing Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s soft cheeks anymore. \u2018Tonight I\u2019m free to help you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you big sister Ting,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun linked arms with Chen Jia Ting and Chen Jia Wen.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, the three young women stopped in front of a two metre violet door. On the door were ancient inscriptions.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, remember don\u2019t touch young master,\u2019 Chen Jia Ting warned.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun nodded her head and she quietly walked into Hao Yan Che\u2019s bedroom. His bedroom was bigger than Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s bedroom. She would be scared to sleep in his bedroom alone. She thought he looked like the sleeping beauty in fairy tales.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun crept closer to Hao Yan Che\u2019s bed. A bedsheet draped over his waist and legs. She wanted to touch his smooth silver hair and skin. His straight nose and eyelashes were longer than her nose and eyelashes. She thought he looked more beautiful than the maids and Na Liu Ting Du.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was transfixed on Hao Yan Che\u2019s beauty for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, wake up,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018It\u2019s after sunset.\u2019</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Che continued to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master if you don\u2019t wake up to eat your dinner, I\u2019ll eat all your dinner,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun was disappointed Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s trick to wake her up didn\u2019t work on Hao Yan Che.</p><br/><p>\u2018Young master, I can see your naked bottom,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun still couldn\u2019t wake up Hao Yan Che. She was about to shake him awake, but she remembered Mrs Chen and Chen Jia Ting\u2019s warnings. She looked around the bedroom for something to poke him awake. Her eyes landed on the bathroom door. She quietly walked to the bathroom, and picked up a plunger.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun walked back to Hao Yan Che\u2019s bed. When she was about to poke him with a plunger, she heard his voice.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you dare touch me with the plunger, I\u2019ll turn you into paper,\u2019 Hao Yan Che warned.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapter Twenty</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Satisfied?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du hugged Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s neck and she smiled at him. He felt he wasted years denying he loved Feng Du Du. It was too late. By the morning, he would be separated from Feng Du Du forever.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu, I want time to past faster so I can see Gun Gun,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du kissed Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s cheek. After the day he confessed to her, she saw him slowly change. He was gentler with her to show he cared about her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu hugged Feng Du Du tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2018If one day I\u2019m not here anymore, you have to listen to me and let Ting Du take care of you,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du is only fifteen,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018I\u2019m twenty-five. How can Ting Du take care of me? I don\u2019t need anyone else to take care of me, I only want you.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s only a hypothetical situation,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll go wherever you go,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018What if I die?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll die with you,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018If you die with me, what about Gun Gun?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du will take care of Gun Gun,\u2019 Feng Du Du said. \u2018Gun Gun loves Ting Du. Ting Liu, have you thought about letting Ting Du marry Gun Gun?\u2019</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu pinched Feng Du Du\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you want Ting Du to suffer?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu teased.</p><br/><p>Feng Du Du hit Yuan Ting Liu\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why would Ting Du suffer?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked. \u2018Don\u2019t you think Gun Gun is adorable, warm and loving?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, Gun Gun is loveable,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu silently stroked Feng Du Du\u2019s hair. She was proud that Yuan Gun Gun was their daughter.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu saw Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s caller ID on his phone. He let go of Feng Du Du, and walked to the study room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, what did you find out?\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dad, the owner of the plaque has no criminal record,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Also, I don\u2019t think the owner kidnapped Gun Gun for money.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I agree,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said. \u2018I\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Bye dad,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu went back to bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu, are you worried about something?\u2019 Feng Du Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Liu, whenever you\u2019re worried about something, you can share your worries with me,\u2019 Feng Du Du said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s sleep,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu was worried what Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s kidnapper wanted if the kidnapper didn\u2019t want money.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At nine in the morning, in front of Yuan\u2019s company headquarters, a silver Rolls-Royce stopped in front of Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du. The luxury car confirmed that the kidnapper didn\u2019t want money.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, I thought I said my master only wanted to see you,\u2019 Jia Tu said.</p><br/><p>\u2018The letter didn\u2019t say I had to see your master alone,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu said.</p><div></div><br/><p>The passenger doors were unlocked. Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du sat in the car. The silver Rolls-Royce quickly disappeared from Yuan\u2019s company headquarters.</p><br/><p>The Rolls-Royce stopped in front of a private airport. The three young men stepped onto a small private jet to fly to the Hao Mansion.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du didn\u2019t understand why someone would build a mansion near a forest of wild animals.</p><br/><p>Jia Tu pressed a secret knob and the front door opened.</p><br/><p>\u2018Come inside,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du were surprised to see a beautiful woman with long white hair waiting for them behind the door.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thank you Jia Tu,\u2019 Qiu Li Luo said. \u2018You can leave.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes mistress,\u2019 Jia Tu said and left.</p><br/><p>Qiu Li Luo closed the door. Yuan Ting Liu and Na Liu Ting Du followed her to the living room. The men thought the mansion was furnished like a Victorian home.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun jumped off the sofa, she ran to Yuan Ting Liu and hugged him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy!\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu held Yuan Gun Gun tightly in his arms. His little girl was safe.</p><br/><p>\u2018Daddy, what took you so long to come here?\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I really missed you and mummy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What about me?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked. \u2018Gun Gun, didn\u2019t you miss me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun called.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun stretched her chubby arms for Na Liu Ting Du to hold her. Yuan Ting Liu loosened his hold on Yuan Gun Gun and Na Liu Ting Du held her.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu assessed the man sitting on the sofa. The man didn\u2019t look like a simpleton.</p><br/><p>Hao Yan Que thought the little round ball\u2019s dad had icy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mr Yuan, I have something I want to discuss with you in private,\u2019 Hao Yan Que said. \u2018Come with me.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ting Du, stay here and play with Gun Gun,\u2019 Yuan Ting Liu instructed.</p><br/><p>Yuan Ting Liu followed Hao Yan Que to the study room.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, lollipop,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek. He picked up a lollipop from the coffee table, and gave it to Yuan Gun Gun. He thought she was a sweet little mouse.</p><br/><p>Yuan Gun Gun unwrapped the lollipop and she held it in front of Na Liu Ting Du\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, eat,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du sighed inwardly and put the lollipop in his mouth. He stroked Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s hair that was brushed smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Gun Gun, did you have fun here?\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018Aunty Li let me eat delicious food. She gave me a pink butterfly clip. Big brother Du, is it pretty?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Gun Gun looks like a little princess.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Big brother Du, look at this beautiful dress aunty Li helped me wear,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s beautiful,\u2019 Na Liu Ting Du said. \u2018Gun Gun, did you miss home?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yuan Gun Gun said. \u2018I missed big brother Du, mummy and daddy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Na Liu Ting Du kissed Yuan Gun Gun\u2019s cheek again. When he was with Yuan Gun Gun, all his worries disappeared. He even forgot why he and Yuan Ting Liu came to the Hao Mansion.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>End of Chapters Ten to Eleven</p><br/>\n</div>"}

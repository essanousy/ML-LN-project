A loud smack rang out as she slapped her own face. Xiao Shi leapt up in fright as she nearly threw out the pearl hairpin in her hands.</p><br/><p>She was flustered at seeing her mistress\u2019s red face in the mirror, \u201cMistress Xiu, why did you hit your own face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rubbed it her cheek, saying, \u201cNothing, I just felt a little itchy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, she was keeping herself alert, guarding her original intentions, and not letting herself be seduced by the male lead. Yesterday\u2019s Long Heng had really been too attractive. Even though she had not dared to gaze closely at him, those sturdy, robust muscles of his and firm chest had still entered her eyes.</p><br/><p>This kind of man amongst men was really too good in modern times. Low-quality fakes were running all over the place, an unbearable sight for the eyes. She\u2019d gone on a few blind dates before, or dated some fellows who were still in university. However, those slender bodies of theirs, with waists even thinner than her own, had really left her feeling awkward. If she were to live together with such weak men, they really wouldn\u2019t give her with any sense of security whatsoever.</p><br/><p>However, that figure of Long Heng\u2019s was truly the kind that appeared thin when clothed, but appeared muscular when unrobed. Just looking at that back of his alone was already enough to make her extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d slapped herself because she had embarrassed herself too much with her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi combed her hair and wash up, with Bai Xiangxiu sitting there after eating breakfast, waiting for Long Heng to come to find her. A maid entered just as this time, saying that the orchids would be thrown away, yet asked for her to choose a few of them to bring back.</p><br/><p>Plants naturally had to be chosen by oneself. Therefore, she left for the greenhouse she\u2019d visited earlier along with Xiao Shi. Because the servants couldn\u2019t leave them in their previous home without harming the people in the room, and the orchids would freeze to death if placed elsewhere, the servants had just left them there.</p><br/><p>The place was big, and airflow was more or less good. Therefore, no one would be poisoned from the toxic glycosides in the tulips. However, Xiao Shi was worried, and didn\u2019t really want her to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stay outside then. I\u2019ll go in myself. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu knew that Xiao Shi was timid upon seeing the latter scared. Therefore, Bai Xiangxiu wanted to leave her maid outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fine! What if something happens to Mistress Xiu, what would I do then? I should be the one to enter and pick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could not help but smile as she saw Xiao SHi\u2019s heroic expression. She gently pinched her maid\u2019s nose nose before saying, \u201cDo you know how? I\u2019ll go. It\u2019ll be fine as long as there aren\u2019t many people present and I have cloth covering my face. Anyways, some of the plants have been thrown away already. It\u2019s not a patch of flowers anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll accompany you in.\u201d While Xiao Shi was scared, she wanted to stay by her mistress\u2019 side, advancing and retreating along with her.</p><br/><p>She was still young in Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s eyes, so Bai Xiangxiu took a pink of her face. \u201cYou just wait here. We can\u2019t have too many people go in or that\u2019s when we\u2019ll all be poisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi actually really believed her words. She hesitated for a moment before finally deciding to remain outside.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu only brought a pageboy in. He was in charge of transporting the plants. He was in charge of moving away whatever flower pot she chose. However, he had to maintain its heat properly. At least fifteen minutes was required for it to be moved to the nearest warm room from here.</p><br/><p>Beacuse the airflow here was fine, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t feel stifled. Moreover, there were also some other plants here which helped to mitigate the toxicity level in the air.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it really happen suddenly, without any prior warning, a pillar of the greenhouse suddenly snapped and crashed downwards. That pageboy, in the process of moving flowers, didn\u2019t notice this and was slammed into the ground.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu jumped in shock. She wanted to go over to check on his condition, but for some reason, her foot suddenly stepped on empty air as her body actually also plummeted downwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiangxiu!\u201d An anxious voice sounded, following which she seemed to have been caught by someone, but before she could rejoice, a massive rumble resounded by her ears as the whole world around her seemed to collapse.</p><br/><p>She lapsed into unconsciousness, only awakening after some time had passed. What happened? Why is there so much dust?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu coughed with great difficulty, some foreign object seemingly having entered her eye, her tears obstructing her vision. A hand then gently smoothed her back, \u201cAre you better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She coughed a few times, wanting to rub her eyes.</p><br/><p>However, a handkerchief was shoved into her hands, \u201cWipe your eyes gently. Dust must have entered them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu gently rubbed her eyes with the handkerchief, and indeed felt a little better. While there was still a little bit of pain, she could indeed see now. They seemed to have fallen into a deep pit. Very deep, and she\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu finally realized that something was wrong. She seemed to be sitting on someone right now. No wonder she had not been injured, someone had actually been a meat cushion for her. She hurriedly stood, finding that her entire body hurt greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo slowly.\u201d Song Jiaoyue supported her, \u201cWhen you fell, you hit your waist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaist? No wonder it hurts a little,\u201d She reached out to touch her waist, then felt blood on her hand. She felt woozy. Had she been injured?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry. It\u2019s just a graze. It shouldn\u2019t be serious.\u201d Song Jiaoyue supported her, not having been injured as he was practiced martial arts. However, when they had fallen just now, he had not been able to guard her completely. As a result, a nail had grazed her waist.</p><br/><p>With clothes on, he had no way to tell how serious the injury was, but the blood loss was not great, so it shouldn\u2019t be too serious. He felt guilt within his heart. He felt it was really great that he had come to see her at the time, but really regretful that he had not been able to protect her well.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu composed herself, before seeing that she was completely covered with soot and dust, with Song Jiaoyue also being in a similar state. And seeing that the one she had been resting on earlier was actually that pageboy who had been knocked out earlier, she couldn\u2019t help but jump in shock. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust unconscious. There\u2019s no a problem.\u201d Song Jiaoyue removed his scarf while suspecting that it wasn\u2019t clean enough. After shaking it around for a bit, he said to Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cWrap it around your waist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded, reaching out to grab it. However, she discovered that her arm rather hurt as a muffled groan left her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour hand\u2026\u201d Song Jiaoyue couldn\u2019t care less about formalities as he grabbed her hand, only to discover that her jade-like hand had already swelled up to the size of a bun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have been injured when falling as you used your hand to support yourself against the ground. Forgive my impertinence, but can I help you to wrap the scarf around your waist?\u201d He was afraid that the injury on her waist would be contaminated by the dust. Therefore, he could only use such a method to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Also, thank you.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu raised her arms, her meaning being for him to help her wrap it around the wound at her waist.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was taken aback as his heart trembled, not having thought that she would be so bold. However, he still wrapped his scarf around her waist, wrapping his handkerchief about her wrist next. That way, she would not be hurt a second time.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was covered in sweat after handling all this. Her body was really just too fragrant, causing him to having some impure thoughts. This was not good. He definitely had to keep his distance. Originally, he had thought that she would begin weeping after understanding the situation, or would be a little awkward due to wanting to avoid suspicion of improper relations. However, she was, in reality, still very calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do we go up? What is this place?\u201d Song Jiaoyue was stunned for a bit. He finally knew now why she had run over and taken that blade for him. She was actually not as soft as her appearance suggested. She was strong, extremely strong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

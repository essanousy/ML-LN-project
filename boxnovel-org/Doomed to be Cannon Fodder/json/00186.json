Her expression would take a turn for the worse if he was even a bit late to return, and she would give him the most aggrieved look in the world, looking all the more pitiful.</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt that his heart would melt in a puddle every time he looked at her like this, and was both anxious and helpless as he kept her company. But he was also so incredibly happy at the same time, because his child was slowly growing inside of her. His child! It might grow into someone like him in the future, or a beautiful girl like her. Whatever they would turn out to be, this was his first child, so nothing bad happening would be tolerated. He brought over congee to feed her. \u201cWhat would you like to eat later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? I\u2019m not even done with this congee yet. Let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019re eating later\u2026 later!\u201d The more Long Heng treated her thus, the more soft-hearted Bai Xiangxiu became. But how could she so easily toss away her life in the modern times? Thus, she became more and more conflicted. Everything was bad when one was in a poor mood, and it didn\u2019t help that her body wasn\u2019t very healthy to begin with, so it was a bit difficult to nurture her body as well as the new life in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you say Miss Lin and the others went to?\u201d She would gossip when there was nothing else to do. There was nothing for it, it was a woman\u2019s innate nature.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was also in a good mood now that he\u2019d shaken off the marriage. He smiled, \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant alright, but leaving with Luo Yunzheng this time might\u2019ve been a mistake on her part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was like a curious cat as she lay on the bed, propping herself up with her arms. She somehow felt another layer of meaning just under Long Heng\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t want to talk about these things with her, but had to talk about Lin Qianzi\u2019s gossip in order to distract her. Inside, he reflected deeply that no matter how reserved and shy a woman might be, she would always be particularly passionate about something like this.</p><br/><p>Her eyes betrayed her shock after he was done. She was silent for a long while before she looked up at him in disbelief, \u201cSh-she\u2026 she did\u2026 that with Duan Yunying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe so, and then that man somehow made his way into the Lin Manor. I believe that only Luo Yunzheng was in the dark about it all, so I only told him that there may be someone else who loves Miss Lin like he does.\u201d Long Heng smiled very innocently, but Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t fooled. This man could be quite evil. He\u2019d obviously taken Luo Yunzheng for a fool! If he\u2019d known all this beforehand, he wouldn\u2019t have come fight for Lin Qianzi at all, and so hard at that. Therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you tell Luo Yunzheng that Miss Lin is pregnant?\u201d My gosh, at this point, it\u2019s an unknown who the actual father is!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my men saw Duan Yunying buying medicine for preventing miscarriages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, who\u2019s the father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng flicked her forehead lightly, \u201cHow would I know? Who do I go ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Long Heng hadn\u2019t the slightest relationship with them, so how would he know who the father was? On the contrary, he was absolutely the father of the one in her stomach. As a modern woman, she\u2019d heard of women having children out of wedlock, as well as couples having children only a year or two after the wedding. But she\u2019d rarely heard of couples having a child less than half a year after the ceremony. His ability would put many to shame. She recalled from the novel that the female lead hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant that quickly either! Why had things changed when it came to her?</p><br/><p>Pregnant women were easily tired, so it didn\u2019t take much more talking before she became sleepy. Long Heng placed the covers over her and got into bed as well after changing his clothes.</p><br/><p>Ever since knowing that Bai Xiangxiu really was pregnant, and because she was worried about the impact on the unborn child, the old madame had wanted Long Heng to spend his nights elsewhere. But how could he bear to put through Bai Xiangxiu through so much trouble with his coming and going? He\u2019d immediately volunteered to stay behind to take care of her.</p><br/><p>Apart from keeping a blade by his side, the two were as if an ordinary couple. They ate and slept together every day, inciting all sorts of jealousy from others. How would Bai Xiangxiu care what they thought? She\u2019d grown lazy since having a child, supremely lazy. She wouldn\u2019t move unless she absolutely had to.</p><br/><p>Setting aside the fact that it was the very picture of harmony in the Prince Li Manor, Duan Yunying was feeling all sorts of put out. His lovesick parasite had been utterly wasted. He wanted to use Lin Qianzi to kill Long Heng, not Luo Yunzheng. What was he to do now that she had run off with Luo Yunzheng? It would be a waste of energy if he managed to kill someone he didn\u2019t want to kill. And yet, he couldn\u2019t randomly kill anyone in the princely residence. It would be disastrous if it sparked Long Heng\u2019s desire for revenge instead of killing him. What if the prince decided to mobilize his troops? Duan Yunying\u2019s country would be in too much trouble then!</p><br/><p>This was why he\u2019d deployed such a roundabout method before, but who would\u2019ve thought that they\u2019d fail time and time again. Had he known about this all beforehand, he would\u2019ve planted the parasite in her body. It was just that he hadn\u2019t dreamed that Long Heng would still like her even after she\u2019d grown ugly. It looked like he truly loved her.</p><br/><p>Or, do I still try to do something with that woman? That woman listened to orders quite obediently and stayed within the manor. She wouldn\u2019t leave easily. He wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the residence if she didn\u2019t leave, because the manor was still on guard against him. \u2026but perhaps.. He couldn\u2019t, but what about someone else? Duan Yunying laughed coldly. The easiest time to gain a woman\u2019s heart was when she was sad. Alright, he\u2019d have to use her again.</p><br/><p>This was how a beautiful maid suddenly appeared in the Prince Li Manor. Her methods were so sophisticated that it didn\u2019t take long for her to be promoted to a role in the prince\u2019s residence. But she was very mindful of her place, and didn\u2019t do anything for a few days. Some matters couldn\u2019t be rushed. Her goal could only be reached when a certain person appeared.</p><br/><p>She waited roughly five days before that person made his appearance, and when that maid saw her target, she turned with a cold snort and walked into the study. The prince was handling some official affairs, and there was no one else around. She placed a tea cup down in front of him and asked with a smile, \u201cDo you remember me, Your Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Li lifted his head because he felt the voice a bit familiar, only to be greeted with a female flinging herself into his embrace with a waft of her fragrance. He was about to push her away when she asked him softly, \u201cDo you want to know Duan Yunying\u2019s true identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng had indeed found out that Duan Yunying had had something to do with the enemy team, but hadn\u2019t been able to identify his true identity. He hesitated for a moment, but it was right then that someone entered through the door and saw this scene as soon as she set foot inside.</p><br/><p>The hell is going on here?!</p><br/><p>Her husband was holding another woman, and moreover, was sitting in an extremely compromising position. Bai Xiangxiu was stunned, then felt that she was entirely justified in flying into a rage, right?! She\u2019d actually recognized that woman as the female supporting character Yaya. Long Heng didn\u2019t seem to like her.</p><br/><p>No wait, not liking her doesn\u2019t mean the same as not wanting her! He was a man after all, and hadn\u2019t touched Bai Xiangxiu in almost a month. He would likely feel something for any woman he saw! Bai Xiangxiu grew angry as that thought crossed her mind and turned to leave\u2026</p><br/><p>Long Heng frowned and casually threw Yaya off to a heap on the side. \u201cMen, tie her up so I can interrogate her later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Li, you should know that I entered the manor because of you, you\u2026\u201d Yaya had thought that he would be interested in Duan Yunying\u2019s identity and so would be inclined to treat her well. Then, she\u2019d be able to take advantage of that to leave that person for good!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

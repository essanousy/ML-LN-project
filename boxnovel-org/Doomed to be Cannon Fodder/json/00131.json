Her every response was very frank, yet it was clear that they were all fake. Why was she able to act so candidly? How was he supposed to know that such acts of self-protection was very normal in the world that Bai Xiangxiu originally lived in? Not only did people in the modern world not revere force, but everyone protected themselves behind a mask, one that was taken off only in front of family members. </p><br/><p>Ever since Bai Xiangxiu had arrived here, she\u2019d been of the mentality that she wouldn\u2019t be able to return home and acted like she was working all day. Her acting skills were quite good as a result of that. Duan Yunying felt that he couldn\u2019t see beyond her facade. This was also a reason for him becoming more interested in her. </p><br/><p>However, being interested in her was one thing, this attack on his sight and smell was another. The most amazing thing was that the other party actually didn\u2019t seem to know how nauseous she was making other people feel. She still thought that she was that beauty and kept drawing closer to him.</p><br/><p>If she behaved this way before, he would definitely be happy, because for a beauty to behave that way clearly meant that she fancied him. He would take her without even needing to use any aphrodisiac on her. However, he really couldn\u2019t feel happy now. He was on the verge of vomiting his meal from the previous night whenever she moved closer. </p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d need to quickly return to the prince\u2019s side, isn\u2019t that right, Sir Duan?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu approached him again as though she was extremely frightened. Duan Yunying immediately recoiled in fright, and then started coughing softly. </p><br/><p>\u201cSir Duan, are you still not feeling well? According to the prince, you\u2019ve never been in the best of health. I think you must be tired from going all over the place in search of me. Why don\u2019t you let me give you a massage to loosen your muscles and bones?\u201d She stretched her talons out towards him as she spoke. </p><br/><p>Looking at those black fingers of hers with a foul scent to them, Duan Yunying felt that he really couldn\u2019t sit there any longer. He hastened to flap his hand and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t \u2013 eurp \u2013 dare. This humble one had better go back and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu finally broke into a smile as she watched Duan Yunying rush out through the door. It was a pity that her face was hurting slightly and so she didn\u2019t dare smile too broadly. But, even then, she was still extremely happy deep down in her heart. She slowly laid down on the bed, not at all afraid of him bothering her tonight. She only hoped that this would be the case tomorrow as well. Only then could she return to Prince Li\u2019s side safe and sound.</p><br/><p>She fell asleep in a relaxed manner, whereas Duan Yunying immediately took a bath until midnight. He felt that the foul scent was still lingering around him after he showered and so applied fragrance to himself in hopes of getting rid of the smell. Someone pushed the window open at this moment and placed a sword against his throat.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying snorted coldly didn\u2019t move an inch. \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be what I\u2019m asking you. You were the one who suggested that we work together. Yet, how is it that you deserted your partner and ran off? You should know the outcome of offending me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the gallant hero Luo think that Long Heng is so easy to handle? His thoughts are so meticulous that even I didn\u2019t anticipate it all. He set up secret guards around Miss Lin, guards that are so strong that my men, as good as they are, would never get past them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about her? Since you\u2019re going to exchange hostages, why aren\u2019t you bringing her along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe escaped.\u201d Duan Yunying felt oddly depressed. They were completely destroying all of his previously laid plans. It was one thing if Long Heng was difficult to handle, but he hadn\u2019t expected that a woman like her would act out of his expectations too.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d originally saved Luo Yunzheng with the intention of having both parties win. They would kidnap one woman each and execute their own plan respectively. Luo Yunzheng had used his relationship with jianghu to force the doctor to kidnap Bai Xiangxiu and hand her over to him. Duan Yunying would then sneak into Miss Lin\u2019s residence and take her out. However, there were some changes to that plan. He\u2019d never expected Long Heng to actually think of Miss Lin to the point where he would set up hidden guards around her. Thankfully, he\u2019d retreated quickly. If not, it was highly possible that he would have been forced to reveal his true colors.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to use poison in front of Long Heng, else it was very possible that the prince would find something by following the clues Duan Yunying left behind. He\u2019d wanted to plant the love sick parasite in her body before exchanging hostages, but never would\u2019ve thought that Bai Xiangxiu would actually escaped.</p><br/><p>Thus, his plan had been foiled, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it now. \u201cIsn\u2019t Miss Lin your target? Moreso, that woman is right beside me at this very moment. If you want to take her with you to exchange hostages, do as you please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeside you? That beggar?!\u201d Luo Yunzheng was stunned. He didn\u2019t believe Duan Yunying\u2019s words at all. </p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You knew how this plan was almost flawless when we made it. I\u2019ve already tried my best and even saved your life. Even if we\u2019ve failed, you won\u2019t be losing anything either, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Do you take me for a fool? I helped you bring her out, but you broke your promise of helping me trade hostages. We don\u2019t know what the prince going to do to Miss Lin at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s his fiancee after all. Do you think he\u2019ll do anything to her? Anyway, I can assure you that this woman won\u2019t retain her chastity when she returns. Think of this as me repaying my debt to you. Or, do you want to do the deed yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng was stunned for a moment, but quickly recovered. \u201cI never thought that you would feel\u2026 Alright. Since things have turned out this way, what you say, goes. I can delay exchanging hostages for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will do. You can steal her away from my side when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen enjoy her well.\u201d Luo Yunzheng nodded his head. He was extremely pleased with this outcome. There wasn\u2019t anything particularly bad about dragging this out for a few more days. He was incredibly pleased at being able to return a woman who\u2019d cheated on her husband back to the prince. He didn\u2019t know what kind of person this man was, but at this moment in time, those who wanted to go against Long Heng were all his friends. </p><br/><p>He discarded the sword in his hands and left.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying made up his mind as he watched Luo Yunzheng\u2019s fading silhouette. He had to find a way to lure Bai Xiangxiu to bed tomorrow. The truth had proven that dreams were full, but reality was scant. </p><br/><p>As for Luo Yunzheng, he took a detour back to Red Maple Mountain Villa and left a message indicating that they would meet at Falling Maple Tavern three days later to exchange hostages. </p><br/><p>He\u2019d planned on leaving right after leaving a message, but Long Heng sent a message using his internal qi. \u201cLuo Yunzheng, don\u2019t you want to see how she is right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng had just consummated his relationship with Miss Lin and naturally felt that she was different from other women. Additionally, he felt slightly guilty for what he\u2019d done to her and frowned. He clearly knew that he would possibly fall into Long Heng\u2019s trap by going back. However, he still gritted his teeth and stood in front of the window.</p><br/><p>Countless spears immediately pressed against his throat, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. He said coldly, \u201cAre you thinking of killing me, or do you want the woman to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng pushed open the door and walked out. Long Yunzheng instantly felt a heavy weight on his whole body. He never would\u2019ve thought that a furious Prince Li would be such a fearsome person. </p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, where is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine at the moment. You can prepare the hostage exchange in three days time. What about Miss Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine as well.\u201d Long Heng coldly quirked his lips and beckoned behind him with his finger. A completely weak and limp Lin Qianzi was brought out before them. She was still unconscious, but one could see that she was currently ill and not in a good state.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?!\u201d Luo Yunzheng furiously roared out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, but you, who did something to her. If Bai Xiangxiu isn\u2019t returned to me in one piece, then I really might have other people serve Miss Lin well.\u201d Long Heng couldn\u2019t tolerate the situation any longer. If Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t return safely, he might really do things that even he couldn\u2019t imagine. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 nurse her to health. We will exchange hostages in two days.\u201d Luo Yunzheng instantly pushed forward the proposed date by a day. After all, the woman wasn\u2019t really in his hands. In the event that something went wrong, he couldn\u2019t bear to see Long Heng abuse Miss Lin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

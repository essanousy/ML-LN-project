In the end, he had been dragged into everything as well. After all, the alliance head couldn\u2019t just stand by and see those in the wulin suffer. The novel had mentioned that he had an extremely beautiful appearance and excelled in martial arts. For example, his entrance just then had caused Luo Yunzheng to subconsciously back up a step.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Alliance Head Yu threatening me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Luo, please let go. You cannot take actions that will harm the wulin for the sake of personal relationships.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find it a bit difficult if you want to stop me. However, I\u2019ll take your words into consideration.\u201d Luo Yunzheng didn\u2019t want to suffer any losses, so he extended a hand to Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu glared at him. The Alliance Head Yu standing before them didn\u2019t want any conflicts between the imperial court and the wulin, so he wouldn\u2019t do anything to her. With such a savior present, why would she throw herself into the arms of her enemy, Luo Yunzheng? \u201cSave me, Alliance Head Yu! This little woman is a daughter of a good family who was kidnapped by him. He even wants to, to assault me!\u201d Speaking quickly, she began to cry. </p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng started. He\u2019d assumed that she would pick the familiar face in this situation, but she\u2019d actually pleaded for Yu Kuang to help!</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang furrowed his brows, his chilly, celestial visage turning even more beautiful at the action. With a wave of his sleeves, he actually sprang towards Luo Yunzheng!</p><br/><p>The Cloudlake Faction had enormous influence within the jianghu, but they were a free and unfettered group from the perspective of the wulin alliance head. It was only because one of their members had gone and provoked the imperial court this time, which had then caused fellow wulin members to be injured that Yu Kuang had actually come to restrain Luo Yunzheng\u2019s behavior. He\u2019d never expected the latter to actually kidnap a young woman to fool around with here! Luo Yunzheng was truly bold in his debauchery. Yu Kuang hated that type of people most of all, so he showed no mercy.</p><br/><p>Because Luo Yunzheng had been injured at the prince\u2019s estate a few days back, he was no match for the man. In his haste, he grabbed Bai Xiangxiu from the bed and threw her at Yu Kuang while she was still wondering how to escape. His original intention was to have her block a blow for him. It wouldn\u2019t matter even if she died. Yu Kuang hastily tried to withdraw his strike when he saw her body come flying at him. The backlash of internal energy ended up injuring himself, but he couldn\u2019t fully stop his attack, remnants of which actually striking Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s sternum. She felt the air burst free from her lungs before losing her breath to collapse on the floor.</p><br/><p>As she fainted, she could only think of cursing that Luo Yunzheng. He\u2019d actually used her as a human shield! Sooner or later, she\u2019d definitely get back at him, but right now it was impossible for her to even move. Yu Kuang looked at the woman he\u2019d struck with furrowed eyebrows, but picked her up in the end to bring her back to Whitecloud Mountain.</p><br/><p>Whitecloud Mountain was the jianghu\u2019s number one faction, and its members placed emphasis on self-improvement through arduous cultivation. Yu Kuang was the leader of the faction as well as the wulin alliance head, a busy man with a high position. Thus, his living quarters were slightly more comfortable than everyone else\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Currently, a severely injured Bai Xiangxiu was lying on his bed. Even though she had woken up, she didn\u2019t dare to move because her sternum had been broken. A certain martial uncle of Whitecloud Mountain had already examined her and said she\u2019d be good to walk in a few days. But right now she didn\u2019t even dare to move a muscle!</p><br/><p>That Yu Kuang was a strange one as well. He was clearly an alliance head and very busy, but he didn\u2019t even have a study. Most of his business was handled in his own rooms. Despite being alliance head, he seemed not to enjoy a single privilege of one. But he definitely had the airs of an alliance head as he babbled on about courtesy and ceremony while looking like an ascetic. </p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Alliance Head Yu, may I ask\u2026\u201d Aren\u2019t there any female disciples here? She couldn\u2019t help but ask the busy man as he worked in the outer rooms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yu Kuang didn\u2019t enter, instead speaking in a distant tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 Alliance Head Yu, though I\u2019m thankful that you\u2019ve saved me, could you consider sending me back to the capital?\u201d At least then she wouldn\u2019t feel so sullen.</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly, but it\u2019s not convenient for you to be moved right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang\u2019s voice was truly, extraordinarily light. It left her with no choice but to say, \u201cIs it possible, to have a girl come in. I\u2026 need\u2026 to use\u2026 the facilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so embarrassing mentioning this to her idol, all right? She felt like ramming her head into tofu.2 But the person outside simply walked away in a calm, measured way. Before long, a sturdy-looking female disciple entered the room. Without another word, she picked up Bai Xiangxiu and went to a side room, before setting her down on a chamber pot. \u201cI\u2019ll support you, so hurry up. There\u2019s a lot going on outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangixu was nervous and tried to look for a conversation topic. \u201cHow odd. Why doesn\u2019t Alliance Head Yu arrange for me to mend my injuries in another room? At least one with female disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d need an available room in the first place. Whitecloud Mountain is the number one faction in jianghu. The number of disciples who want to join us is long enough to form a queue that stretches to the bottom of the peak. So aside from the Faction Head\u2019s rooms, everyone else is squeezed in together. There\u2019s no extra space for you to treat your injury.\u201d After the female disciple finished her proud words, she helped Bai Xiangxiu finish up her lavatory duties and carried her away again.</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangxiu only felt enough pain to writhe on the bed. Why were all martial arts practitioners so strong? She\u2019d been left in tons of pain, all right? After two days on the bed, she could finally walk again. By then, she figured it was high time that she returned to the capital. Since she knew Yu Kuang was right in the little room outside, she wanted to find him to ask about going back. He had no time during the day, and it was difficult enough to find him at night.</p><br/><p>She lightly knocked on the door before hearing movement from inside. But nobody came to open it. Strange. If Alliance Head Yu was inside, why wasn\u2019t he opening the door? She knocked again, and heard a muffled noise, but the door remained shut. Has something happened?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu stood listening outside the door, hearing muffled noises from within. It sounded like somebody had been gagged. Had Alliance Head Yu been kidnapped? How was that possible? But she couldn\u2019t just let the sound be after she heard it. Maybe he\u2019d eaten the wrong food or something.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu pushed on the door twice without effect before using her foot to kick it. She thought it wouldn\u2019t budge, but maybe the door was too old. It slowly swung open, but the inside was completely dark. Bai Xiangxiu swallowed and stepped inside, only to see a strange sight by the light of the moon.</p><br/><p>Alliance Head Yu Kuang was lying on the bed with something stuffed into his mouth. There was a rope that looped around his neck to tie his hands behind his back, and a gag in his mouth. She hurried over to light the oil lamp by the bed first, then proceeded to remove the gag. Brows furrowed, she asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the gag disappeared, the fairy-like face of Yu Kuang said weakly, \u201cBig sis, save me. What can I do now that they\u2019ve tied me up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Just what was going on here? Could anyone tell her? She\u2019s still waiting desperately online for answers!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis, my hand hurts. It hurts a lot. Can you help untie Sh\u016b\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWah!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t think it was too good for this child-like man who resembled Yu Kuang to remain tied up. But really, things were too strange. She was a little hesitant as she undid his bonds. Her movements weren\u2019t rough, but the other party seemed to feel greatly wronged and began to cry.</p><br/><p>1.

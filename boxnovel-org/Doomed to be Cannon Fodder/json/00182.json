However, he wasn\u2019t wearing a traditional red flower on top of his garb. I wonder if it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to, or because there\u2019s no such tradition here.</p><br/><p>Long Heng would often glance at Bai Xiangxiu from time to time. There\u2026 seemed to be hints of worry in his eyes? Ohh\u2026 So you actually do know that I\u2019d be sad if you marry another woman. Why else would you bother looking over here? Unfortunately, Bai Xiangxiu felt tiredness creep along her limbs, so she couldn\u2019t be bothered with him. And so, she slumped into her chair and asked Xiaoshi to massage her shoulders as she leaned her head against Xiaoshi, as if she was about to take a nap.</p><br/><p>Down in the thick of things, Long Heng was very depressed. He had gone to all this effort to prepare a spectacle for her and yet she seemed disinterested enough to want to sleep instead. Just when he was about to get someone to check on her health, the wedding matron suddenly announced, \u201cThe bride has arrived! The groom may receive his bride by kicking down the carriage door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without much of a choice, he could only step up to kick down the door. Some of the guests went outside to join in on the fun, but Bai Xiangxiu was feeling miserable. She couldn\u2019t bear to sit down anymore and wanted to rest in her room, but the second she stood up, she felt very lightheaded. She didn\u2019t particularly want to faint, so she decided to sit down for a little while more. Unfortunately, Long Heng took that moment to return with his new bride.</p><br/><p>The bowing rites should be coming next. Bai Xiangxiu was very woozy and wanted nothing more than to throw up. I don\u2019t want to see it. I feel so irritable. Everyone else looked nervously at the red-clad couple. They were waiting for them to perform their bowing rites. After that, they\u2019d send them off to the bridal chambers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu\u2026\u201d Xiaoshi was filled with worry as she held tightly onto her mistress, seemingly afraid that her mistress would collapse as soon as the maid let go. The old madame noticed the condition Bai Xiangxiu was in. She couldn\u2019t help but worry. Who summoned her here? What if she miscarries from her sorrow? Just when she was about to order a mama to escort her back to her room, one of the guests suddenly charged out with a weapon in hand. The old madame screamed loudly from the fright. Even Bai Xiangxiu herself gasped a little at the sudden turn of events.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Long Heng was able to avoid the attack just in time thanks to his experience as a military general. However, he wasn\u2019t able to completely avoid injury, blood spilling from a shallow cut. But his injury wasn\u2019t for naught as he was able to yank off the assassin\u2019s mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yunzheng\u2026\u201d Long Heng coldly uttered, even though he was actually feeling elated inside. He\u2019s finally revealed himself. It would\u2019ve been hard to continue this charade without him. If I were to really proceed with the bowing rites and take that Lin woman into my manor, wouldn\u2019t it anger my little woman to death? </p><br/><p>The bride was visibly agitated when she heard Luo Yunzheng\u2019s name. She immediately tore off her bridal veil, revealing Lin Qianzi\u2019s pitiful-looking face. After taking a look at Luo Yunzheng, she opened her mouth, as if on the verge of saying something. But she ultimately kept her words to herself. </p><br/><p>If she were to acknowledge Luo Yunzheng now, wouldn\u2019t she be admitting that she had a relationship with him? If that happened, she wouldn\u2019t just destroy her own reputation, but also the reputation of the entire Lin family. But there was something else she didn\u2019t understand. Why was he here when she\u2019d already clearly severed her relationship with him? Just as she was about to put her veil back on, Luo Yunzheng laughed and said to her, \u201cEven if it means death, I will take you with me today.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out for Lin Qianzi\u2019s hand with every intention of dragging her away. The guards from the Prince Li Manor immediately surrounded the two. He would have to fight to the death if he wanted to leave. </p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that you can escape from my manor while taking another person with you? Also, Miss Lin, this prince is curious. Just what is your relationship with\u2026\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t finish his sentence but the meaning behind his words was obvious. He was insinuating ignorance of their true relationship. </p><br/><p>The other guests had already connected the dots. After all, there were already widespread rumors that the daughter of the Lin family was seeing a man from the jianghu. Some even claimed that she was having an affair in her own residence. Everyone originally thought that those was just rumors, never imagining that any of it might actually be true.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Li. Will you give us your blessing?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you already have so many beauties in your estate, what would it matter to you to give Miss Lin to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Luo Yunzheng! Do you actually think that I would allow that to happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 I have no choice but to hack my way out of here!\u201d Roughly ten or so highly skilled experts revealed themselves from the crowd moments after he uttered those words. They tore into the guards, keeping them engaged. </p><br/><p>Long Heng took a step back and ordered, \u201cProtect the guests! Everyone else back away!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Luo Yunzheng was well aware of Leng Heng\u2019s weakness. His men started to make their way towards Bai Xiangxiu. How could Long Heng possibly allow him to do that? He had already assigned some of his concealed guards to protect her. But what he had failed to anticipate was the appearance of an even stronger expert, none other than Yu Kuang. Dressed as one of the members of the manor guards, he alone was worth an entire army. None of the jianghu men were able to get past him.</p><br/><p>Even though Long Heng was a little annoyed at Yu Kuang\u2019s appearance, the latter\u2019s presence truly did decrease his worries. Despite the presence of numerous manor guards, they were actually losing the skirmish. Many of the guards had already been injured, with some of the guests implicated as well. Long Heng\u2019s fury was increasing by the minute. He pointed at Lin Qianzi, \u201cMiss Lin. Why do you try to enter my house at all when all you truly want is to be with this man from the jianghu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Trembling in Luo Yunzheng\u2019s arms, Lin Qianzi was now as pale as a ghost. When she heard his accusation, she immediately shook her head and murmured, \u201cNo\u2026 Not true\u2026 I\u2026 No\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng continued, \u201cI would\u2019ve given my blessing to the both of you if I\u2019d known! Why must you trample on my dignity thus?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no relationship with him whatsoever!\u201d Lin Qianzi hardened her heart. For the Lin family, she must deny all accusations of her relationship with Luo Yunzheng.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng snickered coldly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you want to admit it or not, you will be coming with me today. I, Luo Yunzheng, am a respectable figure. I will not allow my woman to climb into another man\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his agitation, Luo Yunzheng had begun to reveal his scoundrel side and completely ignored the scene he was helping create. Long Heng immediately latched onto what he\u2019d said. He coldly asked, \u201cYour woman\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. She is my woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, halt!\u201d Long Heng suddenly yelled. Everyone immediately stopped fighting. He glanced at Bai Xiangxiu as servants rushed to bandage his wound. She seemed fine, but she was still looking back at him with concern in her eyes. Feeling a flicker of warmth in his heart, he continued. \u201cAlright. I will not be willingly cuckolded if she really is your woman. But since Miss Lin denies everything, there is only one way for us to solve this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng wasn\u2019t too keen on fighting with the entire armada of guards in the prince\u2019s manor either. What this woman had done just now had caused him much pain. But there was no going back. He had to take her with him, or he would lose all credibility in the jianghu. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng took another long look at them and said, \u201cHave some mamas check her. If she still remains a virgin, that means you are lying. This prince will marry her and take good care of her for eternity. But if she is no longer a virgin, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Li! How can you accuse your future wife of such things?\u201d Minister Lin had gotten word of the entire show and had immediately rushed to the manor with his men. </p><br/><p>Long Heng immediately retorted, \u201cThen how do you suggest we solve this, Minister Lin? If Miss Lin is truly innocent, then there\u2019s no reason for her to fear the test. If her body is found to be clean and untainted, this prince is willing to kneel and beg for her forgiveness. If she isn\u2019t\u2026 Minister Lin, you can answer for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was trembling from head to toe. She looked at Minister Lin and shook her head fiercely. Her virginity was long gone. There was no way to hide that if they were to check!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

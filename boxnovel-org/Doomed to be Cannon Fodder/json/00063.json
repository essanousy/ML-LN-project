But Song Jiaoyue was a perceptive type who at least knew more about women\u2019s matters than Long Heng. He was sensitive enough to stop asking questions and return with a smile.</p><br/><p>Still annoyed, Long Heng said, \u201cMadame Bai, don\u2019t raise this thing anymore. Since Sir Song likes it, just give it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu gave a start. This was her mainstay and pillar, something she definitely couldn\u2019t give away. Song Jiaoyue didn\u2019t want to snatch her favorite either, so waved his hand to say, \u201cNo need, how could I take away the madame\u2019s beloved\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng regretted his words after he said them. How couldn\u2019t he know how Madame Bai cared for that cactus? When others drew near it, she\u2019d carefully guard it against them. If he forced her to give it to someone else, she\u2019d definitely have a falling out with him. But since he already spoke up, he couldn\u2019t take back his words, so he said, \u201cThen have her be in charge of finding another one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu released a breath. At least she didn\u2019t have to give away her precious darling. But where was she supposed to find another cactus? In the midst of her thoughts, Huo\u2019er said, \u201cI like him. Give him one of my branches instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was really afraid that this prince would make her hunt for another cactus. More importantly, she wasn\u2019t sure where she could find a second. Huo\u2019er suggestion was perfect, so she said, \u201cActually, there\u2019s another way. Xiao Shi, bring over a pot with some dirt in it.\u201d It was easy to raise a cactus, so there was no need to worry.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi did as Bai Xiangxiu instructed. These days, she acted as second fiddle to her mistress in planting flowers and had already learned all sorts of skills. She\u2019d even gotten used to watering them and stuff all the time. After putting in the soil, she brought Huo\u2019er into her mistress\u2019s room as ordered.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu tested the scissors before feeling a little reluctant to cut. It\u2019d be fine if this was an ordinary cactus, but Huo\u2019er could speak and even cry for help! \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, she had no idea that those two men were skilled in martial arts and had sensitive ears. They heard every one of her words. Long Heng\u2019s lips twitched involuntarily. She was actually asking a plant if it hurt. Really, this Madame Bai, she left a person speechless.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue actually burst out into laughter, but covered it up with a cough. Then he turned to talk to Long Heng about nonsensical topics.</p><br/><p>Long Heng went along with him, though he was still worried about that young girl in his heart. Just then, he said that she\u2019d fainted. Was it because she\u2019d been frightened badly? But it was hard to speak about that while his friend was still here.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s heart ached as she cut away the bud that had sprouted from Huo\u2019er. Although he said it hurt, he seemed very happy, because this was an important link for cacti to reproduce. Expelling a breath, Bai Xiangxiu planted the soft shoot and gave it some water. After she checked to make sure everything was alright, she had Xiao Shi carry it out. It suddenly felt like she\u2019d raised a pet and given it away, even though this one couldn\u2019t talk yet.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was still very happy to receive this plant full of thorns. He repeatedly expressed his thanks before planning to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Song, this cactus differs from other plants. It only needs to be watered every two to three days, so don\u2019t pamper it too much.\u201d Don\u2019t water it to death.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue agreed to each and every point. He wanted to ask if she had any other tips, but Long Heng said, \u201cShu\u2019er, what are you dawdling outside for? Go and send Sir Song off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d Shu\u2019er answered before escorting the person out.</p><br/><p>But Long Heng then said, \u201cWhat are you all loitering for? Go call for a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bao Qin couldn\u2019t help but asked, \u201cYour Highness, but your leg\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince\u2019s leg is fine. Didn\u2019t you hear that your mistress fainted? What are you waiting for?\u201d These servants were really too unperceptive. </p><br/><p>Bao Qin was aggrieved. Their mistress had walked back here just fine and even planted a plant for someone else. Where did the fainting part fit in?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, this concubine is much better now.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu walked over. It was only a little faintness, so she really was much better now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back and lie down. There are naturally others here to wait on me.\u201d He had a guilty conscience. If his own impulsiveness hadn\u2019t resulted in him breaking Boss Liu\u2019s leg, she wouldn\u2019t have been frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen many thanks to the prince for your solicitude.\u201d When Bai Xiangxiu finished, she really did go straight off to rest. She wasn\u2019t feeling very well right now.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t rest for long before the doctor came to ask after her symptoms. When she heard it was only dizziness, he decided that she was blood deficient, so she got a prescription for some medicine.</p><br/><p>These wealthy young misses in ancient times were practically fed on medicine growing up. She had gotten to feeling unwell all over as soon as she heard the word \u2018medicine\u2019. But the prince was sitting next door, so she couldn\u2019t simply refuse. There was no helping it, she\u2019d have to drink!</p><br/><p>She only drank medicine for two days before the prince\u2019s injury was just about recovered. She could finally ask not to drink such bitter brews. Still, he remained at her place. It was really depressing.</p><br/><p>The Lin family finally made their move today by sending over nutritious items. Looking at the things spread out on the table, Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but feel they were a bit late. After all, their rescuer\u2019s injuries were just about healed when these items came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u2026 you can have them all.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t spare them a glance as he paced about the room. Though his steps looked somewhat awkward, it was hard to see any abnormalities without closer scrutiny.</p><br/><p>This fellow is still quite staunch, hmm? He deserves to be called a man of the military. But how was she to eat this pile of nutritious supplements?</p><br/><p>Long Heng walked two circles before he spoke to the servant who\u2019d delivered the gifts. \u201cGo back and tell the Lin family that this prince thanks them for remembering how he got his injury.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t so good, was it? After all, they were the prince\u2019s in-laws. But seeing that the prince\u2019s gaze held no signs of joking, he could only retreat and do as he was told.</p><br/><p>The Lin family servant\u2019s expression naturally turned dark upon receiving the message. He went back to report to Minister Lin and Madame Lin. Minister Lin threw down his cup and said, \u201cHe actually has face to mention his injury without seeing how he delivered the person! The wound on her head\u2019s yet to recover. She\u2019s still his future wife-to-be, couldn\u2019t he shield her better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Lin was angered to the point of tears. \u201cMy poor daughter was tossed into the backyard battered and exhausted, her body full of injuries! As her mother, I almost died from heartache at the sight. That girl actually insisted on saying not a word, only that he should be thanked for bringing her back. Do you bring people back like this? It was obvious he\u2019d just abandoned her there. Such a coldhearted icicle! if I\u2019d known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have betrothed her to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry. We\u2019ve already decided on this man. When I have time tomorrow, I\u2019ll talk with him on how to be conduct himself as a husband.\u201d Minister Lin was furious. If not for his daughter constantly pleading for him to thank the man, why would he bother being angry over something as trifling as sending gifts?</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, you have to thoroughly lecture that boy. Don\u2019t have him look down on our daughter in the future!\u201d Lady Lin said as she fanned the flames from the side.</p><br/><p>But Minister Lin only said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t blindly indulge our daughter, either. You have to discipline her where it\u2019s needed. She was wrong this time as well.\u201d Perhaps their daughter had good foresight to flee from her marriage after seeing how she couldn\u2019t entrust herself to Long Heng for the rest of her life. But the marriage had already been set. And moreover, they were the ones climbing up the social ladder with this match.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

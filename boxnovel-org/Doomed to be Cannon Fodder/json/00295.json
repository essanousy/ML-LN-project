You shouldn\u2019t be speaking for that man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not speaking for him! If it hadn\u2019t been for you, we wouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you slander me like this, junior sister? I didn\u2019t sleep all night because I was out searching for you. Master is my witness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it is true you didn\u2019t sleep all night because of a girl. Well, to be more precise, girls. You spent the night at Amorous Fragrance and slept with two girls there. The drug you used on Yu\u2026 Miss Yu also came from there. The madame is here as witness.\u201d A voice suddenly rang out. Yu Jiaoniang\u2019s face instantly reddened when she recognized the voice. She noticed that the alliance head\u2019s face was also blushing. This\u2026 this\u2026 seeing his face was enough for memories of how she\u2019d pushed the man down last night to surface in her mind. This is so embarrassing, what should I do??</p><br/><p>The sect head was surprised, things had taken a complex turn. Why was the wulin alliance head suddenly investigating his sect\u2019s matters and even brought people to help him resolve this headache?</p><br/><p>The senior brother also hadn\u2019t anticipated the appearance of the alliance head and was momentarily stunned. The madame gave a full recounting of his crimes as he stood there, dumbstruck. This b*tch is heartless alright! She promised me that she wouldn\u2019t say anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you treat your junior sister this way?! She viewed you as a brother!\u201d The old master of Jade Peak Hall\u2019s towering fury erupted as he bellowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a brother? She\u2019d rather be with some random stranger instead of me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said he\u2019s not some random stranger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who? Why are you trying to defend him even now?\u201d This time, the sect head frowned at her. His daughter had to marry after this! She couldn\u2019t be so freely taken advantage of! But judging from how she was behaving, she was acting like she was the one who\u2019d taken advantage of the other instead. She wasn\u2019t spitting out the name no matter what he said!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it was me.\u201d Yu Kuang was both a man and the alliance head, so no one doubted his words. Both Yu Jiaoniang and the senior brother kneeling on the ground were immensely taken aback after that confession. The sect head almost fell off his chair. He couldn\u2019t exactly be blamed for that either, this was simply too terrifying! His daughter had taken care of legendary block of ice, the alliance head himself! This\u2026 this\u2026</p><br/><p>No wonder his daughter had acted like it was she who\u2019d wronged the man. She really couldn\u2019t be blamed for something of this scale. The great alliance head sitting loftily on high, the millennium year old virgin was\u2026 no longer. He was even blushing! The sect head almost burst out in laughter. Who didn\u2019t want an alliance head son-in-law?</p><br/><p>The senior brother was completely stunned. Could someone please explain to him what was going on here? The junior sister was with the alliance head? Wait, wasn\u2019t he in for a world of hurt then?</p><br/><p>Just as he thought, he was hauled out to experience a world of hurt. As his pitiful wails faded into the distance, Yu Kuang awkwardly dropped to one knee and asked for Yu Jiaoniang\u2019s hand in marriage. How could the sect head possibly entertain second thoughts? He immediately nodded in agreement, but, much to everyone\u2019s surprise, his daughter spoke. \u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Why should they wait on such a good matter? One couldn\u2019t find such a good son-in-law no matter which desolate mountaintop they searched! Well, his daughter had stumbled upon him without even trying. Why should they reject such a stroke of good fortune? And yet here she was, protesting with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, what happened was a misunderstanding. You\u2026 didn\u2019t even know me before, so we can just forget anything happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you. You\u2019re Yu Jiaoniang. You also came to the last wulin gathering.\u201d Yu Kuang was a bit nervous; this would be the second time his proposal failed! No, I can\u2019t fail this time! And so he immediately treated this like a martial arts competition and stared Yu Jiaoniang down.</p><br/><p>All things put aside, the girl\u2019s nerves were as tight as harp strings after last night, so how could she possibly bear up beneath such an intense stare? She immediately fainted dead away.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang didn\u2019t hesitate and immediately revived her, staying by her side the entire day. There were wulin gatherings every year; that wasn\u2019t nearly as important as getting a wife. Someone might ask him at this point that, \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be a sexless block of ice? Why are you so anxious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who didn\u2019t want to get married at his age? Look at what a good life Long Heng was leading! Yu Kuang would be a fool if he wasn\u2019t jealous. With Long Heng\u2019s numerous kids running all over the place like living reminders of what he lacked, Yu Kuang would be a fool if he wasn\u2019t anxious.</p><br/><p>And so,Yu Kuang used all his patience to lure in his little wife and finally succeeded in the end. He too had children soon, and his little wife actually found his personality disorder quite fun. This actually depressed him a little, but of course that conversation would happen far, far into the future.</p><br/><p>And this is the official end of DCF!!

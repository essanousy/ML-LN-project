Hence, she didn\u2019t realize that sneaking out to play for a few days would cause such widespread, ugly rumours.</p><br/><p>What eloping with someone? She\u2019d already tried her very best to protect her chastity! No matter how much Luo Yunzheng had demanded it of her, she\u2019d refused to agree and even threatened him with her own life to dismiss the ulterior motives he possessed.</p><br/><p>Although she\u2019d been constantly being groped for the past couple of days, they\u2019d always stopped short of that final step. If my reputation is really tainted this way, I might as well die instead.</p><br/><p>Just when she had forsaken hope, the man on top of her suddenly rose up alertly to check the surroundings. He chuckled, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that he\u2019d dare to come alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He flicked his finger and sent something flying into the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Before Miss Lin even grasped what had happened, the item punched through the ceiling, followed by a tall handsome man who had leaped down from the rafters. He had barely landed on the ground before launching himself at the two on the bed. Miss Lin was so frightened that she immediately pulled her clothes tightly around herself and attempted to hide. However, the bed was only so big, so where could she go? She could only cower in one of the corners while watching the two men duel. Who would\u2019ve thought that the person who\u2019d come in fact Prince Li himself!</p><br/><p>She was very flustered at the moment. She\u2019d never imagined that the prince would personally come and save her.</p><br/><p>Yet, as he stood there, hints of a cold supercilious smile played about Long Heng\u2019s lips. The contempt and disgust that was evident in his eyes didn\u2019t sit well with Luo Yunzheng\u2019s pride. He spoke coldly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Prince Li to come personally, but this woman now belongs to me. Trying to take her back will be entirely up to your skills. But if you think it\u2019s going to be that easy, then I\u2019ll have to remind you that this isn\u2019t your princely estate, but my territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest. He\u2019d spent years walking the line of life and death on the battlefield, how could he hesitate due to someone from the jianghu? He reached for a short blade. \u201cAnd what of it? I will certainly take her away today, and if you\u2019re man enough, try and stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng was no stranger to the rascally nature that came from being part of the jianghu. He wasn\u2019t affected by Long Heng\u2019s threats and fired back, \u201cYou might be able to take her body back, but her heart remains here. Ahahaha, the only reason she snuck out was to escape her marriage to you. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng was extremely irritated by the blow to his pride. However, his face remained impassive as he said, \u201cEnough with the nonsense,\u201d. He hadn\u2019t even finished his sentence before striking out.</p><br/><p>Curled up on the bed, Miss Lin overheard Luo Yunzheng\u2019s comment about herself and felt utter disgust. Her chastity was absolutely intact, and when had she fallen for this jianghu ruffian? She would never be moved\u2026 yet\u2026 She didn\u2019t want him to get hurt. Prince Li was widely renowned to be ruthless. She\u2019d heard many stories about his rampages and massacres; the story of how he bathed a city in blood was enough to make one tremble with fear.</p><br/><p>Now that Prince Li had his eyes on Luo Yunzheng, the latter was doomed to an unfortunate fate. The battle between the two had already reached a frenzied degree, and Luo Yunzheng\u2019s arm had already sustained injury. Miss Lin screamed upon seeing the blood and cried, \u201cPlease stop fighting, don\u2019t fight anymore \u2026 \u201c</p><br/><p>Why would these two men listen to her when the fight had already escalated to this point? Luo Yunzheng had even forgotten to call in his own men for backup, and had just grabbed a sword to attack Long Heng. The fight was getting so violent that most of the furniture was caught in the crossfire, turning into nothing more than splinters and shreds of cloth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d Lin Qianzi was so frightened by the destruction of the bedhead that she shrieked and jumped off of the bed. However, her sudden movements resulted the two men slowing down the pace of their fight, as they grew wary of delivering any blows they couldn\u2019t pull back from.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng saw an opening and managed to knock away one of the twin swords Long Heng was wielding. However, Long Heng wasn\u2019t disadvantaged quite yet, and punished him with a heavy kick. Long Heng raised the blade in his hand and was about to charge forward when\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yunzheng, Your Highness! Please stop, don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Miss Lin threw herself forward, shielding Luo Yunzheng from the attack.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was baffled. Even though he had no regards for Miss Lin, he had made her father a promise, a father who\u2019d personally pled with him to bring her back. He would be unable to face her father if anything happened to her. Therefore, he hesitated for a split second, which caused him to slow down.</p><br/><p>The result of his hesitation quickly manifested itself as Luo Yunzheng darted past Lin Qianzi and lunged forward with his blade. Long Heng had finally reacted and pushed aside Lin Qianzi; she had truly become a hindrance. However it was too late to dodge Luo Yunzheng\u2019s attack, and the blade bit into Long Heng\u2019s thigh.</p><br/><p>Sounds of a disturbance stirring outside broke the duo\u2019s concentration. Long Heng realized that things were about to take a turn for the worse, so he leapt over to Miss Lin and scooped her up. Little did he know that his push had caused her to hit her head on the table, leaving a big lump bleeding on her forehead.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d been born with extraordinary good looks, but was now almost disfigured with this injury, retaining no trace of her former beauty. Long Heng clamped her firmly beneath his armpit and bounded through the ceiling with a powerful spring.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how you can hide from us with that injury while you haul a person along!\u201d Luo Yunzheng had actually been startled by Lin Qianzi\u2019s actions just now. He hadn\u2019t expected her to leap in at the crucial moment to take a blade for him. It was because of this that Prince Li hadn\u2019t slashed him, and he\u2019d retained his life. </p><br/><p>That woman was always trying to escape, but she\u2019s actually fallen for me. He stroked his chin and decided that he would definitely pursue her relentlessly in the future. Even if he was unable to catch up with them this time, it didn\u2019t matter as she would never be able to truly escape from him, just like a monk would never be quit of a temple.</p><br/><p>However, even if he was unable to catch up to them, he wanted Long Heng to bleed. It would actually be optimal if he had lost that leg. However, he didn\u2019t expect that Long Heng had reinforcements waiting for him. Luo Yunzheng\u2019s men somehow lost the duo halfway through their pursuit, and never found enough traces to track them again.. </p><br/><p>When he found out, Luo Yunzheng was so furious that he smashed everything in his sight, but there was nothing he could do. Nonetheless, other than an immediate fit of anger, he wasn\u2019t too bothered by it. He knew one very important detail, where Minister Lin\u2019s manor was located.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was welcomed into a secret chamber thanks to a person in the jianghu. He threw Miss Lin onto the bed so that people could tend to his wounds and ordered, \u201c Escort Miss Lin back, and tell them that she was injured by the bandits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, but since Your Highness has lost a lot of blood, please stay here to rest and receive treatment.\u201d The one kneeling down sincerely advised him, since the Prince seemed ready to rush through the night to get back to his manor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I can rest anywhere. This injury is nothing.\u201d Long Heng waved his hand. He\u2019d finally accomplished his mission and could finally return to the manor to see her.</p><br/><p>Just when he was thinking about her, Lin Qianzi awoke and pulled her clothes tightly around her in panic, observing her surroundings like an injured, little white bunny. When she saw Long Heng sitting upright to the side, she was secretly relieved. She\u2019d rather hoped that it would be him coming to her rescue.</p><br/><p>She just hadn\u2019t wanted Luo Yunzheng to be hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 hurt?\u201d She trembled a little as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d Long Heng replied coldly and signaled his subordinate, who got up and immediately walked over to Miss Lin. \u201cMiss Lin, this way please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing; where are you taking me to?\u201d Lin Qianzi leaned closer to Long Heng, but he actually stood up without looking back and walked away. \u201cRest assured, I won\u2019t send you back to the thieves\u2019 lair!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Miss Lin seemed to be in shock. She pushed that servant away and exclaimed, \u201cNo, don\u2019t touch me, I\u2019m not moving and I\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s subordinate was unable to get closer as she flailed. He could only furrow his brow, turning to the Prince, \u201cYour Highness, what should we do?\u201d She\u2019s obviously not cooperating, so how do I take her back? Should I use force against her or should I try to coax her? Being a servant is just so difficult!</p><br/><p>Long Heng words were curt, \u201cKnock her out and carry her back.\u201d</p><br/><p>For real?! Knock her out? This is your fianc\u00e9e we\u2019re talking about! Being a servant is seriously difficult! There was nothing for it. The servant formed a hand blade and chopped at the hiding Miss Lin\u2019s head. He had to resign himself to carting her back home like a sack of flour\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

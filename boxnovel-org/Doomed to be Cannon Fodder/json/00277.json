But after watching for a while, he only saw the scene of someone speaking to themselves. The plant seemed to be entirely silent. In addition, he thought the black devil\u2019s snare looked very strange. It was as if he could see blood vessels within its inky depths. Its flowers also bloomed only for a short period of time, then withered very quickly. As the saying went, \u201cFlowers do not blossom and remain red for more than a hundred days.\u201d</p><br/><p>But, this black devil\u2019s snare originated from Shu County and had come all the way to the capital. Despite going through so much, the flower still maintained its original form. Actually, no, the petals have definitely grown in size. Underneath the moonlight, it resembled a voraciously carnivorous plant. In some ways, Bai Xiangxiu was quite extraordinary for raising something so odd.</p><br/><p>While Long Heng was deep in thought, he suddenly heard Bai Xiangxiu cry out. He rushed to her side. \u201cOh no! Those two bastards want to bribe someone to murder you. What are we going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake note of your image. How can you use profanity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I forget about that every time I become emotional. But this isn\u2019t the time to talk about that! The emperor and Su Yun wants you dead. What are we going to do?\u201d Since Bai Xiangxiu was very hysterical, her face was turning red and puffy. Light glinted off her eyes and she looked extremely adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is exactly what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d Long Heng cupped his hands around her little face as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! This isn\u2019t the time to do that sort of stuff!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was flustered by Long Heng\u2019s ambiguous actions. In her agitation, she had failed to notice how close their faces were to each other, not to mention that Long Heng was exposing a lot of skin at the moment. He only had a pair of loose red trousers tied around his waist and a robe barely draped over his upper body. It would hardly take a tug to take everything off. There was a dangerous sort of sexiness to the man when he looked like that. It would be a bit concerning, but this ensemble completely revealed his well toned muscles. Although he was sitting very indolently, others would still feel an enormous amount of pressure merely from the sight of him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had been fine before she\u2019d taken a good look at this picture, and once she had, she found her husband immensely attractive. Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but become lost in her thoughts. However, Long Heng snapped her out of it when he began to pinch her flushed cheeks. \u201cAnd what are you thinking about? I\u2019m saying that I can\u2019t wait for them to come kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already arranged everything. No need to worry, my dear. I only need you to focus on resting. But I\u2019ll be tiring you out a little in the next few days because I want you to spend more time with me. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019ll be lonely when I\u2019m not around for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, eh? Then, this prince will let you experience what it feels like to be lonely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be getting naughtier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince should be asking you that question. The princess consort has been getting naughtier lately. You\u2019re deliberately bending your waist for me to admire. If this isn\u2019t seduction, then what is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to seduce you, okay? I am having a serious talk right now. Serious talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince is also serious. How wonderful it is to admire your various expressions on a daily basis.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t beat you. Ahhh\u2026 be gentle. Gentle! You\u2019re practically ripping it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. This prince already knows where your bottom line lies.\u201d And so, the initially serious night became very light indeed. The inappropriateness lasted through most of the night. Long Heng\u2019s stamina and skills had steadily improved since that first night. As a result, Bai Xiangxiu had no choice but to remain bedridden for three days. But she kept herself busy. She had the cactus moved to her bedside as she wanted instant notifications if anything were to happen.</p><br/><p>On her second bedridden day, Bai Xiangxiu overheard Su Yun and found out that they were ready to take action. It would appear that she didn\u2019t trust those who were around her. She would only speak of the matter when the emperor was around. Currently, Long Heng was both her and the emperor\u2019s target. They wanted him dead. But when it came to killing Bai Xiangxiu, the two had diverging opinions.</p><br/><p>Since they had already found an incredible team of assassins to kill Long Heng, and had already negotiated the price, Su Yun saw it as a good opportunity to get rid of the princess consort as well, in order to prevent trouble from later on. However, the emperor disagreed. He said a woman was nothing to fear. He wanted to keep her alive to get the gunpowder formula.</p><br/><p>Su Yun countered, \u201cWhy should we keep her? As long as you provide me with enough time and people, I can eventually figure the formula out on my own. Plus, the wound on my face will heal as long as we find a competent physician. By then, you will have both the beauty and the weapon. Why must you continue to long for that woman? What does she have that could make bewitch Your Majesty so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what nonsense are you spewing? I have other uses for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, deep down we both know the truth. You\u2019ve dreamt of N\u00e8e Bai ever since failing to get her in bed. You even call out her name when asleep. You\u2019re so infatuated to the point that you order your other concubines to purposely act weak and delicate to please you. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m unaware. But being intoxicated by women is the beginning of an emperor\u2019s downfall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPa\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is pa?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was confused when Huo\u2019er said the word \u201cpa\u201d.</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er thought about it, \u201cThat\u2019s the sound that happens when a human touches another human. Two nights ago, this sound kept coming from your room\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 no need to explain. I understand now.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu immediately came to the conclusion that the emperor had slapped Su Yun across the face. It would appear that their relationship was quite fragile. Since he\u2019d slapped her, they\u2019d probably left on bad terms. After the emperor left, Su Yun seemed to have gone nuts. She started muttering to herself all alone in her room. \u201cFine. Fine! If you\u2019re going to be heartless, don\u2019t blame me for being unjust. If you take in Bai Xiangxiu, she\u2019ll definitely not let me live. So why don\u2019t I simply drag you off your throne?\u201d</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su really seemed to have gone completely insane. But this might not be bad for them. Their relationship could be a mess for all Bai Xiangxiu cared. She was fine as long as she could warn Long Heng to be wary of being ambushed. But Long Heng had a tendency to wander off on his own. It was quite difficult to get in touch with him. Fortunately, he always returned at night, which was when Bai Xiangxiu updated him with what she\u2019d overheard. Long Heng remained calm through her explanation. He didn\u2019t seem the least bit affected by the news. All he was interested in doing was torturing Bai Xiangxiu to the point where she couldn\u2019t get up for six days. He kept going until Bai Xiangxiu felt the urge to strangle him in bed. Sadly, while she tried it, Long Heng\u2019s neck was too hard. It was an entirely useless move.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t too concerned about the situation either. She felt that Long Heng wasn\u2019t the type to play around with his life. He had most likely taken preventative measures.</p><br/><p>So she never would\u2019ve thought in a million years that Long Heng would return home in a litter so soon after his departure. His body was covered in blood as he was carried in. He looked like he was barely alive and was severely injured. Bai Xiangxiu felt her entire body turn ice cold. Seeing Long Heng like this, she couldn\u2019t control her tears. Remaining calm and preserving her image all went out the window. She nearly collapsed.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi and Xiaohuan were by her side as they supported her into the room. Long Heng was lying in bed while the doctor bound and bandaged him. The amount of blood irritated her eyes. Bai Xiangxiu felt like the chances of someone surviving after losing so much blood were slim to none. But at the same time, she was hoping for a miracle. However, when the physician turned around, he solemnly stated, \u201cThe prince has lost too much blood. I\u2019m afraid that\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Famous doctors from various places had come, and more continued to come. Even doctors from the enemy countries had been invited, which seemed a bit odd. Who had fallen ill in the palace for them to invite so many famous doctors?</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s trusted aide shook his head, \u201cIt seems that it\u2019s not a serious illness. Apparently these doctors all treat external injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Song Jiaoyue became increasingly curious. Even though he knew the palace had been searching for excellent doctors during this time, he felt it strange that they even invited some doctors from the enemy country.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo any of you know any famous doctors? Or, can any of you have someone place this on his body and take it into the palace with him?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu took out a fragrance pouch. The workmanship on it still didn\u2019t look like much.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue frowned with a twitch of his lips, \u201cWhat is this for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis object is very useful. Do you remember when I told you about entering the palace? This was how I discovered what was going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d This couldn\u2019t be possible, right? But when he saw her confidence, he felt that she didn\u2019t seem to be lying. All right, Song Jiaoyue conceded. He seemed to unconditionally believe her words now, even if her words were a bit mysterious and fantastical.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can put it on his body, but we have to put some banknotes inside.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s trusted aide indicated that he didn\u2019t have that much money!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately took out two banknotes from her sleeve and said, \u201cAre two hundred silver banknotes enough?\u201d She remembered the concept of a poor home making for rich paths, so had brought much money with her when she left home. Thus, Song Jiaoyue, Yu Kuang and everyone else looked at the pile of banknotes in her hand speechlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bring out all the money from the prince\u2019s mansion with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. This is just some pocket money that the prince usually gives me to spend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Song Jiaoyue coughed softly. This old friend of his really did favor this little concubine, actually going as far as to give her so much money! On the other hand, Yu Kuang was thinking, so it turns out she likes money\u2026 Should I give her some?</p><br/><p>This was why they said that public displays of affection had to be limited to the appropriate time location and audience. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s little display immediately struck the two men speechless. Bai Xiangxiu silently put the banknotes back. It seemed that the hearts of men were just as easily hurt as the hearts of women. She would have to keep this in mind in the future.</p><br/><p>She chuckled and continued, \u201cPerhaps, we can glean something from those famous doctors. I\u2019ll go into my room first.\u201d</p><br/><p>She went into her room to find Huo\u2019er and ask about the circumstances in the palace. However, her targets still didn\u2019t say anything of Long Heng. Where are they keeping him? However, the people in the palace didn\u2019t have the intention of harming the old madame and Xiao Lin yet. In fact, they were treating the two very politely and made no movements towards the Prince Li Manor either. From this, she could see that nothing had happened to Long Heng because if he\u2019d died, the emperor would have easily taken care of them by now.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be that easy to kill Long Heng either. Firstly, he was a loyal official, especially one who had been crowned with glory for his accomplishments in battle. Discussion was rife about him on the streets after her return to the capital. No one cursed at him possibly because he had won many battles. Most importantly, he had even exterminated many big and small cities and towns of the enemy nation, even forcing their people back to their old homes. This really boosted morale, so the people were all especially excited.</p><br/><p>In fact, this almost seemed like the Olympics or some competition with foreigners. No matter how badly the public normally thought of those athletes, public sentiment would completely change as long as they gained glory for their country. No one would believe the emperor if he was to suddenly announce some sort of crime that Long Heng had allegedly committed. But if the emperor was to take action after these times passed, then it would become much easier.</p><br/><p>They all understood this principle, but they still couldn\u2019t find the person they were searching for. As for Bai Xiangxiu, she was waiting for news from Huo\u2019er. It finally spoke of what if had gleaned from the fragrance pouch on the second day. It turned out the emperor had invited those famous doctors to help a girl heal the wounds on her face.</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er quickly told her of the circumstances inside, but it seemed that doctor had been too afraid to speak his thoughts, so they gained limited information. However, Bai Xiangxiu had still grasped the situation a bit more clearly. The emperor asked right after the doctor had entered, \u201cCome look at the wounds on this lady\u2019s face. Is there any way to heal them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Bai Xiangxiu had determined that the person speaking was the emperor, Huo\u2019er also called him the emperor as it relayed the events of the situation. The doctor assented and walked over. The emperor spoke again after roughly ten minutes, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will definitely heal your injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks to Your Majesty. I am already very happy that Your Majesty has summoned all these dermatologists to look at my injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er said that this was a woman\u2019s voice. After some analysis, Bai Xiangxiu felt the only person who would dare address herself as \u201cI\u201d in front of the emperor could only be Su Yun. Moreover, the woman had used the more exact term of dermatologist to refer to the doctors. But that wasn\u2019t right. Wasn\u2019t Lin Qianz the one locating doctors for her? How come the emperor was doing this now? Plus, it was extremely peculiar for the emperor to speak these words to a slave.</p><br/><p>The current doctor said the wound was very deep and that it would be a bit difficult to help it recover its former appearance. It was likely that a scar would remain for the rest of her life. The emperor heard this became extremely angry when he heard this. \u201cGet out! Get this quack out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was promptly thrown out, leaving Bai Xiangxiu unable to hear anything else because the cactus spines had also been taken out of the room. However, she felt that perhaps the emperor hadn\u2019t bedded just Lin Qianzi, but also Su Yun. Everyone spoke of the beauty seducing the man, but it was likely that only a transmigrated female could seduce a man completely with destroyed looks.</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to become resigned from being unable to discover any news of Long Heng, Song Jiaoyue suddenly returned from his home with a very strange expression on his face. He called everyone over before speaking, \u201cLast night, a man in black entered my room. His level of martial arts was very powerful and he left after a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Something worth gathering everyone together for was absolutely not simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that Long Heng is imprisoned in the Imperial Justice Dungeons. That place has been abandoned for many years.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu became excited but when she thought about it, but calmed down after pacing in a circle, \u201cSir Song, do you think this is a trap?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue sighed. It was good she had calmed down, otherwise he didn\u2019t know how he would have convinced her. \u201cThere\u2019s that possibility. That man\u2019s level of martial arts ability was so high that even I could not catch up to him. For this type of a man to bring this type of news, it\u2019s a bit suspicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, this was such a difficult piece of news to attain. We can\u2019t go without confirming this.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pondered this. If this is a trap, it\u2019s probably aimed at Long Heng\u2019s trusted aide and Song Jiaoyue. Song Jiaoyue in particular actually. If he really does take action, he might be implicated, and when the time comes, the entire Song clan will be done for.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang spoke up at this moment, \u201cWhat about I\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if this is a trap, all of you may be lost forever. How would they have possibly sent anyone to Sir Song if all preparations hadn\u2019t been made already?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

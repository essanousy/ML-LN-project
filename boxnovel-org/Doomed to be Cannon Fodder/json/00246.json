The royal entourage even boasted of horses with all red fur. Bai Xiangxiu was truly having her eyes opened today, but busied herself with setting up camp after entering the mountain. Every household set up camp according to instructions from the palace servants. Because Prince Rong hadn\u2019t come, the highest ranked after the emperor was Prince Li. Therefore, their camp was right next to the royal camp site at the second highest position. After them was the Lin family, as they were now royal in-laws!</p><br/><p>Minister Lin felt quite vindicated now. His own daughter was a Noble Lady, and he\u2019d heard that it was only a matter of time before the emperor elevated his daughter\u2019s position. How would he not be happy about this? When taking another look at Long Heng, he felt that his daughter had been quite correct in not choosing him. Prince Li was just a pawn that the emperor would get rid of at any moment! Look at him now, serving his daughter and son-in-law!</p><br/><p>The camp was quickly set up and Bai Xiangxiu also put the carriage into order. Everyone was given some breathing space after arriving before setting out again, so she and Long Heng sat in the tent for a while before setting out after hearing the signal. They were to be horseback this time, whether man or woman, with some palace and personal servants following behind with other items. They would also collect any spoils of the hunt and prepare them to be feasted on during lunch.</p><br/><p>Long Heng couldn\u2019t ride at the moment, so he laid on the litter and was carried by four people. Elevating a concubine to a wife was usually a matter to be laughed at, but when everyone saw the highly spirited Bai Xiangxiu cutting a sharp figure, they all felt that Prince Li\u2019s beating had been worth it. Song Jiaoyue in particular felt that a cat was heavily scratching at his heart, and he was unable to calm his emotions for the longest time.</p><br/><p>He acutely felt how useless he was, and how he was even less than Yu Kuang. Although the wulin head liked her as well, he was able to put down the emotional burden he\u2019d taken on his shoulders. He returned to the wulin once he saw her safely back to the manor and had left with a dashing grace. But what of Song Jiaoyue? He always wanted to see her again and was unable to fully let go of things, but never had any idea what to say when he finally saw her, and could only look at her from afar.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had practiced horse riding at Tranquil City, having been a part of an accelerated class at that. Truthfully, she\u2019d been forced to learn as fast as she could, and now sat both steadily and handsomely on her horse. How would any ordinary woman compare to her? Add to that her clean, neat appearance today and a lovely looking bow hanging jauntily off her saddle, her beautiful and flawless face evoked admiration and envy no matter how one looked at her.</p><br/><p>This was most apparent from Lin Qianzi. She was clad pertly in white today, and looked quite pitiful after her miscarriage. That\u2019s right, she\u2019s the female lead after all, how would she not draw eyeballs when she looks pitiful? But\u2026 is it really appropriate to be dressed in all white? 1 Bai Xiangxiu ignored that ferocious glare coming from her and walked side by side with Long Heng\u2019s litter.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably going to make a move against you, be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, be at ease. I know very well what she wants to do.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was quite confident. These \u2018bugs\u2019 I\u2019ve got are so good for eavesdropping, and they\u2019re completely natural and without any harmful side effects. Even if they\u2019re found, no one will know what they\u2019re used for. They\u2019ll only think it\u2019s a fragrance pouch used to put down a curse! She somehow ended up walking side by side with Lin Qianzi. Bai Xiangxiu subconsciously looked around and noted that there weren\u2019t any veiled maids beside the female lead. Did Su Yun not come? What a weird feeling, but it also makes sense, since she\u2019s not the sort to go off the deep end in search for revenge. She understands very well how to make use of others. And yet, why did she help Lin Qianzi previously, but not show up today?</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to Consort Li. You\u2019ve finally gotten what you want,\u201d Lin Qianzi spoke with a smile, but it was infused with sarcasm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all thanks to the emperor\u2019s favor.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t know how to speak pretty words? It\u2019s just a contest of who can be the most gracious and well-mannered. I\u2019ve been pretending at this all along. Pfft!</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you suffering under the elements just after being elevated. Consort Li is good-natured to not complain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lady jests. When even a Noble Lady with such elegance like yourself doesn\u2019t complain, what right does someone like this consort have to pick and choose? Besides, the breeze is refreshing today and the scenery a delight to the eyes. It\u2019s quite appropriate for playing games.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a bit dull to only ride on horses with such beautiful scenery in front of us.\u201d Lin Qianzi urged her horse forward after speaking, arriving next to the emperor and murmuring a few words.</p><br/><p>The emperor reached out a hand and the convoy immediately came to a halt. A eunuch soon announced in a shrill voice, \u201cThe emperor has given orders that it is too uninspiring to walk along thus for the autumn hunt. Therefore, Noble Lady Qian has suggested that the ladies of each household can hold a contest. Whoever is the first to bring down bring will receive a jade horse. This horse was offered as tribute from the barbarians and is quite precious. She will also receive one golden fur coat that is a treasure from the late emperor. It\u2019s warm in winter and cool in summer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Long Heng\u2019s eyes narrowed when he heard these two items. Bai Xiangxiu asked quietly, \u201cAre they really good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, particularly the golden fur coat. It\u2019s impervious to blades and spears. It\u2019s really quite a treasure.\u201d He took a look at Bai Xiangxiu after speaking and noticed that her eyes were sparkling. I. want. it!! was written in them. Long Heng coughed lightly, now this was being just a bit too obvious. He couldn\u2019t help but remind her, \u201cBe careful of traps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there will be traps, but I\u2019m well prepared. Long\u2026 um, Your Highness, do you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d I do, but I\u2019m worried. However, Long Heng wasn\u2019t the sort to voice sweet words, especially when there were so many around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful, but so do you too!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was able to step forward so boldly because she had such a shield behind her. Thanks to Long Heng\u2019s attentions and care, the previously cowardly Bai Xiangxiu had built up her confidence, and even she felt that she was a bit over the top these days. Well, you only live once! And why would I be like this if they hadn\u2019t started things?</p><br/><p>\u201cWill anyone participate?\u201d The eunuch yelled. However, many of the ladies couldn\u2019t even sit properly on their horses, much less participate in a contest!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will!\u201d It was the first time that Bai Xiangxiu had spoken so loudly in front of others. Her voice rang surprisingly crisp. There wasn\u2019t a hint of hoarseness in it at all. One had to say, her voice really did sound good, even she was lulled by it for a moment. I guess I don\u2019t have to put on an act for the rest of my life! Apparently even the women of olden times can live with their heads held high. No wonder the female lead had grown so out of control in the novel and unsettled an entire city with her antics. She\u2019d realized that she had a man who loved her and who would always stand behind her. This was why she\u2019d been so fearless. And now, that man stood behind Bai Xiangxiu. It was a wonderful feeling.</p><br/><p>An indescribably stunning women slowly urged her horse to the front as the crowd watched with astonished eyes. Her clothing fluttered in the wind, the blue color somehow seeming more pure than Noble Lady Qian\u2019s robes of white.</p><br/><p>I think you guys will like this next arc\u2026 and in the meantime, participate in the great chibi contest! Win a free shirt!</p><br/><p>1. In Chinese customs, one wears all white when in mourning. Lin Qianzi is drawing attention to the fact that she\u2019s mourning for her child, a child that the emperor didn\u2019t father.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

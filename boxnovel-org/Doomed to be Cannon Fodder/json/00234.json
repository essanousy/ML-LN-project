Song Jiaoyue had no choice but to interfere and break up the fight, revealing his identity in the process. Once they recognized Long Heng\u2019s \u201cwife, the men insisted on escorting Bai Xiangxiu back to the capital. They just wanted to help Long Heng in any way they can. In any case, many hands made for light work. Bai Xiangxiu decided to head back to the capital with the accompaniment of these people.</p><br/><p>However, they would surely be at the center of attention considering how large their group was. So they decided to disguise themselves as they entered the city. There was one major issue that they\u2019d yet to address, and that was Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s outstanding appearance. Nobody would\u2019ve batted an eye if a common beauty decided to enter the city gates, but Bai Xiangxiu was the city\u2019s top beauty! She would surely be the center of attention if she entered the city looking like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll disfigure myself!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu said ruthlessly. However, everyone else quickly vetoed the idea. They were all trying to save her husband. How would they explain to Long Heng why his wife had become ugly after they\u2019d saved him? \u201cI mean I will disfigure myself with makeup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Judging from the expressions on their faces, they probably thought I was going to cut my face with a knife. Bai Xiangxiu would never do that even if her life depended on it. One had to understand that a knife to the face was actually very painful. This suddenly reminded her of Su Yun. She was a woman that was as proud as a peacock. I bet she\u2019s incredibly furious at Long Heng for ruining her face! With her abilities, there\u2019s no doubt that she will eventually stage a comeback! It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a tiger in front of Long Heng and a wolf behind.</p><br/><p>However, Su Yun probably won\u2019t be able to create too much trouble for now; she still isn\u2019t too familiar with this world. Bai Xiangxiu consoled herself mentally while putting on makeup to disfigure herself. Yu Kuang helped her out. As a man from the jianghu, he knew how to make it look more realistic and believable. It didn\u2019t take long before a very horrifying birthmark was drawn on her outstanding face, but that was not all they did. They also thickened her eyebrows and even made her lips seemed chapped. She genuinely looked like a different person.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. She was sure that she would frighten a few people with her current appearance. Surprisingly, that didn\u2019t happen. The others were just incredibly astonished by how she\u2019d managed to turn such a beautiful face into something like that. Bai Xiangxiu touched her face and smiled awkwardly. \u201cDo I look very ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re very beautiful.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s looks didn\u2019t really matter to Song Jiaoyue. To him, her beauty was beyond her outer appearance and came from deep within her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu found her question very silly. \u201cLet us depart. We will enter the capital separately.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was dressed as an ugly woman as she carried a basket of eggs into the city as though she was about to sell them. However, Song Jiaoyue entered the city on his horse with his head held high. There was no need for him to disguise himself. Some of the others were dressed like farmers, while the rest were dressed as beggars. It wasn\u2019t hard for them to collectively sneak into the capital as they were all very capable.</p><br/><p>They all went their own way to do some work before they gathered at one of Song Jiaoyue\u2019s houses. Bai Xiangxiu had been busy sending out feelers and realized that nobody in the city knew that Long Heng was already back. He was clearly being arrested in secret. \u201cWhere should we begin with our plan to rescue Long Heng?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, we need to know why he was summoned back to the capital. Someone could be pulling the strings from behind, but it might be the emperor\u2019s own intentions too,\u201d Song Jiaoyue took the lead in explaining, as he was much more familiar with the inner workings of the court.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that means we have to enter the palace. But how are we supposed to do that? Is there someone you know who\u2019s in the palace right now?\u201d Long Heng\u2019s trusted aide asked. </p><br/><p>\u201cWe do. The old madame is in the palace but we can\u2019t get in touch with her. It\u2019s simply impossible,\u201d Song Jiaoyue replied with his brows furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve have a plan. Sir Song, I have to return to the Prince Li Manor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu winked and returned to the Prince Li Manor under the silent protection of Song Jiaoyue and her ugly appearance. She reluctantly crawled into the manor via the hole that she\u2019d used last time. Song Jiaoyue had gotten used to it by now. There was just so many sides to her, dumbfounding him each time.</p><br/><p>How many women could have led such an exciting life during the olden days? Back then, women mostly lived deep in the rear courts. Their sole purpose in life was fulfilling the needs of their men while slowly growing old, and eventually dying. But Bai Xiangxiu was different. Despite her weak and feeble outer appearance, she was doing things that only the tough and strong-willed would be able to do.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was being extremely cautious even after she slipped into her own courtyard. The servants were being a little more lackadaisical as none of their masters were at home. It didn\u2019t take her too much effort to arrive at Apricot Garden since everyone only treated her as just another servant when they saw her. She was even carrying something as part of her disguise. She waltzed into her own room and picked up Huo\u2019er. However, Xiaoshi was already standing by the door with a shoe in her hand when Bai Xiangxiu turned around. She immediately shouted, \u201cSomeone is stealing a plant\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately covered her mouth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me! Don\u2019t call for help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame\u2026 Xiu?\u201d Why do you look like this now?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m here to retrieve Huo\u2019er for something. Don\u2019t raise a commotion over this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 where are you going? And when will you be back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to you at a later date. Xiaoshi, be good and stay put in the manor. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201d Xiaohuan was left behind in Shu County as well. Hopefully, she\u2019ll be able to come back when things have settled down and we can go back to our previously peaceful lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoshi wants to follow you. Xiaoshi will follow you no matter where you\u2019re going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good. Things will settle down soon, but I can\u2019t take Xiaoshi with me before that happens.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was worried that even more people would learn of her return, so she quickly warned Xiaoshi. \u201cDon\u2019t mention to anyone that I\u2019m back. Alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi could only nod as tears slowly welled up in her eyes. She didn\u2019t know why but she had a feeling that Madame Xiu was about to do something very important. Bai Xiangxiu patted Xiaoshi\u2019s head and crawled out of the manor through the hole, bringing Huo\u2019er with her. Song Jiaoyue was about to collapse. Bai Xiangxiu seemed like she had a plan just now, but all she took from the manor was just this random potted plant.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately shut herself into her room when they returned to the house and finally came out after half a day. She took out a fragrance pouch that seemed like it was newly made. \u201cSir Song, can you make sure this gets to the old madame in the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will find a way, but I\u2019m afraid that I can only do this once. I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t help you if you want her to reply,\u201d Song Jiaoyue frowned. Even if the old madame knew something, it would be impossible to get her message out of the palace. </p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a reply. As long as she talks about her findings in a place with nobody around, I can immediately know of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu stuck out her tongue in a rather playful manner and refused to tell him anything else. Nobody would believe her anyways.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

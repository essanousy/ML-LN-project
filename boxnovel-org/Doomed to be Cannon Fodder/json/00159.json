If she wasn\u2019t wrong, that was a touch of animosity in that gaze of hers.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu struggled to maintain her smile, but privately felt that she shouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of her. Or rather, there was no need for her to be afraid. The female lead had never once harmed her character in the novel, and she had already tamed the male lead that had killed off her character. What did she need to be afraid of the female lead for?</p><br/><p>No longer afraid, she straightened her back. Unfortunately, she slightly overextended her back while doing so and winced in pain. It seems this is the price I have to pay to tame the male lead. My back is killing me!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do. It is very unfortunate that I have to trouble you with the arrangements instead.\u201d Like mother said, I\u2019m too kind-hearted. I have to be a little more ruthless towards the concubine favored by the prince. Otherwise, she might climb above my head. </p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi whole-heartedly believed that she was in such a situation right now. In fact, Bai Xiangxiu was sitting in the host\u2019s chair, while she had to settle for the guest chair. She was supposed to be the mistress of the prince\u2019s estate, but she was being treated like a guest instead. The old madame\u2019s words had also irked her. What is she trying to imply by saying that I\u2019ll be leaving after a couple of days? Why would I want to hide in the prince\u2019s estate if not for the fact that I was forced to and had no say in the matter? </p><br/><p>I wouldn\u2019t have lost my virginity if the prince hadn\u2019t ignored and deserted me in the Red Maple Mountain Villa! It\u2019s clearly his fault! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong! Mother is right. He should take responsibility since it was all his fault. I will definitely move into the prince\u2019s estate and become the mistress of the household here! Lin Qianzi had resolved to lay claim to the seat of host when the nationwide period of mourning was over. After that, the concubine would have no choice but to bow in her presence. Determined, Lin Qianzi lifted her chin and gazed straight at Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s eyes. Sparks seemed to fly through the air where their gazes crossed paths. </p><br/><p>\u201cYe-mama. Tidy up the western guest house and help Miss Lin settle in.\u201d I\u2019ll arrange for her to be further from me since she clearly sees me as her enemy. Come to think of it, that place is quite close to the old madame\u2019s residence. Bai Xiangxiu had to let the old madame know the intentions behind her arrangement, so she quickly added, \u201cThat place is a little nearer to the old madame\u2019s residence, so it will be much more convenient for you to visit her.\u201d </p><br/><p>This arrangement is flawless! I don\u2019t think that the female lead will be able to find any fault with my arrangements even if she wanted to. However, I don\u2019t understand why the female lead seems to be harboring such enmity towards me. Long Heng has yet to show interest in her, while she\u2019s already slept with another man.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but notice that both the plotline and the female lead\u2019s way of thinking had diverged from the novel, but she wasn\u2019t sure why. Fortunately, heaven itself seemed to be helping her in everything she did at the moment. This was probably all due to the male lead being on her side. Or maybe\u2026 She felt this way because she was in love? </p><br/><p>It was almost noon by the time she was finished making all the arrangements for the female lead. She had the servants prepare lunch and waited for Long Heng to return. Bai Xiangxiu was actually worried that the male lead would visit the female lead instead. She was so caught up in her thoughts that she absentmindedly cut her finger while she was chopping vegetables. It didn\u2019t take long before blood started to flow. </p><br/><p>Due to her hemophobia, she quickly froze in shock. She only came to her senses when she heard Xiaoshi call out her name and was lifted into a warm embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so careless? Does it hurt a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only had Long Heng returned, he had chosen to return to her side instead of visiting the female lead. Bai Xiangxiu felt instant relief flood through her.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to hook her arm around the male lead\u2019s neck. She then moved her face closer and began to take in his fragrance, like it gave her energy. </p><br/><p>Long Heng, in his own way, also consoled her for a bit. He only asked about Lin Qianzi after she felt better from lying down for a bit. Unexpectedly, the male lead had known that she would come, but seemed very unwelcoming to her. Disgusted, even. Since Bai Xiangxiu was no longer afraid of communicating openly with him, she immediately asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl is causing the Lin Manor too much trouble, so they have no choice but to send her to my estate. They\u2019re so desperate for me to marry a girl who\u2019s cuckolded me in every way possible, shoving me into bright, dazzling green hat.\u201d Before, Long Heng would be openly seething with anger. But since he\u2019d taken Bai Xiangxiu, he had learned to hold back his temper while in her presence. This was mostly due to the fact that he felt that she was simply too feeble. He would always take extra caution when doing things in her presence, always holding back his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 That is true. It\u2019s a very green hat indeed.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was recalling some of the female lead\u2019s actions and the top quality male supporting characters that she would meet later. It would definitely be quite troubling. Thus, the words came out of her mouth quite subconsciously. Realizing how those words sounded, she immediately covered her mouth with shock. Oh no. Will I be punished for this?</p><br/><p>Long Heng flipped her over and gave her a nice firm tap to her butt, making Bai Xiangxiu yelp in pain. \u201cWuuuu\u2026 Your Highness, I will never let my mouth run off like that anymore. It hurts so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only partly an act, but because of how her face looked, it was highly effective. The wound on her face was mostly healed by now because she had been applying the medicine that the doctor had given to her. There was only a small scar left, and she had drawn a tiny flower on it to cover it up, which made her look even more seductive. What man could hold himself back after watching mist well up in her eyes as she cried out with pain? Long Heng could feel his body heat up. He gave her another gentle slap and said \u201cI will punish you later tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>A panicked expression immediately appeared up on Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face. She grabbed onto Long Heng and said, \u201cDon\u2019t! Please just punish me right now. Immediately! Don\u2019t wait until nightfall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t there only one kind of punishment left that he can administer when night arrives? However, Long Heng furrowed his brows and said, \u201cIs that really alright? We have yet to have lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! Lunch can wait!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu abandoned her face and her dignity to avoid abuse at nightfall. Despite the obvious look of hesitation on his face, Long Heng got up and walked to the door to lock it. </p><br/><p>Ehh\u2026? Isn\u2019t this a bit weird?</p><br/><p>He then began to undress himself while he was walking back towards Bai Xiangxiu. He even complained, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so impatient. I wanted to leave it for tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately sensed that something was wrong. Can it be that this man has mistaken the meaning behind my words? She quickly leaped up and grabbed onto his misbehaving hands and said, \u201cYour Highness. Can\u2019t we find another method of punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Can you stop thinking about those kinds of things even for a minute? Even though it is a show of your love, love that is too strong can be overbearing too!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Then tell me. How do you want this prince to punish you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 What other punishments\u2026 are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this prince has come up with something. Why don\u2019t we give it a try?\u201d Long Heng lifted her up and laid her onto the bed. He pinned her down and rained kisses down on her. When he arrived at her neck, he began to put in more force. The tingling sensations made Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s body tense, but she couldn\u2019t quite come up with a way to describe the feeling. It was a little painful, yet it was a little pleasant at the same time. She couldn\u2019t resist letting out little moans of pleasure. Suddenly, the prince bit her! </p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! Your Highness! Why did you bite me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYell again and it will no longer be something as simple as just a nibble.\u201d Long Heng lifted his head while he was still covering her. Even though he was smiling, there seemed to be a hint of naughtiness in his smile.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could sense that he was up to something as she stared at him blankly. Unexpectedly, he began to calm down instead. He lifted her off the bed and said, \u201cTime for lunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>And just like that, she was freed. Things are settled with just a kiss?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

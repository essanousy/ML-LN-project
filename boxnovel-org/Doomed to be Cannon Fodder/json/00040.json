As expected, this woman was a weakling. She\u2019d agreed so easily!</p><br/><p>The second madame began to stroll around the room. As she walked, she discovered a colored glaze decoration next to the cactus plant. It was a simple globe, but it shone with a dazzling light beneath the sun, adding a modicum of color and beauty to the room. Colored glaze was quite a rare product in ancient times, so it was quite precious. The prince must have gifted it to her. In a fit of jealousy, she picked it up and started to play with it as she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to see something like this; where did little sister get it from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince had someone send it over. Mistress needs to drink medicine at nighttime, and a single candle isn\u2019t bright enough.\u201d Xiao Shi was a little worried. If anything happened to the item his lordship had sent over, Madame Xiu would definitely be punished.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? His Highness has really given the matter much thought!\u201d The second madame pretended to put the object back, but purposefully let it slip out of her hand to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d At the same time, she let out an ear piercing shriek, as her acting had caused her hand to bump into the cactus. Unexpectedly, the thorns pierced into her flesh. Cradling her hand, she screeched, \u201cWhat is this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi threw herself over to the pieces of the colored glaze pieces. \u201cAh, Second Madame, this is something his lordship gave Madame Xiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I was just careless. Your Mistress hasn\u2019t even spoken yet, so what\u2019s a servant like you going on about?\u201d The second madame waved her arm as if in great pain from the thorns, before giving a hostile look to the cactus. \u201cWhy is Fourth Sister raising such a horrific thing? You might as well throw it away.\u201d So speaking, she moved to pick it up.</p><br/><p>Sensing danger, Huo\u2019er suddenly cried out, \u201cSave me, Mistress! Save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu clenched her teeth. She\u2019d seen shameless people before, but never people this outrageous. After breaking her things, they even wanted to ruin her Huo\u2019er. Do they really think I\u2019m so easy to bully?! She abruptly stood up and closed the distance between herself and the second madame with a few steps, using strength to forcefully push her aside so she could shield Huo\u2019er. \u201cSecond Madame, what are you doing? This is something I\u2019m raising, not you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second madame was uncomfortable after getting pricked, but when she saw the pushover, steam bun-like fourth madame suddenly so agitated, she couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cAren\u2019t I just worried that you\u2019d be in danger? It\u2019s a sign of my good intentions. Hasn\u2019t little sister seen how my hand\u2019s been pricked?\u201d As she spoke, she pulled aside her sleeve to show off her hand, though no injury was visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that Second Madame got pricked, but that wouldn\u2019t have happened if you hadn\u2019t gone over. It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a dog that runs around biting people.\u201d Everyone had their own trigger. This cactus that could speak to her heart and existed as the only one of its kind was hers. If she needed it to prick her in one year and send her home, she couldn\u2019t let it get hurt.</p><br/><p>The soft and pliable Madame Xiu had completely changed her tune. The senior madame thought it wasn\u2019t wise to provoke her too much and laughed. \u201cForget it, isn\u2019t it just a prick? Come and let me see, perhaps I can help little sister pick out the thorns.\u201d When she finished speaking, she pulled the second madame over to sit down and look for thorns in her hand.</p><br/><p>The two of them were filled with deep sisterly affection, but to Xiao Shi, the situation had just turned worse. Her own mistress had scrambled off the bed herself to protect the cactus even though she\u2019d spent the last few days leaning on others just to walk around. Thus, she gently supported her and asked, \u201cMadame Xiu, how are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Shi, I think something\u2019s a little wrong.\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Shi peeked at her back and saw darkish red blood seeping out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s bleeding again. You must have split open your wound again just now. Hurry back to the bed and lie down.\u201d It was all those two madames\u2019 fault. If they hadn\u2019t come, her mistress wouldn\u2019t have to suffer so much.</p><br/><p>When the senior madame and second madame saw the sudden bleeding, they stopped looking for thorns. Neither of them had realized her injury was so severe. Meanwhile, Ye-mama decided to be solicitous and come in, upon which she said, \u201cMadame Xiu, his lordship has sent a doctor and nurse over to help you\u2026 aiya, what\u2019s happened?\u201d Her heart grew worried as she saw the person lying on the bed in a cold sweat from the pain.</p><br/><p>Then she spotted the mess on the floor and angrily rebuked, \u201cYou chit! How did you look after your Mistress? If she\u2019s frightened or hurt, how will you explain it to His Highness and Old Madame? You\u2019re really no end of worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had no way of lecturing the senior madame and second madame, so she had to use Xiao Shi as a scapegoat. Xiao Shi felt wronged but couldn\u2019t say anything back. She too knew that Ye-mama wasn\u2019t really aiming for her, so she didn\u2019t speak. Instead, she just let a few tears cascade down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you crying for? The doctor will be here soon. Ah, these two madames, if you would. Our space is small and there will be someone making medicine and doing examinations later. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll frighten you two, so why not\u2026\u201d They still hadn\u2019t beat it. All of them would be punished for inferior service; she really was infuriated by these two troublesome demons.</p><br/><p>Ye-mama was originally one of the old madame\u2019s people, so the two madames didn\u2019t dare refute her words. They exchanged glances before rising to leave.</p><br/><p>The doctor and nurse arrived as soon as they left. As the doctor gave directions from outside, the nurse personally changed Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s medicine. Her movements were very light, but Bai Xiangxiu still felt pain. She lay on the bed, muttering in agony and completely unaware that a man had walked in. The only man in the complex who would walk into her quarters unannounced was Long Heng, who heard her groans of pain as soon as he entered. He glanced over at the doctor.</p><br/><p>The doctor immediately kneeled and spoke. \u201cI heard that the injury split open the length of a finger-width. Fortunately, it hasn\u2019t been infected, so the nurse is taking care of it now. May Your Highness set your cares at rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen get up!\u201d He wanted to go in for a look, but felt that it was too sudden. After all, the two of them didn\u2019t have any real connections yet. More importantly, he was worried that she\u2019d be startled again somehow.</p><br/><p>As soon as he turned around, he saw the colored glazed sphere that he\u2019d gifted her shattered on the ground. When he recalled the two women he\u2019d seen leaving the premises, he wondered whether they were connected to this incident. Then, was her aggravated injury to blame on them as well? It looked like they\u2019d forgotten the bloody scene from last time all too soon. His lips curved up as he gave a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>By his side, the doctor was still kneeling, almost completely scared out of his wits. He trembled, not even daring to lift his head. All the stories he\u2019d heard about Prince Li, the one that stood out the most was that Prince Li\u2019s laughter heralded a rain of blood. But Prince Li only laughed halfway before stopping his laughter. Long Heng remembered that this woman had been frightened senseless the last time they\u2019d beat someone to death. Could she bear to see another round?</p><br/><p>He kicked aside the shards of colored glaze and sat in a chair to wait until the nurse emerged. She quickly knelt down at the sight of Prince Li, and he asked her about the condition of her injury.</p><br/><p>The nurse answered his questions one by one before he dismissed her with the doctor. Soon afterwards, Ye-mama emerged as well, carrying a basket filled with discarded, bloody bandages. Long Heng\u2019s heart quaked at the sight. He\u2019d seen blood before, but why did he feel so uncomfortable after seeing her blood?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, looking at the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour servant had just arrived when it happened as well. Xiao Shi should know the details,\u201d Ye-mama replied.</p><br/><p>Long Heng nodded. \u201cOh?\u201d He rose of his own accord and walking behind the folding screen. There was a ceramic stool covered with an embroidered cover by the bed, so he sat on that.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was all afluster. Fortunately, she was completely concealed by the bedcovers when she spoke. \u201cYour Highness, nothing happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng glanced at Xiao Shi, who didn\u2019t let her mistress get in another word edgewise as she explained everything that happened from beginning to end. He didn\u2019t say anything after listening, but sat there quietly like a giant mountain before the two women. Finally, Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t take it anymore and asked, \u201cYour Highness, is there something you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng looked at Bai Xiangxiu, lying on the bed with her head turned his way. Though her little face was a bit wan, those wet, dewy eyes only inspired tender affection. He couldn\u2019t help laugh as he said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear your good words on their behalf.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

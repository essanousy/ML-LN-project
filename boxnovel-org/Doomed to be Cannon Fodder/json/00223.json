He seems capable enough, but there\u2019s no need for you to worry, I will help you to the best of my abilities. Just remember to fulfill your side of the deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I will. It\u2019s just that this formula\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake, but also real at the same time. Some of the ingredients have been removed, but it can still explode. However, the gunpowder has become very volatile and will go off easily as a result.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how can we make this into a better weapon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on how many people you are willing to let me borrow for research. Some sacrifice is needed to win the war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake as many people as you need as long as you succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You\u2019re Chen Tao right? Since you\u2019ve used this formula before, you will be in charge of the research!\u201d The soldier crumbled the paper into a ball and threw it onto the floor. His face was filled with confidence and arrogance. Chen Tao gritted his teeth. He never thought that he\u2019d be commanded by a low-ranked soldier when he decided to defect to their side. Unfortunately, Commander Lu seemed to trust that soldier a lot and allowed him to take Chen Tao away.</p><br/><p>Chen Tao slowly came to realize that the low-ranked soldier was actually a woman! She wasn\u2019t very beautiful, but still atypical nonetheless. She sacrificed life after life to find the perfect ratio of ingredients to manufacture gunpowder. The gunpowder exploded prematurely if the ratio wasn\u2019t perfect, killing the workers that were manufacturing it. She would only look very disappointed and coldly say, \u201cGo get me two more people with steady hands. We shall start again.\u201d </p><br/><p>Chen Tao was speechless. This woman was even more manly and cruel than most other men. Worse still, she actually visited Commander Lu\u2019s tent on her own accord! She exited the camp only after the two was done with their business together. She beckoned Chen Tao over with her finger when she saw him on her way back. \u201cCome with me. I wish to know more about that woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Tao frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>If would\u2019ve been fine if she was a man, but unfortunately she wasn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t seem to mind though. She replied as though she couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I will eat you! Just come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Tao had no choice but to enter her tent. She took off her headpiece and revealed long, luscious hair with varying length. She perched jauntily on a chair, \u201cTell me about that woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Tao could feel his throat constrict. Even though she wasn\u2019t a stunning beauty and was already more than twenty five years old, she exuded elegance and had truly youthful. Most skin importantly, she had a kind of alluring charm which no woman in this world possessed. But since she was the commander\u2019s woman, he had no choice but to bury his desires and tell her everything he knew about Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>After he was done, the woman suddenly swiped her slightly curled hair and laughed. \u201cI see. So only her soul transmigrated here. She sounds like a woman without her own opinions. Shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to deal with. So what if she has watched Water Margin before and has a bit of knowledge about gunpowder. Why would I be afraid of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Lu suddenly entered the tent while they were in the middle of their talk. Chen Tao immediately stood up and greeted him, \u201cGeneral.\u201d Commander Lu wasn\u2019t just a general, he was also a prince. Life would be difficult if Chen Tao ever so slightly offended him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d It was quite obvious that this general was jealous. Chen Tao had no choice but to leave. He knew very well that this was a woman he couldn\u2019t afford to offend. Belittling her would be a grave mistake after Bai Xiangxiu had taught him a lesson. However, he did hear things that he shouldn\u2019t have heard. He was thoroughly shocked by her boldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear, are you jealous? Don\u2019t be mad. I was only trying to learn about the enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still a man after all. How can you let him enter your tent? You should act sensibly next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re so petty. Why won\u2019t you let me sleep in your tent then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s an army camp and people will come in at any time. Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted some freedom? It is only fair that I get as much freedom as you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man. You will have all sorts of women throwing themselves at you if you\u2019re allowed to have freedom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop letting your imagination run wild. Ah Yun, you said that she is also someone from your world? Is everyone from your world very knowledgeable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Our world is entirely different from your\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Tao could no longer hear the rest of their conversation and he wasn\u2019t too interested in eavesdropping either. The fact remains that both of these women were indeed very special and atypical.</p><br/><p>Long Heng and his army assembled Tranquil City at dawn, calling roll and about to march off to battle. Bai Xiangxiu was a little distressed when she was sending him off. She was worried that enemy\u2019s bomb maker had something up their sleeves. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if that person was of ordinary origins, as Long Heng would definitely be in a world of trouble if that person was very knowledgeable. Judging by how the transmigrator had immediately invented gunpowder, Bai Xiangxiu was certain that he\u2019d read a lot of transmigration novels. There was no point in dwelling on her worries. There was no way Long Heng would allow her to go with him. Even remaining at Tranquil City was all due to Prince Rong\u2019s help. </p><br/><p>Long Heng quickly invaded deep into enemy territory in one go, beating them back after consecutive battles. Just as mid autumn was about to arrive, the enemy came up with a new strategy as well. They took a page out of Earth\u2019s history books and besieged Wei to rescue Zhao by attacking Long Heng\u2019s weakness, Tranquil City. This tactic was one of attacking something else the enemy held dearly when they were too strong to attack directly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes at their decision. Are they going to siege Tranquil City with less than a thousand men by causing a commotion? And is that supposed to help save their country from imminent doom? She would\u2019ve been scared and would ask for assistance if there was only a few men in the city, but such was not the case as Yu Kuang was here. He left the city for a few days and came back with a group of people from the wulin that wanted to help with national matters. These people jumped high and low, showing excellent mastery of qinggong, especially the White Cloud Mountain disciples. Any one of them would likely be worth a hundred men.</p><br/><p>The wulin men went out to scout and size the enemy up. The smoke and dust behind the enemy\u2019s ranks was nothing but a deceptive trick. They numbered only roughly a thousand. Their cavalry was using tree branches to kick up dust to make their army seem bigger than they really were.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang and many others had a habit of consulting Bai Xiangxiu with such matters ever since she\u2019d helped defeat the chain horses formation. According to what Song Jiaoyue had said, it was because she had all sorts of ingenious ideas. Prince Rong thought the same as well. And so, everyone gathered inside a room to hold a meeting and discuss whether they should send Long Heng a letter to tell him about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to send him a letter. This is just a trap. They only sent a thousand men here in hopes that His Highness will retreat to defend the city. This will greatly affect the momentum of their invasion. His Highness will surely face great turmoil if the enemy stationed some men to ambush them in the middle of their journey. In fact, they could even risk total annihilation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see your point,\u201d Prince Rong said while nodding. \u201cThen how are we supposed to deal with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>While a thousand men wasn\u2019t too large of a number, they can still take down an entire city at a quick pace. It would be an enormous problem if they were not defeated quickly. Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. Was she supposed to be helping with these military matters as well?! She was just a female supporting character! And cannon fodder at that too! Why were they being all formal and serious with the meeting? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we we come up with a way to thwart their attack before thinking about anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen! Assemble the troops to thwart their attack!\u201d Prince Rong issued the order while waving his hand. He was the only one that could take charge in Tranquil City. Even though Long Heng had left some of his trusted lieutenants behind, they still had to report to Prince Rong. They\u2019d realized by now that Prince Rong was now relying entirely on his newly acquired godsister as he was clueless in military matters. He would always seek her opinion on things and was very thorough when he consulted her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

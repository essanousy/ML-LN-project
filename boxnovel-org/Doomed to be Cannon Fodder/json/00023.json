The women weren\u2019t actually going to be at the ceremony, because that would be where all the men would be. The womenfolk were going to sit in the meditation room chanting Buddhist scriptures. It was there that the old madame met Lin Qianzi, the female lead. She was a true beauty when she was properly dressed in female clothing. However, Bai Xiangxiu trailed a finger down her cheek and privately thought that she\u2019d overtake the female lead by a large margin when it came to looks.</p><br/><p>The old madame seemed to be rather satisfied with Lin Qianzi, so the two sides struck up a conversation. The book had not described this part in many details, instead starting from when Lin Qianzi tried to escape her marriage. As for Bai Xiangxiu, although she was an unexpected guest, she was still a background character. Her position was even below that of the older female cousin Yu Xiaoshu. She had been squeezed to the side until she almost had no space to stand. Although she was a beauty, she tried her best not to attract the attention, and succeeded in not attracting any jealous gazes.</p><br/><p>It was Yu Xiaoshu who thoroughly looked down on the female lead, Lin Qianzi. Her eyes stared at Lin Qianzi as if she wanted to bite her to pieces, while Lin Qianzi tossed seemingly unwitting glances at Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with her hurt expression though? I haven\u2019t done anything to her!</p><br/><p>Could it be beautiful supporting female leads turned into cannon fodder because the female lead was jealous of their looks? The more Bai Xiangxiu thought about it, the more she considered it to be possible. She ducked her head and hid that troublesome face of hers. Actually, Madame Lin wasn\u2019t too happy about the way the prince\u2019s household had handled things. They had actually brought a little concubine to such a grand occasion. However, upon seeing how she well she was behaving, keeping to the back of the group without saying anything, she seemed like a soft one who wouldn\u2019t bully her daughter.</p><br/><p>She patted her daughter\u2019s hand, indicating that she didn\u2019t need to worry. She then cast a look at one of the servant girls with her. The girl caught the look, and quietly walked out of the crowd.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi knew full well what her mother was up to. She couldn\u2019t help but frown and say quietly, \u201cMother, don\u2019t make trouble for her, she\u2019s a good person.\u201d She had even helped her in the prince\u2019s complex previously, and had not revealed her identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m simply testing her.\u201d Madame Lin smiled gently. She was actually worrying for her daughter. Her daughter was too kind and would definitely attract trouble for herself sooner or later. She had to eliminate all her enemies for her daughter before she married into the household.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiangxiu had not heard their conversation, she seemed to understand what was going to happen, because the female lead\u2019s gaze kept drifting towards her with some pity. Madame Lin\u2019s eyes were full of viciousness, and a sneer hung clearly at the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>That Madame Lin was probably panicking inside after seeing how she, as a little concubine, had been brought here. Bai Xiangxiu was destined to be unlucky this time.</p><br/><p>Should she fight back?</p><br/><p>Maybe not. If she fought back on a grand occasion like this, she might draw the ire of that mother and son duo who liked killing people with staves. Besides, the supporting male lead liked little white flowers with a holy mother complex. Back then, the female lead had attracted his pity after being bullied by the old madame and the concubines in the prince\u2019s household. That pity had been the seed that had sprouted into deep love.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, she should simply take it?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt a touch on the back of her waist. She rolled her eyes towards the sky before turning around. Actually, she had already predicted that there would be something behind her for her to crash into when she turned. It looked like they had brought out the figure of Buddha this time. Well, no matter what it was, since they\u2019d gone to the trouble of bringing it out, she was going to make them go bankrupt.</p><br/><p>Thus, the gentle push abruptly became a forceful one. The tray in the girl\u2019s hands was completely overturned, sending its contents crashing to the ground. This time, it wasn\u2019t just her, but everyone present who froze in startlement.</p><br/><p>Two Buddha figures and glass prayer beads fell to the ground, shattering into tiny pieces. The jade Buddha figure that the girl had prepared but hadn\u2019t had the time to throw was still clutched in her hands. However, everyone could see that the one in her hands was the least valuable one. The ones on the ground were worth well over a thousand silver ingots!</p><br/><p>Seeing how everyone hadn\u2019t been able to react in time, Bai Xiangxiu hurriedly knelt on the ground and looked towards the old madame frantically as she said. \u201cOld Madame, this concubine didn\u2019t do it on purpose; it really wasn\u2019t on purpose. I felt someone push me from behind, so I turned around. I didn\u2019t think\u2026 I didn\u2019t think\u2026 Wuwuwu\u2026\u201d It should be fine if she cried and admitted her crime first, right? See, she was so frightened that her whole body was trembling, how pitiable.</p><br/><p>The old madame frowned. Her heart cooled when she saw the pieces on the ground, and that Madame Lin\u2019s servant girl stood frozen. With so much space to the side, she had still chosen to walk behind n\u00e9e Bai and had even bumped into her. This had clearly been done on purpose.</p><br/><p>She was merely a concubine, was there any need to be this narrow-minded? Was her son not allowed to have other women by his side if Madame Lin\u2019s daughter married into her family?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be so careless?\u201d The old madame\u2019s tone was fierce, but lacked the rebuking tone she normally would have.</p><br/><p>Madame Lin\u2019s heart ached. This useless maid Hua\u2019er, she would definitely sell her once they went home! She couldn\u2019t even do a single thing right.</p><br/><p>Hua\u2019er could also see that there was something wrong with her master\u2019s gaze, so she hurriedly knelt and said, \u201cMadame, I, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that she would suddenly turn around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak properly!\u201d Madame Lin shouted sharply. Upon hearing that, Hua\u2019er calmed down, \u201cIt\u2019s all her fault! If she hadn\u2019t suddenly turned around, this servant wouldn\u2019t have dropped and broken these valuable treasures. Madame, please help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, it was an accident.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu secretly pinched her leg, and the tears automatically came pouring out. The weeping beauty attracted everyone\u2019s pity.</p><br/><p>Especially the female lead. Her heart pricking with sympathy, she said, \u201cMother, they didn\u2019t do it on purpose, why don\u2019t we forget about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Lin glared at her own daughter. How could she have given birth to such a wastrel! She had already invested a few thousand silver ingots to plumb the depths of this concubine, so she\u2019d see things through to the end! Thus, she frowned and commanded, \u201cMen, drag Hua\u2019er away. I\u2019ll deal with her when we return. As for this one from the prince\u2019s household\u2026 What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d She glanced at Bai Xiangxiu, but all she did was cry and look towards the old madame for mercy. It looked like she was extremely frightened.</p><br/><p>Madame Lin gave a disdainful smile. She hadn\u2019t thought that she would be such a soft, useless thing. If she had known earlier, she wouldn\u2019t have bothered testing her. She had been thinking of using a cheap jade Buddha for this test, but who would have known\u2026 The more she looked at those items, the more her heart ached. She couldn\u2019t help but grit her teeth. She had to make that concubine pay for it today.</p><br/><p>The old madame didn\u2019t speak, but simply showed a look of pity on her face. Although Yu Xiaoshu didn\u2019t like Bai Xiangxiu for her looks, her disdain for the legal wife-to-be, Lin Qianzi, was even higher. Deciding to add oil to the fire, she smiled and said, \u201cWho knows if she bumped into Madame Bai on purpose?\u201d She had cut straight to the point, and everyone\u2019s eyes turned to Lin Qianzi. This person hadn\u2019t even married into the household, but she was already threatening the concubines. Wasn\u2019t this a little early?</p><br/><p>However, the old madame then said, \u201cShut up. Madame Lin, it was Madame Bai\u2019s clumsiness that brought us to this point. This older sister apologizes to you on her behalf. The Prince Li household will compensate you for these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>What, wouldn\u2019t the prince\u2019s household go bankrupt then?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t a good deal at all. Bai Xiangxiu had clearly wanted to make the Lin family bankrupt. Thus, she immediately spoke up, \u201cThis concubine didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Madame Lin, it\u2019s fine if you just punish me. Otherwise, this concubine can give all her assets to the Lin family as compensation.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The old madame was so happy that her eyebrows disappeared into her hairline everyday from all her smiling. Every so often, she\u2019d visit Bai Xiangxiu to see her unborn grandchild. She would come so often that it was making Bai Xiangxiu anxious.</p><br/><p>One must understand that during this kind of time period, it wasn\u2019t very appropriate for the old madame of a household to visit a concubine so often. However, the old madame was only here to see her grandchild, so Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t possibly decline her visit. Furthermore, the old madame was already getting on in her years, and there wasn\u2019t much more left that she desired. </p><br/><p>Well, she can visit all she wants. I have nothing to hide anyways. After sending the old madame off, Bai Xiangxiu began to gently caress her stomach. He\u2019s so restless these days. Every so often, I can feel him kicking and nudging inside.</p><br/><p>Long Heng said that he\u2019s an innate general. He even said that he\u2019ll teach him some martial arts after he\u2019s born.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s already made plans to torture my son before he\u2019s even born. Bai Xiangxiu let out a soft sigh. How was she supposed to leave this all behind when all she could do was worry about a new issue every day? She was worried about her child. Even though the gender was still a mystery, she couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for him. Her child was going to be motherless immediately after birth. Will he be bullied? What if his stepmother is a calculative bitch? What if she feeds him poison from a young age and turn him into a cripple? Or even kills him when he grows up? So many things might go wrong! </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t wed another woman. Alright?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu said agitatedly as she turned around and tugged on Long Heng\u2019s collar. </p><br/><p>Long Heng noticed that she seemed to be extremely disturbed by something. He held her hands tightly and did his best to reassure her . \u201cOf course. I will not marry another woman. Don\u2019t be so agitated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promised me so easily. You must be lying! You\u2019re going to marry again and that evil woman will treat my son harshly because he\u2019s concubine born, and thus will always be a step lower than her own children.\u201d This problem had been eating away at Bai Xiangxiu lately. However, she\u2019d suppressed it because they\u2019ve never been treating her child as if it was concubine born. However, she was still a little uneasy about it, which was why she spoke up.</p><br/><p>Long Heng caressed her anxious little face and said, \u201cThat won\u2019t happen. I will kick them all out if they dare try. Don\u2019t worry, nobody is going to harm our child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was visibly calmer after hearing his words. However, she was still stricken with guilt for wanting to return home and leaving Long Heng by himself. She hesitated for a moment and continued, \u201cLong Heng, I will allow you to marry another woman, but can you search for someone who is kind and gentle? Someone who would never harm our child? Pay attention to what is happening at home after that too. Don\u2019t immerse yourself with work and let our child be brought up by others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er, What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Why does it sound so much like her last words? Long Heng had an extremely bad feeling about things. He suddenly gave Bai Xiangxiu a hug and caressed her head. \u201cStop having such foolish thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded her head. How can I not entertain such thoughts? She soon felt some discomfort in her stomach again. She caressed her stomach, \u201cHe\u2019s being naughty again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng caressed her stomach tenderly as well, but Bai Xiangxiu responded by wincing in pain. She bent her back a little and began to groan from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Noticing that something was wrong, Long Heng immediately cradled her in his arms and broke into a sprint. \u201cSummon the midwife! Hurry! Stop standing around!\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if she really was in labor or not, summoning the midwife was definitely not the wrong decision. Surprisingly, Long Heng\u2019s instincts were on point. The midwife immediately recognized the signs that Bai Xiangxiu was going into labor. The entire manor fell into chaos in the blink of an eye. The old madame and Long Heng were sweating buckets as they waited anxiously outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeng\u2019er don\u2019t be so anxious. Every woman has to go through such an ordeal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! It hurts\u2026!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery woman?\u201d That was actually a scream of horror right? People made the same sounds when they were being murdered.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d The old madame comforted Long Heng and asked him to take a seat. However, she could clearly see the veins pop out on Long Heng\u2019s forehead. It was obvious how nervous he was feeling.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu stopped screaming after a while. After all, labor pains normally came in pulsating waves. It wasn\u2019t unbearable all the time.</p><br/><p>But Long Heng didn\u2019t know that. In the heat of the moment he said, \u201cWhy did she stop screaming? Send someone in to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019d be in constant pain? Wouldn\u2019t all women die from pain if that was the case? Sit down. Don\u2019t be so nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng had only sat down for a moment before he jolted to his feet again from the renewed screaming. Suddenly, one of the midwives exited the room. He immediately inquired, \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu is exhausted. I\u2019m on my way to retrieve a few slices of ginseng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat slices of ginseng? Just take the whole thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d How is the mistress supposed to chew on a whole ginseng? And yet, she had no choice but to follow the prince\u2019s orders. Bai Xiangxiu was soon wordlessly biting down on a whole piece of ginseng like a dog. Wow. Isn\u2019t he being such a great help. However, biting on the whole ginseng was surprisingly effective as well. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s okay. At least I can slurp up some of the ginseng juices. It feels surprisingly good, all things considered. The only thing she\u2019d complain about was the taste of the ginseng.</p><br/><p>Since she had been suffering from the woes of birth since early noon, Bai Xiangxiu had expanded all of her energy by nightfall. When she was about to begin thinking of her dying words, the child that had caused her so much suffering was finally born.</p><br/><p>She could feel her entire body grow lighter. Her soul seemed to have returned to the modern world. It seemed like she was being lifted onto an ambulance. Her co-workers from the horticulture club was right beside her trying to explain to the paramedic what had happened. What?! I didn\u2019t faint because I was staring at my phone! I\u2019m a very professional employee alright? I don\u2019t even normally look at my phone when I\u2019m working!</p><br/><p>The paramedic even added, \u201cYoung people these days. Their phones are more important than their own lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t faint because I was staring at my phone! Alright?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu yelled out of nowhere. Everyone was greatly startled by her sudden yell. The paramedic then said, \u201cThe patient has regained consciousness. Inform the hospital for emergency treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, her consciousness was pulled away by the sound of a baby crying. Bai Xiangxiu exhaled deeply and slowly opened her eyes. Why was everyone surrounding her? Why was Long Heng here as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er, wake up\u2026 Please wake up\u2026\u201d Long Heng could feel his entire body turn ice cold. The bad premonition he had felt earlier had come true. Bai Xiangxiu had immediately stopped breathing after her child had been born. The midwives were shocked to death when they noticed. Disregarding the saying that men shouldn\u2019t enter the delivery room, he\u2019d charged right in and arrived at Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s side in one strong leap. Is this going to be the last time I\u2019ll get to see her?</p><br/><p>When he laid eyes on Bai Xiangxiu, whose complexion was now as pale as a sheet and whose blood had drenched the bed, his mind came to a halting, blank stop. He was on his knees while holding Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand, hoping that it was all only a dream.</p><br/><p>The doctor was administering acupuncture with wildly trembling hands. He knew that everything he was doing was going to be for nought. Her breath had already left her body. All of a sudden, the child began to wail loudly, despite not making a sound even when he was born. His wailing dragged everyone\u2019s mind and soul back to reality, including his mother.</p><br/><p>The movement of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand snapped Long Heng from his daze. He immediately held her hand tightly and frantically said, \u201cXiu\u2019er\u2026 Xiu\u2019er! Are you awake?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch! Who\u2019s stabbing me with a needle?\u201d Why does it feel like I\u2019ve been stabbed by a needle on my face and on my arm?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor. Quickly pull out your silver needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The doctor was trembling from head to toe when he removed the needles. How could she possibly return to life when she\u2019d stopped breathing? He\u2019d never seen such a thing in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere? Doctor. Check her body to see if there\u2019s any medicines you need to prescribe immediately.\u201d Long Heng was weeping for joy. He was so moved that his hands were trembling as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

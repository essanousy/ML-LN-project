She was the vaunted eldest miss of the Lin Manor and the daughter of the official wife. She\u2019d known how to sing and dance since young and was immensely talented. Everyone who met her vied to compliment her, and a marriage had landed in her lap without her even trying very hard for it. Although she hadn\u2019t agreed to it, she knew that other women envied her greatly because even though Long Heng\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t the best, he was young and didn\u2019t have a name for philandering. He possessed military power and was so very handsome. There were very few women who didn\u2019t like a man like him.</p><br/><p>But she was currently being slighted, and being treated as a maid! How would anyone in the manor have the courage to do so? It looked like things were just as Luo Yunzheng had said, the woman in front of her was no simple character. She hadn\u2019t believed him then, but now she did. If it wasn\u2019t for this woman\u2019s intentions, would these people have dared spoken to her like this and treated her like a maid?!</p><br/><p>And so, Lin Qianzi was enraged. She stood up to glare at Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cJust what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu knew that she had misunderstood things and hastily explained, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand Miss Lin, these aren\u2019t people of the manor, they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to explain, I know you don\u2019t welcome me\u2026\u201d She turned around and fled in tears, as if she\u2019d suffered a grave injustice.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu started sweating profusely after watching all this. Miss Lin was the future mistress of the house! People would surely think a great deal if she ran out of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s residence, sobbing. They\u2019d run their mouths off about the future mistress of the house wanting to strike a good relationship with the favored concubine, but had been sent out of the concubine\u2019s residence in angry tears\u2026 No matter what rumors developed, all would be bad for Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>As much as the old madame and Long Heng favored and spoiled her, she was still a concubine. Logic and the law would be on Miss Lin\u2019s side as long as Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t the official wife. Even though Miss Lin didn\u2019t have a good reputation, the ancient times still very much differentiated between children born of the official wife and concubines, and placed an even greater emphasis on the differences between masters and slaves.</p><br/><p>Concubines were slaves, the official wife was the master. That she, a slave, had done all this meant grave disrespect to her master.She could be exiled to the border or directly caned to death! The Bai Xiangxiu in the novel had committed the same mistake, and now she\u2019d repeated herself as well.</p><br/><p>What should I do?</p><br/><p>If word of this got out, there\u2019d be nothing good in it for her. She had to think of a way for everyone to know of this and not blame her. Bai Xiangxiu grit her teeth. Since she\u2019s running away, pretending to be hurt, then I\u2019ll just faint! There was nothing for it. Bai Xiangxiu took a few steps, pretending to chase after Miss Lin, but actually ended up on the ground with a thump.</p><br/><p>The manor instantly boiled over in a chaotic mess, with servants summoning doctors, preparing medicine, and brewing nutritional supplements.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi, on the other hand, had run out of the manor. Even her maid didn\u2019t catch up to her, and the guards at the door didn\u2019t stop her either because she was a guest. She barreled out onto the street and began walking aimlessly in her distress.</p><br/><p>Someone suddenly appeared in front of her. He had delicate features and looked very honest, cutting quite a striking figure even when on the street. The most important thing was that he seemed to recognize her as he asked her oddly, \u201cMiss, don\u2019t you work at Red Maple Mountain Villa? You\u2019re the maid called Yuan\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got it wrong, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Lin right? I actually heard it from the prince. You were called Yuan\u2019er in order conceal your identity. I am Duan Yunying, a hanger-on of the Prince Li manor. Where are you going? It\u2019s quite dangerous here, might I send you home?\u201d Duan Yunying coughed a few times after speaking, not appearing to be someone who was sinister in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi just so happened to be in a sad mood and felt that she\u2019d been abandoned by everyone. She grabbed his hand and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home. I just want to spend some time quietly somewhere, can we do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, would you like to go to my quarters? Although this is a bit abrupt, it\u2019s rather quiet there.\u201d Duan Yunying\u2019s act was almost flawless, taking in Lin Qianzi as well. She trusted this man because he really was very gentle and beautiful, just like a harmless little bunny. They chatted as they walked, and Lin Qianzi felt like she\u2019d never met such a gentle and charming man. He completely changed her view of men.</p><br/><p>The two arrived at a very luxurious inn. Duan Yunying was living alone in quite an elegant yard. Although it was almost winter, the view was still stunning. Lin Qianzi\u2019s spirits were immensely uplifted by the sight, and by the talented Duan Yunying adept at soothing women. There was also a table full of delicious dishes and good wine prepared as well. He seemed to be great listener as he paid attention to Lin Qianzi vent about Long Heng\u2019s heartlessness and the unfair treatment she\u2019d suffered from. He took her side and agreed that she\u2019d been treated most unjustly. He even wanted to speak to the prince on her behalf so that she would be treated fairly. She hadn\u2019t been treated so gently in such a long time. Lin Qianzi actually became a bit drunk and groggily fell into his arms.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying felt that since he couldn\u2019t use the women by the prince\u2019s side, he might as well use this Miss Lin. She said that their betrothal couldn\u2019t be dissolved, so if he obtained her help, he could use her to kill Long Heng on the day of their marriage. Even if he couldn\u2019t, he could use her to affect Long Heng. Sometimes it was easier to kill using a soft knife than an actual one made of steel. Since she was falling into his arms, it\u2019d be a pity to not take what the lady was offering.</p><br/><p>Since he was worried that she\u2019d blame him afterwards, he smeared some \u201cThree Days of Inebriation\u201d on his lips. Lin Qianzi slowly transformed from simple hugs and small kisses to ravenous hunger that couldn\u2019t wait. She was actually the one who stripped off her clothes first to entangle with him. Duan Yunying laughed coldly and lifted her onto the bed, using everything he knew to pleasure Lin Qianzi well.</p><br/><p>If a man wanted to make a woman feel good in this regard, she would be sent up to high heaven. It wasn\u2019t just those with strong stamina that would make a woman happen. Duan Yunying happened to possess two points, a fine body and and strong stamina. Therefore, Lin Qianzi finally had a taste of sweet joy after countless times of torture at Luo Yunzheng\u2019s hands. Although she sobered up at the end, she was still lulled by Duan Yunying\u2019s tender and comfortable attacks.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d always thought that in the matter between men and women, women could only accept what men did to them. But she finally learned today that women could feel just as good as well. She didn\u2019t know if it was because she\u2019d drank wine, but she gave full vent to her feelings and her voice steadily grew in volume. It\u2019d always been Luo Yunzheng forcing her normally. She\u2019d always felt that enduring had been a form of torture. Duan Yunying even held her as they bathed afterwards, then sat off to the side with a reddened face and kept apologizing to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry! Miss Lin you are simply too beautiful! I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t help myself and so did that! If you wish to blame me, then please kill me!\u201d He picked up the fruit knife that was lying on the table and handed it over, knowing full well that she was so comfortable right now that she wouldn\u2019t bear to make a move at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, that woman was his good friend\u2019s concubine, and it would not do for him to overstep his boundaries.</p><br/><p>Temporarily flustered, he quickly suppressed such thoughts, smiling, \u201cI had never thought that Brother Long\u2019s house would possess such a talented woman. It seems like truly a blessing for you.\u201d He no longer mentioned the poem and the girl afterwards, remotely pretending that this had never happened.</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng, the lover of conspiracies, couldn\u2019t help but think that there was more than met the eye here. After having sent Song Jiaoyue away, he rapped on the table a few times. Why did it seem that the \u2018crazy\u2019 woman was getting a little restless these days? Even though he clearly knew that she was a woman of his own harem, he still hesitated for a time before heading over alone.</p><br/><p>The Winter Garden was really in too remote a location. Thus, he didn\u2019t see virtually anyone on his way there. When he arrived, there was not even a guard at the door. He had heard that all the residences had received old women servants and pageboys. How had they only overlooked this residence?</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, his mother shouldn\u2019t have made such a mistake. However, what he didn\u2019t know was that the old madame had actually dispatched the people. But afraid that they would be a hindrance to her plans, Bai Xiangxiu had refused and sent back these people on the grounds of her being afflicted with craziness, claiming she was too scared for outsiders.</p><br/><p>Since there was no one guarding the door and he was the master of the place, there should be no problem if he went in! \u2026Right? Long Heng lingered outside for a while before he finally still slipped in.</p><br/><p>The situation inside caused him to wrinkle his brows. It was really too dirty and messy. There was messily scattered paper everywhere on the ground, and there was even ink drying in splotches on the floor.</p><br/><p>The owner of this place sat at her table, her hair scattered as if she was pondering something deeply. A little maid was kneeling on the floor, wiping it little by little, speaking as though feeling wronged, \u201cI already told you not to place the inkpot by the table\u2019s edge, MIstress, now look, the entire floor\u2019s covered with ink\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait, why is there a man\u2019s shoes here. It\u2019s so late, how could there be a man here?</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi slowly raised her head, and saw an abnormally cold and handsome visage before her. She immediately dropped to her knees, \u201cThis.., this humble maid greets Your Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHighness? What highness? Xiao Shi, you need to stop playing. Even if the king himself was here, this poem, I would still have to\u2026\u201d Her words meandered off into silence as she realized that there really was a man standing in front of her.</p><br/><p>She rapped her skull and rubbed her eyes, saying, \u201cXiao Shi, go call for the physician again. I\u2019m hallucinating again, what do I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi was nearly in tears from fright. Her mistress had really written poems to the point of turning silly. This person was clearly standing right before her eyes\u2014how was it a hallucination?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Long Heng was rendered completely speechless. Did he appear so much like a hallucination? Or was it that she had actually been longing for his arrival? Thinking thus, his heart softened as he said, \u201cIs this how you serve your mistress? Why is this place so dirty and messy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether or not a man loved a woman, he would naturally feel happy if she thought of him. Having finished his words, he continued looking at her. She really didn\u2019t give off the feeling of a woman who would scheme to grab his attention. Even if she did so, he didn\u2019t find that too hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, it really is the highness? Ah\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was not really a talented person, and had been furiously wracking her brain to think up poems. She finally came to her senses, a tragic cry spilling from her lips as she realized she hadn\u2019t paid her greetings to the prince.</p><br/><p>At least, these formalities were something she had already learnt. But right then, perhaps because she was too flustered, she stumbled over the chair she\u2019d been sitting on. She crashed to the ground in a heap, sweat beginning to form from the sharp pain that shot through her. She stuttered slightly,\u201dGree\u2026 gree\u2026 greetings to Your Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>It should be said like this, right?! Having spent all this time the past few days thinking of a way to seduce the male supporting character, as well as brainstorming verses of a couple of poems, her brainpower had really been pushed to the maximum.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help by admire those transmigrating seniors of hers. Had they known that they would be going to cross worlds? They were all able to plagiarize and steal those poems so smoothly! But for her, even stealing poems was already causing her mind to reach the verge of exploding. She really didn\u2019t understand this turn of events that was happening in front of her. The attempted seduction of the male supporting actor hadn\u2019t shown any results so why had the male lead come over?</p><br/><p>Actually, Long Heng\u2019s earlier thoughts in coming here had already vanished like smoke in the wind. For one, the state of this woman was good enough evidence to conclude that she wasn\u2019t in a particularly clear state of mind. Second, given how messy and chaotic this room was, randomly taking a piece of paper to wrap a present was also not an impossibility. He picked up a piece of paper, seeing the full contents of that poem. The corners of his mouth twitched involuntarily. Was she using this poem to train her handwriting? She\u2019d written it so many times.</p><br/><p>In truth, he had actually guessed correctly. Bai Xiangxiu was indeed training her handwriting whilst trying to recall poems! However, when Long Heng saw the woman\u2019s knees trembling as she endured the pain without screaming, he had to say, \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wanted to cry but did not have the tears to do so. She remained kneeling, not moving an inch, raising her head to glance at Long Heng before lowering it again. That small expression of hers caused Long Heng\u2019s heart to spasm. Had he done something wrong to her, to see such resentment in her eyes?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, you still want this Prince to help you up?\u201d His personality was cold. Even though he felt that the woman before him deserved his pity and love, he had no idea how to react.</p><br/><p>Originally, he had thought that she would lower her head and beg for forgiveness or something. Wasn\u2019t that the usual reaction for most women? However, just who was Bai Xiangxiu hmm? She was a person who had commonly lived amongst the flowers and the plants, never using her brain. Even if she knew how to act obedient, she was already completely numb before the male lead.</p><br/><p>Putting it nicely, this reaction was one of simple fear. Putting it bluntly, it was just being scared to the point of having lost her wits. Lowering her head, she answered, sounding a little wronged, \u201cIn reply to Your Highness, it is not that this concubine does not want to get up. It\u2019s that\u2026 I can\u2019t. My legs seem to have gone numb.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Long Heng was once more rendered speechless. How was this woman frail to this extent? Earlier, when she saw someone beaten to death with staves, she was shocked to the point of being sick for over two months. Now, for having her kneel just a little, she\u2019d lost the ability to get up. A feeling of helplessness suddenly assailed him as he ordered Xiao Shi, \u201cHelp your mistress up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi hurriedly went over to support her mistress. Because she exerted too much force, she virtually lifted Bai Xiangxiu up by her waist. Long Heng\u2019s heart softened again. This woman was really a little too light. Even a little maid could lift her up.</p><br/><p>Was she as light as a feather? He suddenly heard Xiao Shi cry out in shock as he mused, \u201cMistress Xiu, Mistress Xiu, what\u2019s happened to you?\u201dShe shook the figure which had already grown limp in her embrace, watching it flop around.</p><br/><p>Stunned, Long Heng asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Looking at that hanging head within the maid\u2019s embrace, it seemed like she\u2019d fainted?</p><br/><p>What, really? Yes, she\u2019s frail, but frail to this extent? Just simply kneeling was enough to make her faint?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you standing there for? Go find a physician!\u201d Long Heng stepped over quickly, gathering Bai Xiangxiu in his embrace. He\u2019d been thinking of hugging her earlier, who knew that his wish would come true so quickly? It was only, she really was light.</p><br/><p>Not only light, she was also very soft. Not only soft, she was also very fragrant. How did she pose any threat at all like this? It seemed that all the bones within her body could break even if he just exerted the tiniest amount of force.</p><br/><p>Seeing the Prince carrying her mistress within his embrace, Xiao Shi was momentarily stunned, but quickly came to her senses, running over to the medicine hall for a physician.</p><br/><p>Long Heng placed the person on her bed in her inner chamber. This Winter Garden\u2019s bedroom wasn\u2019t too spacious. To him at least, it only had enough space to turn around, too small to the point of pitiful. The bed was also not very big, but there was still a large portion of space left after she was laid down on it. Was a woman\u2019s body so small? He covered her body with his, discovering that his body completely covered hers.</p><br/><p>His heart couldn\u2019t help but grow warm, being especially aroused by that enchanting face of hers. By the same token, the memories of the battlefield appeared in his head. He broke out in a cold sweat as he hurriedly sat up, wrinkling his brows.</p><br/><p>Indeed, all beautiful woman were a scourge. She was too dangerous. He didn\u2019t want to look at her any more, so he took his leave from the Winter Garden, a shadow his only company on the way back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

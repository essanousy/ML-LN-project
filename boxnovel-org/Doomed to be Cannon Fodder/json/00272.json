To be able to turn her face into that\u2026 I\u2019m fairly certain those doctors are all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFace?\u201d Yu Kuang asked out of curiosity. Bai Xiangxiu went over the particulars of Noble Consort Su being Su Yun and how her appearance had completely changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean to say that she killed all the doctors after becoming beautiful in order to cover up the truth?\u201d Luo Yunzheng could barely believe his ears. It just seemed too ludicrous. Bai Xiangxiu however, knew that Su Yun was absolutely capable of something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean that we don\u2019t need to look for the doctors because they\u2019re most likely all dead?\u201d This was Long Heng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, if they\u2019re dead, I want to see their corpses. If they\u2019re alive somewhere, I need to find them.\u201d Yu Kuang rebutted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! I may not know much else, but you\u2019d never be able to imagine the various methods that the imperial court has for disposing of bodies,\u201d Luo Yunzheng snorted. Those of the jianghu also had various grudges with the imperial court, so Yu Kuang nodded in agreement as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for them to do so without leaving some kind of trace behind, but there\u2019s no need for us to look into it. Since she did it, then we\u2019ll have her slip up herself,\u201d Long Heng mused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu seemed to understand what her husband was getting at and looked at the two from the wulin, \u201cIf you want justice for the doctors, then I\u2019ll leave this in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of trouble in the imperial court?\u201d Luo Yunzheng smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome what may, they\u2019ve already gone to this length, what else would I be afraid of them for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ve been quiet for too long. I\u2019ve been longing for some exercise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just leave this matter to me and Luo Yunzheng,\u201d Yu Kuang declared. The group brainstormed some more and realized exactly how ruthless a character this Noble Consort Su seemed to be. She was as careful as she was ruthless, so they couldn\u2019t uncover any evidence that night. However, they also weren\u2019t building a case for prosecution. It was enough to know that she\u2019d done it.</p><br/><p>When the men left, Long Heng remained sitting at the table, his fingers tapping on it with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering how to switch out the master of this imperial court.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 can I ask who this new master will be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d Long Heng lightly tilted up Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s chin and smiled faintly, drawing close to murmur by her ear, \u201cWhat do you think about being empress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind if you really want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I knew you\u2019d say that. Mother and Xiao Lin are just about ready to return to the countryside, I\u2019ll arrange for them to travel to Tranquil City after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go back? But the emperor will never allow you to return to your stronghold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, what if I become more of a threat in the capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will only force the tiger up the wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t even have the chance to go up the wall?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked, perplexed. For some reason, she felt that Long Heng already had a plan in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cKick up a fuss with them first, the bigger the better. Keep all of their attention on you and not on me, the prince with nothing to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I see, you want us to be bait and switch up the target. We should make a big deal of whatever we can get our hands on, right?\u201d This was great! She loved doing stuff like this. No wonder Long Heng had kept a particularly low profile lately, acting like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. However, she didn\u2019t have a complete handle on things. Did he want to be the emperor, or have someone else be the emperor? But who else had the ability to be emperor?</p><br/><p>The crown prince was only ten, could it be\u2026 Prince Rong?</p><br/><p>He was the only royal relative, but he\u2019d always been an honest man and thought nothing of power and glory. He didn\u2019t have any real authority in the imperial court, but of one thing she was certain. He was certainly not a fool. A fool would not have lived as long as he had. She\u2019d had the feeling when she was in Tranquil City that Prince Rong wasn\u2019t just another small fish in the pond. He\u2019d never shied away from responsibility when it was his turn to do so, he\u2019d just kept a low profile and sometimes gave all the credit to Long Heng. She\u2019d wondered why he\u2019d done so back then, but now that she thought about it, he was likely afraid of attracting attention from the miserly emperor and being suspected of treason!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t legitimate for a subject to revolt, but things were a different matter when it came to him. She wasn\u2019t familiar with these kind of intrigues in the olden times, but they somehow felt very real to her. Relatives were few in modern families, so they were usually quite close. There were rarely cases of folks fighting each other in struggles for power.</p><br/><p>Since Long Heng wanted her to kick up a fuss, then she would do so to the best of her abilities. Yu Kuang and Luo Yunzheng called together a group of jianghu folks and started spreading rumors that Bai Xiangxiu crafted. One set said that there was a noble consort in court that used to be very ugly, but had invited wondrous doctors to look at her face in order to win the emperor\u2019s favor. When she grew beautiful, her life grew brighter as well and so she became the noble consort.</p><br/><p>The second set told of the emperor carrying off a concubine from one of the enemy princes, but her face had been disfigured. The emperor had invited many doctors to fix her face, but alas her heart wasn\u2019t as beautiful as her face. She killed all the doctors to prevent her previous ugly face from being talked about.</p><br/><p>More than one doctor had gone missing, so there was already some attention being paid to it. More attention was drawn to it once the rumors spread. Those searching for their kin found their way to the capital and started lodging official protests. The doctors were powerful existences to begin with, particularly their families. They had no shortage of connections or wealth, and were willing to bring it all to bear to find their missing family!</p><br/><p>Things had been relatively quiet before the rumors, but once they started spreading, clues started flying in from all directions. The matter grew larger and larger, but there was no response from the palace, nor did any official pay any attention to them. This had the opposite effect as those affected decide to lodge an imperial petition!</p><br/><p>Of course, Luo Yunzheng and Yu Kuang were the ones behind connecting all these families together. They usually wouldn\u2019t oppose the imperial court so blatantly, but the two doctors who\u2019d vanished from the jianghu were all well respected and beloved. Many of them had been helped by the two doctors, so there were plenty willing to raise a racket on their behalf. Luo Yunzheng was here precisely because of those circumstances, and the wulin alliance head was naturally here to uphold the peace of the wulin. Bai Xiangxiu had learned of all this when she\u2019d thanked them with some embarrassment. She\u2019d originally felt quite ashamed, as if she was using them. That was when she found out that they had their own responsibilities, and she was just a catalyst.</p><br/><p>It was through them that she learned roughly twelve doctors had disappeared from various places, not including the ones covertly captured from enemy nations. How could twelve people just disappear like this? Bai Xiangxiu really couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around it. Su Yun has gone absolutely crazy! Or has she lost her sense of reality after reading so many novels?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s not the only one with supernatural powers! They\u2019re featured in Supernatural Girlfriend as well!

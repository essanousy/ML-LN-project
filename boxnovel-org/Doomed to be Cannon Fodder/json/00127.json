What\u2019s forcefully taken will never be sweet. No matter how passionate you are, it\u2019s useless if the male lead doesn\u2019t return your favor. Besides, what are you doing capturing a female supporting character for? Is this some kind of fun for you?</p><br/><p>A hand suddenly appeared on her chest as she thought. Wuwuwu!! No way, is this the prelude to harassing me?? What\u2019s wrong with this female supporting character, grabbing me to harass me?</p><br/><p>\u201cHarassment!!\u201d This was the only thing the speechless Bai Xiangxiu could say after being stunned for a long moment.</p><br/><p>Yaya didn\u2019t know that Bai Xiangxiu had already guessed her identity by now. She only knew to fling a slap across Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face when the latter cried out. Who\u2019d have known that Bai Xiangxiu was more sharp tongued than Yaya had imagined, and that she would even dare take action as well! Yaya hadn\u2019t anticipated that a slap would suddenly greet her in return, but the burning sensation on her cheek indicated that it had happened. She was momentarily stunned. What had happened to the noble lady, that gentle and tender being? Was Long Heng and all the others, as well as her own master, blind??</p><br/><p>She\u2019d liked him so much in her past life, but he\u2019d ended up with that woman without a single thought for her. Now that that life was over, she didn\u2019t dare have any other designs on him in this life. She only hated him from the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>But who would\u2019ve thought that although that Miss Lin wasn\u2019t protected like Long Heng in the past, she hadn\u2019t elicited the master\u2019s interest either. The reason being, she wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d caught Long Heng\u2019s eye, but instead that simple concubine who he\u2019d killed so easily before.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that this concubine would be like so now? She wasn\u2019t creating trouble for everyone, or using her beauty to seduce men to try to kill Miss Lin. Nor was she inviting Long Heng\u2019s hate. Long Heng now loved her for her fragile beauty, and the servants kept lauding how good she was, and how kind she was. But now it seemed that this wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>Yaya laughed coldly. Since this concubine was two faced, who needed to be kind to her? Why not make her appearance match her inside? Yaya flicked her finger.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt a sudden draft on her face and reached up to touch her cheek. Even in the dim light, she could see the blood dripping down her hand.</p><br/><p>Ruined. Her face must be ruined. This woman dared ruin her face! Bai Xiangxiu finally recalled this scene. It was the one where the female lead had been raped!</p><br/><p>The female lead and male lead had been doing just fine in Red Maple Mountain Villa. Although Luo Yunzheng had come to disturb them, their relationship had still made some progress. It was at this time that the third supporting male character, Duan Yunying, had shown up with the little white rabbit heart and the big grey wolf tail. He had aroused pity from the female lead and attracted the male lead\u2019s jealousy. Duan Yunying had then used Yaya to cause the female lead to hate the male lead, and then tempted her to run away from the Red Maple Mountain Villa.</p><br/><p>The female lead was the kind of creature who would run into all sorts of danger when she was away from the male lead. She was captured by Duan Yunying and Yaya as soon as she left the grounds, and used as a token to threaten the male lead with.</p><br/><p>The male lead had gone to enormous efforts to save her, going through sword formations, assassins, poison sands, and more. So was she now suffering on behalf of the female lead? The female lead was sitting nice and pretty in the Villa, but she would be the one being tormented.</p><br/><p>That little white rabbit supporting male had done his fair share of torturing the female lead, both covertly and overtly. He\u2019d almost induced Stockholm syndrome in her. Yet, he was also the third person who\u2019d seen her naked. The first was the male lead, the second Luo Yunzheng, and the third was him.</p><br/><p>No way! She didn\u2019t want that pervert to see her naked! But she seemed to have been harassed by Yaya just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour chest isn\u2019t that big either. There\u2019s nothing good about you apart from your face, so you\u2019re nothing if you don\u2019t have it!\u201d Yaya wanted to continue, but pain suddenly wracked her body, and she fell to the ground with an agonized cry, spasming uncontrollably. \u201cM-master\u2026 forgive me! Master, forgive me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened to admit a faint figure. He seemed to be an immortal from a mist-wreathed realm, floating in like a wisp. He wore a mask of peach blossoms on his face, and there was even a poem inscribed on it. It looked quite elegant.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying. She guessed who he was even without seeing his face. Or it could be said that she already knew who he was, and didn\u2019t need to guess. It would appear from Yaya\u2019s pained posture on the ground that she had been poisoned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d A cold voice emitted from behind the sophisticated mask, making Bai Xiangxiu tremble all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, please give me the antidote to the Heartpiercing Poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Plop. A small flask landed on the ground as Duan Yunying spoke, \u201cTake it after an hour. That is your punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yaya crawled out gritting her teeth as she did so. Indeed, she crawled out.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t fully aware of what was going on, she could roughly guess at what had happened. No wonder Yaya had placed her sights on Long Heng after being reborn. Her decision was understandable. A steadfast, loyal male lead and a frightening, perverted little white rabbit. She would\u2019ve picked the male lead without hesitation as well, just like how she\u2019d selected the male supporting character instead of the male lead when she\u2019d first arrived. This was because the supporting character was much more harmless; the male lead was simply too dangerous in comparison. But now, she seemed to be missing the male lead a bit, because he seemed to be the only one who could save her now.</p><br/><p>Or I can save myself\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t move an inch even as she watched Duan Yunying approach. The female lead had dodged too and fro in the novel, but had still been pressed down in the end. Although it\u2019d been done to cure her wounds, the supporting character had taken quite the advantage of the situation as well.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying was very surprised. This woman was simply too calm, so calm that he was having trouble seeing through to what her true personality was. He knew Yaya\u2019s personality. She never would\u2019ve harmed this woman in front of him had she not been enraged. He\u2019d wanted to use Bai Xiangxiu for some of his goals, but now it seemed that it wouldn\u2019t be as easy as he\u2019d thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go back to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019d naturally meant Long Heng, but this was a bit of an odd situation for her. Why wasn\u2019t the supporting character taking advantage of the situation to bully her, and then do to her what he\u2019d done to the female lead? Why had the plot changed again? Bai Xiangxiu was a bit mystified and couldn\u2019t help but frown. She had no idea what this pervert was thinking of.</p><br/><p>The pervert cut a mesmerizing figure as he approached slowly, pulling lightly on her hair as he smiled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask who I am, appearing in front of you with a mask like this? Don\u2019t you think all this to be rather weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her gaze was calm, it seemed even more fathomless than the ocean, leaving one incapable of peering into her thoughts. This woman is not as simple as she appears. There weren\u2019t many who wouldn\u2019t be afraid when faced with a situation like this, but there she was, just standing there. She was looking at him without a hint of fear, despite the blood flowing down her face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s not what it seems!\u201d</p><br/><p>But the men around her only laughed uproariously as they unabashedly leered at her body from tip to sole. Lin Qianzi was so flustered and angry, but she was sure this had something to do with Bai Xiangxiu. I won\u2019t let her get away with this! Someone finally gave her a shirt to wrap herself up with, but it was only a shirt. No one paid any more attention to her; they even stayed far away from her, as if she was some terrifying beast. When she got back to her room, she gave full vent to her embarrassment and rage, smashing everything she could get her hands on. She was a vaunted noble lady! It was all because of that woman that she was like this now! I\u2019m going to kill her, I definitely have to kill her!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu spent a long time muffling her laughter in her blankets after she received the news. Although her fever had abated, the wounds on her butt still hurt greatly. Long Heng didn\u2019t bring up the matter of her going back to the capital anymore. Although Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t leave the city, someone else decided to make a visit. But, when he arrived, everyone in Tranquil City had the most interesting expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu felt that everyone was looking at him weirdly as he wound his way through the city. He\u2019d immediately rushed over when he received news that his wife Lin Qianzi had been rescued after being captured by the enemy. He wanted to bring her back. Although he knew that her child wasn\u2019t his, he still held it in for these sake of a cousin he\u2019d been obsessed with since youth. His entire family had seemed to be against them after the two had gotten married. They hated his Miss Lin and thought of all sorts of ways to torment her. Lin Qianzi, on the other hand, spent her days crying instead and never once showed him a friendly expression. He felt that his patience was just about worn out.</p><br/><p>Although the two had gotten married, they had spent very little time together. He wanted to take her back and properly live out their lives this time. He didn\u2019t want her to come in contact with those people anymore. It was all because of those men that she had lost her way and become stranger and stranger.</p><br/><p>As odd gazes followed him into the military camp, he quickly found Long Heng. How he\u2019d envied the man before because he was her fianc\u00e9! But what was with the look in his eyes now? \u201cThank you very much for rescuing my wife. I\u2019m here to take her away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, then take her away!\u201d Long Heng waved his hand and had someone bring Lin Qianzi over. Bai Xiangxiu took this opportunity to walk over and speak to Ji Zhangshu, \u201cSir Ji, there are some things I\u2019d like to speak to you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu had recognized Bai Xiangxiu immediately. She wasn\u2019t exactly easily forgettable. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak of Miss Lin\u2019s story before she arrives. You can then decide if you want to take her with you or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu frowned, having no idea what this woman wanted to say. Long Heng watched off on the side, a hint of a smile playing about his lips. Bai Xiangxiu was the most familiar with Lin Qianzai\u2019s story, so she talked at length about how she\u2019d fallen for Luo Yunzheng after being captured by him, then how she\u2019d fallen in with Duan Yunying and how she\u2019d been used by him. In the end, she hadn\u2019t even known who the father of her child was, and had thrown her child to his death. Of course, Bai Xiangxiu also spoke of how she\u2019d given her body to Chen Tao to try and get revenge for her child.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll those present can stand as witnesses. If you don\u2019t believe them either, Commander Lu would have the same story to tell you.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to go into detail of what had happened to Lin Qianzi in the enemy camp after so many days. \u201cI originally tried to persuade her not to run, but you have indulged her far too much. Why didn\u2019t you marry her if you liked her? Look at all the trouble she\u2019s stirred up. I can tell you now that the emperor will find out of Lin Qianzi\u2019s actions that placed her desire for personal revenge over her nation sooner or later. At that point, your entire family may be implicated in the ensuing strife.\u201d Lin Qianzi\u2019s only way out lay in the Ji family now. Where could she go if Ji Zhangshu didn\u2019t want her? Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t let her stay anymore, she might cause trouble for Long Heng.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how can this be? How did she turn into this?\u201d Ji Zhangshu looked around at those present. Prince Li, Sir Song of a noble family, and some of Long Heng\u2019s men. He suddenly understood the meaning of the odd gazes. That was pity\u2026 and contempt. What man could accept this?</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi happened to walk in at that precise moment. She felt particularly close to Ji Zhangshu. In her mind, he\u2019d been the one who\u2019d cared about her the most since they both were young. He would understand and take care of her even when her parents wouldn\u2019t. However, he actually subconsciously moved aside when she flung herself at him. He didn\u2019t say anything but, \u201cGet your things and let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>He still had to bring her back after all. Minister Lin was waiting for him to return safely with her. Yet Lin Qianzi was in no hurry to pack her things. She slowly walked over to Bai Xiangxiu, but saw Long Heng standing behind her before even speaking. \u201cBai Xiangxiu, you killed my son. I\u2019ll have my revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou killed your own son; you can\u2019t have forgotten that, can you? I\u2019m sure everyone in the enemy camp will remember even if you\u2019ve forgotten that little tidbit.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t shrink back at all and stared right at Lin Qianzi with a dismissive smile. Is the white lotus female lead about to become the black lotus? She was rather curious just how much ability Lin Qianzi would have after this transformation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had actually already thought of what the female lead could do. Isn\u2019t it just her usual tricks of using the men who are madly in love with you? But out of all the men you\u2019ve met, you\u2019ve hurt Luo Yunzheng, Duan Yunying\u2019s dead, and this cousin of yours doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll let you off easily when you return. Who are you going to use in the future? Male supporting character the emperor? They hadn\u2019t even met yet!</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi snorted and turned around to pack her things. She was still very happy to be able to return to the capital. Her cousin was waiting for her in the carriage when she was done, but sent a servant to help her into the carriage. How odd, why is his attitude so different? He used to take care of me so carefully before. Is it because of the child? Ah right, he still wasn\u2019t very understanding of the child, so she had to make a proper explanation. She immediately started her explanation after climbing into the carriage. \u201cCousin, I\u2019m sorry, I know you loved the child very much so, but Bai Xiangxiu was the one who\u2019d killed him. She threw our child to the ground herself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ji Zhangshu frowned, not knowing if what she said was true or not. \u201cWhat was the scene then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Lin Qianzi grew a bit confused. She remembered that she\u2019d grabbed her child, but things had gone a bit hazy after that. \u201cThey discovered me and tried with all their might to take my child back. And then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did they want to take your child?\u201d Ji Zhangshu had heard everything from Bai Xiangxiu, so knew the secret Lin Qianzi had been concealing from him all along, that regarding the origins of her child.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know why they wanted my child. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lin Qianzi didn\u2019t want her cousin to misunderstand anything, because she was already very happy that he\u2019d come to save her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

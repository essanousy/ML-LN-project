The ankle she twisted yesterday still hurt, while her heart was already tired. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that solving one problem only birthed three more. Looks like it really wasn\u2019t easy taking care of a household.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks to Steward Fang, but since I\u2019ve promised Old Madame to help, there can\u2019t be any mistakes. Especially these dishes, they\u2019ll be set as soon as they enter the pot. With a hundred dishes in total, we barely managed to scrape together all the ingredients. They shouldn\u2019t be wasted, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d She usually spoke in a soft whisper, but now her voice was unusually firm.</p><br/><p>Steward Fang felt snubbed and put out. \u201cNaturally. I\u2019m just afraid that it\u2019ll tire you out as the guest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith so much to do, there\u2019s no difference between guests or not. It\u2019s much more important to finish this task. Hey, that little brother over there, you can\u2019t put the vegetables somewhere too hot\u2026 Xiao Shi, tell them to stop, it\u2019s easy for freshly washed vegetables to spoil on a hot surface.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pointed at a servant in the corner, her voice made louder by anxiety.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi hurried over to tell him, but neither of them realized that Long Heng was smiling as he watched from a corner. So it turned out that this girl had times when she was a glib talker too. But he only looked at Song Jiaoyue and said, \u201cShe is doing very well. Even her voice is twice as loud as it is in the prince\u2019s estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have someone take her to rest right now. You really do dote on her dearly.\u201d Long Heng had insisted on taking a look at the kitchens as soon as he\u2019d arrived. Even a blind person could tell he was worried about Bai Xiangxiu. Still, he never expected his friend\u2019s heart to be so set on a concubine. Song Jiaoyue\u2019s heart grew even more pained by the thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense. This prince came on mother\u2019s orders to see if she\u2019d lost face for the prince\u2019s estate.\u201d Long Heng snorted as he finished, flicking his sleeves to leave.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue thought to himself, I hope you\u2019re telling the truth. Maybe then I\u2019ll still have some hope.</p><br/><p>Both of them arrived in the front yard while preoccupied with their own thoughts. First, they paid respects to the old master and presented their gifts. Old Master was already approaching 70 years of age, but he was bright-eyed and full of vitality.</p><br/><p>Still, he didn\u2019t have a good impression of Long Heng. The Song family was one of Confucian classics, so he had difficulty understanding why his grandson would make friends with one who had such a vicious aura. Recently, however, he\u2019d changed his views. And the primary reason behind that was Long Heng\u2019s concubine, who had propped up her husband\u2019s appearances. Thus, he was very polite when meeting Long Heng and much more friendly compared to the times they\u2019d met before.</p><br/><p>Long Heng naturally sensed this, but sat down without minding too much.</p><br/><p>On one side sat a few eminent monks who were busy drinking tea with the old master and speaking of Buddhism. Dressed in gray monk\u2019s robes and with prayer beads in hand, Old Master did indeed somewhat look the part of a Buddhist monk.</p><br/><p>After speaking of Buddha, they were to go to the family hall for worship. As a man of the battlefield, Long Heng really felt like he couldn\u2019t listen any longer. In a small voice, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue silently shook his head in his heart. If you don\u2019t like to listen, why come at all? Still, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have someone accompany you.\u201d He then had a young pageboy lead Long Heng out. Though Long Heng had been friends with Song Jiaoyue since childhood, he was an introvert who didn\u2019t visit the Song estate often. As a result, Song Jiaoyue was very familiar with the prince\u2019s estate, while Long Heng knew little of the Song estate.</p><br/><p>The young servant led him outside, and they didn\u2019t manage to get very far before bumping into a most undesirable person.</p><br/><p>Madame Lin and Miss Lin, as well as Madame Song, were all walking this way. Most likely, they were here to request a meeting with the Great Master monks, but had never expected to bump into Long Heng. Miss Lin\u2019s face suddenly turned red. Ever since she had been rescued, she\u2019d always thought about his kindness, but due to the rules of etiquette she couldn\u2019t thank him in person. She had never expected them to meet under such circumstances, but now she had no idea what to say.</p><br/><p>Right now, her impression of Long Heng had improved somewhat. After experiencing several things, she realized that most of the men in this world were all uncivilized, rude savages. His type could already be considered good in comparison. At least he didn\u2019t tell everyone about what happened between her and that bandit.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect their sudden meeting today to reveal that he really was a handsome man. Though his features were swift and fierce, they had the indomitable spirit of a dauntless male. His posture was straight, and while his actions that day were rough and rude, he could still be considered a gentleman. She opened her mouth to say something, but Long Heng only nodded at them before turning to leave.</p><br/><p>Miss Lin\u2019s face turned stiff as her mouth opened and closed. \u201cPrince Li\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng creased his brows. He never expected her to have the gall to speak and have him stop. Though he was brimming with resentment, he still paused and turned to face her. A pair of icy eyes stared at Miss Lin, who shivered. She couldn\u2019t say a word of thanks. Moreover, if she said such things in public, wouldn\u2019t it be verifying the rumors that she\u2019d gotten captured by bandits after she\u2019d run away?</p><br/><p>In a second, her face turned red as she began to tremble. Her actions naturally inspired pity from others on her behalf. Madame Song didn\u2019t know the details and assumed that the girl was simply shy and scared. \u201cMiss Lin probably wants to ask after the Great Masters\u2019 affairs. Are they still inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t waste any more words, but left as soon as he spoke. He detested her from the bottom of his heart. Ever since he started hating strong and overly artificial women, someone like Bai Xiangxiu, who was timid and had no schemes despite possessing some ability, suited him just fine.</p><br/><p>Long Heng wandered aimlessly around the Song estate before he spotted a servant girl carrying a flash of wine hurrying past his side. He recognized this servant girl as the one by Song Jiaoyue\u2019s side. If he recalled correctly, her name was Bai He.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk her what\u2019s going on; why is she in such a hurry?\u201d He was just curious and couldn\u2019t help but worry that it was related to Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>The Song estate pageboy called out. \u201cBig sister Bai He, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He was in too much of a rush to see who was asking and replied as she hurried by, \u201cThe Mistress Xiu from the prince\u2019s estate said her foot hurts, so I\u2019m going to deliver some wine\u2026\u201d She had already turned the corner by the time she\u2019d finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Long Heng naturally heard her and couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brows. When he recalled the chaos of the kitchens, he was certain that she\u2019d fallen. She was so small and delicate, doubly prone to getting hurt. If he knew earlier, he would\u2019ve reminded her not to act so strong. Now she was injured again, wasn\u2019t she?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d There weren\u2019t many women at the kitchens, so there was no fear of running into anyone. More importantly, she was hurt!</p><br/><p>The servant boy didn\u2019t think it was proper to bring a guest to the kitchens. If the eldest young master found out, wouldn\u2019t he be scolded? But this was his guest\u2019s woman, after all. It was probably normal to have a look. When Long Heng arrived at the kitchens, it was to see everyone busying themselves with work. Ye-mama was standing by a room in the corner, so he strode over and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-mama dropped into a bow at the sight of her family\u2019s master and replied, \u201cYesterday madame went to the greenhouse and sprained her ankle. She couldn\u2019t tell anyone, so she used vinegar to rub it in private. Today she worsened the injury by working with it, so now it\u2019s swollen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Long Heng smote the table in his anger. Why didn\u2019t she know to cherish herself? Why did other people\u2019s matters have her fussing to such an extent?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

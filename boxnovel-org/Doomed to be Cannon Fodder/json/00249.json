Suddenly, the hidden guard following Bai Xiangxiu returned. He stood beside Long Heng with a dazed look still on his face. Long Heng raised his brows quizzically at the hidden guard. He wanted the guard to tell him why Lin Qianzi was beaten up. That guard turned to face Long Heng as his fingers flickered. This gesture meant that a few sentences wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover the entire story. Just what happened? How can it be such a long story?</p><br/><p>Long Heng could only continue watching off on the side. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t kneel. She bluntly said, \u201cIn response to Your Majesty, I didn\u2019t push her into the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis commoner\u2019s wife can testify for Noble Lady Qian. Princess Consort Li must\u2019ve shoved her into the water. After all, they\u2019ve never been in good terms with each other.\u201d Madame Yue actually came up to testify? Bai Xiangxiu immediately broke into laughter when Madame Yue was done talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d Madame Yue shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I was just incredibly impressed by Madame Yue. I didn\u2019t realize you were a clairvoyant. How could you possibly know whether I shoved her into the water or not? You weren\u2019t even there! These ladies here can testify that.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pointed at the ladies, who were also very puzzled. Their horses had been spooked, so even though Madame Yue had proposed a search for the two, their startled horses had already run off quite a distance. Someone else had already rescued the noble lady and princess consort by the time they had gotten back. How could they possibly have had the time to gaze at the river when they were so focused on trying to regain control of their horses? Moreover, it was too far to actually see what was going on in the river anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 It\u2019s true that both of you have never been on good terms.\u201d Madam Yue was now twisting words and logic. She\u2019d decided to give Lin Qianzi a hand because they\u2019ve been close friends before she had even married. Unfortunately, a number of rabbits had jumped out of nowhere and startled the horses just when she was just about to arrive at the river. She would\u2019ve been thrown off her horse and injured if she hadn\u2019t known how to ride properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we possibly be on bad terms? At that time, Miss\u2026 Noble Lady Qian wanted to wash her face by the river and only asked me to accompany her. She could\u2019ve asked any of you. Why would she ask me to accompany her if we are on bad terms with each other? Why would anyone invite their enemy to accompany them for such a thing? Are they insane?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s temper was now a little different compared to the time she\u2019d first arrived in this world. She used to be someone who kept to herself, but she was now a little more dominant. It couldn\u2019t be helped; there was simply too many sly and deceitful people around her. She had no choice but to become stronger.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue broke into laughter, even though he shouldn\u2019t be making any sounds in the crowd. However, the way she was using her hands to emphasize her argument was simply too funny. The crowd soon followed Song Jiaoyue\u2019s lead and roared into laughter. Princess Consort Li did make a good argument for herself. Even though the words she\u2019d chosen were a bit vulgar, it was quite obviously due to frustration.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi immediately realized that her plan had gone awfully wrong. It was all Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s fault for playing such an illogical card! She gritted her teeth and retorted, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I only wished to get to know Princess Consort Li better since she\u2019s no longer a concubine. We will definitely meet very regularly in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoble Lady Qian must be thinking too much. You reside in the palace while I am nothing but a commoner. Why would we meet regularly?\u201d There was a bit of a smirk on Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face, which made Lin Qianzi\u2019s complexion turn even more ashen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I was only doing this for the sake of His Majesty. But I never expected that you\u2019d shove me into the river and that you\u2019d even\u2026 beat me up while I was in the water!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hidden guard began to complain inwardly. He was the biggest witness! However, his illusions were currently still lying in shattered shards around his feet.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi started to shed tears again. \u201cThe injuries I\u2019ve received on my body is the proof! And\u2026 also this one on my face.\u201d After that, she raised her hand and pointed at the handprint that Luo Yunzheng had left on her face. She\u2019d never imagined that his heartlessness would end up helping her instead. It was such an odd turn of events.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions changed after they saw the handprint on her face, Prince Li as well. The emperor also frowned and coldly remarked, \u201cPrincess Consort Li. You were the only person accompanying her at that time. Are you telling me that she slapped herself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe. Who\u2019s to say that she didn\u2019t?\u201d Someone in the crowd snorted, which caused the crowd to roar into laughter again.</p><br/><p>The emperor remained calm. Deep inside, he genuinely felt that she deserved to be slapped. It was her own fault that her reputation was being destroyed. Minister Lin suddenly came to the fore and dropped to his knees. \u201cYour Majesty, please deliver justice for my daughter! She is now part of the royal family, even though it was this loyal subject\u2019s fault for not raising her well. By beating my daughter up, isn\u2019t this more than enough proof that the princess consort has no respect for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor looked back at Bai Xiangxiu again. For some reason, he genuinely wanted to see how she was going to talk her way out of this. However, all he saw was the frown on her face, which made her seemed very pitiful and adorable. She then sneezed violently and replied with a smile after sniffling a little, \u201cThere\u2019s no way she slapped herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d The emperor was curious. For what reason did she say that it was impossible that she slapped herself?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu pointed at her face, \u201cIf she slapped herself, the thumb pint should be facing downwards instead of facing up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone secretly praised Bai Xiangxiu for her wit when they realized how much sense she made. But wasn\u2019t this also proof that she was the person who slapped the noble lady? Long Heng shook his head. He was curious where she learned all these things, as her brain was genuinely filled with all these weird ideas.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was proud of herself. She might not have read a lot of books, but she had twenty years of accumulated knowledge from watching television shows! It was only logical that she\u2019d remember some of these tropes. This time, she was putting her knowledge from detective films into good use!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you were the one who beat her?\u201d The emperor\u2019s voice no longer sounded cold. In fact, he seemed a little interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only proof that someone had slapped Noble Lady Qian. It doesn\u2019t mean that it was I.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu walked up to Lin Qianzi, \u201cDoes anyone know what\u2019s the difference between a man\u2019s hand and a woman\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some busybody among the crowd replied, \u201cA man has a bigger hand than a woman, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked towards him and gently smiled, \u201cYes. You are correct.\u201d She then looked at Lin Qianzi in the eye and placed her hand on the latter\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>The handprint on Lin Qianzi\u2019s face spanned across half of her face. The emperor\u2019s complexion turned green before Bai Xiangxiu even placed her hand on Lin Qianzi\u2019s face. How could he not turn green? Lin Qianzi had very obviously been slapped by a man. The handprint was significantly bigger than Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand. The emperor didn\u2019t care that Lin Qianzi was using little schemes to attack Long Heng and his wife. It didn\u2019t even matter that her schemes were being revealed. However, a noble lady had been slapped by some other man! This was obviously inappropriate! Moreover, the man who\u2019d slapped her was surely not the emperor himself, as he\u2019d been sitting here the whole time!</p><br/><p>So, this meant that even the emperor himself was nearly, or had been cucked by some other man! Lin Qianzi received quite a fright as well. She immediately kowtowed for mercy, \u201cNo! Your Majesty! It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on? Who was the man who slapped you?!\u201d The emperor slammed the table in a fit of anger. He\u2019d finally admitted defeat in front of Lin Qianzi\u2019s apparent lack of wit. He should\u2019ve personally slapped her. Why would she conjure up a scheme that was so easily exposed by others? Her incompetence had even brought shame to him! Just how stupid must she be to be able to do something like this? Moreover, she\u2019d allowed Bai Xiangxiu to pick her scheme apart in front of everyone! This was unforgivable! </p><br/><p>The emperor was in no mood to show her any more mercy. She simply brought too much trouble for what she was worth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

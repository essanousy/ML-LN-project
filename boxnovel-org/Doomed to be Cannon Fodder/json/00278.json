His fingers subconsciously twitched. The pageboy that had returned was already in control of the situation and kicked almost everyone out. The only people left in the room were Bai Xiangxiu, Xiaoshi and Xiaohuan. The two maids, who were carefully holding onto her, led Bai Xiangxiu to a small reclining couch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you tell me everything in one go, or continue after she\u2019d left the room? Go check on her and see why she fainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor assented and went over to check on the princess consort. Originally, he\u2019d wanted to say that excessive blood loss had caused the prince to temporarily lose consciousness, but Bai Xiangxiu had fainted before he could finish. It wasn\u2019t as if he could do anything about that, right? Hadn\u2019t the prince ordered him to make his condition sound a little more critical? It wasn\u2019t like he was really in a bad condition!</p><br/><p>The doctor silently walked over to Bai Xiangxiu and took her pulse. Shu\u2019er helped Long Heng bind his wounds with extreme proficiency. He had had a great deal of practice from his time on the battlefield so that he was now very adept at this task. Even Long Heng nodded his head satisfactorily. This rascal has matured quite a bit, at long last.</p><br/><p>He worriedly looked over at where Bai Xiangxiu was, but only saw that the doctor\u2019s originally furrowed brows had practically become the deep creases of a bun. This made Long Heng feel like there was an enormous problem with the situation. He wanted to get off the bed and even began to struggle to his feet, but Shu\u2019er immediately said, \u201cYour Highness, your wound will split open. Please do not move anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Long Heng had thought that she\u2019d already built up enough tolerance for the sight of blood after being on the battlefield. But who would\u2019ve thought she would still faint at the drop of a hat? It didn\u2019t really make sense.</p><br/><p>After a detailed examination, the doctor lifted his hand and sighed, \u201cCongratulations, Your Highness, congratulations! The princess consort\u2019s pulse indicates that she is pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Long Heng was completely struck dumb. The doctor doggedly continued on, \u201cIt seems she\u2019s been pregnant for about two months or so. Her pulse is very stable, but due to a little shock just now, she is a bit weak. As long as she takes some medicine that calms the fetus, she will be alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 then go prescribe some medicine quickly.\u201d Two months. So she\u2019d gotten pregnant in Tranquil City, then made the arduous journey back and undergone so many things. This child must be as strong as iron! A smile tugged at Long Heng\u2019s lips. Unexpectedly, he felt this unborn child already had some assets that made him proud.</p><br/><p>The doctor still had to dress his wounds for him. Long Heng said, \u201cJust go out soon and say I can\u2019t hold on for much longer. Have them prepare funeral arrangements, but I have something to make clear. No servants may enter, and no one may notify the old madame. Anyone who disregards my orders will be severely punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng looked at Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s pale face. If it wasn\u2019t for him scaring her, she wouldn\u2019t have fainted. He hoped that she wouldn\u2019t be frightened again when she woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the princess consort wakes up in a while, just say that this prince is completely fine.\u201d His heart was slightly warmed. It seemed he really did have a place in this girl\u2019s heart. He really liked this feeling. Long Heng slowly drifted off to sleep. The unexpected happiness and the blood loss had tired him out.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiangxiu, she woke up with a start because she had seen Long Heng covered with blood from head to toe in her dream. \u201cLong Heng, Long Heng\u2026\u201d She fiercely sat up, her entire body in a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Consort, the prince is alright, he\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t get riled up.\u201d Xiaoshi hurriedly explained as Xiaohuan supported her to a sitting position, pointing to the bed as she did so. \u201cThe prince has just fallen asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFallen asleep?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu naturally didn\u2019t believe it and walked over. She sighed with relief when she saw him breathing evenly. The great joy and relief she felt robbed her of the tension in her body, causing her to sway unsteadily, about to faint</p><br/><p>A hand suddenly supported her, and a voice spoke,, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Take your time and lie down beside me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was extremely happy to see that Long Heng had awoken. \u201cYour injuries though\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Come over here slowly.\u201d Long Heng wanted to prop himself up, but Bai Xiangxiu pushed him back down and silently slipped into bed next to him. She began to cry after she saw his body wrapped in bandages.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, nothing\u2019s happened to me. Half of the blood you saw belonged to someone else.\u201d After a pause, he said, \u201cYou may all go out! Bring in the princess consort\u2019s medicine after it is done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf nothing\u2019s happened to you, I won\u2019t need to drink my medicine, let me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLie down like a good girl. Don\u2019t move about randomly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who\u2019s injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have a couple of superficial wounds. It will get better very soon. You are the most important one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it seem something is not right?\u201d She knew Long Heng loved her dearly, but to love her to this extent seemed a bit abnormal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat seems not right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk more about this. It was Su Yun\u2019s assassin who caused your injuries. I\u2019m definitely not going to let this go this time. She has gone far beyond just overboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I purposely got injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you know I would worry about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too emotional. Listen to me\u2026\u201d Long Heng revealed his full plan to his wife. Bai Xiangxiu was shocked beyond words. She didn\u2019t think Long Heng could\u2019ve done so much secretly. It was enough to overturn a dynasty.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had wanted to give her a nice surprise, but she was not quite the same now as she had been in the past. Worrying too much would harm her body. \u201cNow that you know what\u2019s going on, you won\u2019t overthink it right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but couldn\u2019t you just trick the enemy into believing that you injured yourself? Why did you have to actually injure yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to make them believe it. Besides, I left one alive to go back and make a report.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Heng, can you think of me and your child in the future whenever you want to do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know? If you know about it, why would you let yourself get so emotional? What if something happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow about what?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu looked at him, unable to make head or tail of those words. No matter how she thought about it, this sentence made no sense.</p><br/><p>Only then did Long Heng guess that she was talking about Xiao Lin. However, seeing her wide eyed appearance of wanting to know more extremely amused him, so he teased her, \u201cGuess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess\u2026guess what? Do I look like I\u2019m in the mood for a guessing game?!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu wanted to punch him, but she stopped herself because his body was covered in wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you are carrying our child again, you must be extremely careful.\u201d Long Heng was afraid she would become emotional again, so he reached out a hand to stroke her abdomen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu sat up in agitation. In modern society, one didn\u2019t get pregnant with a second child that quickly! She couldn\u2019t accept things for a moment. Was it really a good thing to be so good at reproducing? Wouldn\u2019t the government come regulate these things? No, she should say, she didn\u2019t want to be a mother again this quickly. Shouldn\u2019t she rest for a few more years? But there weren\u2019t any contraceptives in ancient times. If she continued like this for the next ten years, she might even end up making a soccer team.</p><br/><p>Facepalm. This was too scary! She really wanted to invent a condom or something along those lines. Wait a minute, it seemed there was a type of medicine here that could prevent pregnancy if one drank it after one did it. It was usually given to concubines. Perhaps, if she really couldn\u2019t take it next time, she could use that. Even though it was a little bitter, it was better than giving birth to a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time after we do it, I better drink prevention soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you are the princess consort. Why would you want to drink something like that?\u201d I really don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s thinking. What kind of a main wife would use those types of things?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if I continue having babies, won\u2019t it be bad for my body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng pushed her down and laughed. \u201cBut, it\u2019ll good to have a few more sons, so that when the father and his sons go to battle, they\u2019ll be invincible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have such a vivid imagination.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes at him. She would never approve of letting her sons go into battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

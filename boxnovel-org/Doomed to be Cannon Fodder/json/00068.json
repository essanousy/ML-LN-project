Although she\u2019d been taken into his rooms, she was still only a head female servant in the lack of an official wife.</p><br/><p>How could she not understand his current state when she saw his condition?</p><br/><p>Settings aside the eldest young master\u2019s tastes, he wasn\u2019t one to fancy simply any woman. Were it not for a few fellow sisters who served him since childhood and were clever and quick-witted, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted them into his house no matter what. But how could they not understand how he felt? Even if he took them in, it didn\u2019t mean he was taken with them. More likely, he was just familiar with them, or simply pitied them.</p><br/><p>It was different this time. Song Jiaoyue had actually blurted out a woman\u2019s name, and that woman was none other than Prince Li\u2019s concubine. Yu Se had thought that eldest young master had been acting differently these days. Not only did he stop spending time with the girls in his rooms, but he often wore a dejected expression. But it all made sense as soon as she put everything together.</p><br/><p>She sharply inhaled. It would\u2019ve been fine had the young master adored a young woman from another house. He\u2019d be able to save himself trouble if he went calling along with Madame Song. But this particular woman\u2019s status was too unique. It seemed that eldest young master would have to resign himself to suffer. How would Yu Se not understand what kind of person Song Jiaoyue was?</p><br/><p>Still, Yu Se could only keep such thoughts in her heart. If she brought up the subject, eldest young master would be embarrassed to the point of anger. Thus, she pretended not to understand a thing and simply tidied him up before drawing the bed curtains and going to rest off to the side.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When Song Jiaoyue woke up the next day, he was clearly less gentle than before. He summoned a servant and asked, \u201cWho was it that helped me to bed last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl replied, \u201cIt was big sister Yu Se.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall her in.\u201d He always strove for self-restraint, but couldn\u2019t help relaxing his guard when he was at home. That had been especially true last night. He still remembered some of what had happened earlier, but who knew what he\u2019d said after he came home by himself? If anything spread, she would catch the worst of it.</p><br/><p>She was so delicate, so how could she bear such a thing against him?</p><br/><p>As he was thinking, he spotted the small plant growing by the window. Though its green and verdant growth was very pleasing to the eye, it was tiny, and its entire body was covered in spikes. He really didn\u2019t understand why she treated such a thing like a treasure.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue broke into a warm smile, even as Yu Se entered the room. It made her heart give a start. Ever since he had brought back that plant, eldest young master had cherished it like a treasure. He even watered it himself, and never let any of them touch it.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Se, you\u2019ve been at my side for ten years now, right?\u201d Song Jiaoyue inadvertently swept his eyes over her, though his expression was a bit stern.</p><br/><p>Yu Se knelt on the ground with a thump. She naturally understood that while the eldest young master appeared sentimental, he was actually quite ruthless. He\u2019d definitely dismiss her from his service if he found cause to dislike her. It was true that he wouldn\u2019t just sell her to some servant boy or match her up with a random person, due to taking their past history into consideration. Still, he had ways to make sure she never appear before him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, eldest young master.\u201d Yu Se was afraid, but replied very prudently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, last night\u2026\u201d Song Jiaoyue trailed off on purpose, while Yu Se was quick to pick up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest young master fell asleep as soon as he came back last night. He never woke the entire night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue smiled and nodded his head. \u201cUnderstood. You don\u2019t need to kneel either, so hurry and help make me presentable!\u201d He didn\u2019t press the issue, knowing that whatever he said last night, it wouldn\u2019t spread any further.</p><br/><p>After freshening up, his first deed was to water that tiny green cactus. Today was the third day, so it probably needed to drink. After watering the plant, he went directly to Madame Song. As long as he was with his mother, he\u2019d see her sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Even if it was only a glance, that was just as well. He wouldn\u2019t ask for more.</p><br/><p>But by sheer coincidence, he arrived just in time to hear his mother had gone to Hundred Fragrance Courtyard and hurried after her. He was surprised to see his mother from a distance as soon as he arrived. Her tiny figure was surrounded by a handful of servants and old maids, while a few distinctive ingredients were set out by her side.</p><br/><p>For example, weeds\u2026</p><br/><p>Wildflowers\u2026</p><br/><p>And other unknown plants\u2026</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue barely avoided laughing out loud, but watched as she pointed amongst the flowers and plants, filled with inner self-confidence.</p><br/><p>When he drew closer, he heard her speak. \u201cDon\u2019t call these ones weeds. They can actually improve flavor as well. It\u2019s rare to find them in this season, so they mustn\u2019t be frozen. Put them in a room that\u2019s neither too hot nor too cold. Besides having plants for garnishes, the most important thing is the freshness of the vegetables. Also, you have to soak the beans ahead of time. Once that\u2019s done, will we have we prepared everything for today?\u201d Beans made up a majority of vegetarian dishes, so of course she had to probe and make sure.</p><br/><p>By then, Song Jiaoyue had already arrived at Madame Song\u2019s side. When she saw her son, she hastily placed a finger against her lips to show that he should be quiet. Then she pointed at Bai Xiangxiu, indicating that Bai was currently inspecting the ingredients, so she shouldn\u2019t be disturbed. Song Jiaoyue would prefer nothing less, so he stood on one side without speaking. After watching her inspect many different things without sitting down or even drinking a sip of tea, he began to grow worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, why not rest a bit?\u201d he reminded from the side.</p><br/><p>Only then did Madame Song say, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We promised Old Madame that we couldn\u2019t exhaust her helpful assistant. But I really am envious; how did she find such a formidable lass! This one\u2019s made preparations for sixteen different dishes in just this bit of time. Madame Xiu, come over and rest. You can see to the rest later.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words were out of her mouth, Madame Song felt a bitter gaze turn her way and nearly spat out her tea. She hadn\u2019t said anything untoward, had she?</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangxiu simply walked over, wringing her handkerchief as she spoke. \u201cGreetings to Sir Song.\u201d Then she looked towards Madame Song with a pitiful air. \u201cMadame Song, I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t gathered up a hundred dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had invited Bai over to make dishes, but no matter how she did it, she couldn\u2019t make a hundred different ones.</p><br/><p>Madame Song wrinkled her brows. Although she was in charge of the household, she was better with the account books than personally taking charge of food and ingredients. Now they were in a predicament. If they could only make around eighty-some dishes, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to save face. \u201cWhat to do now? Tomorrow\u2019s the start of the banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we could manage it if we forced it, but we might not have enough ingredients,\u201d said Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go gather some ingredients, as long as we can make more dishes,\u201d Song Jiaoyue hastened to say. He wanted to take part in some way, too. Madame Song didn\u2019t suspect anything. After all, this was the old master\u2019s birthday, so a son should naturally expend some effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other dishes can we make?\u201d Madame Song asked as she sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to gather some canned peaches\u2026\u201d started Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cWell, beets made with peaches, a type of cold dish. Then we can have pickled vegetables with bean curd. We don\u2019t have anything pickled vegetables here, so you can send someone to the prince\u2019s estate to get it from Winter Garden. I have a lot there. After that, there\u2019s bitter melon with egg. If we make make it pretty, it should be presentable. Another one is fragrant spicy lotus root, which we can carve into something presentable as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she finished, she saw both Madame Song and her son staring at her and gave a start, her face turning red. \u201cWhat\u2026 what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Song smiled. \u201cI never thought that brain of yours had so many dishes. I haven\u2019t even heard of these ones before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re, they\u2019re all commonplace dishes.\u201d Did they need to be so moved? Weren\u2019t you the ones who asked me to come help you in the first place? If I couldn\u2019t help out when you were so busy, then what would be the point of me coming over? Bai Xiangxiu had always thought of herself as a sincere person who did earnest work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

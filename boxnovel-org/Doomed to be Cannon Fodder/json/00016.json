However, it was clear that she had done her research on how to escape Prince Li\u2019s complex. After jumping out of the water, she slipped into a wooden hut that she had set up and changed back into the clothes of a woman.</p><br/><p>Once she turned back into a woman, the pursuers lost their target and began to mill around aimlessly. Things were progressing smoothly, but she felt rather depressed. Wasn\u2019t that fiance of hers too violent? He had ordered a girl to be beaten to death. Although he had been born with a handsome appearance, he was pretending to be something he wasn\u2019t and that frightened her. Also, the woman she had been talking to must have been his concubine. She hadn\u2019t thought that she would be that beautiful. With such a beautiful concubine, would he even take a second look at her after marriage? Definitely not, she thought. After she finished changing into her female disguise, she returned home.</p><br/><p>As she entered her courtyard, she was greeted by a snow white figure. Startled, she was about to leave when the white figure spoke, \u201cYounger cousin, are you still going to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, older cousin, how did you know it was me?\u201d Lin Qianzi walked back, a sheepish smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I possibly mistake you? I told you that it\u2019s not a good idea to provoke Prince Li, but you still went anyway. How was it? Are you satisfied with your fiance? Based on looks, he\u2019s ranked amongst the top.\u201d Ji Zhangshu was almost sneering as he spoke. He\u2019d adored his younger cousin for many years, and hadn\u2019t thought that his aunt would actually match her with that cold-hearted killer.</p><br/><p>Distress showed on Lin Qianzi\u2019s face before she threw herself into her older cousin\u2019s arms, crying. \u201cCousin, that man\u2026 he\u2019s really scary. He killed someone without batting an eye, he actually beat a girl to death with staves. And, and\u2026 the woman in his rear court is both beautiful and kind. He won\u2019t even take a look at me. What should I do, what should I do? I don\u2019t want to marry him, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu patted her head while his heart ached for her. He said tenderly, \u201cI know, I\u2019ll definitely help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, could you help me escape this marriage? I just want to hide for some time so I don\u2019t have to marry him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tears had soaked into his clothing, making Ji Zhangshu feel even more sorry for her. Helpless, he said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do anything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi nodded in gratitude before continuing to hide and cry in Ji Zhangshu\u2019s arms. When she thought about Prince Li\u2019s sharp gaze, she definitely felt uncomfortable all over.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was currently gardening outside her room. Recently, she had been planting things in the garden of her courtyard whenever she had the time. However, the weather was a little too cold, so she couldn\u2019t plant too many things. After she was tired of fiddling with plants, she went back to talk to the cactus Huo\u2019er. She then found a soft shoot growing out from Huo\u2019er\u2019s body. Was it about to branch off?</p><br/><p>\u201cItchy, it\u2019s really itchy\u2026\u201d Huo\u2019er wasn\u2019t used to the newly sprouted shoot, and kept complaining that it was itchy.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust hang in there. Once it grows bigger, you\u2019ll have a companion.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt that Huo\u2019er\u2019s voice had matured a little, but it was still a little child\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnduring. Huo\u2019er is enduring. But Huo\u2019er wants to feel the breeze, wants sunlight.\u201d Huo\u2019er always acted cute towards Bai Xiangxiu. She had no other choice but to move it to the windowsill and open the window so Huo\u2019er could bask in the sunlight and the breeze. However, it was still cold out, so the moment she opened the window, the cold winds rushed in to bite her. Xiao Shi said, \u201cAh, Mistress Xiu, you can\u2019t.You might catch a cold!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, keep the window open for now. Close it later.\u201d She went off to wash her hands after giving her orders.</p><br/><p>These past few days had been rather tiring for her, so she just wanted to rest early. As a result, she was already in bed before the sun had set. Although, she hadn\u2019t taken off her clothes, she was just resting while trying to remember if the book had ever mentioned the female lead secretly spying on Prince Li, Long Heng. However, after the female lead left, wasn\u2019t it time for her to start her plans to escape marriage?</p><br/><p>She remembered that today was the day the male and female leads\u2019 marriage date was supposed to be decided. In the end, it would be March of the following year! But she would die in May of that year. She had to leave before May. Ruminating between plans and the novel\u2019s progression, she grew a bit tired until Long Heng brought some people over.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d been a little happy when he\u2019d heard this woman protecting his reputation today. As an appropriate response to the provocation from his fianc\u00e9e, he thought of coming to her place to sit for a while. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as simple as just sitting. He had brought gifts and even wanted to sleep over for a night before leaving. The idea of bringing gifts had been suggested to him by a pageboy by his side. Although he had felt a little awkward, spending a bit of effort on his first woman was something he felt he should do.</p><br/><p>Who would have expected that he would be greeted by such a startling sight the moment he walked in? Xiao Shi was sprawled on the desk, sleeping, while Bai Xiangxiu was snoozing on the bed, fully dressed. Although the floor was clean, the window had been left open. He couldn\u2019t help but frown at this carefree attitude. Although she was a concubine, she was also a master. Wasn\u2019t she treating her servant too casually?</p><br/><p>With annoyance in his heart, he commanded, \u201cClose the window.\u201d</p><br/><p>His pageboy was outside and hurriedly went to close the window. However, because he was too hurried, he didn\u2019t notice the cactus Huo\u2019er and was brutally pricked on his palm. \u201cAiyah\u2026\u201d The servant didn\u2019t know that this thing had such fearsome thorns and actually shouted in his fright.</p><br/><p>Since he got pricked, the pageboy instinctively smacked poor Huo\u2019er, who overbalanced and fell to the floor. The flower pot shattered into small pieces and it cried out in pain, \u201cMistress, save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, what\u2019s the matter? Save who?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu woke up all of a sudden and ran out in a fright. She saw Huo\u2019er thrown to the ground and a twinge of pain ran through her heart as she ran over to grab it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, stop, that thing has thorns.\u201d Long Heng saw that she had run out with two white, bare feet, sprinting without hesitation towards that strange plant. Seeing that she was about to grab it with her hands without caring whether or not she would get hurt, he hurriedly called out to stop her.</p><br/><p>She froze at his words, turning slowly on the spot to face him. Confusion clear in her eyes, she took one look at him before kneeling with a thump, \u201cGreetings to Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why is the male lead here? Mr. Plotline, can you get any more off track?!</p><br/><p>\u201cRise!\u201d Long Heng was a little speechless at this woman\u2019s actions. However, upon seeing that she wasn\u2019t getting up but continuing to pick up the pieces of the flower pot, he couldn\u2019t help but suffer a blow, am I really not as important as a weird little plant? Thus, he said, \u201cThat thing is so dangerous! Why not just throw it away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! It\u2019s also a life, you can\u2019t just kill it like that.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu grew agitated, and almost hugged the cactus protectively. Like a mother hen protecting her chicks, she stared at him guardedly.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s miniscule amount of burgeoning affection for her was completely erased in an instant. With a toss of his sleeves, he said, \u201cThen just live with it for the rest of your life!\u201d Hadn\u2019t she just spoken up for him? Now she\u2019s actually looking at me like that for that little plant. This woman is rather gutsy.</p><br/><p>He walked away resentfully, perplexing Bai Xiangxiu and Xiao Shi. Even a long while after he\u2019d left, they still thought they were dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress Xiu, did His Highness come over just now? Was I seeing things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably, not?\u201d What was up with the male lead? Or perhaps the story just hadn\u2019t mentioned these things? It was because Long Heng had come and gone so suddenly that Bai Xiangxiu simply thought that the male lead had come to cause trouble and neglected any other possibilities.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was currently depressed. His fiancee had actually boldly snuck into the mansion to eavesdrop on some nonsense and had even jumped into the water in front of so many men. This had completely undermined his dignity. Then he\u2019d finally found a woman who would speak for him, but it was clear that he wasn\u2019t even as important as the plant she was raising.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

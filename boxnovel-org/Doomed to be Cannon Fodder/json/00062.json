It was fresh and pure like pine and bamboo or cypress, a scent one could only find high in the mountains. The perfume from rouge was so light as to be almost nonexistent. Just where did one raise a girl like this, so sweet and soft to the point she didn\u2019t even seem to have any bones?</p><br/><p>He subconsciously tightened his grip, worried that she\u2019d fall.</p><br/><p>By the side, the pageboy by his side found the situation amiss. Where was this? The prince\u2019s estate! He could tell that his master\u2019s expression looked fascinated and affected. If anything happened, wouldn\u2019t it offend that strict and rigorous prince? So he hastened to say, \u201cBig sister servant, why aren\u2019t you getting up yet? Sir, you haven\u2019t been hurt, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue laughed bitterly as he let go. Still, his heart ached, a dull pain that never seemed to subside. If possible, he really wanted to hold her for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi really was frightened and jumped up like a hare. \u201cMadame Xiu, are you alright? Did this servant hurt or crash into you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. Has Sir Song been injured?\u201d When Bai Xiangxiu saw Xiao Shi get up, she hastened to follow and dutifully backed away, a marked difference from her behavior before of wanting to get close to him.</p><br/><p>At this point, Song Jiaoyue seemed to understand why he\u2019d felt a trace of unease when they\u2019d first met. It was because she had been secretly staring at him.</p><br/><p>He actually felt unused to her lack of attention now, but at the same time, he began to respect this woman. She could put down her feelings just as she\u2019d taken them up and adapt to the circumstances. What a great difference when compared to him!</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue felt that he was a man who could only pick someone up and never let them go. \u201cI\u2019m fine, but you\u2026have to take good care of yourself.\u201d His reply was polite but stilted, and he didn\u2019t dare look at her face anymore.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately changed the subject. \u201cWhy did Sir Song come by?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue also replied instantly. \u201cNaturally, to inquire after the prince\u2019s injury. Is he better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready much better, please come this way,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was slightly ill at ease. She kept getting the feeling that Sir Song\u2019s gaze was scorching hot. But that had to be a misconception. After all, didn\u2019t he feel nothing? He had no heart. Since he was heartless, she shouldn\u2019t think too much either, or else it\u2019d turn everything into a mess.</p><br/><p>She led the way forward like a mistress of the household, while Song Jiaoyue watched her from behind. Her figure was slender and pretty, her long hair dutifully piled up on her head to expose a spotlessly white nape.</p><br/><p>This Madame Xiu\u2019s beauty certainly had no equal. No one would be able to ignore her when they faced her! Even Long Heng, his ice-cold friend, was no exception. He only hoped that the other could love her a bit more tenderly.</p><br/><p>Soon enough, they arrived at Winter Garden. The doors to the courtyard were wide open, since more people had come to visit since the prince was resting here. Bai Xiangxiu walked in first and found the prince still sitting properly on his bed, reading a book. She had no idea he\u2019d gone out earlier, and made a pretense of asking, \u201cYour Highness, Sir Song has arrived to call on you. I don\u2019t know if\u2026\u201d He should come in, or you should go out?</p><br/><p>It was obvious that an injured patient shouldn\u2019t go out, but she had no idea that his recent headstrong actions had worsened his injury to the point where he couldn\u2019t walk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him come in, you can go rest.\u201d After taking care of matters, she hadn\u2019t come back quickly but had run into Song Jiaoyue instead? He didn\u2019t know why, but his heart constricted again. He was uncomfortable!</p><br/><p>Soon afterwards, someone led Song Jiaoyue inside. Song Jiaoyue had long recovered to his usual self and smiled as soon as he entered. \u201cJust where did you get all these injuries?\u201d Although he\u2019d walked in carelessly, his eyes were still darting around to all corners of the room.</p><br/><p>This used to be her sleeping quarters, no? But why were there so many flowers and plants in here, to the point that it seemed a little strange? Still, they smelled very nice, as if he\u2019d entered a garden in the full bloom of spring again. His mood instantly improved as he sat by Long Heng\u2019s side to look at his friend. The upturned corners of his lips proved that their owner was feeling happy.</p><br/><p>Long Heng only said a few words, \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor injury. Look at you, you\u2019ve come visiting this prince\u2019s estate ever since it was built. How did you lose you way into Summer Garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSummer Garden?\u201d Shoot, he must be overthinking things. He hastily smiled and said, \u201cHow could I not know where Summer Garden is? You\u2019re rampantly underestimating my memory. I heard that you were treating your wounds elsewhere, so I took a detour. On my way, I happened to meet\u2026\u201d he paused as he saw Long Heng\u2019s pupils violently contract.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue inwardly clenched his fists. Indeed, the other valued her, so he continued, \u201cMadame Xiu seemed like she was about to faint, so I supported her for a bit before we both went this way.\u201d It was better to reveal how he\u2019d held her without trying to hide it, rather than have someone else use it as a pretext for gossip in the future. After all, they couldn\u2019t be sure that no one else had seen them at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cFaint?\u201d Long Heng grew worried, though not a trace of it appeared on his face. As a man, he naturally refused to be anyone\u2019s laughingstock, but his heart was filled with anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely. Let\u2019s not talk about that, were your injuries caused by\u2026 that person from the Lin family?\u201d Song Jiaoyue intentionally changed the topic and saw Long Heng\u2019s expression completely change. Honestly speaking, that Miss Lin was really impressive if she could cause his friend\u2019s face to change like this.</p><br/><p>This was an unpleasant topic as well. It was obvious Long Heng didn\u2019t want to talk about the details. After the two of them chatted for a while, Song Jiaoyue stood up. He wasn\u2019t the type that normally enjoyed the things in this room, but found his attention drawn to a certain plant. That plant was covered in nothing but thorns. The young lady he\u2019d met by the seaside had taken away something just like this, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Anyone would be curious about such a thing, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo\u2019er\u2026 no, it\u2019s a cactus,\u201d Long Heng had asked about it too, but Madame Bai had actually given the plant a name. He coughed lightly. Did he lose some dignity naming it like that to his friend?</p><br/><p>\u201cCactus? Is it a flower? Or a plant?\u201d He reached out to touch it, but Bai Xiangxiu had long heard their conversation from next door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it.\u201d Otherwise he\u2019d be pricked and bleed.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue\u2019s fingers stopped very close to the plant, his heart thumping. Was she worried for his sake? But wasn\u2019t she afraid of Long Heng getting angry if she was so obvious? When he turned back, he saw that Long Heng didn\u2019t look like anything out of the ordinary. It looked like he trusted her very much. Or perhaps, he knew she\u2019d be like this because she was kindhearted. That\u2019s right, she\u2019d always been a kindhearted girl.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue withdrew his hand. \u201cMany thanks for pointing it out. But I\u2019m not sure what the uses of this cactus are?\u201d</p><br/><p>So the young lady from the seaside really had been her. Back then, she\u2019d given her all to obtain this thing, as if she liked it very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cCacti have strong survival skills. Originally, they grew in the desert and could be used to treat sunburn. Moreover\u2026\u201d Urk, once she started talking about plants, she couldn\u2019t stop. For a second there, Bai Xiangxiu had almost forgotten about her status. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t say too much and soon shut her mouth, a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was very happy. Although they were separated by a curtain, this was the first time he\u2019d spoken so many words with her. His heart was filled with delight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They aren\u2019t that big of a hindrance if they don\u2019t have that Su Yun woman to help them. There really is nothing else for me to fear.\u201d Long Heng had been studying this area for many years as he\u2019d always wanted to take down their headquarters. In the end, something good really had come out from all his effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why wouldn\u2019t she help them anymore?\u201d There\u2019s no way she won\u2019t help them, right? Didn\u2019t they save her life? It\u2019s obvious that she will put in her full effort to help Commander Lu defeat us so that she can gloat at Long Heng for not accepting her help! This is a woman with princess syndrome we\u2019re talking about here!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe received an injury while she was running away,\u201d Long Heng replied unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn injury? Where was she hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer face\u201d</p><br/><p>PFF! \u201cWho injured her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026 can\u2019t you just tell me everything at one go?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was anxious to hear the rest of the story, but Long Heng just had to choose this moment to treat his words like gold. </p><br/><p>Long Heng found it hilarious when she got all flustered. He began to describe how he\u2019d given chase to Commander Lu and Su Yun after he destroyed the enemy camp. The two had escaped together on horseback. Long Heng had then given furious chase. Commander Lu was no match for him at all, and the commander actually tossed the woman at him to block a spear when he realized he was losing.</p><br/><p>Su Yun reacted quickly and was able to avoid being struck on her vital points, but her face had been marked by the blade. However, she was quite ruthless and took her revenge as she jumped off the horse, slashing Commander Lu with a knife and severing the tendons on his heel. Long Heng didn\u2019t pay any attention to that woman and was only focused on killing Commander Lu. Unfortunately, someone ended up coming to their rescue. Commander Lu managed to escape, but Su Yun was probably disfigured for life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right. You probably could\u2019ve held back, so you did it on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes I did. You\u2019re so smart.\u201d Long Heng gently pinched Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s cheeks and flopped onto the bed to rest with his limbs all sprawled out. He was being very casual. There wasn\u2019t even a little bit of pretentiousness. Bai Xiangxiu suddenly realized that Su Yun had been dumb to think that she could conquer Long Heng. After all, Long Heng was a domineering CEO-type of man that specialized in curing princess syndromes. Su Yun would probably never forgive him for disfiguring her! </p><br/><p>\u201cI will raze the surrounding smaller camps to the ground tomorrow. Then, the capital is open for capture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Then you better get some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccompany me.\u201d Long Heng took Bai Xiangxiu in his arms and whispered in her ear, \u201cThese past days have been very hard on you. I will definitely make it up to you when we return.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cWho needs rewards? All I need to be content is to see you and Xiao Lin safe and happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Long Heng nestled her in his arms, falling asleep while breathing in her fragrance. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t disrupt him either. Long Heng was showing her his most genuine side right now. She snuggled deeper into his embrace and wrapped her arms around him as she went to sleep.</p><br/><p>When she woke up again, Bai Xiangxiu found that Long Heng was already awake, but he was still holding her tightly in his arms. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you recapture Su Yun? She\u2019s still quite capable of many things,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked with a seemingly casual tone.</p><br/><p>Long Heng laughed, \u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s just a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking down on women?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pouted to show her dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Long Heng laughed and pinched her cheeks again. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to say. She would definitely be a great general if she were a man. She certainly has the confidence, and she has a certain way of presenting herself. These kinds of people are rare, but one also cannot rely on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer thoughts are too complex. She would never be able to stay loyal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But what if she was a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody should ever trust a person who defects that easily. Moreover, I really dislike the way she looks at me. I\u2019m a man; not prey. I can never become another woman\u2019s prey. Except for you, of course.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 what are you doing? Let me go! You\u2019re heavy! What if someone suddenly barges in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Aren\u2019t you a bold woman now? Why did you suddenly become so timid again?\u201d Long Heng lifted her onto his belly and looked up at her. He seemed very amused when he saw the awkward look on her face, which was why he gently lifted her legs in order to tease her further.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I bold? I\u2019ve always been timid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo timid that you\u2019d beat up the citizens of Shu County?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 They were the ones who struck first, alright? I thought that they were bandits!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. So you seduced the enemy strategist because you were timid as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t want him to call the guards so I had no choice but to seduce him. Are you mad at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about lying to me? Did you do that because of your timidness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever lie to you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile she was running away, Su Yun told me that you have another identity and that everything you\u2019ve said before was all a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>So Su Yun still believes that I\u2019m a transmigrator! That\u2019s probably why she told Long Heng that! \u201cThen do you trust me or her more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, of course. I was only joking. No one would believe anything she says. Alright, I need to leave, but you should get some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems he\u2019s going to launch a sneak attack on their headquarters tonight. Bai Xiangxiu really thought that the thousand-year nation would soon be conquered, but something unexpected occurred in the middle of the night. An emperor\u2019s emissary arrived at camp. It seemed he had travelled night and day to make it this fast, riding hard the entire way. In his possession was a gold token and an order. To be more specific, it was a return order, commanding Long Heng to return to the capital with all haste. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was so furious that she desperately wanted to beat up the emissary. He\u2019s clearly here to cause trouble! Look at the timing, showing up with the order to return just when we\u2019re about to win! Moreover, this was a return order via a gold token! Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but compare this moment with what had happened to Yue Fei, a very famous general who\u2019d been framed by treacherous court officials.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was already on his way to battle with his men, but immediately returned upon receiving news that the emperor\u2019s emissary had come. He knelt down when he saw the imperial edict. He jerked his head upwards upon hearing the return order. Bai Xiangxiu could almost see the unwillingness, rage and struggle in Long Heng\u2019s beautiful eyes from her position inside the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmissary, you might already know that the enemy nation is already backed into a corner with no way out. If you give me a month\u2019s time\u2026 no. Even half a month\u2019s time would suffice to wipe the country off the map forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not that I don\u2019t want to give you time. It\u2019s just that the emperor wants you back in the capital immediately.\u201d The emissary had never imagined that Prince Li was capable of producing such results. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble a little inside as he was afraid of offending the prince. This place was Prince Li\u2019s domain after all, he could kill almost anyone if he wished to.</p><br/><p>A quick horse galloped into the camp while things stood at a standstill between Long Heng and the emissary. The man on the horse was holding another gold token in his hand, which allowed him to ride a horse into the camp. \u201cLong Heng, receive this edict! His Majesty summons you to the capital. There must not be any delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>They even brought out another gold token? Bai Xiangxiu could tell that something bad must\u2019ve occurred in the capital. Why else would they want Long Heng to return so badly? If this was anything like Yue Fei, Long Heng would surely lose his command if he brought only a few men with him back to the capital. Moreover, his family was in the emperor\u2019s hands. Killing them would be as easy as taking candy from a child. But he\u2019d be going against an imperial edict if he chose not to return. The old madame and Xiao Lin would probably suffer an even worse fate if he chose not to return.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

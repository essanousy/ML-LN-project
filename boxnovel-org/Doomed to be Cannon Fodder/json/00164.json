With a happy heart, he carried her back to the room. He was especially excited tonight, so much so that Bai Xiangxiu almost couldn\u2019t handle his vigor. However, she liked it for some reason and so left him to his own devices with her. She kept talking to herself in her heart. He was her husband, so whatever he did to her was as it should be. </p><br/><p>Long Heng had never seen such an accommodating side to Bai Xiangxiu before. Previously, she would always cry out that it hurt when he moved a few times, and would continue crying out with pain until the end. However, she\u2019d pandered to him this time around, making him feel strangely excited. This actually stoked his craving to rear back to life a few times more.</p><br/><p>She really was just enduring the whole ordeal at the start. But near the end, she also seemed to be extremely happy too. As a man who\u2019d just eaten and supped his fill, Long Heng felt strangely happy. He was a little like a young lad who\u2019d just gotten to know the taste of love. This made him want to shove everything he possessed into Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hands, even wishing to hand over his secret stash of money. As a result of that, Bai Xiangxiu felt that she\u2019d really struck gold. </p><br/><p>He continuously sent taels of silver to her by the thousands and tens of thousands. In fact, if Long Heng needed to spend a large amount of money, he had to ask her for the silver. This wasn\u2019t all that different when compared to the a modern day woman enjoyed. She didn\u2019t need to mention how pleased she was having such an honest and capable husband. She was so happy that she even thought of chasing the female lead away.</p><br/><p>This thought scared even Bai Xiangxiu herself. Did all women become unusually greedy when they had someone they loved? Forget it! Since things had escalated to this point, she wouldn\u2019t be a woman if she yielded any longer. What\u2019s more, she was a woman who\u2019d transmigrated. Xiaoshi was helping her mistress get out of bed. As she did so, she felt that there was a distinctively fierce look in Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s eyes today. </p><br/><p>She was feeling much more positive when confronting matters compared to the day before. That was because everyone outside had spread rumors that she was a favored concubine, and an impressive one as well. Fine, let them talk! She was starting to pay these matters no mind anymore.</p><br/><p>However, she never would\u2019ve thought that something would happened just when she felt that she was about to turn into the female lead. The servants were all spreading news that Long Heng had actually escorted Miss Lin back to the Lin Manor. This matter wasn\u2019t strange, rather it was that he\u2019d wanted to go to the Lin Manor to ask for permission to marry their daughter. He\u2019d even personally prepared the betrothal gift himself!</p><br/><p>He had displaying his affection towards Bai Xiangxiu not too long ago, so why was he asking to marry the other woman in the blink of an eye? Bai Xiangxiu was feeling a mixture of anger, sadness, despair and incomprehension. It almost felt like all of these emotions had appeared in her head all at once. She didn\u2019t know what to do anymore after she heard the news. She just stood there in the courtyard, letting the cold wind blow in her face. Her cloak slid off her shoulders, yet she was oblivious to it all. </p><br/><p>Sigh, it\u2019s really difficult to get into a sincere relationship. Just when she thought she would have a great duel with the female lead to win the male lead over, he had sent betrothal gifts over to the female lead instead.</p><br/><p>Senior Madame and Second Madame happened to be right across the way and came to stir up trouble with her when they heard the rumors. They never expected her to really be emotionally affected by it. They were baffled by this, but seeing as they\u2019d achieved their goal, they left with laughter merrily ringing in the air. But when they turned their heads, they saw Prince Li standing coldy behind them. He\u2019d never thought of explaining this matter to Bai Xiangxiu because he thought that she understood him. Did she still not understand how he felt towards her?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince hates women who gossip and meddle. Withdraw now and receive your punishment. If you offend me one more time, pack up and get out of my manor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior Madame and Second Madame were so shocked that they left shaking uncontrollably. The look in Long Heng\u2019s eyes was indeed extremely frightening. They left with dust on their faces, but that was of no concern to Long Heng. He looked at Bai Xiangxiu, realizing that she\u2019d actually left without turning her head in his direction. With a frown on his face, he thought, Does she not know that I\u2019m not marrying that woman with heartfelt intentions?</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t willing to explain his intentions because he was wholeheartedly focused on exacting his revenge on those who\u2019d harmed Bai Xiangxiu in the past. In any case, she was his. Explanations could wait until he had the time to do so.</p><br/><p>But who would\u2019ve thought that Song Jiaoyue from the Song family would flip the entire table over in anger when said news travelled to his attention. He really didn\u2019t understand what Long Heng was thinking. This move of his was clearly an insult to the woman who\u2019d treated him sincerely all this while! She was spoken of highly in the prince\u2019s manor, but had been heartlessly abandoned in the end!</p><br/><p>Fine, fine, fine. He might be heartless, but Song Jiaoyue couldn\u2019t bear to see her abandoned in that cold manor from now on. \u201cYu Se\u2026 Yu Se! Come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Yu Se ran in after she responded and saw that overturned table, along with Song Jiaoyue\u2019s face flushed hot with anger. She immediately knew that this was a matter related to Madame Xiu. She\u2019d heard Song Jiaoyue mention before that although Bai Xiangxiu was called Long Heng\u2019s favored concubine, remarkably beautiful and a charming seductress, she was actually pure in body even until this day. Long Heng was only behaving in a manner for appearance\u2019s sake. That and he was just using her as a shield against other women.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d really felt very sorry for Bai Xiangxiu then. A woman like her to be destroyed in such a manner. Though her master liked her, he didn\u2019t dare voice his feelings. </p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare some snacks and put heart meat in the stuffing. Send them over to her.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to wait any longer. If he did, he really would go insane. He\u2019d been thinking about the vegetarian food she\u2019d cooked after tasting it at the death of the dowager empress. As a result of that, he hardly ate now because he felt that everything he ate just didn\u2019t have the taste of her cooking. </p><br/><p>\u201cBut, what reason shall I give?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say that you\u2019re the one giving the snacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Yu Se really did ask the servants to do as her master requested. She actually felt it strange. Why did he want the snacks to be stuffed with a heart? But, she obeyed his orders and finished the snacks. She then sent someone off to deliver them to Bai Xiangxiu. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was depressed. Was the plot progressing according to the actual novel now? In the main plot, she\u2019d been beaten to death after Long Heng and the female lead married after the new year.</p><br/><p>For some reason, she was only a little angry, but didn\u2019t suspect Long Heng\u2019s intentions at all. She rather thought the ripples caused by her transmigration had been quite impressive, they\u2019d forced two people away from a path of mutual love. But, she couldn\u2019t guarantee that Long Heng and the female lead definitely couldn\u2019t be together either. Just as she was deep in her thoughts, someone reported that the Song residence had sent something to her. </p><br/><p>\u201cMm, bring it in!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s thoughts were jumbled up. She wanted to cry, but she felt that there was nothing worth crying about. </p><br/><p>Not long after, Xiaoshi brought the Song family\u2019s box of snacks into the room, explaining that Yu Se made it and wanted Bai Xiangxiu to give her some pointers. Actually, how would Bai Xiangxiu still have the heart to give others pointers about their food? Even so, she took a piece and ate it leisurely. She was completely oblivious to the fact that all the maids and mamas in Apricot Garden were extremely worried about her and were afraid that she\u2019d do something stupid.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the Song Family had sent someone over at this point in time, distracting her from the matter. Who knew though, that Bai Xiangxiu would actually blank out when she ate half of that snack, not moving an inch for quite a while? The color on her face flushed constantly through different shades. She seemed to be even more horrified than just now when she knew that Prince Li was going to send the betrothal gifts. </p><br/><p>How could Bai Xiangxiu not be surprised? She was shocked to the point where she almost wet herself! The snacks had stuffing in it, but more importantly, the stuffing contained meat from the heart of an animal. This clearly meant that the sender had feelings for her!</p><br/><p>Moreover, Yu Se had been the one who\u2019d brought this to her and was also an intimate figure by Song Jiaoyue\u2019s side. Song Jiaoyue was clearly behind this all. So, was this his way of expressing that his heart belonged to her? This was too scary, alright?! Bai Xiangxiu had clearly given up on Song Jiaoyue a very long time ago, and had even given her body and heart to the male lead. Wasn\u2019t it scary for him to suddenly play such a hand?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

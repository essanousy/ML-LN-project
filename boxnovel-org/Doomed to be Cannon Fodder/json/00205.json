When suddenly faced with this deluge of cold water, all she could do was stand there with a blank look as her brain tried to process all this information. But Bai Xiangxiu was done speaking her mind. She held out the child in her arms and said, \u201cHere. Your son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! That isn\u2019t my child! My child is well-behaved and sensible! My child often cries and makes gurgling noises! This isn\u2019t him! He\u2019s not!\u201d She thrust her hands straight out, knocking Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hands away with surprising force. The violence of her action was so unexpected that the child\u2019s body slipped out of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hands. Fortunately, she was able to catch him again, or the poor child would\u2019ve landed in the dirt yet again.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu\u2019s patience had run dry. \u201cLock them both up!\u201d He then glanced at the child\u2019s corpse in Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s arms, \u201cGive him a burial!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the soldiers came up to Bai Xiangxiu to take the child\u2019s body. She let out a long sigh and reluctantly handed him over. She didn\u2019t look at Commander Lu after that either. She\u2019d lost her chance to escape and had failed to save the child. She felt like the biggest idiot in the world. Worst of all, she was locked up in the same room as the female lead. She couldn\u2019t even fall asleep because of the female lead\u2019s incessant verbal abuse.</p><br/><p>The female lead had a lot of pent up resentment towards Bai Xiangxiu. She would glare at Bai Xiangxiu from time to time like she wanted to peel off all of the latter\u2019s skin. Bai Xiangxiu could only try her best to ignore her presence until Lin Qianzi was taken away for questioning the next morning.</p><br/><p>Since Commander Lu was extremely curious about Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s true identity, it was no surprise that he wanted to question Lin Qianzi first. Lin Qianzi had never been the type of person to care about her country or a righteous cause. Her brain was filled with nothing but love and men. Weren\u2019t all female leads typically like that? They had very broad hearts and would kindly accept the male lead or supporting male characters even if they were revealed to be spies from the enemy nation. Novels were typically written like that.</p><br/><p>As such, her interrogation seemed to go on for a bit longer than usual. Lin Qianzi\u2019s cheeks were both swollen by the time she came back. It looked like some torture had been applied to her. Bai Xiangxiu was taken away right after her return. I guess this is finally it. Sigh\u2026 I would\u2019ve escaped successfully if it weren\u2019t for that child.</p><br/><p>However Bai Xiangxiu also knew very well that she\u2019d still try to save the child if she found herself in the same situation again. It couldn\u2019t be helped. She\u2019d never be able to live with herself if she chose to escape instead. Moreover, she was now a mother too. Lin Qianzi\u2019s child reminded her of her own son.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was on the verge of tears. Xiao Lin is going to lose his mother at such a young age. I wonder if he\u2019ll still remember me when he grows up? However, she didn\u2019t allow herself to break into tears. It\u2019d be incredibly shameful to cry in the face of the enemy. So, she held her head high and entered the room. Commander Lu was already waiting inside the room with a frown on his face. Bai Xiangxiu had an incredibly bad impression of that man because he simply looked too similar to Duan Yunying. Despite all that, she wasn\u2019t afraid of death at all. She made herself at home sitting on a chair and crossed her legs. She was actually somewhat nervous because she didn\u2019t know how she was about to be put to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Long Heng\u2019s concubine?\u201d This is the incredibly strange woman that second brother disdains? From his letters, I remember that he actually changed his impression of her for the better before he died, and wrote that she\u2019d be his woman after killing Long Heng. I never imagined that she\u2019d have such a good-for-nothing image.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu wasn\u2019t the only one that was surprised. Long Heng had rushed through the night to come to her rescue after receiving news of her capture. He was incredibly shocked to see her like this. Yu Kuang and Long Heng had changed into enemy soldier uniforms and were standing outside the door. They were able to look inside from time to time. The woman that he was trying to save was inside, covered with wounds and blood. Despite all that, her gaze was firm and resolute. Doesn\u2019t she have a phobia of blood? How is her will so strong during such a time?</p><br/><p>He was worried and incredibly proud of her at the same time. He\u2019d planned to use his achievement in this war to implore the emperor to bestow upon Bai Xiangxiu the status of Princess Consort Li, but he\u2019d never imagined that she\u2019d follow him all the way here and write such an incredible letter as well.</p><br/><p>The content of the letter was more than enough to help him break the chained horses formation. He could\u2019ve stayed in the city to train the soldiers, but he just couldn\u2019t help but worry about her. He\u2019d immediately encountered Song Jiaoyue after leaving the city. He friend was being pursued by enemy soldiers, and Long Heng learned that she\u2019d been captured after saving Song Jiaoyue. He\u2019d immediately made the decision to infiltrate the enemy camp, but it was near daybreak by the time they were deep in the enemy lines.</p><br/><p>When they finally found Commander Lu\u2019s camp after changing into enemy uniforms, Lin Qianzi was coincidentally inside the camp saying bad things about Bai Xiangxiu. She mentioned something about Long Heng murdering Duan Yunying all because of Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu gave Lin Qianzi a tight slap to her face while smiling coldly. \u201cDo you really think that a prince would go to life and death just for a woman? You\u2019re so shallow-minded. I really wonder why people used to call you a gifted woman.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu squeezed her cheeks and finally gave her another vicious slap. \u201cYunying would never have needed to change his target if you\u2019d been a good girl and married Long Heng. He would be able to give Long Heng a lethal strike during your consummation. He would never have needed to mutate the parasite into a strain to be implanted through ingestion instead of consummation. Do you know that the parasite loses more than half of its effectiveness in that form? Moreover, why would he lose control of that woman\u2019s body if he hadn\u2019t used up his vital energy to implant the parasite into your body previously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do you mean that everything he\u2019d was all so that he could kill Long Heng? Then what about me? Everything he has said to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were all just empty words to humor you. You\u2019re such a gullible girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? How could this have happened? I\u2019ve done so much for him. I even stopped Luo Yunzheng from beating him up and left Luo Yunzheng for him! And you tell me that his feelings were just a lie the whole time?!\u201d</p><br/><p>SLAP!</p><br/><p>Commander Lu hated crying women the most. Lin Qianzi was thrown into the ground by the force of that slap. He gave her a warning with a cold voice, \u201cStop crying. You\u2019d better tell me everything you know about her or I\u2019ll send you to that place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi told Commander Lu everything she knew about Bai Xiangxiu, even though she still was still overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions. Commander Lu was extremely satisfied with what he\u2019d heard. He immediately had Bai Xiangxiu brought to him after sending Lin Qianzi away.</p><br/><p>Long Heng and Yu Kuang both understood that Commander Lu had noticed an opportunity to use Bai Xiangxiu to break the impasse. It was very likely that he planned on using Bai Xiangxiu to force Long Heng to open the city gates. Opening the city gates would be akin to opening the gates to the entire nation. If that were to happen, the city\u2019s citizens wouldn\u2019t be the only one that would suffer the consequences. Long Heng\u2019s family in the capital would likely suffer the same fate as well.</p><br/><p>No one would think that a man could possibly make such a huge sacrifice for just a woman under normal circumstances. After all, they were putting a woman against an entire nation here! However, Long Heng was hesitating. He genuinely didn\u2019t know what his choice would be when push came to shove.</p><br/><p>The two in the room had already begun to converse while Long Heng was still deep in his thoughts. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. I\u2019m Long Heng\u2019s concubine. Con-cu-bine\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu accentuated. She was trying to imply that it\u2019d be wasted effort to use her to force Long Heng\u2019s hand since she wasn\u2019t Long Heng\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart, but you don\u2019t understand men at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile he might not care whether you are alive or not, there\u2019s always other ways to force him to make a choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhmm\u2026 Please continue. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tear off your clothes in public, layer by layer. If he still refuses to comply, I will have my subordinates show you some \u201clove\u201d. They will keep loving you one by one until he finally opens the city gates. Don\u2019t you think that this is such a good idea?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

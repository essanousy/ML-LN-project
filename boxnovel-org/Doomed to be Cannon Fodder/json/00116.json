The female lead couldn\u2019t tell right from wrong at all in these matters! Just what did she have stored in that brain of hers?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu finally realized only now that her pitiful little bit of white lotus attribute could be sent back for a reroll compared to the female lead. She\u2019s spent so much effort to get to where she was without the two men noticing, and nothing would be gained if her boss sustained injuries because she\u2019d let the female lead stop her from alerting others.</p><br/><p>So, she didn\u2019t care that she wasn\u2019t the female lead. She grabbed the female lead\u2019s hand and flung it away. \u201cTake shelter off to the side. If I don\u2019t call for help, the prince will also be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. He is Prince Li. He can defend himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad! Prince Li is a human, not a real war god.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was anxious. Seeing as the female lead still wanted to pounce on her, she simply swatted her hand in the female lead\u2019s general direction. She didn\u2019t do so with the intention of actually hitting the female lead. She only wanted to push her away, but she didn\u2019t think that her movements were slightly quicker than usual under these desperate circumstances. She actually ended up slapping the female lead across the face and her overly long fingernails accidentally left a bloody scratch on the female lead\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Damn it! I\u2019ve really stirred up trouble this time. Bai Xiangxiu was sure that the male lead and all the other supporting male characters were going to hunt her down for this. However, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t expect that the female lead would actually grab her hand with her claws while she stood dazed. During that mild struggle, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand was also injured by the female lead\u2019s nails. </p><br/><p>The two women likely hadn\u2019t expected to injure the other party, and so both were stunned for a moment. However, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mind was consumed by thoughts of saving the prince, so she ran away without a thought for her image. She shouted as she ran, \u201cHelp!!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had held her breath for a long time, so her shout came rushing out with great volume. The guards at that end immediately heard her cry of alarm and bolted towards her. Long Heng had also heard her and subconsciously glanced in her direction. As a result of that, he bore witness to the scene of Lin Qianzi pulling her back while she shouted for help. This was the first time he\u2019d seen Bai Xiangxiu doing something with all her might, so he could be forgiven for losing his focus for a moment. </p><br/><p>When he came back to his senses, the other man\u2019s punch was already too close for him to evade. Long Heng quickly used his palm to cushion the punch, but still sustained internal injuries and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s heart tightened as she saw him fall from the sky with her own eyes. This wasn\u2019t because she liked him! It was because she felt that he\u2019d been protecting her recently and had never harmed her. Even if he wasn\u2019t a friend, he was still more than just a stranger to her. So, she would naturally be a little concerned about him, right?</p><br/><p>Therefore, she shook off the female lead and ran towards the prince. The male lead was much more important to her than the female lead.</p><br/><p>Those guards were also sprinting towards her as Bai Xiangxiu ran. Lin Qianzi called out loudly to Luo Yunzheng, \u201cGo quickly\u2026\u201d A guard had a sword pressed to her throat the second she\u2019d choked out those words. She didn\u2019t dare move any further.</p><br/><p>The third supporting male lead Luo Yunzheng felt that he had indeed gained a small advantage from the situation. He pivoted and ran off. Bai Xiangxiu, on the other hand, had already run up to Long Heng\u2019s side. When she saw that the corner of his mouth was bleeding, she paled in consternation. She had no idea how she was going to help him up.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the look in Prince Li\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t change in the slightest. He only said, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d and rose to his feet. He wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth with an outstretched sleeve. \u201cTake her back to where she came from and keep an eye on her. If anyone comes to look for her, kill them. No exceptions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we need to call a doctor over to take a look at your injuries? It doesn\u2019t look like your injuries are light\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d The prince had grabbed ahold of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand, revealing the bloody scratches.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas this her doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an accident. I actually also scratched Miss Lin as well.\u201d She lowered her head. You\u2019re feeling bad for me, aren\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>Prince Li did indeed feel bad for her and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back into the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the doctor came, he diagnosed some minor internal injuries in Prince Li. Fortunately, the prince only needed to rest a bit to recover. Hearing this, Bai Xiangxiu relaxed and felt that her actions just then really had been a little excessive. She\u2019d even scratched the female lead\u2019s face. Even though the male lead hadn\u2019t blamed her, she felt that the various supporting male characters and whatnot would exact revenge on her sooner or later.</p><br/><p>This also included the male lead before her eyes, but she only prayed that he would remember that she\u2019d only done so to save him tonight, and so wouldn\u2019t place this matter to heart. Nevertheless, she\u2019d better remind him of this matter. Hence, she waited when Prince Li\u2019s complexion had turned slightly better before suddenly falling to her knees in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness. I scratched Mistress Lin just now because I was anxious that you would be hurt. Please let me know what my punishment should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Get up!\u201d Long Heng had no idea what he would do with her. Why was she so timid? Since when was he going to blame her for what\u2019d happened? She made it seem like that woman actually had a place in his heart.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu hesitated, but then saw her boss close his eyes and faintly say, \u201cShe is just an unrelated person here. Why should you have to torment yourself because of her? You don\u2019t need to be so afraid of her in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>What do these words mean? Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t seem to put her thoughts in order for a moment. What exactly did he mean by that? Could it be that he was already considering Bai Xiangxiu as his woman? Even so, she couldn\u2019t relax because who knew when the dying embers of love between the male lead and the female lead would one day flare up again?</p><br/><p>But, it was worth mentioning that she really did like what the male lead had said, so much that she heaved an audible sigh of relief. It seemed like the effort she had put in for such a long time had paid off in the end. She\u2019d finally received her boss\u2019 praise and acknowledgement. In retrospect, this was the kind of mindset that she had when she just started working!</p><br/><p>However, the male lead was much more handsome than her previous boss. She had actually slightly drifted off into a daze just by looking at his side profile as he meditated. She was completely oblivious to the fact that Xiao Shi had draped an outer garment over her. In the end, she rested her head on her arms and fell asleep on the table as she watched him.</p><br/><p>The group of servants didn\u2019t dare to disturb their master\u2019s meditation either, so everyone silently gathered to the side. When Long Heng finished circulating his qi throughout his body, he noticed that the small woman who\u2019d just behaved in an extremely impressive manner just now had actually fallen asleep on the table. His heart softened at the sight, and he carefully lifted himself off the bed, scooped her up in his arms, and carried her to the bed. He covered her with the quilt, and then lay down beside her, dismissing those outside with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t do anything. He only stroked her hair as he thought, she\u2019s obviously a timid person, but she did something so brave just now just to help me. It seems that I have a place in her heart.</p><br/><p>Long Heng lightly planted a kiss on her forehead. Even though he was furious that man had come to find him, that matter had already receded to the annals of his mind when he saw her working so hard to protect him. A small burst of happiness actually unfurled in his heart when he lightly kissed her smooth forehead again. His lips couldn\u2019t help but to curl up in a little smile. Even though he didn\u2019t do anything, the warmth in his heart grew even deeper.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t exactly sleep peacefully that night. She was caught in a weird dream, where a huge cat was chasing her, like it really want to lick her. The cat licked her so thoroughly that it didn\u2019t stop even when her entire face was covered in its saliva. The next moment, the dream switched to a monster pressing down on her chest. She felt herself being smothered to the point where she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. </p><br/><p>When she woke up the next day, she felt more tired than if she\u2019d climbed a mountain for a day. Something\u2019s wrong. It really feels like there\u2019s something pressing down on my chest. She glanced down to see that there was actually a man\u2019s arm on her. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t be blamed for overreacting at that moment because she\u2019d been sleeping alone all this time. Anyone wouldn\u2019t be used to having someone suddenly sleep beside them. Moreover, this person was clearly a man. She could clearly see the muscles on his arm through his thin inner garments.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

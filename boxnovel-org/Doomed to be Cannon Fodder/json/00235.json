Song Jiaoyue had first sought out Ji Zhangshu, because the woman who had entered the palace to become a concubine had originally been his. Ji Zhangshu had likely had a chance to meet with her before she entered the palace. </p><br/><p>When they found him at All Leisure Tavern, it seemed that Ji Zhangshu had been stripped of his official position, and the Ji family was in decline. It was evident that this was blatant revenge for something. The man had ended up drinking himself into a stupor by the time they\u2019d arrived. One of Long Heng\u2019s trusted aides dragged him into an alley. The thick smell of alcohol made Bai Xiangxiu furrow her brows, \u201cWake him up.\u201d There was no way to ask him anything when he was like this! </p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu was sober enough after a bucket of cold water had been dumped over his head. He was startled at the sight of Bai Xiangxiu. Only after he saw Song Jiaoyue behind her did he remark, \u201cSo it\u2019s you two. Haha, have you come to mock me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has time for that kind of thing? I only want to ask you what\u2019s going on with Lin Qianzi.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had actually always had a bad impression of this Ji Zhangshu. He had been unconditionally good to the female lead in the novel, but he was rather cowardly. Besides plotting a few small schemes behind people\u2019s backs, he didn\u2019t dare do anything else against any of the other supporting male characters. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t dare fight them for the female lead. Well, even if he wanted to, his martial arts weren\u2019t capable enough. Besides the fact that he had read many books, there wasn\u2019t anything special about him. But\u2026 how should this be worded? His feelings towards the female lead were true, and for that reason alone, he was a better man than Duan Yunying.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very good. Now, she\u2019s a Noble Lady and has gained the emperor\u2019s favor!\u201d Ji Zhangshu slumped dispiritedly on the ground. He seemed to have nothing to do with that woman, but a deep sadness welled up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>What did she do to you before she left? Or do you know why she\u2019s with the emperor now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to ask how she seduced the emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, yes,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu coughed softly. Speaking of this in front of the ex-husband was a bit embarrassing, and she hadn\u2019t thought that he would bring it up first. </p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how she gained the emperor\u2019s favor, but she came to see me before entering the palace. She\u2019d completely changed by then. Her former self was fresh, pure and adorable, so weak and delicate that it seemed she could be blown away by the wind in an instant. But now, she applies a lot of makeup and is so beautiful that one cannot take their eyes off her. However, she will never be the person that she used to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Can one person actually change that quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom her words, it seems that someone is teaching her how to do these things. That\u2019s how she gained the emperor\u2019s favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mention who it was, but her words were quite cold. Men are all extremely lowly. If women are sincere to them, men will abandon them ruthlessly. But if women keep ahold of their hearts, then the only person hurt will be the men. Haha, I didn\u2019t know that when I fell in love with her, she saw it as a base, pathetic crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu closed her eyes, \u201cThere\u2019s only one person who would teach her that. The very same person who told me the same in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! That woman actually came to the capital?\u201d Song Jiaoyue wrinkled his brow. He had only heard of the monster-like woman with an unending series of tricks up her sleeves. However, he didn\u2019t know that Long Heng had ruined her appearance and forced her to flee from the battlefield. \u201cCan this be a political play to throw the court into chaos and give the enemy country the chance to make a comeback?\u201d This worried some.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is purely motivated by revenge. The last battle with her, the enemy commander used her as a shield against Long Heng. As a result, her face was ruined, but she managed to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Then how did she find Lin Qianzi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it wasn\u2019t the woman herself. But only she could say something like that, discounting a woman who had been hurt by a man.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu could not determine whether this mysterious new player was Su Yun based solely upon these words. But if it was in fact her, Bai Xiangxiu would have be even more careful.</p><br/><p>Ji Zhangshu could see that they wanted to deal with Lin Qianzi, so he said, \u201cShe can currently use the emperor to harm others. The emperor was behind the revoking of my family\u2019s official position. I have no government position at the moment, but I rather feel that living like this is more freeing. I can drink whenever I want, and can ignore everyone else\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt this man had really lost his will to fight. \u201cWhy must you be so miserable for a person who is not worth your love? That\u2019s when you truly have no future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t Madame Bai head for the border territory for Prince Li even when criticized by the world? Didn\u2019t you choose your actions because of your love? To be willing to go through anything for them?\u201d The meaning of his words were not lost on anyone present. Everyone was the same fool for love, so what was the point of laughing at him for being a fool?</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything I do for Long Heng is worth it. He will remember what I do for him and reciprocate. However, Lin Qianzi will never do that. Since she has never placed you in her heart, she won\u2019t feel heartbroken no matter how much you sacrifice for her. Why don\u2019t you learn from Luo Yunzheng, and go about your life? Being like this will only lose face for you and your family.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t look back as she left with Song Jiaoyue. Song Jiaoyue waited a beat before reminding her, \u201cIf we want to know who the person backing Lin Qianzi is, the Lin family will know. But the current Lin family\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the Lin family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. They\u2019ve merely borrowed the emperor\u2019s favor to rise again, that\u2019s all.\u201d He recounted the events of the Lin family for Bai Xiangxiu. It turned out that Lin Qianzi had ruined her family\u2019s name quite thoroughly, causing stacks of petitions censuring Minister Lin to be sent to the emperor. The emperor had wanted to demote Minister Lin, but it was at this time that Lin Qianzi had somehow gained the emperor\u2019s favor. He quite favored her, and spoke no more of demoting Minister Lin. The officials at court didn\u2019t dare offend him by bringing it up either. The Lin family\u2019s current prestige was greater than it had been in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Now I feel blessed that I\u2019m just a little concubine. If I was Long Heng\u2019s main wife, then I would\u2019ve implicated my entire family.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s analysis was correct. A marriage was a union of families, and if anything happened, both families were usually affected. </p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nothing will happen to the prince. We will definitely find where he is being confined soon,\u201d Song Jiaoyue comforted her. Although she was very strong, in his eyes, she was still a woman in the end. Moreover, they still hadn\u2019t found where Long Heng was being imprisoned since entering the capital. His captors had seemingly vanished into thin air. It seemed things had been planned far in advance.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded her thanks. When she returned to her room, she sat next to Huo\u2019er and asked for news of the old madame and Xiao Lin. \u201cThey are doing well. Old Madame is currently reading the letter you sent. She finds it odd that she can\u2019t just send a letter back out to Mistress so that Mistress will know everything. Also, she\u2019s crying, because she has found out that Mistress\u2019 husband has been taken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, it must be very arduous for her!\u201d She had been put under house arrest and now her son had been secretly taken.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just said, \u2018We must all be strong for the little prince\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu suddenly felt the old madame to be quite the amazing woman. When Long Heng\u2019s father had passed, she had taken the reins to raise her son all by herself. It wasn\u2019t as if she was unaware of the filthy happenings of the rear court either. Protecting Long Heng thus far had already been a long and arduous road.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He glanced at Long Heng and waved his hand, \u201cYour Highness, there\u2019s no need for all that trouble. I have something to discuss with you in private, so could you ask them to leave the room for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng gestured towards his servants and had them exit the room en masse. However, as a result, no one was left to pour tea anymore.</p><br/><p>Minister Lin didn\u2019t mind that either, only saying, \u201cThere are some issues within our inner residence, and I hope that Your Highness can offer some assistance in solving this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not appropriate for this prince to be handling the affairs of your inner residence, right?\u201d Long Heng tightened his grip on his teacup. Is Minister Lin losing his grip on reality? At the same time however, since things had fallen to this extent, the situation probably wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>Minister Lin opened and closed his mouth a few times before continuing, \u201cThere have been quite a few burglaries in my residence lately, and even the authorities are powerless against the burglars. That\u2019s why I can only come here to ask Prince Li for some assistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Minister Lin, you must be joking. If the authorities can\u2019t deal with the burglars, then how do you expect me to act against them? All I have with me are some brutish soldiers, how could they handle the meticulous tasks that are normally handled by the authorities?\u201d Who cares about the actual truth of this matter? Since I\u2019ve already pushed away the responsibilities, just get the hell out already! Stop hindering my business with Madame Bai!</p><br/><p>Minister Lin could feel the veins start to pop out on his forehead. He\u2019s a prince who wields a significant chunk of military power, he should at least be a little concerned when his father-in-law\u2019s house is being raided by burglars, right? Despite all that, he doesn\u2019t even hesitate to push all the responsibility to the authorities. It\u2019s as if he isn\u2019t even a concerned party at all.</p><br/><p>However, this matter definitely had to be handled by Long Heng. How could the authorities possibly be able to take on ruffians from the jianghu? Moreover, there were a couple of things that had to remain hidden from the authorities, or his daughter\u2019s good name would be ruined beyond all repair. In addition, since Long Heng was able to retrieve her last time, there was a strong chance that he was deeply involved with the matter as well. Naturally, there shouldn\u2019t be any misunderstandings concerning his daughter.</p><br/><p>But, he had no idea how distant Long Heng felt from the situation. He only sat coldly off to the side, as if he hadn\u2019t heard Minister Lin\u2019s request. Minister Lin had no choice but to continue trying to persuade him. This was because the attitude of this future son-in-law towards his daughter\u2019s matters was really a bit lacking. \u201cPrince Li, at the end of the day, both our families are related through marriage. If anything happens to the Lin family, it would be equally bad for you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And why would that be?\u201d Minister Lin gritted his teeth. It was too difficult for him to talk about that matter after all. So, he could only change the topic by saying, \u201cThis thief is extremely powerful. He dared to actually kill the maidservants and servants in my estate. If he isn\u2019t disposed of as soon as possible, I\u2019m afraid that he will cause great misfortune later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the burglar forces my daughter to do some unduly things, then things will really get ugly.</p><br/><p>Long Heng naturally knew what he was trying to imply. If that man was so infatuated with her that he actually decided to chase her all the way back to her home, then he surely would never let her off the hook easily. Long Heng would surely be speechless if she ended up bearing that man\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>But just as Minister Lin had mentioned just now, it didn\u2019t matter whether he cared about Miss Lin or not. At the end of the day, the two of them were engaged. If a disgraceful scandal were to concern her, then it would be very easy to embroil him into things. And so he asked, \u201cThen what suggestions does Minister Lin have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very dangerous at my home right now and I\u2019m most worried about my daughter. So, I wonder if Prince Li could just take her into the Prince Li Manor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Long Heng refused without a second\u2019s hesitation. \u201cMy mother is currently not in the estate. If outsiders were to get wind of this, I\u2019m afraid that it would be a drastic blow to Miss Lin\u2019s reputation as well. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d What is this Minister Lin thinking? Is he trying just anything in a desperate situation?</p><br/><p>Minister Lin was indeed getting desperate. That was why he\u2019d conjured up such an idea. However, he didn\u2019t know that Old Madame had left the estate. Since the official lady of the estate wasn\u2019t home, it was indeed inappropriate and inexcusable for his daughter to enter the estate. Now he\u2019d suddenly found himself in a new dilemma.</p><br/><p>Long Heng suddenly thought of n\u00e8e Bai. She had suffered through quite an ordeal lately and had gone through no small degree of fright in the estate as well. It was probably a good idea to take her out on a small trip and relax a little. And so, after some consideration he said, \u201cThen why not to Red Maple mountain villa? It\u2019s the private property of the Prince Li manor, and, Yongning Temple isn\u2019t too far from there as well. You can send Miss Lin to the temple as a front and escort her over to the villa at the middle of the night when no one will notice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then we will go with your plan.\u201d Minister Lin didn\u2019t expect that Long Heng would think of a solution that quickly. It was quite a relief to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, when you return, please inform the young lady that when she enters the Red Maple mountain villa, she must keep a low profile at all times. So, please ask her to wear plain clothes and enter the manor as a maidservant to prevent others from noticing her.\u201d</p><br/><p>As to prevent who from noticing her, Minister Lin, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware whom that is.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Alright. I\u2019ll explain it to her clearly when I return. Only, Qianzi has always had a weak physique ever since youth, so please be kind to her, Prince Li.\u201d Minister Lin clenched his fists. He was actually looking forward to getting them married as soon as possible. That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much anymore. Yet, Prince Li refused to call upon the Lin residence and officially propose marriage. He\u2019d delayed the wedding again and again, causing Minister Lin much anguish.</p><br/><p>Is \u2018weak\u2019 really a good word to describe her physique? She\u2019d already been tossed around by that man to such an extent and yet, she doesn\u2019t seemed to have developed any problems.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018weak\u2019 was extremely inappropriate when it came to describing her. Moreover, what was Minister Lin trying to imply by saying that? Was he hopeful that something would happen between Long Heng and his daughter while they were together? He gave a cold laugh inwardly and said, \u201cMinister Lin, if there is nothing else, please hurry on back for the preparations!\u201d</p><br/><p>That cold and arrogant look was back again. Minister Lin honestly didn\u2019t have another reason to stay, so he rose to take his leave. As for Long Heng, he was still feeling quite unhappy. He was only trying to become intimate with n\u00e8e Bai in his own home, but people was always coming to make trouble for him. But on the bright side, the Red Maple mountain villa really did have a very beautiful view and was a good place for a trip.</p><br/><p>Since plans had been made, the trip was a foregone conclusion. Luckily, there wasn\u2019t much to do in the army camp these days and the emperor wouldn\u2019t ask a prince to attend court every day. As such, Long Heng ordered some men to start preparations for the journey and proceeded to inform n\u00e8e Bai personally.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t expected that she still hadn\u2019t returned when he arrived at Winter Garden. He couldn\u2019t help but frown as he walked towards the outside of the meeting quarters. Noticing that people were still standing around, he couldn\u2019t help but start to lecture them sternly, \u201cIt\u2019s such a chilly place in here. What is the matter that you have yet to finish discussing?\u201d</p><br/><p>These servants were really too irresponsible, making her freeze in the room like that!</p><br/><p>But the servants felt wronged as well. Ye-mama was the person who had the most authority to speak, so she walked up to Long Heng and spoke in a polite tone, \u201cThe mistress has fallen asleep just now and still hasn\u2019t woken up!\u201d</p><br/><p>She seems exhausted. Just what did Your Highness do to her? But how would she dare to say such things to the prince?</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt a little guilty because the expression in Ye-mama\u2019s downcast eyes seemed a little accusatory. Could it be that he had done something wrong?</p><br/><p>He coughed lightly and walked into the the room to see Bai Xiangxiu still lying there asleep on the heated platform in roughly the same posture when he\u2019d left. Except, now there was an extra pillow beneath her head and she was covered by a cotton blanket. Xiao Shi was dutifully waiting by her side and quickly curtseyed when she saw Long Heng come in.</p><br/><p>Long Heng knew that this room wasn\u2019t normally warm. It was just a room used for distributing items. Although the heating platform was nice and warm, the warmth in this room could not be compared to the warmth of the rooms in the various residences.</p><br/><p>Yet, she was deep in slumber. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t do to just wake her up and drag her away. If he couldn\u2019t drag her away, then why not carry her away? With his speed, it wouldn\u2019t take the two of them long to arrive at Winter Garden. Long Heng wanted to do just that, but as soon as he lifted her head, he could feel that the person in his arms just wasn\u2019t being very cooperative.</p><br/><p>She actually twisted around to raise her hand to hit him. She even exerted her strength and slapped his chest, frowning, \u201cStop fooling around. Let me sleep a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Long Heng was rendered speechless. This girl\u2019s sleeping habits really weren\u2019t very that great. It seemed that she was a very irritable person when she was awakened by others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

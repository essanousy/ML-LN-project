She always wore a slight smile when she saw others, easily leaving a favorable impression on them. Born from a wealthy merchant family, her family had money but no power. This was why they\u2019d joined their family up with the prince. Though a concubine\u2019s family couldn\u2019t be considered a proper wife\u2019s family, it was still a relationship that could allow the family to bask in a bit of honor.</p><br/><p>As for second madame, her father was a minor official of the seventh rank. She was the daughter of a concubine, chosen from her envious sisters because her birthdate was deemed fortuitous. Even now, those sisters were trying to find a way to enter the estate and seize the chance to marry into higher status.</p><br/><p>These were all things that Ye-mama had told her beforehand, but Bai Xiangxiu was in the dark as to why they\u2019d chosen now to suddenly make a visit. As the two walked in, they brought with them the trappings of their wealth, both attired in expensive dresses. Accompanying their entrance was something that immediately made Bai Xiangxiu sneeze.</p><br/><p>Not because of anything else, but because she\u2019d long stopped using silly things like incense when she started her in depth study of plants. The sudden scent of incense mixed with ancient rouge that accompanied the two madames was a bit hard to bear. Their wild and contrasting scent profile attacked her nostrils and made them itch.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just her. Xiao Shi had also become used to the natural scents of Winter Garden and couldn\u2019t take it either, discreetly turning away to rub her nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of breeze has blown these two sisters in? Please, hurry and sit.\u201d Everyone was a concubine, so despite being elder and younger sisters, their statuses were equal. Thus, she merely bent her body without rising to greet them.</p><br/><p>The two visitors sat down accordingly, and the senior madame smiled as she started the conversation, \u201cIs Fourth Sister doing better? I heard you\u2019d been severely injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious anymore. It\u2019s fine as long as I\u2019m careful not to touch the injury.\u201d Her complexion still hadn\u2019t regained its natural glow, remaining a pale white. She hadn\u2019t had the chance to eat anything particularly nutritious since she\u2019d come back, but her constitution was perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>The two madames clucked their tongues. \u201cLook, look, look, Fourth Sister is indeed a beauty. Being ill only makes you akin to a sickly Xishi1. Not to mention men, even women would feel distressed by the sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh, they\u2019re actually complimenting me. There has to be a motive. Bai Xiangxiu had always feared the old madame and the prince, but she had no such reservations toward these two. Thus, it wasn\u2019t very difficult to handle them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? These two elder sisters also possess outstandingly elegant bearing.\u201d She smiled as she waved a hand, gesturing for Xiao Shi to pour some tea. When Xiao Shi left, she glanced at Ye-mama, who took the hint. The two of them left to quietly exchange a few words outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell what they\u2019re here for?\u201d Ye-mama asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like anything good,\u201d Xiao Shi could sense that these two overbearing, dressed-up women definitely had bad intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep an eye on them first. I\u2019ll go find His Highness if they make a fuss.\u201d The prince had warned her repeatedly that if anything bad happened to Madame Xiu, she\u2019d face a fate far more horrific than she could imagine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll keep watch. You listen from the outside as well. If something\u2019s off, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for the His Highness to come over!\u201d Xiao Shi also knew that the prince treated her Mistress differently. Although he hadn\u2019t come by since her return, he\u2019d sent someone to look after her.</p><br/><p>After the two finished talking outside, Xiao Shai made tea and entered the room, only to find her mistress\u2019s expression to be a bit strange. A smile with a hint of a sneer, it was her first time seeing such an expression on her mistress\u2019s face. Had something happened?</p><br/><p>Just when she saw that odd expression, she heard senior madame laugh and say, \u201cFourth Sister should know as well. Once that young miss from the Lin family enters the household, our food and drink will depend on her moods. For right now, we can only maintain our positions by gaining favor from His Highness.\u201d As she finished, she sipped her tea. Almost immediately, her fingers trembled involuntarily. She had come from a family of merchants, so she was very familiar with teas.</p><br/><p>Though she hadn\u2019t been harshly criticized by anyone since stepping into the estate, the tea sent to them every month was merely top-grade jasmine or top-grade green tea. But here at the fourth madame\u2019s was the highest quality Pu\u2019er tea. Just a simple sip was enough to leave a lingering fragrance on her lips and teeth. This was more than a single level of difference between them.</p><br/><p>The second madame didn\u2019t recognize the tea, so all she thought was that tea was fragrant, \u201cHmm? Fourth sister\u2019s tea is a bit different from ours. What kind of tea is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very sure.\u201d These were true words. She\u2019d never paid particular attention to tasting teas, much less noticed that her tea had changed recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite tasty,\u201d The second madame drank another mouthful. \u201cAs elder sister said, right now we\u2019re all like grasshoppers on a rope, so we need to advance together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is it the same with the third madame as well?\u201d Why did only these two come over?</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Madame? No no no, she\u2019s still a proper concubine-born daughter from a house of a fifth-rank official. How would she be the same as us? Moreover, the Lin family and Third Madame\u2019s family are even distant relatives, so Miss Lin naturally treats her better than the rest of us.\u201d The senior madame looked at Bai Xiangxiu as soon as she\u2019d finished speaking. Seeing that the other had no reaction, she thought, sure enough, she\u2019s a soft one. All she has going for her is a pretty face. As long as we can grab her, we\u2019ll get a lot of benefits.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu only laughed twice as she mused, Who\u2019s on the same rope as you guys? I\u2019m planning to run away.</p><br/><p>The senior madame merely sighed as she watched Bai Xiangxiu lower her head. \u201cWe know little sister is being favored right now, so how could she admire me or Second Sister? After all, His Highness hasn\u2019t even stepped into our rooms yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Were they here to whine and complain? Even if the prince had entered Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s rooms, he\u2019d never done anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then these two sisters mean?\u201d Just what are they here for?</p><br/><p>Second Madame was more blunt, so she said, \u201cFourth Sister\u2019s been heavily injured this time, so I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to serve His Highness for a couple of days. It\u2019ll be even worse if Old Third found a chance to strike.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister and I talked things over, and we\u2019d like you to look after us. If you could put in a few more good words for us before His Highness. That way, even when Miss Lin becomes the official wife, His Highness will still harbor feelings for the three of us. She wouldn\u2019t be able to fully suppress us then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu opened her mouth so wide that she forgot to close it. Did these two want her to pimp them out? Although the male lead was a despotic type and frighteningly ferocious, he wasn\u2019t trash. At the very least, he was extremely earnest about his feelings, so how could he casually climb into others\u2019 beds? She narrowly avoided rolling her eyes at them, but remained sitting in a good temper, though her smile was a bit forced.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, does Fourth Sister disagree? Or perhaps, you want to monopolize His Highness\u2019 favor? Heheh, Fourth Sister, I\u2019m not scolding you. I won\u2019t talk about how all the crows in the world are black, but is there any man who doesn\u2019t like to take a dip into different pools? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re actually counting on him to keep his body as pure as jade?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot to mention, once Miss Lin enters the household, I\u2019m afraid even someone as favored as you would be sold off. Why not have everyone be the same? It\u2019s better than someone making an example of you. We\u2019re thinking for your sake as well!\u201d The senior madame spoke mildly, her words implying that she\u2019d taken Bai Xiangxiu into consideration as well. It even sounded like she made sense.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s lips twitched. She wasn\u2019t some woman of some lord, so who cared if they were all crows or sparrows? Thus, she said, \u201cSenior Madame\u2019s words are right. But I\u2019m afraid that his lordship won\u2019t be coming here for awhile. When he does, I\u2019ll find a way to put in some good words for you.\u201d Agree with them first. Wouldn\u2019t that be the same as agreeing and doing nothing afterwards? Yet she didn\u2019t expect that Ye-mama had already left before she spoke to find Prince Li.</p><br/><p>Ye-mama\u2019s heart throbbed as she walked. The old madame both feared and loathed the possibility of those concubines joining together to harm the official wife. If she knew, wouldn\u2019t she punish them severely? Even Prince Li was unlikely to spare them.</p><br/><p>1.

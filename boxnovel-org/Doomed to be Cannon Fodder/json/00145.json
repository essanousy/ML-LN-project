Even though he didn\u2019t mind, it didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t. A woman cared most about her face, especially a beautiful woman. But, would she really sleep the entire way back to the capital?</p><br/><p>He actually wanted to talk to her, see her smile at him. Then he would pinch her cheek and have a little fun with her. They\u2019d likely have reached the capital by the time they were done with that. But looking at her sleeping visage, she was so peaceful and lovely, so small and delicate\u2026</p><br/><p>Why did he suddenly feel like he was looking at his daughter; wasn\u2019t she his woman? If this woman bore him a daughter, it would definitely be a cute baby. No. Before that, he needed an heir. Her eyes suddenly opened just as he pondered on his heir. He felt a pang of guilt because he\u2019d just been thinking of how to have her bear him a son.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu just so happened to catch the sudden change on Prince Li\u2019s face. The corners of his mouth had just been turned up in a smile, but he immediately became serious when he saw that she was awake. However he didn\u2019t push her away. Wasn\u2019t this guy just a bit awkward? Or perhaps he was just used to putting on the airs of a general in front of the army and had found it hard to return to his own personality?</p><br/><p>She smiled faintly, but didn\u2019t crawl out of his embrace. Perhaps it was because they had been intimate that these kinds of actions didn\u2019t make her bashful anymore. Plus, it was cold, and waking up nestled in his arms was very comfortable.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was also in no hurry to have her get up. Instead, he pulled a light quilt over her. But he was not used to idle chatter. Even though he was still cold towards the girl he liked, his actions and expression were not as cold as they\u2019d been when they\u2019d first met.</p><br/><p>Bai Xianxiu really didn\u2019t fear him anymore. She kept thinking that the male lead in the novel was an earnest person. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if things stayed like this. No, wait. She had to go back! But well, if she couldn\u2019t go back, did that mean she could have the male lead forever? She was conflicted, wanting to go back, yet not willing to. It seemed that a lot of things had changed after they\u2019d been intimate.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust bear it a little longer. We\u2019ll rest for a bit at the relay station up ahead.\u201d There was a relay station outside every city on the way to the capital, and they weren\u2019t just used to change city patrol horses. It was also a place for traveling merchants and government officials to rest. In addition, the staff inside had simple, clean backgrounds. After all, it was a branch of the local government.</p><br/><p>There was also a place specifically for female members of official families to rest, accessible through a long passageway. Of course, horse-drawn carriages could enter, heading directly to the rear compound where female attendants awaited them. Long Heng didn\u2019t alight from the carriage from beginning to end. Not because he was sticking close to Bai Xiangxiu, but mainly because he didn\u2019t like to be seen unless it was necessary.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t as weak as he thought. Her spirits had long since recovered after sleeping for a day. Although she was still achy and sore, it wasn\u2019t as bad as before. It was only later she learned that Long Heng had used medicine on her, and more specifically, Red Pearl\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that she thought of it, she didn\u2019t dare take off her pants to look down there. That stuff didn\u2019t wash off easily, alright? It was a good thing that it wouldn\u2019t come out, otherwise her skirt and her underwear\u2026 Her eyes brimmed with hot tears of resignation when she thought about this. How could he casually smear that stuff down there?</p><br/><p>Well, there was no sense in worrying about it. There was nothing that could be done anymore. If he dared touch her tonight, he would be the one disgusted!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu thought about it thoroughly, then delicately, gracefully alighted from the carriage with Long Heng\u2019s hand for support, and entered her room.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Xiaoshi wanted to help her down but was too late. She was actually quite irked because of this. Xiaowu was the same; she had come on this trip to wait on her mistress. She\u2019d finally snatched Ye-mama\u2019s position, but the male lead somehow managed to supplant her every duty. Even here, she couldn\u2019t stay by her mistress\u2019 side. It was a wholly unpleasant feeling.</p><br/><p>Long Heng now treated Bai Xiangxiu with delight and respect, but was still hungry for more intimacy. So they stopped before it was dark and went directly to their rooms in the relay station to wash up.</p><br/><p>After washing they quickly arranged dinner. By the time they\u2019d finished a pensive dinner, the sky had yet to darken. Food held no taste for Long Heng right now. He swept her up in his arms, carrying her to the bed to have his way with her. Kissing and groping was unavoidable, and Bai Xiangxiu kept wanting to push him away. It was a pity that her feeble efforts went completely unnoticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still light out, can\u2019t we\u2026 talk?\u201d Articles of clothing were fast disappearing from her body. She didn\u2019t want to do it again before the sky darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, what do you want to talk about?\u201d Long Heng found a comfortable position so that he could still reach into her clothes. The more she squirmed away, the more he wanted her. But it was indeed still early in the night, so he restrained himself from playing with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, tell me, why did you want to exchange Miss Lin for me?\u201d Exchanging the female lead for the supporting female was the dream of all cannon fodder supporting characters. Don\u2019t ask why, but Bai Xiangxiu just felt incredibly vindicated that she hadn\u2019t been affected by the female lead\u2019s halo.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s face darkened at the mention of Lin Qianzi, but didn\u2019t immediately stir to anger. That was controlled more or less by the feel of that warm pliable body beneath his hands. Soft and fragrant, how could he think of anything else?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what sort of woman she is, casually flirting with that man. When I went to save her previously, I discovered that she was already not the noble, innocent Miss Lin.\u201d He scoffed. After he\u2019d seen that, she was already nothing to him, no matter how beautiful she was. Besides, he\u2019d already had his sights set on the young woman before him. He stroked her face. \u201cWhy must you bother about her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, maybe she was forced.\u201d Definitely forced, because that Miss Lin had a flaw, a flaw that all female leads had, it was that she affected a cold air. She would never take the initiative with a man, but after being forced she would blame and reproach him. But when someone else hurt that man, she would feel that he had treated her well and have all sorts of tender feelings. Thus, she would end up mistreating the male lead.</p><br/><p>The male lead had quite a good temper. Though sometimes he might mistreat the female lead, in the end, he was still quite tolerant of her. Of course, the female lead would finally realize how good the male lead was in the end, culminating in a happily ever after for the two of them. Wasn\u2019t that how these novels usually played out? Bai Xiangxiu had not finished reading it, so she could only take that line of reasoning.</p><br/><p>\u201cForced? Forced her affections toward that man? When has she viewed me as her fianc\u00e9? She\u2019s despised me since the beginning, so why would I I attend to her all day long?\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re also thinking about turning against me, hmm?\u201d His voice quickly turned cold.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately felt immense pressure and she shook her head so fast it nearly fell off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know your mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A good child would definitely correct a mistake. Too bad she didn\u2019t expect that she would be framed by others.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

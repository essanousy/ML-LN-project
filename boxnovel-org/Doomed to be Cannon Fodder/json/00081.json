The emperor had the prestige of an emperor, and a minister had the prestige of a minister.</p><br/><p>There was one kind of prestige that was a combination of the two characteristics of having a high rank but also tempered by the fires of battle. </p><br/><p>Prince Li, Long Heng, was precisely this kind of person. He himself came from a family of generals and had been a noble since birth. Later on, he commanded the armies, and it was even said that a general on the field wasn\u2019t bound by the sovereign\u2019s orders! When even the sovereign\u2019s command could be ignored, it was easy to see how great his authority was.</p><br/><p>Therefore, not just anyone could bear this kind of majestic presence.</p><br/><p>Even Bai Xiangxiu, a modern person, also momentarily felt that he\u2019d grown larger than life as goosebumps dimpled her entire body. She hadn\u2019t even turned around, so she couldn\u2019t to see what he looked like.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense? What? Do you think that it\u2019s wrong to save lives first, or is another scheme afoot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Few people dared to refute Prince Li\u2019s words. The Song brothers opened their mouths, yet no words came out. In the end, Long Heng\u2019s words forced them to close their mouths. If they dared say anything else, then they really would be scheming otherwise. </p><br/><p>When Long Heng saw that no one had the intention to speak again, he spoke to Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cWhat are you doing standing here? Saving people is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s body trembled at those words as she replied, \u201cTightness of chest and shortness of breath does not lend itself to movement. Remove all of these flowers first and open the windows for ventilation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants quickly followed suit after she finished speaking. Those tulips were all taken out in short order and the windows thrown open. With the windows opened, the people suffering from tightness of chest earlier all felt a bit better. Song Hui was among those who\u2019d experienced a tighter chest, and now he possessed a bit more faith in this madame\u2019s actions. </p><br/><p>His eyebrows slowly relaxing, he said, \u201cWhat else needs to be done, Madame Xiu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could breathe in deeply now as well. \u201cUse a damp towel to wipe down the patients\u2019 faces to help them wake up a bit. Don\u2019t use cold water, warm water is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the servants did as they were told, the complexion of the two people on the couch did indeed become a bit better.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was immensely relieved. His heart filled with astonishment and gratitude as he watched Bai Xiangxiu scatter the people in the room.</p><br/><p>There were many types of women in this world, but someone like her, obviously intelligent and low-profile, was actually rarely seen. Take Lin Qianzi for instance, she understood poems, was beautiful, and was often hailed as the most talented woman in the city. But what about this woman in front of him? She\u2019d been unknown to the public before marriage and still remained low-profile afterwards. </p><br/><p>Her appearance was more beautiful than Lin Qianzi\u2019s. She knew how to make vegetarian dishes and understood all sorts of knowledge. She was truly a pearl covered in dust. If he had known of a woman such as her earlier, he would have personally gone to her door to propose. Unfortunately, she was now someone else\u2019s concubine.</p><br/><p>Just as his distress grew manifold, he heard that the old master had woken up on the couch. He was looking much better after coughing lightly a few times and spitting out a mouthful of phlegm. But he was still breathing heavily, \u201cThat really suffocated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Hui hurriedly stepped forward and said, \u201cFather, are you better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old master replied, \u201cA bit better. Why hasn\u2019t Grand Master Hui Shou awakened yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>GrandMaster Hui Shou woke up just as they were talking about him. Judging from the situation, the two were indeed poisoned by the toxic fragrance of the tulips.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu heaved a sigh of relief, finally knowing that she hadn\u2019t made any mistakes. If she couldn\u2019t save them after delaying the medical treatment, then her guilt would\u2019ve been enormous. After drinking tea, Old Master naturally asked about the situation. Knowing that Bai Xiangxiu had saved him, he couldn\u2019t help but display a small smile towards her. When he heard his four sons quarreling amongst themselves after coming to see him, he couldn\u2019t help furrow his eyebrows and say coldly, \u201cWhat are you all still standing here for? Get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Song brothers were helpless and could only withdraw to avoid his ire.</p><br/><p>The old master said to Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to actually know those flowers. I accidently noticed these unknown flowers when I was outside and merely felt them elegant. That was why I placed them in the hall here. I didn\u2019t think they would hide poison. Seems like they\u2019ll need to be destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. \u2026 I\u2019m saying that tulips are still good flowers. It\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t plant too many inside. If planted outside, they will create a nice landscape.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt that the tulips were still beautiful flowers. There wouldn\u2019t be a problem as long as there weren\u2019t great patches of them.</p><br/><p>Seeing her wanting to save the flowers, the Old Master couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cIf you like them so much, just take them. I won\u2019t dare grow them anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen many thanks to Old Master.\u201d Breathing a sigh of relief, Bai Xiangxiu thanked the elderly man. But off on the side, Grand Master Hui Guang didn\u2019t let her off.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady patron, it was possible for you to not turn back just a moment ago. And yet, why did you return?\u201d The old monk smiled as he asked.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu really wanted to roll her eyes at him and say, \u201cHow do I know?\u201d. But now, under the watchful eyes of so many people, and most importantly the murderous god standing behind her, she could only say, \u201cNaturally, because I thought of a method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFemale patron, are you not afraid of things becoming difficult?\u201d Hui Guang\u2019s smile never wavered as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see Old Master and Grand Master Hui Shou suffer from danger, right?\u201d Wasn\u2019t this an obvious question? As a monk, how could he not understand, as a monk?</p><br/><p>But Hui Guang said, \u201cThis is a shared destiny with Buddha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, there are but a few who aren\u2019t predestined.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and retorted.</p><br/><p>Hui Guang\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he remained smiling, but he no longer spoke. Bai Xiangxiu was startled for a moment and then fell into deep thought. In this world, there were indeed very few who would not have their fates intersect with Buddha, but that didn\u2019t mean that everyone would turn back. Yes, just a moment ago she felt that she had some courage. Her face couldn\u2019t help turn slightly red. With everyone\u2019s eyes looking at her, she became even more embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Afraid that Great Master Hui Guang would speak of something or another again, Long Heng said, \u201cThe matter is already done. Why are you not leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu responded softly and submissively followed behind Long Heng. However, Song Jiaoyue felt sorry that his friend was really too ice-cold. She was such a kind-hearted girl. She should\u2019ve been treated with gentleness and care. His heart was slightly pained, but there was nothing he could do about it. </p><br/><p>Watching Bai Xiangxiu leave, Hui Guang murmured one of the many names of Buddha. Grand Master Hui Shou said weakly, \u201cIt is rare to see you so proactive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Guang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s so rare to see someone so intelligent. It\u2019s a pity that she still has ties to the mortal world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hui Shou said laughingly, \u201cNot everyone can truly leave behind worldly affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head, Hui Guang said, \u201cBoth you and I are no exceptions, let alone her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two great masters rested for a while and then took their leave afterwards. However, unexpectedly, only one of them returned to the monastery. The other went to the Li Manor to beg for alms. That remains a story for another day.</p><br/><p>It was time for Bai Xiangxiu to return and so she went to take her leave of Madame Song. She also spent some time saying goodbye to Yu Se and Bai He. This kept her until dusk, when night had fallen. Long Heng and his men were still waiting anxiously at the front door. He could have gone back first, but he wasn\u2019t at ease just leaving her here alone.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while, a servant\u2019s report came back that the old master was feeling a bit uncomfortable again. As a result, they had asked Madame Xiu to go see him and was afraid that she would be unable to return tonight.</p><br/><p>Long Heng almost kicked the servant straight into the ground. His woman wasn\u2019t a doctor! What use was there in having her stay? But he was worried about leaving her behind and returning by herself. She really was too famous in this Song household. After thinking it over, he ordered his people to return to the Li Manor and back to Old Madame. He himself would also stay behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

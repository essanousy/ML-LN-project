That thing was none other than a royal decree! Even if it was in the military, one would have to wash their hands clean and kneel before receiving it. Yet, he\u2019d given it to her just like that? Oh well, there are no outsiders here anyways. She opened it and took a look. Skipping over the flowery salutations that plagued the beginning of the decree, she saw that the latter part of it stated that she would be made Princess Consort Li.</p><br/><p>It was not easy for a little concubine to get promoted to the position that easily. Unlike the modern era, where a man\u2019s mistress would take the position of the main wife after the former wife divorced the man, should a man in ancient times vanquish one\u2019s wife for the sake of his concubine, one would be incarcerated for this serious crime.</p><br/><p>Even after one served jail time, the concubine would still be unable to assume the position of the wife. Fortunately, Long Heng doesn\u2019t have a main wife, so there should be no punishment. \u201cWait, that\u2019s not right\u2026 Did you get punished just for this royal decree?\u201d asked Bai Xiangxiu with her brow furrowed the moment she realized the truth of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, quite a worthwhile trade. You can live in my residence proudly and properly now! Aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 Well\u2026 I\u2019m definitely glad, but you didn\u2019t have to get hurt for something like this. And that aside, didn\u2019t the emperor cause trouble for you?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt like crying all of a sudden, but she had just emptied her tear ducts not long ago. She no longer knew whether she needed to shed a tear. Even though it was a joyous matter, she found that she couldn\u2019t revel in celebration given Long Heng\u2019s injured state. After Long Heng recounted his experiences at the palace, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face flushed red, \u201cHow can he be so shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has the right not to accept it even if the eyewitness is there. It\u2019s his imperial right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what should we do? Do we just accept that we\u2019ve fallen victim into their ploy?\u201d Dissatisfied as Bai Xiangxiu was, she knew that there was no other choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt any rate, he has to come up with a reasonable explanation for this matter. Otherwise, there will be those who aren\u2019t satisfied with the resolution even if I don\u2019t mind it. Let\u2019s just wait and see who he will make the scapegoat next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. What about Xiao Lin and the old madame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were retained within the palace, possibly out of fear that I\u2019ll cause trouble. But don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll definitely return in a few more days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. For some reason, I feel that the storm won\u2019t abate even if we want it to.\u201d Lowering her head, she noted that Long Heng was staring at her oddly with his head slanted. His long ink-colored hair sprawled over the bed looked rather tantalizing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Come over here, let me rub it off for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not thinking that the serious-looking Prince Li would tease her like that, she stretched her face forward obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome closer. You know I\u2019m injured, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s your hand that\u2019s injured, not your shoulders, Bai Xiangxiu thought with confusion as she continued to draw closer, only to feel a hand press against her head and a warm kiss to the lips. We\u2019re already husband and wife, yet you resort to this? What\u2019s with the sudden attack, huh? Even so, she didn\u2019t shrink back and even reciprocated the kiss passionately.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had always been an introverted person, so she was incredibly conservative about such matters. It was as if the shyness of all eastern women was concentrated within her, so the times when she took the initiative for such matters could be counted on one hand. Having gotten his way, Long Heng pressed on and didn\u2019t hold back. But just as he was about to wrap her in a deep, warm embrace, the pain he felt from his wound tearing open caused him to have no choice but to calm down. Pushing her back with haggard breath, he huffed, \u201cYou little lass\u2026 This prince will be back to deal with you when I recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her face flush with embarrassment, Bai Xianxiu said, \u201cIt was you who did \u2018it\u2019 to me first. Why would I have to be \u2018dealt\u2019 with by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you could do the \u2018dealing\u2019 on me if you so prefer.\u201d While Long Heng could barely move, he still didn\u2019t shy from flirting verbally. However, when Bai Xiangxiu patted him lightly a few times, his face fumed with such excruciating pain that one could almost boil water by using his face as a stove.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop fooling around. Summon the supervisor to announce the royal decree. With the recent developments being as volatile as they are, I can quietly elevate your status. My apologies. The celebratory banquet, on the other hand, cannot be rushed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to host a banquet at a time like this? Very well, just get some rest. I\u2019ll talk to Butler Long about this.\u201d Though she said that, Bai Xiangxiu was incredibly happy as she could formally become the main wife and no longer suffer the disdain of others. Xiao Lin on the other hand would no longer have to be a concubine-born child. It was still common in an ancient era like this for concubine-born children to be ostracized by others.</p><br/><p>Long Shuting had also been rather busy lately. He understood the situation of the household quite well and also knew that if the emperor decided to kill the prince, the rest of Prince Li Manor would not fare well either. However, since nothing of the sort happened yet, he could do naught but hold his ground. He didn\u2019t even consider escape.</p><br/><p>Seeing Bai Xiangxiu walk over with royal decree in hand, he asked curiously, \u201cMadame Xiu, for what have you come to the front yard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu laughed, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to trouble you to announce this royal decree in front of the rest. After that, hang some red lanterns outside or something, and hire an opera troupe to sing in the courtyard for a day or two.\u201d</p><br/><p>An elaborate show still had to be put on. Otherwise, who would know that she had successfully elevated in rank from a mere concubine to a princess consort? Long Shuting received the decree with an odd look. Upon giving it a brief glance, he smiled, \u201cThis one greets Princess Consort Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh? Why does it feel so good to be called that? From today onwards, I\u2019ll be the boss! I\u2019ll be able to do whatever I want! \u201cRise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi had been following behind her and just realized what had happened. She fell to her knees just when Long Shuting got up, \u201cThis one greets the princess consort. Congratulations, Princess Consort!\u201d She actually burst out in tears afterwards out of sheer joy that her mistress had been promoted after such hardship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a great joyous occasion! We must definitely hold a big banquet to celebrate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Highness has said that the current situation is unsettled, so we should be prudent in this matter. Just send some gifts to my family and inform them about this. However, caution them to lay low and not come visit recently. I\u2019ll send someone to escort them to the manor after things calm down a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Aren\u2019t you supposed to visit home with the prince?\u201d Even though she was only made consort at a later date, some formalities still had to be observed. It has been tradition since ancient times for a son-in-law to bring one\u2019s daughter back to see the parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, you have a point. I guess that\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d There were so many matters happening as of late, she wasn\u2019t sure whether the emperor would act against them once again. More importantly, what would they do if that came to pass? Should they really rebel? Then again, things probably wouldn\u2019t get so far. Otherwise, Long Heng wouldn\u2019t have begged for her to be made Princess Consort. Even so, she still had to celebrate in her residence. Having told Long Shuting what to do, Bai Xiangxiu returned to take care of Long Heng, \u201cI finally don\u2019t have to refer to myself as \u2018this concubine\u2019 from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all the benefit you gain?\u201d Long Heng mused as he took in a sip of the soup she was feeding him. All she wanted from becoming my consort was so that she wouldn\u2019t have to refer to herself as \u2018this concubine\u2019? Other things aside, isn\u2019t she the least bit happy about becoming my wife?</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiangxiu had long considered herself to be the wife of Long Heng, no matter how ancient people perceived it. Long Heng on the other hand, didn\u2019t consider concubines to be his wife. Now that she was his rightful wife, he could walk in broad daylight with her and nobody would have the excuse to object to it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there are plenty of benefits. I\u2019m just too happy that I couldn\u2019t come up with any right now,\u201d responded Bai Xiangxiu as she continued the feeding, feeling a sweet tinge of emotion in her heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

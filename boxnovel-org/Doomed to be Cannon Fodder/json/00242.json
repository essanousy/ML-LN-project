How could the crowd\u2019s expressions possibly escape his eyes? How could he possibly not know about Lin Qianzi\u2019s reputation? Long Heng was trying to humiliate him in public!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t belittle yourself, my loyal subject. You\u2019ve already done so much for our country. Naturally, you deserve only the best.\u201d As quick as a flash, the emperor\u2019s face returned to a placid smile, seemingly unbothered by Long Heng\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Long Heng could immediately tell that the emperor was up to something. Why else would he suddenly drop the talk about national matters to talk about marriage? It didn\u2019t take long for him to realize what the old fox was up to. They were clearly afraid that he\u2019d take a wife from a powerful family. That would make him an even more powerful foe. Truth be told, if that was his plan, he would\u2019ve turned this country upside down a long time ago. These aristocrats and government officials were nothing more than a bunch of sloths who knew of little other than food, play, and greed. There was not a single person who knew how to fight.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even want to control the army, which had ultimately caused Long Heng to develop the army in a way where he held a majority of power. It was not like their laziness was the only reason. The royal family was simply too small. The current emperor was a concubine-born son who had wiped out the entire royal family in his pursuit of the dragon throne. The only person left from the royal family was Prince Rong, an honest man who cared little for material gain. Prince Rong was unfamiliar with military matters as he didn\u2019t desire power. The power he had from his royal blood was more than enough for him!</p><br/><p>I wonder how my son is doing. Long Heng knew he couldn\u2019t mention his son, as any mention would be a show of weakness. \u201cYour Majesty, this subject has a request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy success in this war is all due to my concubine, N\u00e8e Bai. She helped resolve the siege by coming up with a unique plan. I believe Prince Rong has already reported on it. This subject owes much to her with no way to repay her. Your Majesty, will you give your approval for this subject to make her my main wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Her achievements do sound very impressive according to Prince Rong, which is why he taken her as a godsister. However, I\u2019m sure you are familiar with the laws of this matter correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe punishment for the unauthorized promotion of a concubine to a main wife is five thousand taels of silver and one hundred beatings of the military rod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd do you accept this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy loyal subject, I understand that your body is not at its best after your journey back to the capital, but rules have to be adhered to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter. I only wish for Your Majesty to bestow us with a royal decree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Men, take Prince Li away to beat him a hundred times and bring him back here to receive the royal decree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng gritted his teeth. It seems he wishes me to receive the royal decree while injured. Not a problem, all the training I\u2019ve done is not for nothing after all. He snorted derisively inwardly and went to receive his beatings. Even though he was being beaten by a group of eunuchs with little to no strength, a hundred rod beatings wasn\u2019t something a normal person would be able to bear. Long Heng was able to endure through the beatings with his internal force. He swaggered back out after the beating and knelt in the palace hall with his back ramrod straight, causing everyone to gasp in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that how good Long Heng was in martial arts, but no one ever imagined that he\u2019d be that powerful. He could still walk with fast strides after taking a hundred rods! There wasn\u2019t even a slight tremble when he spoke. He was truly a hero. Many were impressed, but Minister Lin and the emperor could only look on while gnashing their teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy loyal subject, you may now retrieve the royal decree and get some much needed rest. The autumn hunting day will be held three days from now. Can you accompany me for the hunt? Of course, you must bring the new madame of your household. She\u2019s a heroine who is no less than men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three days? He wants me to accompany him to the hunt in three days? Even though I just received a hundred beatings? Long Heng gritted his teeth, \u201cNaturally. Your Majesty, the person who dared impersonate you must be someone close to you. Please investigate this thoroughly to prevent anything further from developing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I will definitely investigate this matter clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this subject wishes to be dismissed. I will skin the culprit alive if I ever find them. How can I allow such a traitorous person to live while he\u2019s bringing calamity to our nation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely, exactly!\u201d They had just been one step away from taking over the enemy nation, but an imposter had suddenly emerged out of nowhere and sent out a fake decree! The old ministers that were present were all furious.</p><br/><p>The emperor was extremely speechless. None of the ministers truly knew his thoughts. In fact, they were even speaking out for Long Heng! Has it never crossed their minds that Long Heng might lead the army to take down the capital after he\u2019s done conquering the enemy nation?</p><br/><p>A bunch of useless fools. They don\u2019t even have the foresight of a woman. However, his failure this time was because he\u2019d belittled a woman a little too much. It was rumored that N\u00e8e Bai had been the one to rescue Long Heng. The emperor had thought that this would be a good chance to get rid of the Song family, but he never imagined that there\u2019d be someone even more formidable behind them. Fine. I want to see for myself how formidable N\u00e8e Bai truly is. I heard she broke into the dungeons after causing a furor in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, we still need someone to oversee the process even though we have the imperial decree. Can I escort my mother home for such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 The empress genuinely enjoys the company of the young prince. Why don\u2019t we let them spend a couple more days together? I will order someone to escort them to your manor when the time comes.\u201d The emperor was worried that Long Heng might do something rash in the heat of the moment. He wanted to take the general down a notch for a moment. After all, the emperor would be the one with the last say on things when Long Heng\u2019s limelight finally died down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is my honor that the empress enjoys the company of my son. If that is the case, this subject will now take my leave.\u201d Long Heng then took the imperial decree to the manor. When he arrived at Apricot Garden, he crawled onto the bed and didn\u2019t move a muscle. </p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re back\u2026 Why are you injured? Did the bastard emperor punish you?\u201d Alright, Bai Xiangxiu was a little too agitated. She\u2019d forgotten that this was a society where the emperor was most powerful.</p><br/><p>Ye-mama quickly covered Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mouth. She pinched Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cMadame Xiu, it\u2019s better that you don\u2019t speak of such things. We\u2019d better tend to His Highness\u2019 wounds first.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cYou may all leave. I only need the madame to help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSummon a doctor!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu quickly requested. She didn\u2019t dare to treat his buttocks as she found their condition incredibly horrible. The doctor soon arrived and noticed that Long Heng\u2019s pants had stuck to his flesh due to his wounds. They seemed incredibly serious. The fact that he could still manage to walk back home was simply incredible.</p><br/><p>The doctor used a pair of scissors to cut open Long Heng\u2019s pants as Bai Xiangxiu quietly applied medicine on his wounds, tears slowly dripping down her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying. My wounds are not that serious,\u201d Long Heng said with a pained look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour flesh has turned into pulp! How can it be not serious? Stop talking and let me concentrate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Long Heng was depressed. Why was he being lectured even though he was wounded? However, her lecture felt surprisingly good and warmed the cockles of his heart</p><br/><p>Little beads of tears kept dripping down Bai Xiangxiu face, but her crying face quickly turned to a frown when she turned her head around and saw how the person on the bed was smiling. She gently pressed down on his forehead and said, \u201cYour forehead isn\u2019t warm at all! I thought they\u2019ve beaten you silly! Why are you smiling so much when your injuries are so severe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough. Nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sweat was dripping down the doctor\u2019s forehead. The young couple looked so sweet when they were together. He felt a little guilty just by being in the same room as them. What was he supposed to do if they kicked him out the manor for seeing something he shouldn\u2019t have seen? He had a family to feed!</p><br/><p>It took some effort before they finally finished applying medicine on Long Heng\u2019s wounds. He couldn\u2019t put on pants for a short period of time, so he lay down on his stomach while wearing only his inner clothing, a thin blanket covering him. After the doctor left, Long Heng handed the imperial decree to Bai Xiangxiu and said, \u201cTake a look at this and guess what it is.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

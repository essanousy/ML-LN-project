Stomach pain?\u201d Despite his age, Yu Kuang was still innocent about these kinds of things. He still had an innocent body after all, despite his age. How would he know the significance of a stomachache to a woman? In his mind, even though she\u2019d fallen, there was no way she could have suffered heavy injuries from such a fall. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I will summon Long Heng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry me to the bed. Something feels wrong,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu no longer moved an inch as a possible reason flashed through her mind. Yu Kuang had no choice but to carry her onto the bed, only to have Long Heng enter the tent at that precise moment. He glared at Yu Kuang furiously, but the latter didn\u2019t seem to realize that this was a situation that called for an explanation. Danger seemed to be escalating.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop glaring at each other! Go summon a doctor now! If you go any later, it might come at the cost of a life!\u201d I\u2019m going to be so pissed if it really is what I think it is. How long has it been since I last gave birth?! Long Heng, do you have to be so efficient? This is going to be hell if my life is going to be like this!</p><br/><p>Long Heng quickly ordered someone to summon the doctor when he heard the term \u2018cost of a life.\u201d He thought that they\u2019d done something to her. The doctor took Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s pulse for a long time without saying a word. She suddenly felt that there might be another explanation for all this. Could this be due to a very intense greeting of that time of the month instead?</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at Long Heng while Bai Xiangxiu was still caught up in her thoughts. He hesitated for a bit before saying, \u201cGeneral. This young sir here\u2026 his pulse is a little odd. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d How could this kind of pulse come from a man? Was his skill deteriorating because he\u2019d been treating battle wounds for such a long time without making any diagnoses?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately caught his drift, \u201cI\u2019m actually a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-woman\u2026 why didn\u2019t you tell me that earlier? I was almost frightened to death.\u201d The doctor didn\u2019t know her true identity, so his tone became a bit resigned as relief flooded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Long Heng noticed that their choice of words was a little unusual, which was why he immediately asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we send this gentleman outside first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang furrowed his brows but still left the room. This made Long Heng and Bai Xiangxiu even more nervous. They genuinely thought that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lad\u2026 this madame\u2019s pulse indicates that her pain is due to the accumulation of yin energy from the cold weather, which was why her menstrual period has come late. All she needs is some medicine to boost her blood flow and qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Color immediately returned to Long Heng\u2019s face after he heard what the doctor had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s only medicine for wounds in the army camp. So, we will have to travel to Tranquil City to get her medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go,\u201d Yu Kuang interrupted from the outside. He could hear the doctor very clearly even though the doctor had kept his voice low. Long Heng frowned. This wasn\u2019t something that he should let another man intervene with, but he didn\u2019t have a choice. He had very important matters to deal with right now. The couple looked at each other in the eye, only to see the speechlessness in each other\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang immediately left for Tranquil City after the doctor wrote down the prescription. It would take him quite some time; they were a ways away from Tranquil City.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre\u2026 are you feeling better now?\u201d Long Heng asked carefully while holding her hand as he sat beside her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt very aggrieved. She held up Long Heng\u2019s hand and bit down hard. \u201cI was so frightened. I thought\u2026 I thought\u2026\u201d </p><br/><p>A gentle smile emerged on Long Heng\u2019s face, \u201cYou thought what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought I was pregnant and lost the child when I fell. I was so frightened to death at that time! I didn\u2019t even dare move an inch!\u201d I\u2019m so relieved that I was only panicking over nothing. Bai Xiangxiu suddenly felt chills radiate from someone beside her. It was at this moment that she finally noticed the ugly look on Long Heng\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d What\u2019s wrong with him?</p><br/><p>Long Heng had suddenly grabbed her hands and held them tightly. It seemed that he finally realized how precarious of a situation Bai Xiangxiu had been in just now. It was hard to say how things could\u2019ve truly ended. If she\u2019d been pregnant, then the fall she had taken just now would\u2019ve\u2026 You best remember this. I, Long Heng, will surely took revenge for this!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about taking revenge for me? Go ahead! Let me tell you something. Commander Lu was actually the one who came to rescue Su Yun.\u201d This was basically a chance bestowed by the heavens. Wouldn\u2019t it be such a waste if they were to do nothing with that knowledge?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was him?!\u201d Long Heng bounded to his feet. The enemy\u2019s commander-in-chief had shown up! Long Heng would be able to get twice the results with half the effort if he were to attack the enemy right now. A hint of happiness and excitement appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I will take revenge for you and our child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat child? Don\u2019t speak nonsense!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes at him. She had been doing this a lot lately to the hero who was admired by thousands. The hero wasn\u2019t even slightly angered by it either. In fact, he even gave her a kiss to alleviate her anger and left the tent. Men meant for big things were always like this. Even though Bai Xiangxiu wished that he\u2019d stay around and accompany her at a time like this, she was consoled by the fact that he\u2019d dispatched a lot of soldiers to surround and guard her tent. He rallied the troops and left for battle in roughly seven minutes. </p><br/><p>Long Heng was furious that they\u2019d tried to harm Bai Xiangxiu. Their relationship was now much more than just skin deep. It was a sort of relationship that had seeped deep inside their hearts. He\u2019d likely wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself if anything happened to her. His anger influenced the soldiers as well. They all knew that Bai Xiangxiu was here to help with the war effort, but the general\u2019s face was almost ashen when he\u2019d come out of the tent. They figured that the enemy must\u2019ve done something to the madame.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had a habit of boosting his soldiers\u2019 morale before a battle. He\u2019d speak eloquently about how they were protecting the country and stopping the enemy from ever threatening their own nation. This time however, his speech contained nothing but words of murder and pillage. There wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit of mercy. Like a cold-blooded god of war, he commanded his men to form ranks. Soldiers were easily influenced by their commander\u2019s mood. Moreover, the soldiers also respected the madame very much. So it came to no surprise that they were thirsty for revenge as well. And so, the entire army began their march, empowered by their newly found rage.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was currently resting on her bed after she changed her sanitary pad. She had no idea that some people had the misconception that she was dead, and that they were marching angrily in hopes to avenge her. Even Bai Xiangxiu was stirred by their battlecry; it seemed loud enough to rouse the heavens. Why am I being all excited for? I can\u2019t even get up! This menstrual period of hers was incredibly ferocious.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang soon came back with a variety of medicines. He handed over the medicine to Bai Xiangxiu and marveled as he watched her gulp it down. \u201cAre you feeling better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu almost spat out all the medicine in her mouth. She coughed a few times as her cheeks flushed red. \u201cFeeling\u2026 better?\u201d She was still quite shy when it came to that topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Jiaoyue\u2019s wounds have gotten better and he\u2019s gone back to the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, that\u2019s good news. Life in Tranquil City does not suit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But it doesn\u2019t suit you either.\u201d Yu Kuang gently tucked her hair behind her ears. The gesture looked incredibly affectionate. However, he immediately withdrew his hand when he realized what he\u2019d done. He didn\u2019t seem to understand why his heart felt so much pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? But I\u2019ve no choice.\u201d A wife should follow her husband. All she wanted was for him to return home safely and reunite with their son.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought for a moment there that you\u2019d lost a child.\u201d Yu Kuang couldn\u2019t be blamed for harboring such thoughts because Bai Xiangxiu had thought the same as well. Her actions had caused Yu Kuang to greatly misunderstand things. It was such a series of unfortunate events.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

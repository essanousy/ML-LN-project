But right now, the person inside was so fragile he feared that the news may actually send her life flying away. It would be better to hide this for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSteward, what should we do about the cotton clothing? We can\u2019t afford any more delays right now\u2026 cough cough\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt that the other definitely couldn\u2019t hear her speak clearly. Even she herself had difficulty discerning her own words.</p><br/><p>But in reality, her words were as clear as a bell to him. He quickly replied, \u201cIt might be a bit difficult. This humble one shall endeavor to do his best, so Madame Xiu needn\u2019t worry. Just set your mind at rest and treat your illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, then try to do it as soon as possible. The weather\u2019s getting chillier as we speak, so if we delay too long, someone will catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She is rather kind-hearted. Long Shuting left as soon as he agreed, and indeed, did things as best he could. But all of the larger embroidery workshops were all busy, so there was no way they could accept such a huge order to be completed in so short a time.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu recuperated for two whole days before she reached a semblance of health. Though she could speak, her voice was still marred by the smoke damage. Still, Ye-mama recalled something; the prince and Old Madame should\u2019ve arrived by now. Shouldn\u2019t they write them a letter from home?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had no idea what to write as she picked up her brush, zoning out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi stood by the side and hesitantly made a proposal. \u201cBefore the prince left, you made him angry. Why not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu sucked in a breath as she understood. Since she\u2019d offended her superior, she had to find ways to make amends. What if he returned and vented his rage on her? Would that be her tragic fate? After enduring for a while, she was forced to concede defeat.</p><br/><p>Raising the brush, she wrote a line from a certain nameless poem: 1 it was difficult for us to chance and meet, and the time of parting was equally so; the east wind has arisen now and a hundred flowers are gone 2. </p><br/><p>These two lines expressed her thoughts, which was that she missed him and was very sad and whatnot after he\u2019d left. She didn\u2019t write the rest of the lines because they were all too much; she didn\u2019t want to convey the message that she couldn\u2019t bear to be parted from him. After the poetry, she added a few lines about the situation at the estate. But she didn\u2019t mention the fire or how she\u2019d gotten injured.</p><br/><p>After all, these things weren\u2019t worth them worrying over! She should wait until she\u2019d resolved the main point of the cotton clothing before she made a report.</p><br/><p>After resting for awhile, she felt that it would only be proper if she checked the incident site. At the very least, she should see if there was anything salvageable from the fire. Hopefully, things hadn\u2019t been completely destroyed, or that would really be a loss. With these thoughts running through her mind, she had Xiao Shi and Bao Qin accompany her outside, only to see a maidservant kneeling on the ground, kowtowing towards her rooms.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d She wasn\u2019t some sort of saint, so why was she being worshipped?</p><br/><p>Bao Qin smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly punctual, coming over here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked, perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saved her before, in the fire.\u201d Xiao Shi reminded.</p><br/><p>So it was her. No wonder she came over to pay respects.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, then what\u2019s your name?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked as she walked over. She didn\u2019t want the other to keep kneeling; it felt much too awkward.</p><br/><p>That maidservant lifted her head to see Bai Xiangxiu. Her face had been injured as well, and a red burn scar graced her forehead. It wasn\u2019t very prominent, but it really did affect her beauty. The maidservant\u2019s heart trembled as she pressed her forehead to the ground again. \u201cMadame Xiu, this servant is Xiao Huan and gives many thanks for saving my life. But this servant has caused you to get hurt and is very sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Huan, is it? You didn\u2019t cause my injuries. Get up, child, don\u2019t keep kneeling.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu extended her hand, but the other refused to rise and kept kneeling before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu, please allow this servant to stay by your side and serve you. Even if it\u2019s coarse work outdoors, it\u2019s still fine. This servant has been an orphan since youth, but you were the only one in this world to see me as an actual person.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt that the maidservant was being a tad excessive, but it looked like she was unwilling to take a step back. Since that was the case, she might as well stay. It wasn\u2019t as if Bai Xiangxiu wanted for maids. Moreover, she looked pretty pitiful, and the injury on her face had yet to heal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. Xiao Shi, arrange for her to work in Winter Garden!\u201d When Xiao Huan heard this, she was so moved that she expressed her gratitude again while kneeling. Bai Xiangxiu felt extremely embarrassed as a result and pulled her to her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so polite. Get up and heal your injuries first before going to work! My Winter Garden is small, so I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to squeeze in with someone else.\u201d She didn\u2019t look much older than her teens, around the same age as Xiao Shi. Hearing these words, Xiao Huan was extremely moved and kept thanking her without pause.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt embarrassed by all of this displayed gratitude. Once she\u2019d seen the person off, she brought Xiao Shi and Bao Qin to the bedding and clothing storage. The fire had already reduced the place to ashes, but something seemed a bit off. She stood there looking at the building until she blanked out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi asked, \u201cMistress, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu pointed at the clothing storage. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi observed carefully as well. \u201cWhere is the strangeness?\u201d The conflagration had left an awful aftermath. If not for her mistress\u2019 vigilance, they might\u2019ve burned to death inside already.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis storage used to be two rooms. Everyone knows that there are cotton clothes inside, so naturally no one would build fires indoors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the most probable possibility is that the building caught fire from some flames outside. But it\u2019s the inner room where we keep the bedding that\u2019s been the most thoroughly burnt. That might be where the fire started.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu analyzed as she observed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected Madame Xiu to understand such things as well. Nevertheless, your words are completely accurate.\u201d Long Shuting walked in from behind just in time to catch her words. He never expected a women of the inner chambers to have such insight and correct analysis. The fire had indeed started from that point.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s the head steward.\u201d Why had the head steward come here?</p><br/><p>She really was a beauty. Even when injured, she was still as elegant and lovely as ever. More importantly, she had intelligence as well as looks. No wonder the prince liked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, these signs indicate that this wasn\u2019t an accident after all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But this humble one shall investigate clearly. I ask that Madame Xiu returns to your residence since resting is more important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the matter of the cotton clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis humble one has already sent someone to ask the various shops. I await news at this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, then I\u2019ll have you investigate the cause of this fire!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu knew that there were certain things she couldn\u2019t meddle in, even if she felt indignant. Of course, she was puzzled as well. Why would someone try to burn her to death if she hadn\u2019t ever offended anyone?</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t find the culprit, how was she supposed to stay on in this manor? At the very least, for the sake of her survival, she couldn\u2019t allow such a harmful person to keep lurking by her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu, what kind of person do you think wants to kill Xiao Huan?\u201d Xiao Shi couldn\u2019t help but give vent to her curiosity as they walked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Why was it about killing Xiao Huan? Weren\u2019t they trying to kill her instead?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else could it be but her? Could it be they want to kill you\u2026 oh no!\u201d Xiao Shi gave a start. She didn\u2019t know who had the guts to want to kill Madame Xiu. Even if she was a concubine, she was a mistress of this estate and the prince\u2019s admired, respected woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would anyone want to kill a little maidservant like her? And use so much effort to accomplish the ends? Moreover, they didn\u2019t need to drag me into things just to kill a maidservant; that wouldn\u2019t make sense.\u201d If anyone wanted to kill a maidservant, they\u2019d usually change their plans once they saw Bai Xiangxiu there. But that person hadn\u2019t, which proved they was after her life.</p><br/><p>1. nameless poem () \u2013 the lines in question come from a titleless poem written by Li Shangyin (c.813-858), a poet of the Later Tang Dynasty.</p><br/><p>2.

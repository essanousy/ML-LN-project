After all, even Song Jiaoyue and the female lead had ignored her. In the end, the one to recognize her was the male lead, the one whom she\u2019d feared and actively avoided. Wasn\u2019t this the pinnacle of irony?</p><br/><p>However, what touched her the most was the sense of relief that came after a life and death experience. One often did things that they normally wouldn\u2019t when they were relaxed. For example, Bai Xiangxiu no longer cared whether or not Long Heng would hate the smell coming from her or whether he would enjoy hugging her or not. She willfully believed that since he had recognized her, it was only right for her to cuddle up to him a bit while she was in his arms. She was a girl after all, a woman. And so, Bai Xiangxiu reached out and grabbed onto the hem of Long Heng\u2019s robe with her dirty hands and sobbed without a care for her image.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was actually very worried when he first saw her, but when he saw how she was crying, he knew for sure that she was fine. Except, wasn\u2019t there going to be a hostage exchange? Why was she here alone?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have time to ask her these questions because the woman\u2019s sobbing was completely out of control. He couldn\u2019t even find a chance to speak. He quietly sighed to himself and allowed her to cry her eyes out. It was extremely fortunate that he was so quick with his feet. Otherwise, Bai Xiangxiu would\u2019ve lost both her legs. The only issue now was that his subordinate was now out cold on the floor and seemed to have sustained heavy injuries. A quick wave of his hand, and someone came to carry his subordinate away. </p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue had also recognized Bai Xiangxiu at this point. She was the person that he\u2019d met in the snow roads, but he\u2019d failed to realize who she was. He was able to piece things together now from the situation and since he\u2019d finally taken a closer look at her. It was the weak and delicate Bai Xiangxiu!</p><br/><p>They\u2019d met yesterday, but he\u2019d left her behind in the freezing and snow-covered environment. His heart spasmed painfully when he realized this and regret began to creep over him. Looking at them hug each other, the uncomfortable feeling in his heart grew stronger and stronger. </p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue finally understood why. His feelings towards her were becoming harder and harder to suppress. Right now, the barrier in his heart was barely paper thin. If someone were to pierce a hole in it\u2026 It was at this moment that a voice called out, \u201cSince the person is now in your hands, hand over the minister\u2019s daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Luo Yunzheng returned to the wooden cottage, tall flames had already engulfed it. He\u2019d thought that she\u2019d committed suicide because of her disfigurement. It never even once crossed his mind that she\u2019d managed to escape. However, even if she did escape, how had she manage to find her way here? Did that person or I ever mention where we would be taking her? And I can\u2019t believe that the reputed Long Heng can bear to embrace her when she looks as hideous as that! He\u2019s even using both his hands to hug her waist! He\u2019s certainly quite impressive from a certain angle.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu trembled and burrowed deeper into Long Heng\u2019s arms when she heard his voice. In truth, she wasn\u2019t actually afraid of Luo Yunzheng. She just wanted to get revenge on both of them. Although she felt a bit guilty for using the male lead, he at least needed to know what she\u2019d gone through! She was only going to speak the truth and foil their plans that way. That\u2019ll teach them to think she was easy to bully! She\u2019d nearly died, and now she was suffering from that embarrassing aphrodisiac called the Three Days of Inebriation!</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was truly embarrassing. When she was done crying, her breathing started to hitch as she continued to hug the male lead. Fortunately for her, the male lead hadn\u2019t cleared his mind yet because matters had yet to come to an end. Otherwise, he would surely notice the scent she was emitting. If things are to develop like the original story\u2026 She began to shiver after such a thought.</p><br/><p>How can I possibly tumble in the sheets with the male lead while looking like this? And for an entire day at that too? Bai Xiangxiu herself began to feel bad for the male lead as she mused about this. She wanted to take her leave, but Long Heng wouldn\u2019t let her leave his arms. The thought that she would cause him to lose face didn\u2019t even cross his mind at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to remember you handing her over to me. Looking at the current situation, I don\u2019t even believe that there\u2019s a need for me to conduct a hostage exchange with you. In addition, you don\u2019t seem to have a way out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng laughed softly. \u201cDo you really think you can bar me from leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness. There must be a reason behind their decision to conduct the hostage exchange in this place,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu kindly reminded the male lead. Even though the novel hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about this place, she believed that Luo Yunzheng and Duan Yunying were definitely not folks who wouldn\u2019t keep a contingency plan or two up their sleeve. </p><br/><p>They mentioned something about trading hostages? Had Long Heng really intended to exchange Miss Lin for myself? What is the male lead doing? Was he really exchanging his wife for a concubine? What is this mysterious feeling of being touched? It\u2019s probably better if I don\u2019t overthink it.</p><br/><p>Long Heng gave an order. \u201cServants. Guard them and take them away for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, by \u201cthem\u201d he was referring to Miss Lin and Bai Xiangxiu. It was at this moment when Luo Yunzheng began to laugh like a ruffian. \u201cHold on. You can take that woman away, but Miss Lin will remain here. After all, she doesn\u2019t want to leave with any of you. Isn\u2019t that right, Miss Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi shuddered. The situation had become worse and worse by the second. It was true that she didn\u2019t want to be with Long Heng, but that was only because he didn\u2019t hold an inkling of interest towards her. He wouldn\u2019t even take another look at her if he could help it. And yet, he treated that woman so differently. He still took her into his arms like a treasure even though she looked that hideous now.</p><br/><p>As for her, she\u2019d been raped and her virginity forcefully taken away. And now the culprit was even coming here to take her away by force. Lin Qianzi wanted to shake her head, but she didn\u2019t have enough courage to do so. That man was just too unpredictable. She had no way of knowing what his next step would be. However, she didn\u2019t dare nod either since Long Heng was right there.</p><br/><p>Long Heng sneered and replied, \u201cIf you want her, you can go to the Lin Residence yourself and ask for her. But if you want to snatch her away from my hands\u2026 That\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph. Why bother? Since you already have someone in your arms, I\u2019m sure you can afford to hand over Miss Lin to me. After all, she is my\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Lin Qianzi was flustered. She immediately shouted to interrupt him.</p><br/><p>Is this both loving and hating each other? Bai Xiangxiu suddenly felt a cold glare coming her way just as she was thinking thus. She was taken aback by its sheer vehemence. She moved her line of sight towards Lin Qianzi and wondered just when she had offended this noble lady.</p><br/><p>The ruffian seemed to have noticed Lin Qianzi\u2019s intention to cover up the truth. Because he had been born and raised in the jianghu, the notion of a female\u2019s purity was of far less significance to him. And so, he smirked and responded, \u201cStop thinking about that nonsense and just get over here. What of your little matter? It\u2019s not like that woman in his arms hasn\u2019t been played around with by other men!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Luo Yunzheng was currently surrounded by Long Heng\u2019s men, he still publicly denounced Bai Xiangxiu without mincing his words. He was definitely a bit abnormal in the head. Bai Xiangxiu was flabbergasted. Since when had she been played around with? Moreover, everyone could clearly understand what the man was trying to imply. He wasn\u2019t just talking about Bai Xiangxiu, but implicating Lin Qianzi too.</p><br/><p>The hell? Won\u2019t this just make Long Heng angrier? Isn\u2019t he implying that Long Heng was cuckolded by both his wife and his concubine? Bai Xiangxiu wanted to regain some face for Long Heng. If she was deemed unfaithful in addition to being disfigured by the large wound on her face, the male lead would definitely beat her to death immediately. It wouldn\u2019t even matter if he had a good impression of her.</p><br/><p>Moreover, having been through so much, she didn\u2019t want to be constantly bullied anymore. The whole matter had left a bad taste in her mouth. So, she walked over to Long Heng with her frightening face and looked directly into his livid face to say, \u201cYour Highness. Don\u2019t listen to his nonsense. Your concubine is still clean and untainted.\u201d As her words rang out, she dramatically ripped off her right sleeve. There for everyone was to see, was a bright red chastity dot on her elbow, signifying that she had yet to lose her virginity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

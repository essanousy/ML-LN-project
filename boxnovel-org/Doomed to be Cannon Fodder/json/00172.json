Bai Xiangxiu hadn\u2019t even taken off her undergarments, but was simply wiping herself with water before applying ointment. But this was already an alluring sight to a grown man. Although Yu Sh\u016b himself didn\u2019t understand the meaning of \u2018allure,\u2019 he still couldn\u2019t peel his eyes away. Instead, he just felt like he wanted to look at her longer and hug her again.</p><br/><p>He gulped before seeing big sis turn around. At the same time, he whirled back to look at the moon. Even though he liked looking at the moon in the past, now he thought that big sis\u2019s body looked much prettier. What to do now?</p><br/><p>With difficulty, he waited until Bai Xiangxiu said, \u201cAll right, you can come in now!\u201d</p><br/><p>How would she know that he\u2019d been peeping on her? She was even secretly praising this boy for being very good and obedient. But who knew that the very same child would come in and hug her as soon as he came in, sighing, \u201cBig sis is so soft, so comfy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComfy your head! Come and let me apply medicine to you, you\u2019re injured too.\u201d Because of her injured foot, she couldn\u2019t stand for long periods, so she slowly sat on the bed and pulled at his clothes before picking up the medicine. Yu Sh\u016b only stood there blankly as if he wasn\u2019t injured at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu said somewhat helplessly. She really had no idea what this child was thinking, just staring at her like that.</p><br/><p>Yu Sh\u016b was delighted by these words. His lips drew up into a grin as he really started stripping. Even if he didn\u2019t understand everything, he felt that doing this was the right choice. In contrast, Bai Xiangxiu felt a bit dejected. Why was he so happy to strip when she just wanted him to take off his clothes for medicine?!</p><br/><p>He\u2019d taken off all his clothes on his upper body in the blink of an eye. This was pure, blatant seduction, alright? She thought he was a skinny type, but he was attractive in his own way. More importantly, there were scars engraved on his skin that emanated unusual sex appeal. What to do about that?</p><br/><p>She blushed faintly before she realized something was off, because the other was preparing to take off his pants. Bai Xiangxiu finally couldn\u2019t hold back and grabbed his hand. \u201cNo need to take off any more, this is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Completely enough. If he kept stripping, she was going to fall apart, all right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an injury.\u201d Yu Sh\u016b used his most innocent voice to reply, as if he really was injured down there.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if there\u2019s an injury, we can\u2019t put medicine there.\u201d This went too counter to basic principles. She was someone with a husband, after all.</p><br/><p>Yu Sh\u016b actually gave Bai Xiangxiu an extremely aggrieved look before she pulled him by the arm and spun him around. The next thing he knew, a gentle hand was applying what felt like fire to his back, each scalding touch causing him to tremble. This was a very strange feeling, but very comfortable as well. When Bai Xiangxiu finished and took a look at Yu Sh\u016b, his cheeks had turned red just like he\u2019d been bullied.</p><br/><p>She gave a light cough before silently turning to the side. That kind of look, coupled with his appearance, made it impossible for anyone to abandon him. It was like a little puppy. How it made one\u2019s heart soften, how it made him that much more likeable!</p><br/><p>But she still knew that this kind of \u2018like\u2019 wasn\u2019t anything like love. Instead, he\u2019d stirred up her maternal instincts, which was why she\u2019d done everything to save him at the critical moment. \u201cPut on your clothes, don\u2019t catch a chill.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was best not to travel at night, but they couldn\u2019t light a fire either. They could rest here until morning to continue their journey. Hopefully, Yu Kuang would return by then. By her observation, the wounds on his body were just about healed by now. He should be able to take her somewhere with civilization!</p><br/><p>However, it\u2019d be hard enough passing through this night. Bai Xiangxiu told Yu Sh\u016b, \u201cYou go sleep on the bed first.\u201d She decided to keep watch in case someone caught up to them!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, I want to hold onto big sis and sleep. Big sis is soft.\u201d Yu Sh\u016b wasn\u2019t Yu Kuang, so his killing move was to act cute.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu gave him a shove and said in a serious tone, \u201cDon\u2019t move, go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Sh\u016b ignored her and kept acting spoiled. In the end, Bai Xiangxiu had no choice but to lie next to him because he needed to rest from his injuries. With this, Yu Sh\u016b was happy. He could hug his big sis to sleep.</p><br/><p>But the next morning, Yu Kuang wasn\u2019t happy at all waking up hugging the woman again. Originally, he thought that he could let this woman and her husband be if they were living so happily together. But this morning, he discovered that not only were they lying together, their clothes were even a bit disheveled. Don\u2019t tell him that nothing had happened this time.</p><br/><p>As expected, the startled awake Bai Xiangxiu recognized him at first glance and said, \u201cNothing happened between us last night, either.\u201d If there was anyone to blame, it was that Yu Sh\u016b for being too mischievous and insisting that they sleep together.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her head. Last night she\u2019d lasted until half the night before somehow falling asleep herself. Fortunately, no enemies had arrived, or else they would\u2019ve been assassinated in their sleep. Yu Kuang noticed her body full of injuries and said, \u201cClean up a bit. We\u2019ll set off for the capital as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know what she needed to clean up. They didn\u2019t have any food after all, only something to drink. She used the water to brush through her hair before feeling she should give it all to return to the capital. Wasn\u2019t it just traveling quickly, in the end?</p><br/><p>But as soon as she left the house, she gave a start. As far as she could see were snow-covered mountains. It really was very beautiful. Nowadays, it was impossible to see such white snow in the modern world, nor snowy landscapes like this one.</p><br/><p>She reached out a hand to catch the falling snowflakes and saw that they were indeed as gorgeous as the ones drawn in books. Mother Nature was so magical and mysterious, creating things like this as pretty as a picture. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t know that she was the beauty in tha instant, and a rarely-seen beauty at that. Even if she looked a little wretched, the snowfall only made her that much more dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu heard someone answering her and turned back to reply. But the other didn\u2019t answer, instead choosing to look at the drifting snowflakes. Oh, so he thinks the snow is beautiful too.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon for the offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was about to ask how he was offending her when he took her into his arms. In her moment of shock, the other had already bounded out into the snow-covered landscape at a dizzyingly fast pace. Finally, Bai Xiangxiu realized what she should have prepared for. Those chilly winds cut painfully across her face and sent her ordered hair all into a mess.</p><br/><p>This really was a rather crude way of rushing on their journey. But she had to admit that they were indeed traveling very fast. Moreover, she noticed that there really existed people who could walk on snow without leaving any footprints behind! Each patch of ground they glided over showed no hints of their passage. Sometimes there was some snow blown aside, but they were like the smoke trails of an airplane, at most.</p><br/><p>It really was very pretty. If there was time, she\u2019d like to have Long Heng run around like this with her in his arms for fun. But after further thought, she realized he\u2019d never do something like this because he\u2019d be too worried of scaring her instead! They were almost at the capital, and he was getting closer to marrying the female lead. Actually, she felt that this period of time had passed by rather well. At least she didn\u2019t have the time to think about his matters. But she\u2019d have to face it once she returned. When Bai Xiangxiu reached that point in her thoughts, she suddenly felt an urge to flee instead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

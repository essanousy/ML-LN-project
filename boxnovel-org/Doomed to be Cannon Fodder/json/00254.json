Sex is all they ever think about. Naturally, a woman has no choice but to use her body as a weapon. They will do your every bid as long as you conquer them with your body. Am I so often hurt by men because I still cling to feelings and love? If only I was like Su Yun\u2026 She\u2019s always the one hurting others. After a night\u2019s rest, Lin Qianzi knew that she\u2019d never be able to return to the luxurious life of an imperial noble lady. I wouldn\u2019t have listened to the palace maids and followed their instructions if I\u2019d known that things would end in this way. I also never expected that Luo Yunzheng would show up like that. </p><br/><p>Come to think of it, why did he suddenly appear? Does he have some sort of relationship with that Bai Xiangxiu? Haha! I knew that wretched woman isn\u2019t as loyal as she seemed! Men surely flock around her, even if she wants to be loyal. There are clearly all kinds of men surrounding her at all times. I kind of pity Long Heng if that\u2019s the case. He must be wearing innumerable green hats on his head due to the countless times he was cucked!</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was now a little delirious and blabbed whatever she was thinking. She immediately slammed her hand on the locked door of her prison and yelled with a hoarse voice, \u201cBai Xiangxiu you wretched woman! Luo Yunzheng only ignored me because you seduced him! And also Commander Lu! And that strategist! It was because of your beauty that one decided to throw his sister-in-law to the wolves, while the other willingly died for you! You\u2019re an evil jinx! Long Heng would\u2019ve been mine if it weren\u2019t for you! MINE!\u201d Lin Qianzi screamed for the entire night and shrieked all sorts of obscenities at Bai Xiangxiu. </p><br/><p>The servants wanted to report this matter, but the old madame was now fast asleep, cuddling the young prince in her bosom. They couldn\u2019t wake the old madame up as they were not allowed to wake the young prince up under any circumstance. The situation at the Apricot Garden was even worse. It was said that action was still fast and furious there. They\u2019d be diced into a million pieces if they were to interrupt the prince now! Having no other choice, they could only wait until the prince was satisfied before they went to knock on the door. However, they had to wait until after midnight before the occupants in the room asked for water to be sent into the room.</p><br/><p>The servants were feeling all sorts of jealousy. Your Highness, why are you so energetic when you\u2019re injured? This is too much! Who was the person who\u2019d been carried out this morning eh? We\u2019re all so confused!</p><br/><p>One of the servants entered and reported on the ruckus that Lin Qianzi was making. Long Heng nodded his head and had them take their leave. After that, he picked the exhausted clump of mud that was Bai Xiangxiu and tossed her into the bath. After a little scrub here and there, he laid her down onto the newly made bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go and take a look at her before I take a bath and join you in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Don\u2019t spoil the goods or it\u2019ll be a tough sale\u2026 so tired\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu tugged on the blankets to cover her bare body and dozed off to sleep. Long Heng had no choice but to help Bai Xiangxiu dress before heading to where Lin Qianzi was imprisoned. She was still banging on the door and screaming abuse when he arrived. Long Heng grunted derisively and ordered the guards to open the door.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was shocked to see Long Heng when the guards opened the doors. She\u2019d never quite imagined that such a stern looking man was actually someone who was very protective of his woman. He\u2019d even protected Bai Xiangxiu in front of the emperor by covering her eyes so that the unsightly scene wouldn\u2019t enter her eyes. And yet, Lin Qianzi had been cast aside like a dog. Nobody had bothered to pay her any attention, let alone care about her. It was at this moment when she also realized that she wanted a man who genuinely cared for and protected her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, it was my fault for not seeing who you truly were before. I shouldn\u2019t have ran away, nor should I have given her the chance to get closer to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm? That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. I should be thanking you.\u201d Long Heng looked almost like a deity under the illumination of the moon. Because he\u2019d just done the deed, there was a aura of sexiness wreathing him, making women fall under his spell. It was only now that Lin Qianzi realized that Prince Li was scary only in the rumors, but was actually a very handsome man in reality. His dominance and wit made him a reliable figure that every woman pined for in her heart. \u201cYour Highness, my feelings towards you was always different from other women. It\u2019s a pity that we were fated to meet but never to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you something. That woman must\u2019ve arranged things with Luo Yunzheng to set me up during the autumn hunt. Otherwise, why would he appear so coincidentally at that particular place? It was a setup to make me look bad in front of everyone while she cucks you behind your back. Luo Yunzheng is a lecher skilled in martial arts. Heavens know what they\u2019ve done behind your back before she came into the Prince Li Manor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>SLAP! Lin Qianzi was flung into the wall with that slap to her face. It took her some time before she came to terms with what had just happened. \u201cYour Highness, you must believe me! That woman has definitely slept with men other than you! How can she not when she looks as pretty as\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, cut off her tongue,\u201d Long Heng immediately turned around and left. He no longer wanted to listen to her nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness! How can you do this to me?! I was to be your wife! I had already been escorted to your manor and would\u2019ve been your princess consort if it wasn\u2019t for that bastard Luo Yunzheng!\u201d Lin Qianzi kept on struggling. It was her first time trying to get into Long Heng\u2019s good shoes, but he just wouldn\u2019t pay her any attention. However, Long Heng suddenly turned around when she was beginning to despair. He\u2019d forgotten about all the humiliation he\u2019d faced during that time, but the memories quickly came back when she reminded him of it.</p><br/><p>He laughed derisively. \u201cI\u2019ve come back to see them carry out my orders. This should be quite entertaining.\u201d Someone placed a chair beside him almost immediately after he waved his hand. He was more than happy to witness this bloody scene, even though he was quite tired after putting in half a night\u2019s worth of back breaking labor and his wounds were aching a little.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi looked like she wanted to say something, but two men with fast hands were already holding her jaw open. Another man walked over with a knife in his hands. It was at this moment when Lin Qianzi finally realized that Long Heng was being serious. They really were going to cut off her tongue. </p><br/><p>\u201cAaaa!! No! Ahh\u2026!\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t seem to care no matter how much she struggled. It was like he was just looking at a very interesting theater show. He just stood there watching as his men held Lin Qianzi down and was about to cut her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A glimmer of relief appeared in Lin Qianzi\u2019s eyes. If Long Heng were to spare her today, she would choose to be by his side forever, even if it meant that she would have to be a concubine. Unfortunately for her\u2026 </p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cut too deep. Men will probably want to hear her moan in bed. It won\u2019t be as satisfying if she\u2019s mute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants were dumbfounded. They\u2019d almost thrown the knife away when Long Heng told them to stop. Your Highness, does the princess consort know that you\u2019re such a violent pervert?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quick! This prince still intends to get some rest!\u201d Long Heng yelled his orders while waving his hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi could feel her heart skip a beat. Soon after that, all she could feel was cold hard steel running through her tongue, which was quickly followed by warm blood spraying all over her own face. She covered her mouth with her hands and kept on screaming in horror while writhing on the floor. She kept swallowing her own blood because the wound seemed to bleed endlessly. In the end, she blacked out due to either pain, fear, blood loss, or maybe even a combination of all three.</p><br/><p>Long Heng seemed undisturbed as he was already used to seeing such things. A blood-filled scene was said to bring out the hidden beast within a man, and he seemed to find some truth in that saying. He was feeling a little thirsty for something. He quickly made his way towards Apricot Garden after giving the servants an order to keep Lin Qianzi alive.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was still deep in slumber when someone suddenly came and tugged her blanket away. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked drowsily while looking at Long Heng with droopy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d Long Heng quickly removed his clothes and slipped into bed. He didn\u2019t even bother waiting for Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s permission before starting round number two.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

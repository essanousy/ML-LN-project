He whipped her ten more times, until her clothes were all hanging in rags. Blood slowly seeped out of her wounds. Bai Xiangxiu finally couldn\u2019t endure the pain any longer and let out a quiet yelp.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu was satisfied when he heard that sign of pain. He put away the whip and laughed. \u201cAre you ready to talk now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to say. Can\u2019t you be a little more forthright!? Be a real man, not like a damned indecisive old woman!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was heady with rage after suffering through the beating. She didn\u2019t know why she was so angry either, most likely because the man in front of had such a rage-inducing expression. Who was he to act all high and mighty? Bai Xiangxiu was determined to go against him. Even if she bore no feelings for the country itself, there was no way she would stand for it when outsiders looked down on her husband\u2019s country. Especially not when her husband was a prince of said country!</p><br/><p>Commander Lu was very much impressed. Despite her feeble-looking appearance, she had so much more backbone than other men. She continued to stubbornly glare at the commander without a hint of cowardice in her eyes, even though her body was covered with wounds. This was a rare kind of woman, and one found even rarer on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>A commotion started outside while the two locked gazes. Someone skidded to a halt outside and yelled. \u201cGeneral! The woman has run off after grabbing the child! What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChase after her, and take the child back from her hands!\u201d Commander Lu immediately broke off the staring contest to chase after Lin Qianzi. It seemed that he was concerned about the child after all.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately tested the rope on her wrist after he left. The bindings were very firm; there was almost no way for her to free herself. But she wasn\u2019t just anyone. She\u2019d been baptized by all sorts of modern television shows since childhood, which was why she was well-prepared for a situation such as this. She took a second to peer around for any watchers before lifting her legs.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d learned a little bit of the art of body bending, thanks to Long Heng. She raised her feet up into the air and slowly walked up a metal pillar directly in front of her. She then reached for her ankles and pulled out a tiny dagger she\u2019d previously hidden there. Her waist almost felt like it would snap in half. She released the tension in her body, bringing her feet down. Clutching the dagger between her hands, she began to saw on the ropes. She didn\u2019t know when someone would come in again, so she ground the tiny blade against the rope with feverish haste. In her rush, she cut herself by mistake, but paid it no mind. She freed herself from her bindings not long after, and quietly snuck out of the room.</p><br/><p>There were guards outside, but they were too busy looking outwards rather than paying attention to the door. Noticing that this was her chance, Bai Xiangxiu hid herself in the shadows and slowly started to make her way to the outskirts of the camp. Halfway through her journey, she suddenly heard the sound of a child crying.</p><br/><p>She was incredibly sensitive to the sounds of children crying as a new mother. Instinctively, she decided to take a look instead of continuing with her escape. Lin Qianzi was currently being dragged back to the army camp with her child still in her arms. She screamed while crying, \u201cPlease let us go! Let us go home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoman, I would\u2019ve killed you already if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that you had something with my brother. Hand the child over or face the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This is my child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab the child from her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! I beg you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t dare move an inch. She hid behind a wooden cart and watched the commotion from afar. She decided to make her escape as soon as the coast was clear. All of a sudden, the child was flung into the air in the midst of the struggle. It was unknown whether it was due to a slip of a hand or if it\u2019d been done on purpose to protect her child.</p><br/><p>You have GOT to be kidding me! Now you\u2019ve done it! You\u2019ve gone and implicated that poor innocent child in your fight! For better or worse, the child had been tossed in the direction of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hiding spot. She gritted her teeth and leaped towards the child to try and catch him, foregoing her hiding spot.</p><br/><p>She reached out as she leaped, trying to catch him. But fate was a cruel and unforgiving mistress as Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s outstretched fingers missed the child by a hair\u2019s breadth. The injuries from her whipping had crippled her usually nimble feet, and the child had simply been too far from her hiding spot. The child\u2019s head cracked on the edge of a weapons rack as he hit the ground with a thud. His clothes had yet to settle from the fall before his breath left his body forever.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could feel her heart freeze over. She dropped to her knees next to the child, cradling him in her arms. However, the beautiful child\u2019s head was already drenched in blood. He had already passed on.</p><br/><p>Time seemed to stand still as everyone froze in shock, including Bai Xiangxiu. Of everyone present, she was the most clear of the place a child held in a mother\u2019s heart. She lifted her head to gaze at Lin Qianzi when she realized the child has passed waway. It took almost every ounce of courage to tell her the truth. \u201cHe\u2026 is gone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? WHAT DID YOU SAY?!\u201d Lin Qianzi\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and her voice turned hoarse as she screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has passed away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 Impossible\u2026 my child\u2026 my child\u2026\u201d Lin Qianzi began sobbing uncontrollably. Beside her, Commander Lu was incredibly furious and frustrated. He gave Lin Qianzi a tight slap and yelled, \u201cStop crying! What use are you if the child is gone!? Send her to the pleasure camp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you do this to me? No matter what, I\u2019m still your brother\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s what? You\u2019re nothing! Didn\u2019t you say that the child wasn\u2019t his? And that you had no relationship with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cW-we\u2026 Please, just don\u2019t send me to the pleasure camp! Why isn\u2019t she coming with me? It\u2019s her! She\u2019s the one who worked together with Long Heng to murder your younger brother!\u201d Lin Qianzi pointed at Bai Xiangxiu like a crazy woman. Hatred was writ clear over her face. \u201cShe could\u2019ve caught my child, but she didn\u2019t! She did it on purpose! She murdered my son on purpose!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu slowly and gently laid the child on the ground. Even in death, the child looked very cute, hints of soft gentleness in the curves of his cheeks. Based on looks alone, there was a possibility that the father truly wasn\u2019t Duan Yunying, as he did bear some resemblance to Luo Yunzheng. Yet, the identity of the child\u2019s father no longer mattered in the face of such a tragedy. An innocent soul had been lost over a petty fight. There was a possibility that he could\u2019ve grown up to become the enemy nation\u2019s prince had the female lead not resisted or tried to take him back. Now, the only possible future for the child was to be buried in the freezing cold soil.</p><br/><p>What was worse, even during such a grief-stricken circumstance, the female lead was trying to drag Bai Xiangxiu down with her. Did she spare no thought for consequences? Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s rage birthed as a candle and rapidly grew into a firestorm that thrummed through her veins. She accepted that her death was inevitable anyway, now that Commander Lu knew she\u2019d had a hand in his brother\u2019s murder. Emboldened by her rage and acceptance of her fate, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t run or hide, instead lifting the child with the utmost gentleness, cradling him softly in her arms. She raised her head and walked over to Lin Qianzi. \u201cIt was his bad luck to be born as your son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? What the hell did you say to me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I intend to say. At the very least, my son knows who his true parents are. But yours? If you hadn\u2019t strayed or hesitated back then, there\u2019d be no mix up of his true father today. This tragic turn of events could\u2019ve been avoided altogether.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have no right to lecture me! Why would I have been captured if you and Long Heng hadn\u2019t murdered him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell? Do you not have a brain to use? Let me tell you something. If you\u2019d obediently gotten married to Long Heng as per the arrangement instead of seducing men left right and center, you\u2019d be a princess consort living in the prince\u2019s manor. You wouldn\u2019t have come within miles of this place today! But no, you had to hate on Long Heng on one side and protect Luo Yunzheng on the other. And as you wished, Luo Yunzheng decided to devote his heart and mind to you! He even rescued you from your wedding and decided to retire from the jianghu. He even looked for houses to live a secluded and peaceful life with you! But you didn\u2019t have the heart to appreciate any of that! You just had to avenge Duan Yunying after hearing that he was dead. The question before you now isn\u2019t \u2018Are you a cheap whore?\u2019, it\u2019s \u201cHow much of a cheap whore are you?\u201d. Even the holy mother would frown at the sight of you! With one thing after the other, you\u2019ve done nothing but inflict harm on these men! Men have feelings too alright? They are made of flesh and bone, just like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could no sooner stop the flow of words from her mouth once she started than she could rebuild a dam. Every injustice that Luo Yunzheng had poured out to her when drunk came back to her. She\u2019d genuinely wanted to strangle that female lead back then. But here and now, holding Lin Qianzi\u2019s child in her arms, Bai Xiangxiu gave vent to everything she\u2019d been holding back for so long, giving the female lead a long awaited piece of her mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He never could understand this drive to climb the social ladder. But his wife and daughter threw such a tantrum that finally, Bai Xiangxiu was released to go to the Prince Li Manor. That\u2019s how it started. But no one foresaw the consequences.</p><br/><p>This gentleman must be Sir An. Why is he dropping by so suddenly? She soon found out, as Bai Rong\u2019er charged in with two old biddies, harping at him, \u201cSir An, you mustn\u2019t be so impetuous!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she went in, Bai Rong\u2019er took note of the face of everyone present. Although scared, she thought back to what that tavern elder sister had said: What good is it letting your elder sister play matchmaker? You might as well put on a good show in front of everyone. That way, Sir Song will know your elder sister\u2019s true character and will be moved by your \u201cjustice above all\u201d behavior. You\u2019ll be accorded with utmost honor when he comes to ask for your hand in marriage. Bai Rong\u2019er was na\u00efve and believed every word without reservation, and so had sacrificed ties of blood for self assumed righteousness.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu delicately pressed down on her temple with her finger. \u201cCarry on with the ceremony,\u201d she commanded the matchmaker. Her voice wasn\u2019t all that loud, but it fell on everyone\u2019s ears like velvet over steel. One had to take a moment to remind that Bai Xiangxiu had actually commanded troops on the battlefield. So when she spoke with a certain tone of voice, the matchmaker unconsciously leaped to obey, \u201cOf course. The first bow is to the heavens and earth\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Long Heng\u2019s mouth jerked up, as if he hadn\u2019t seen the new arrivals, and he pulled Bai Xiangxiu down and knelt in obeisance.</p><br/><p>Bai Rong\u2019er and Sir An were shocked. This wasn\u2019t how they\u2019d previously imagined the situation would develop. Wasn\u2019t it said that if a man hears this kind of talk, he\u2019d seek more information and prolong the wedding? What were they doing, going through with the ceremony!? They were showing complete disregard for the newcomers! These two conspirators were both young and inexperienced, and so were completely nonplussed at being treated like air.</p><br/><p>Soon enough, Bai Rong\u2019er was distraught. While everyone\u2019s attention was elsewhere, she kicked Sir An to make him seek help from the seated Old Madame.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, a hand descended on Sir An\u2019s shoulder right at that moment. It held him fast, preventing him from walking forward to seek his justice from the old madame. When he turned to look at the offending party, the sight of a finely dressed gentleman greeted him. However, the latter\u2019s expression was as cold as a winter\u2019s night, sending a chill down Sir An\u2019s spine. Bai Rong\u2019er however, was instantly smitten. She\u2019d seen Song Jiaoyue at last! She hadn\u2019t expected him to be wearing a different outfit for this occasion, but it only added to his charm.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Sir An was no woman to be entranced by a man\u2019s looks. He paused briefly, subdued. Yet, he still turned to the old madame, \u201cOld Madame, Prince Li, I come from the An family. I am the fianc\u00e9 of the Bai family\u2019s eldest daughter, Bai Xiangxiu. But it seems that today, she has broken faith to wed another. Mayhaps this was something you were not made aware of, but it still remains a violation of propriety. As such, I request your consideration in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second bow is to your parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was almost afraid to look up at the old madame during her bow. Would the old madame suddenly take charge of the situation and announce that there was no need to continue with the ceremony?</p><br/><p>But the old madame didn\u2019t move at Sir An\u2019s supplication. Not one blink. Bai Xiangxiu felt her entire body relax. Unhindered by the charade, the ceremony continued in solemn silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third bow to each other as husband and wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the last bow. Let\u2019s see who can stop us now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn imperial edict has arrived!\u201d A shrill voice shattered the silence, startling everyone present. Bai Xiangxiu nearly burst into tears. Wasn\u2019t she just getting married again in another location? Was it that hard to just leave her alone, just for today? She sighed, already beginning to turn to receive the imperial edict. Right then, Long Heng reached for her hand, stopping her. She met his eyes, and he bowed to her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s eyes went wide. Without a second\u2019s hesitation, she too bowed to him. Deep in her bow, her heart was surging. It was only a simple bow, but in that moment, she found meaning in those words she had always heard but never truly understood.</p><br/><p>A husband and wife pair truly stood apart from others.</p><br/><p>Perhaps their resolve was infectious, or the matchmaker knew her duty well, but as the new husband and wife bowed, she exclaimed, \u201cThe ceremony has concluded!\u201d Just those four words.</p><br/><p>At those four words, Long Heng rose from his bow, speaking to his aide, \u201cReward her for her service\u201d. He held his hand out to his brand new wife, walking forward together to receive the imperial edict. </p><br/><p>It really had been a topsy-turvy wedding, but for some reason, the display of grace and resolve from the bride and groom had been profoundly moving. This was particularly the case for Song Jiaoyue. The force of his hand squeezing Sir An;s shoulder made the later cry out in pain. Now that those two were husband and wife, it was time to give up on his intentions!</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Song, I\u2019m Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s little sister. Are you alright?\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er wanted to emphasize her presence, but the other didn\u2019t even glance in her direction. He too went straight up to receive the imperial edict.</p><br/><p>Everyone knelt on the floor as a eunuch loudly read the proclamation. Flowery words aside, the gist of it was that there were other complications with Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s marriage. Therefore they should halt proceedings for the time being until everything was cleared up. </p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s lip curved up in a sneer as he received the edict. \u201cEunuch, let me trouble you to go back and report to His Majesty not to worry about this matter. The ceremony has already concluded. Since His Majesty has already decreed Miss Bai to be Princess Consort Li, the matter cannot be changed no matter what. She will always be Princess Consort Li, wedding ceremony or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eunuch\u2019s mouth twitched. Clearly, when he\u2019d entered, the ceremony had not been concluded yet, but he also couldn\u2019t say that they had defied the edict. They had just delayed in receiving the edict. And thanks to the imperial edict being delayed two hours, even the emperor couldn\u2019t do anything now. So, he\u2019d come too late? The emperor had obviously wanted him to take full advantage of all the people and the resulting commotion in announcing the imperial decree.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s verbal instructions were for me to wait here while the various families sorted everything out, and only then report back with the edict.\u201d The eunuch was dispirited. He really didn\u2019t want to hang around here.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare a seat!\u201d Long Heng had barely opened his mouth before the servants had already arranged a seat for the eunuch. Then, Long Heng and Bai Xiangxiu sat as well. Long Heng\u2019s smile was chilly. \u201cBring them forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so Sir An and Bai Rong\u2019er were brought forward. Once there, they felt rather gloomy. It felt like they\u2019d been hauled before the authorities for a crime instead of coming to air a grievance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. If you don\u2019t speak clearly, you\u2019ll be turned over to the authorities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sir An dropped to his knees with a loud thud as Long Heng\u2019s words hung in the air. He even kowtowed to Long Heng. \u201cYour\u2026 Your Highness,\u201d his voice trembled. \u201cMy family name is An. I\u2019m a scholar by trade. Last year Uncle Bai was drinking at my home when\u2026 when he promised, to marry his eldest daughter to me as a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t comment, indicating he should continue.</p><br/><p>Sir An had no choice but to go on. \u201cBut she coveted wealth and rank, and backed out of our arrangement to enter the prince\u2019s residence. How can Your Highness take such a fickle, untrustworthy woman as your wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you suggest?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one dared interrupt Long Heng. For some reason, Bai Rong\u2019er, also kneeling on the ground, felt that this brother-in-law of hers was really quite alluring. Such aloof behavior with power and influence really seemed to make a man stately and charming.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was quite handsome himself, but he lacked that domineering edge. And so as she drifted off into her own world, her heart was faltering, uncertain who she should choose. If, if elder sister was expelled from the manor because of this matter, might she have a chance to marry into the manor herself?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was watching everything like a disinterested bystander, observing the changing expressions of the guests and Bai Rong\u2019er ruminations. However, her heart clenched when she saw her younger sister\u2019s covetous gaze on Xiangxiu\u2019s own husband!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

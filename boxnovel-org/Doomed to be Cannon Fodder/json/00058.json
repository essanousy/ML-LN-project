Typically, he didn\u2019t like to see the rest of them. Sometimes even the gifts they sent would be tossed out as well.</p><br/><p>Recently, she\u2019d angered the prince because of Madame Bai, so she expected that Madame Bai would either cause her difficulty this time, or that the prince would chase her away! Still, she was the daughter of a merchant and skilled in schemes, so she smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare have Fourth Madame come out and personally receive me. The prince is our highest priority. How is his injury doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMuch better. Senior Madame, please come in.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu treated her as a savior as she hastened to welcome her inside.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the male lead reverted to his persona from the novel as soon as the senior madame entered the room. His expression was impassive as he simply raised an eyebrow at the senior madame paying her respects. \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor issue, so what are you doing peeking here and poking there? Go back and stay in your courtyard; don\u2019t run about all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rightrightright, this is the male lead\u2019s normal personality! Utterly unfeeling towards his concubines, he neither listened nor asked about them. In the end though, he\u2019d set them free. Actually, he couldn\u2019t be blamed for being so cold blooded. It had been Old Madame who\u2019d brought these women home, so he naturally had to make some sacrifices for the sake of loving the female lead! Thus, he\u2019d chosen to sacrifice these women. Actually, they could still marry again after being sent away. It was just that they couldn\u2019t bear to leave the prince\u2019s estate, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>The senior madame immediately felt her face burn with humiliation. She cautiously replied, \u201cYour Highness, this concubine only heard that the Fourth Madame hasn\u2019t been sleeping well these past days, so I wanted to see her. I didn\u2019t run about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never knew you two had such good sisterly relations.\u201d As he spoke, he glanced towards Madame Bai, whose face was full of surprise. She too, didn\u2019t seem aware of when her relations with the senior madame had grown so warm.</p><br/><p>Long Heng inwardly shook his head. This Madame Bai really was too simple. If she tried to scheme against these women, she\u2019d probably be devoured until there was nothing left. For better or worse, he was her man, so he should protect her a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, little Fourth Sister is a very likeable person. Who in this estate doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her?\u201d Praising the currently powerful Madame Bai was also a way to leave a good impression with the prince.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, Long Heng\u2019s mood really did improve after hearing her praise. He liked hearing others compliment Madame Bai, and even felt an inexplicable sense of pride. Even he wasn\u2019t sure what was up with that.</p><br/><p>But he was still vexed by this woman acting as a hindrance, so he curtly said, \u201cI know. If you really want to help her, then take care of Liu Dajia\u2019s matters!\u201d When he finished, he looked at Madame Bai. She\u2019d been assisting the old madame with household duties, so she had had a certain amount of authority. How would she feel if it was snatched out of her hands?</p><br/><p>This was a good way to sound her out, but he discovered that the expression of the person in question didn\u2019t even flicker. Instead, she seemed to think that it was great news for someone else to help out, so there was no need to fight for anything at all. He really was trying to pick a quarrel when there was none. He shouldn\u2019t have tried to sound Madame Bai out when her heart had long been pure enough to make him set aside all his worries.</p><br/><p>The senior madame was naturally happy to suddenly receive an errand. She\u2019d been a thoroughly idle person ever since she\u2019d arrived to this estate. It was obvious that a new estate needed people to manage all sorts of affairs, but Old Madame was firm and staunch in her cautiousness and didn\u2019t call on any of the new concubines to help out. In the end, she finally decided to cultivate an assistant, but it wasn\u2019t the senior madame.</p><br/><p>Hearing the prince\u2019s instructions, she agreed to take care of Liu Daijia\u2019s matters without bothering to see whether Madame Bai was willing or not.</p><br/><p>Liu Dajia\u2019s matter was neither simple nor complicated. He used to be a former subordinate of Long Heng\u2019s father. He\u2019d continued following Long Heng throughout the years, so when the family properties were split up into this prince\u2019s estate, he came along too.</p><br/><p>Because he\u2019d gotten used to being raised in the prince\u2019s estate during the past couple of years, he\u2019d grown boastful. Add to that the fact that his sons managed various things in the estate, he\u2019d become further unbridled and unscrupulous to boot.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d receive his monthly stipend even if he didn\u2019t do anything. When he did, he would buy alcohol instead of giving it to his wife and children. Moreover, the older he grew, the more muddleheaded he became. A man who was over fifty years old still went to dinner parties with singsong girls and even brought back a girl from the brothel to be his concubine.</p><br/><p>Liu Daijia\u2019s wife used to be the old madame\u2019s servant girl. When she saw that he was growing old and disreputable, she\u2019d brought along her servant girl to report to the old madame. The old madame felt that it was inconvenient for her to manage this affair, so she\u2019d handed it off to Bai Xiangxiu. Bai Xiangxiu found it difficult as well, so she\u2019d been furrowing her brows that morning when she fed Long Heng porridge. Long Heng had pried the details from her after some questioning, and promptly passed the difficult task onto the senior madame to handle.</p><br/><p>The senior madame didn\u2019t care about the difficulty of the task she\u2019d received. She was still young, around 16 to 17 years old. How could she compare to Bai Xiangxiu, who\u2019d read countless books in the modern world and was capable of keeping her composure? Thus, after she received this errand, the news spread around the estate till everyone knew about it. Some people were jealous, while others found it odd. Still others poured themselves a cup of tea and waited to watch the show.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was one of those waiting for the show to start. She was currently drinking tea and wondering how the senior madame would handle the matter.</p><br/><p>This Liu Daijia wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. Every time he opened his mouth, it was to talk about Long Heng\u2019s father. When forced to a corner, he\u2019d start cursing randomly, so an impatient person or someone not used to those situations would find it difficult to handle him. If you did decide to rebut his words, the people outside might say the prince\u2019s household couldn\u2019t tolerate their old subordinates or something similar. Then they\u2019d be accused of not showing benevolence towards former subordinates.</p><br/><p>However, it was impossible to coax Madame Liu to intervene either. Moreover, if she went to stir up trouble with the old madame, the old madame would definitely be unhappy. So, Bai Xiangxiu turned her attention to the man lying on the bed with his black hair draped all over. Is he helping me?</p><br/><p>Actually, he was well worth a second look like this. His coldly handsome face seemed extremely serious and respectable with his hair done up, but when it was loose, he was rather bewitching. This was especially true when he lifted his head time and time again to reveal the sliver of warmth within those fathomless eyes.</p><br/><p>Ah\u2026</p><br/><p>Had she been staring at him for a long time? Her face quietly flushed before she bent her head and continued with her embroidery, but it was too late. Long Heng had long discovered her secretly spying on him. His heart felt anxious as well, so it was only after she lowered her head that he asked, \u201cIf it was you, how would you deal with Liu Daijia\u2019s matter?\u201d Technically, he shouldn\u2019t ask too much about internal household affairs, but he was very curious about her views.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.haven\u2019t thought it through yet.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu spoke truthfully, though her words were so unenthused that it turned her face a bit red.</p><br/><p>Long Heng laughed, the sound akin to the ice disappearing and the snow melting away. Even Bai Xiangxiu, who never thought she was the lovestruck type, felt dazzled. Fortunately she wasn\u2019t poking her needle downwards when he smiled, or else she\u2019d definitely have stabbed her own finger instead.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s heart warmed at the sight of her coy self that he actually threw back the covers to get off the bed, hoping to walk to her side. If he could touch her blushing face, he was sure that vivid skin would be a very comfortable sensation.</p><br/><p>But as soon as he stood up, his brows wrinkled. Bai Xiangxiu also rose to her feet in a rush and shouted for Shu\u2019er. The prince couldn\u2019t get off the bed during his recuperation other than to relieve himself or something similar. Still, he needed Shu\u2019er to help him with that as well. After calling for Shu\u2019er, she hurriedly withdrew. Her own rooms had an inner chamber that was used for washing her face, rinsing her mouth, and for convenience\u2019s sake at night. It was only separated by a folding screen though, so she had to hide away in a side room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

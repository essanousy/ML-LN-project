This lady was truly too honest. That was good. It meant that she probably wouldn\u2019t have any ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi\u2019s head couldn\u2019t be any lower that it was right then. She whispered, \u201cNo need. No need. It was purely an accident. Right, mother?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Lin could tell this mistress was a wimp. Sadly, the price they paid to find out was quite heavy. Plus, the words of that little bitch from the prince\u2019s household had pushed this beyond the limits of reasonableness. If she kept pushing for punishment, it would only ruin her own daughter\u2019s name. Therefore, she spoke up, \u201cForget it. Our Lin residence can afford this kind of loss. And like my daughter said, it was an accident. My daughter is so kind hearted and tolerant\u2026 even to servants.\u201d She waved her hand to show it was alright, but it was all an act. Little did she expect the old madame to take advantage of this situation.</p><br/><p>The old madame smiled and said, \u201cMadame Lin and Miss Lin are the ones who are generous and kind. If we continue talking about compensations, this will ruin the friendly atmosphere. How about it, n\u00e9e Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old madame is so evil hearted. But that sentence is aptly spoken. I like it a lot! But she didn\u2019t like the following line, because the old madame said, \u201cN\u00e9e Bai, since you committed the crime of being careless and losing etiquette on this grand occasion, go to the small Buddha hall in the courtyard and copy scriptures as a punishment. There will be no dinner for you. Come back out tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Copying the scripture wasn\u2019t exactly a severe punishment. Therefore, the terrified Xiao Shi lifted Bai Xiangxiu up, and the two of them headed to the Buddha hall together. The sky had already began to turn dark by now. Bai Xiangxiu inhaled an icy breath of air and whispered to Xiao Shi, \u201cGo and steal a couple snacks for us. We\u2019ll eat it secretly at night so we don\u2019t have to starve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi deeply stared into her mistress\u2019 eyes, thinking, you\u2019re going in for punishment. How can you be so sneaky?! Seeing how her mistress\u2019 face did not reveal any signs of fear, Xiao Shi couldn\u2019t help but shake her head and sigh. Her mistress\u2019 heart had reached new heights in boldness! So Xiao Shi returned back to the house to sneak a few snacks and then sent her mistress into the Buddha hall. Since Bai Xiangxiu was the only one being punished, she could only wait outside.</p><br/><p>After sitting for awhile, the sky had turned completely pitch black and the air had cooled to something resembling late fall. Bai Xiangxiu sympathetically called out, \u201cXiao Shi, go and wait inside the house. You\u2019ll hear me from there even if I call you. Go on. This is the temple. Nothing will happen here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi refused originally. However, the air became more and more chilly, so eventually she listened to her mistress and left.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was the only person in the Buddha hall. She was extremely focused as she copied scriptures. The old madame secretly sent someone to take a look, but they soon left after seeing Bai Xiangxiu completing her task so attentively.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu eventually grew tired from copying and decided to take a small nap on the table. She\u2019d just finished tidying up when she heard the door open. A small shadow entered, bringing with them a whiff of lovely fragrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d This person had hair, so they weren\u2019t a monk. But the person was wearing a monk outfit and had a male hairstyle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it Mistress Xiu? It\u2019s me, Lin Qianzi.\u201d The monk with hair said softly.</p><br/><p>Holy shit. It\u2019s the female lead.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately stood up from behind the table in welcome, \u201cMiss Lin, what are you doing here?\u201d The female lead had personally come to see her, so she had to give her a warm welcome. Therefore, she personally offered the female lead a seat, and completely disregarded her odd style of clothing.</p><br/><p>The beauty was increasingly beautiful beneath the candlelight. Lin Qianzi was almost blinded by Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s smile. Plus, her attitude was extremely friendly. There wasn\u2019t the slightest bit of jealousy or hatred.</p><br/><p>It was she who was her man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, but even that little female cousin looked at her with hatred in her eyes. This concubine was so much more magnanimous. In comparison, it made her and her mother seem very dirty and despicable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for what happened today. You shouldn\u2019t have been punished for it.\u201d Lin Qianzi said awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I was careless, and it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu knew the female lead\u2019s intentions. The female lead must have felt her mother\u2019s behavior to be too outrageous and wanted to apologize on her behalf. Yet, she couldn\u2019t really blame her mother, so she sounded and looked a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>As expected, the person in front of her was beautiful on the inside and out. Lin Qianzi felt even more disgraced and couldn\u2019t lift her head.</p><br/><p>She whispered quietly, \u201cThe prince must treat you very well. Although I\u2019m his fianc\u00e9e, I don\u2019t like him. But my family refuses to cancel the wedding, so I have no choice but to leave. I wish you and him happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? The female head is still running away today? If she\u2019s running away, why did she come here to talk to me? Oh yeah, she came to apologize to me.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had nothing against the female lead, but still felt that she was too easily swayed and lacked her own set of opinions.</p><br/><p>If the female lead stayed, then perhaps the male lead wouldn\u2019t appear at her Winter garden randomly any more. That was good. Actually, it would be best if the female lead should make it obvious she isn\u2019t pleased with the male lead. Then, he might start chasing the female lead. So, she should appear even more kind so the female lead knows that even if she marries into the family, she won\u2019t be of any threat to her. So, Bai Xiangxiu grabbed her hand, \u201cIs it because you listened to the servants? They\u2019re all speaking nonsense. Don\u2019t believe them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026y-you\u2026.you could tell that day, that day\u2026.\u201d Lin Qianzi hadn\u2019t expected Bai Xiangxiu to see through her disguise from last time. She started to panic. If this incident was to spread, her mother would likely personally beat her to death.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu held onto her hand and continued with the attitude of a holy mother, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t mention this to anyone, not even the prince. Honestly, I just guessed it was like this that day. You cared so much about the prince that you dressed up as a pageboy and seek him out. But it wasn\u2019t until I saw you today that I realized it was truly you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for keeping this a secret, but it\u2019s not because I care about the prince!\u201d Lin Qianzi\u2019s complexion didn\u2019t look good. While the two of them were speaking, they had no idea\u2026 that their words were actually being heard by two men outside. They were the male lead and the supporting male lead. The two were actually here to visit the old madame. It wasn\u2019t on purpose. The old madame hadn\u2019t told them anything because she felt that men shouldn\u2019t meddle in affairs of the rear court.</p><br/><p>But when they were leaving, Old Servant Ye lamented how pitiful her mistress was. Although the girl was slow and stupid, she had a good heart. Therefore, she wanted to cast the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e in a bad light before she\u2019d married into the prince\u2019s household. That\u2019s why she told them all about the punishment and the entire story. Although Long Heng appeared not to care, deep down he was quite clear about what was going on.</p><br/><p>At the time, Song Jiaoyue had nothing better to do, and smiled, \u201cI heard that Miss Lin was a talented girl. I didn\u2019t expect her to be such a domineering sort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t say anything else and continued walking straight ahead. Song Jiaoyue could only follow along. In any case, they\u2019d just finished eating. But where were they going?</p><br/><p>They arrived outside a small Buddhist hall after a short while. They were able to see two lithe figures sitting inside from the tree they were standing under. Oh, so he wanted to visit his concubine. Song Jiaoyue was about to take his leave when he heard the exchange.</p><br/><p>The two of them cultivated martial arts, thus their hearing was far superior than most people. They were able to hear the entire conversation. They didn\u2019t expect Miss Lin to secretly come and see Bai Xiangxiu. Was a battle between the wife and the concubine about to start?</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, they didn\u2019t fight. Instead, they were speaking very sincerely, especially Bai Xiangxiu. She\u2019d seen through Miss Lin\u2019s identity that day. Song Jiaoyue had thought only three people had been able to identify the page that day.</p><br/><p>One of them was Long Heng, the second was Miss Lin\u2019s brother, and the third was himself. Surprisingly, Mistress Xiu was also very clever. In addition, she wasn\u2019t evil. She\u2019d even helped the future mistress of the household conceal her plans. Was this woman truly kind and accepting, or were her intentions just deeply hidden?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

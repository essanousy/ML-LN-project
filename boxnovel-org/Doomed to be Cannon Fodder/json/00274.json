He knew how vicious women could be. How would that woman, who was currently pretending to be a holy mother, respond to a question like this? It was very clear that her expression had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI almost believed what the doctor\u2019s wife said. Your woman really has so many tricks up her sleeve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2026 will never be my woman.\u201d Yu Kuang glanced over at the other side of the teahouse. They were separated by more than the street between them. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t notice the look in his eyes at all, her eyes intent on the scene unfolding below. Su Yun, you really are amazing. However, you have to have a clear conscience when pretending to be a holy mother. After all\u2019s said and done, you\u2019re not the female lead like Lin Qianzi was. She was a bona fide white lotus before she turned over to the dark side!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unreasonable!\u201d Su Yun\u2019s servant exclaimed when she saw her mistress turn pale. However, Su Yun spoke up, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be this way. This sister, you and I are both women. This is an act that\u2019s not proper to conduct in public. Is it possible for you to follow me back to the palace so that I can try it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a well worded response, but it seemed that the woman had anticipated it, \u201cI knew that it might be a problem for the noble consort, so I prepared a towel. This is made out of the medicinal water and can entirely replace the role of its liquid counterpart. You only need to dab it on your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLudicrous! Who knows whether you\u2019ve poisoned that thing?!\u201d Su Yun\u2019s servant retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned. You can ask anyone here to test it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try it!\u201d A soft clear voice rang out , followed by a woman just as stunning as the noble consort in terms of looks. She was very young and beautiful, but her most outstanding aspect was her posture as she walked forward. Even though she wasn\u2019t sitting daintily in a luxurious carriage, even though she wasn\u2019t surrounded by hordes of guards, she was still so beautiful that nothing was needed to accentuate her grace. \u201cGreetings, Noble Consort Su. N\u00e9e Bai is willing to test it out for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had found the perfect opportunity to walk down and appear before everyone. Regardless of what everyone in the capital thought of her, she would definitely drag Su Yun down today.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame, do you really want to try it?\u201d The doctor\u2019s wife asked, baffled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, give it to me!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu smiled as she stretched out her hand. Seeing this, the miracle doctor\u2019s wife handed over the towel.</p><br/><p>However, just as she lifted the towel to dab her face without the slightest hint of hesitation, Noble Consort Su walked over and stopped Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cHow can I trouble Princess Consort Li? This seat will do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoble Consort Su\u2019s body is comparable to that of gold. If you were to be injured, the blame would be too much for them to bere. However, I am but the humble daughter of an official. If anything happens to me, it will be of my own accord and will not make things difficult for them.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t loosen her grip, creating tension in the towel as the both of them tugged on it.</p><br/><p>Su Yun smiled and said, \u201cHow would this seat blame them if this isn\u2019t poisoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t let Bai Xiangxiu steal her limelight right now! Wouldn\u2019t that just make her seem suspect? Moreover, it was evident that this woman was setting a trap for her. If she didn\u2019t rub it over her face, it would prove that there was room to doubt her. But if she did rub it over her face, who could guarantee the towel hadn\u2019t been tampered with?</p><br/><p>But seeing as Bai Xiangxiu had dared to raise it to her face, she felt that it ought to be safe and snatched the towel over, gently rubbing it over her face. She didn\u2019t dare to exert too much force. After not feeling anything amiss, she smiled, asking, \u201cIs there still a problem now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when everyone thought that there was definitely nothing wrong with her, a terrifying thing happened. Bloody scars crisscrossed her face like a child\u2019s first drawing. In a matter of moments, her beautiful face was transformed into one of nightmares. A stinging pain accompanied the transformation, and Su Yun shrieked, adding to the horrifying image. She hid her face in her hands as she screamedt, \u201cSeize her! She put poison on the towel!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the miracle doctor\u2019s wife rushed up to her as though she\u2019d gone mad. \u201cYou\u2019re the culprit! Murderer!! I lied about the word murderer appearing and an some injured face. Those were all lies! I only put a hemophagic drug on this towel. If someone has an injury that\u2019s been concealed, this will immediately bring it to light! My husband used it for autopsies, but I never would\u2019ve thought that it could be used like this. You vicious woman! There are too many injuries on your face to count!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! You\u2019re the one who poisoned me!\u201d Su Yun wasn\u2019t in that much pain. There was only a slight burning sensation lingering on her skin. She was sure she\u2019d fallen in a trap, but didn\u2019t expect Bai Xiangxiu to think so far ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Since you said there\u2019s no poison on the towel, then have her try it.\u201d Su Yun pointed at Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t panicked at all. She didn\u2019t really know whether the thing on this towel would harm her or not, but even so, it didn\u2019t matter. Why should she be afraid of being put to the test if she hadn\u2019t done anything bad? Thus, she took the towel and dabbed at her face before gently putting it down. \u201cLady, you\u2019ll have to bid your life farewell if something happens to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even when they waited longer than Su Yun\u2019s transformation, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face was still as perfect as it was before. The miracle doctor\u2019s wife was already sobbing. She couldn\u2019t exact her revenge after being pinned down, screeching, \u201cWhat nonsense about royalty facing the same crime as commoners when they break the law? Why does the emperor\u2019s wife get to live a good life after committing a crime and harming so many lives? Why does my husband have to die after saving countless lives in his life? It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you all are working together to harm me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yun\u2019s servants were already making their move after hearing the accusations, hastily grabbing Bai Xiangxiu and the doctor\u2019s wife. Bai Xiangxiu sidestepped their hands and said, \u201cNoble Consort Su, this is wrong. I don\u2019t know this woman at all. I only stepped forward to help you. Where\u2019s your evidence behind your accusation?\u201d</p><br/><p>She secretly pinched her arm and tears welled up in her eyes. The little white flower expression she had on made everyone feel sorry for her.</p><br/><p>Upstairs, Luo Yunzheng fiercely held Yu Kuang down. \u201cDon\u2019t get excited. Your woman won\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said that she\u2019s not my woman.\u201d He emphasized the last two words and spoke very slowly, but his slightly reddened face said otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, how old are you to still be embarrassed? It can\u2019t be that you haven\u2019t had a woman in your life yet, right?\u201d Luo Yunzheng looked at the saintly Yu Kuang with surprise. Seeing his face turn from pink to white, he felt sure that this was indeed a viable possibility. He quickly loosened his grip and smiled, \u201cThen I really was impolite. But I think you ought to go and at least try to lose your virginity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang\u2019s face darkened. He didn\u2019t have the same thoughts as Yu Sh\u016b, but they both felt that this woman was special. He\u2019d never thought about that aspect because she\u2019d never given him anything to fantasize about. Having Luo Yunzheng say something like that made him feel that it was some kind of blasphemy, both towards Yu Kuang and Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Yunzheng, she\u2019s not Lin Qianzi. She\u2019d not the sort to be with a different man every day.\u201d Luo Yunzheng had an extremely unpleasant look on his face at Yu Kuang\u2019s blunt words. He shoved Yu Kuang so hard that the other party stumbled backwards. After that, he turned around and leaped downstairs, disappearing without a trace. Yu Kuang heaved a sigh of relief after Luo Yunzheng left. Even he was extremely shocked as to why his own attitude would change so much when Bai Xiangxiu was mentioned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

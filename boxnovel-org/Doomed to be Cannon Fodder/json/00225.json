It looked to be a very long cut caused by a sharp blade. The fresh blood kept flowing. Bai Xiangxiu quickly held his head up and lightly probed to see whether he was still breathing. Only upon finding that he was still breathing did she relax. However, her heart still thumped wildly, as she was scared that he would never wake up ever again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone come! Hurry up to save Sir Song!\u201d Someone jumped up after her shout, coming over to quickly take Song Jiaoyue downstairs. As they descended the stairs, they saw the gravely injured enemy soldiers. Amongst them, Chen Tao had the heaviest injuries. One of his legs was in tatters from the explosion. The grave injuries had made him pass out, and because of this unexpected attack, all of the enemy soldiers who had come with him had been captured, resulting in few casualties.</p><br/><p>A soldier asked, \u201cMadame Bai, how are we to handle these people?\u201d Sir Song had led them here, but was unconscious. They could only ask Madame Bai. In their eyes, Madame Bai was a very smart woman as she always helped them with so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake them away and lock them up. Treat the ones with injuries. Don\u2019t let them die, otherwise we won\u2019t be able to get anything out of them..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Everyone despised traitors, so the soldier kicked Chen Tao\u2019s leg as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of his wounds too and send him to Prince Rong\u2019s residence. I wish to ask him about some matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a result, Chen Tao was sent to Prince Rong\u2019s residence. She then went to check on Song Jiaoyue\u2019s condition. His wounds were severe, but they didn\u2019t seem to be fatal. He quickly came to when the physician bound his wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was coming for you, so be careful,\u201d Song Jiaoyue said as he pulled Bai Xiangxiu close.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be careful. You should get better first. There\u2019s no need to worry about other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue had only woken up for a moment due to his agitated emotions, so he quickly fell back into slumber again. Bai Xiangxiu then went to Prince Rong\u2019s residence. She wanted to find out more about the other transmigrator\u2019s circumstances. Chen Tao didn\u2019t take long to wake up, but was thrown unceremoniously onto the ground. Bai Xiangxiu glared at him and coldly said, \u201cI only have one thing to ask you. Who amongst you made the bomb? Is it a female or a male? What does he or she look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see my wife and mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour current situation isn\u2019t looking too good.\u201d Prince Rong struck the table as he continued, \u201cOn the other hand, we can make you die slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only want to see them. When the time comes, I\u2026 will tell you whatever you want to know,\u201d Chen Tao glanced at her. The women from that world were all very scary. She was from that place, and that woman was also from that place.</p><br/><p>Prince Rong nodded and gave his consent. Bai Xiangxiu had someone bring in Chen Tao\u2019s wife. Chen Tao became very emotional as soon as he saw his wife. Never once had he thought about how important she was to him. \u201cMother of my child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy husband, is it really you?\u201d She looked at him, almost as if looking at someone she didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, where\u2019s my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you betrayed the country, mother couldn\u2019t bear the gossip of the neighbors and the servants, so she died from illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? She\u2026 she died from sickness?\u201d Chen Tao\u2019s heart spasmed with pain. He had never thought that his mother would die like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, she was angered to death by you,\u201d The lady still remembered the bitterness she\u2019d faced after he had betrayed their nation, and what kinds of attacks they had suffered. After Chen Tao\u2019s mother had died from her anger, Chen Tao\u2019s children had cried as they asked their mother why people called them little traitors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, help me take care of our children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will. They\u2019re all surnamed Wu now,\u201d She kept her eyes on him even as they glistened with tears. Chen Tao\u2019s leg had begun to bleed again. His wife didn\u2019t wish for him suffer and fell to her knees, \u201cMadame Bai, please save him. Even though he has done many evils, he is still my husband, and the father of my children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu glanced at Prince Rong. The physician he had brought here was also kneeling, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we won\u2019t save him, but that we have no way of saving him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lower half of his body had been completely savaged by the bomb. Even if they wanted to save him, they could no longer do so. \u201cHe isn\u2019t worth your pleading. Why do you still want to help a man who abandoned you?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu sighed. Even though she couldn\u2019t overlook everything that had happened, she felt that it wasn\u2019t worth the lady\u2019s efforts. </p><br/><p>\u201cHa, what do cold-hearted women like you even know about the three obediences and four virtues! One teaches women not to respect their husbands, while the other uses the lives of others to experiment with their bombs.\u201d Chen Tao was near delirious. </p><br/><p>\u201cWomen? Are you saying that the person who helped that commander was a woman?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu frowned. She might\u2019ve been happy to find someone from the same world as her if it\u2019d been a man. But according to novels, women who usually transmigrated were assassins, special agents, what not or another. And according to what he had said, this was no ordinary woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she doesn\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s life. She\u2019s an extremely cold woman\u2026 but you\u2019re very different from her.\u201d He lightly coughed but quickly spewed out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu\u2026 Su Yun,\u201d He couldn\u2019t hold on after saying this name and slowly drifted into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a second! What does the Su Yun you speak of look like? Is she about 25 or 26 years old? Does she look like a daughter of an affluent family?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu wanted to ask many questions, but she couldn\u2019t get anything more out of him.</p><br/><p>Prince Rong instructed Bai Xiangxiu to move him to a room, allowing Chen Tao to spend time alone with his wife until evening came around. Prince Rong thought it strange that his godsister knew of this Su Yun\u2019s origin, but when he asked her for specifics, her face became puckered like she\u2019d tasted bitter melon, no, as if she\u2019d tasted the most bitter goldthread herb.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, may this concubine withdraw? My head hurts.\u201d It didn\u2019t just hurt a bit, it hurt quite a lot. Even though there were many people with the same name in the world, only Su Yun could accomplish something like this, unless it wasn\u2019t some sort of assassin or secret agent instead. </p><br/><p>Su Yun came from true wealth. In the past, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s family had done gardening work for a rich villa. She\u2019d tagged along with her family and met the prideful, ruthless young miss Su Yun. At that time, she\u2019d thought, if this person was to time travel to the ancient era, she would definitely become the female lead, because she\u2019s really too strong. </p><br/><p>There was only one flaw; she had a serious Princess Syndrome. She would immediately pursue someone that she fell in love with, bashing her target over the head with money and her body. Bai Xiangxiu had a sharp looking coworker at that time who\u2019d just turned twenty one. He was a poor child who had to make a living without having graduated from university. But Su Yun had fancied him. And at the time, that boy and Bai Xiangxiu had been a bit close.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had been subject to her mockery and ridicule for this reason alone. Su Yun would often make cracks about how Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s perfume was too cheap or wonder if she needed to gift Bai Xiangxiu some free samples from department stores. That or Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s clothes were too old and ragged, and whether Su Yun needed to find some old castaways for her. The Bai Xiangxiu at that time had been only average looking, so she\u2019d been thoroughly defeated. </p><br/><p>As for the sharp looking lad, Su Yun had successfully slept with him in the end. Bai Xiangxiu had been taking care of the lawn at the time, beneath a window just outside their room. Though she obviously saw Bai Xiangxiu, Su Yun didn\u2019t tone her activities down any. In fact, she purposely made her sounds much louder.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He still looked a bit awkward as he coughed lightly and forced himself to speak, \u201cRecently, an honored nun came to our residence and cooked some vegetarian dishes. She has been cooking vegetarian dishes in a Daoist temple ever since her youth. After mother tried it, she said her skills were not as good as yours. Surprisingly, the nun refused to accept this result. She demanded to know exactly how you would cook a particular dish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I see. Which dish?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu thought it was very odd. Why had Madame Song invited a nun to her place to cook vegetarian dishes? But when she looked at Song Jiaoyue\u2019s expression, she had somewhat of an inkling. Most likely, Madame Song just wanted to eat her dishes.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue laughed and immediately handed a piece of paper over to Xiao Shi to hand to Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu took a look and recognized it as the list of dishes she had prepared that time. Underneath it were the procedures on how to prepare them, but they were different from her methods.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis concubine\u2019s ways are different from the nun\u2019s. Xiao Shi, bring me a piece of paper and brush.\u201d She decided to write down her own methods.</p><br/><p>Long Heng overrode her, \u201cShu\u2019er, bring paper and a brush.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shu\u2019er obeyed and brought the items over. Bai Xiangxiu picked up the brush, and as she was about to write, the male lead suddenly blurted out, \u201cYour posture is incorrect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was afraid of this person to begin with, and she also found it frightening when someone suddenly interrupted her thoughts. Her hand jerked as she flinched and the expensive brush flew out with some force. She immediately thought that this was bad and rushed to pick it up. Surprisingly, she was even faster than Shu\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Shu\u2019er had already bent over to pick up the brush, but hadn\u2019t expected Bai Xiangxiu to swoop past him to beat him to the brush. What type of master is she? How come she doesn\u2019t follow the normal routines? Since she\u2019s picked it up, what am I supposed to do now?</p><br/><p>But he quickly got his job back. The brush was thrust into his hands with a hissed question, \u201cTake a look and see if it\u2019s broken?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He awkwardly took the brush to examine, but quickly took note of his master\u2019s black face. He decided to get rid of this hot potato and stated, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu breathed a sigh of relief. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to compensate the prince for the loss of that expensive looking brush. She hastily apologized for her misconduct. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be more careful next time.\u201d She definitely wouldn\u2019t throw it across the room next time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d Long Heng was truly at a loss. He had no idea what to say to her. Song Jiaoyue, standing by the side, felt his heart tremble.</p><br/><p>Why was Madame Xiu so afraid of the prince? Logically, they were married. Although she was only a concubine, she didn\u2019t need to be so afraid?! Unless\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Song Jiaoyue recalled that Long Heng held a lot of disgust towards women after he returned from the battlefield. Whenever they went to a brothel, Long Heng would be furious whenever any women suddenly sat down or tried to draw near him. Although he appeared to be gentle towards Madame Xiu, who knew what really went on behind the scenes?!</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue took another look at her and noticed how worn out she appeared. She did not have that sweet and charming expression women normally had when they were being spoiled and loved by their man. He was a man himself, and had several women in his rear court. How could he not understand her state?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu took her seat and started to slowly write down her recipes. However, she was still frightened from the close call she had just experienced. She felt the eyes of the male lead on her, so she tried her best to write properly. By the time she was finished, little pearls of sweat beaded on her forehead. Bai Xiangxiu spoke, \u201cIt\u2019s not very clear if one just has these recipes to look at. Why don\u2019t I personally make the dishes so you can bring it home with you, Sir Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. Your wound hasn\u2019t healed yet.\u201d Song Jiaoyue stood up anxiously. He honestly wasn\u2019t trying to be polite; he just really didn\u2019t want her to be overworked.</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangxiu had already made up her mind. She paid her respects and took her leave, striding off before anyone could stop her. Long Heng wanted to stop her, but she had left too quickly for him to formulate how.</p><br/><p>Long Heng couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brows as he said to Shu\u2019er, \u201cWarn those in the kitchen. I do not want Madame Xiu to be injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Shu\u2019er promptly left. He came back after a short while and said, \u201cMadame Xiu has finished preparing the dishes. She wants to know whether Sir Song wants them now or later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them home now. My\u2026 ahem\u2026\u201d He stood up to bow to Long Heng. He didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but Long Heng understood. They\u2019d been friends ever since they were little. How could he not know that his friend\u2019s mother was an avid foodie? Long Heng obviously knew. He just waved his friend on to show that it was alright for him to leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was excited when she heard that Song Jiaoyue was immediately going to take the food container from her. She was impatiently waiting outside. Since Long Heng knew about this, it wasn\u2019t like she was doing something sneaky behind his back.</p><br/><p>She noticed Xiao Shi was still following her from behind, so she said, \u201cXiao Shi, I should\u2019ve put some coriander on top of the food to heighten the taste, but I forgot. Could you go get me a few sprigs? Hurry.\u201d Xiao Shi didn\u2019t question her and left quickly. Actually, the reason why Bai Xiangxiu had told her to leave was because she noticed Song Jiaoyue approaching.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue noticed Xiao Shi\u2019s departure from afar. His heart couldn\u2019t help but jump. He turned to the servants behind him as well, \u201cGo over there to wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants were a bit surprised, but they didn\u2019t dare to say anything and silently retreated.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was a bit nervous as he walked over. His palms had begun to sweat. Seeing how hesitant he seemed, Bai Xiangxiu approached him instead. She handed him the food container to him as she blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Sir Song. Ac-actually, I treat you\u2026 differently from the others. I\u2026. there\u2019s a dish inside that I specifically created for you. After you eat it, you will understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue had already understood. He stared at her in a daze before he realized that she had already turned around. She walked speedily, and was already out of breath after a few steps. At that moment, Xiao Shi came back and said, \u201cHere is the coriander you asked for, Mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Song has already taken the dishes. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s not good if the others see us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Oh\u2026.\u201d How had he come so quickly?</p><br/><p>After Song Jiaoyue watched them leave in a daze, he also quickly took his leave. Once he entered his horse carriage, he opened up the food container to see that aside from the dishes he\u2019d ordered, there was an extra plate with two pastries.</p><br/><p>He examined it for a long time but couldn\u2019t figure out what was so special about it. He didn\u2019t bother washing his hands before placing one of the buns in his mouth. The moment he bit into it, his face turned bright red. He felt that his heart was going to pound right out of his chest. It only looked like a normal bun on the outside, but inside was an unusual ingredient, the heart of an animal.</p><br/><p>Her meaning was obvious. She wanted to give him her heart, and wanted him to understand. He truly did understand her feelings. Both when she\u2019d whispered, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re alright\u2026\u201d after blocking the concealed weapon for him, and the tender looks and flushed cheeks when she saw him again.</p><br/><p>All of her actions indicated that she had special feelings for him. In addition, she was expressing them bravely. Normally, he would think women who acted this way were too shameless. How dare she try to seduce other men when she was the concubine of a prince?</p><br/><p>But what if she liked someone else because the prince didn\u2019t treat her well? That was quite possible. She was only trying to show her feelings. It wasn\u2019t like she was really doing something with him, right?</p><br/><p>But what about him?</p><br/><p>Where did his heart stand?</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue silently ate the other piece of pastry. He didn\u2019t know how to define the taste. It was too complicated. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. No matter what, the two of them had no future. It was impossible. She was the wife of Long Heng, and Long Heng was his good friend.</p><br/><p>If Long Heng was absolutely uninterested in her, then perhaps Song Jiaoyue could\u2019ve asked his friend to offer her to him. But Long Heng clearly treated her differently from the rest. If Song Jiaoyue recklessly tried to steal his love, then their friendship would be over.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue placed the lid back on the container and silently shut his eyes. It felt as if he was gazing at a snowy landscape that had melted before it had a chance to inspire others with its beauty. He was regretful, but he had no other choice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

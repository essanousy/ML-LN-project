He was a man who had been through the battlefield, baptized through blood and fire. Although he was a little unfamiliar with sentimental feelings, he also felt a bit of anticipation thrill through his veins. These feelings were both strange and removed to someone who\u2019d trudged through rivers of blood. At the same time, he felt that these feelings had indeed been hard to obtain. It finally seemed like he had everything now, but someone was skulking around to sabotage it.</p><br/><p>How could Long Heng keep his calm? He burned to leap into action, to haul out the person responsible and torture him to death. At that moment, a delicate and graceful woman walked into his residence. She had an alluring figure and a delicate, charming appearance. Her temperament reminded him of a certain someone at first blush, the quiet fourth madame, n\u00e8e Bai.</p><br/><p>Their demeanor were extremely similar to each other, so his expression slowly began to relax.</p><br/><p>He sat there watching as she walked in, and realized that he did in fact know who she was. This person was Sun Hong\u2019er, his personal maidservant before he\u2019d entered the army.</p><br/><p>She dipped in greeting, her eyes tenderly looking at him while her body slipped into an alluring posture. The distance between the two had subtly narrowed. After detecting the fragrance on her body, Long Heng subconsciously felt his stomach tighten. His forehead couldn\u2019t help but crease. It seemed that this fragrance could cause men to weaken their control over their desires, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make him go crazy over her. So he didn\u2019t immediately reprimand her, but began to think of her with a bit contempt.</p><br/><p>Why would a proper lady carry such an impure fragrance on their body? She was clearly trying to seduce men. He had experienced numerous similar occurrences on the battlefield, so he was particularly repelled by such actions. But she possessed a good attitude so, he reached out his hand and said, \u201cYou may rise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes moist with tears, Sun Hong\u2019er immediately apologized for her mistakes as soon as she rose to her feet. \u201cIt was all this servant\u2019s fault. If this servant hadn\u2019t asked the fourth madame to head over to the clothing storage when I realized there was a problem with the cotton, Fourth Madame wouldn\u2019t have innocently received such serious injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop crying. Just tell me what happened from the beginning to the end.\u201d Sun Hong\u2019er only began to talk about the incident after Long Heng had waved his hand with extreme impatience. What she said was likely the truth; Long Heng didn\u2019t note any flaws in her story. However, why is she always looking down? Even if she was trying to show modesty and decorum in front of a man, she had already applied such an unscrupulous fragrance on her body. Did she really have to put on such an act afterwards? He couldn\u2019t stand smelling that fragrance anymore because it would only remind him of n\u00e8e Bai. It made him want to think of ways to pin her down and have his way with her. Every time he had such thoughts, it seemed like every single violent cell in his body grew excited, making his blood thrum and setting his heart on fire. </p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t do. That version of him was too violent. He had to restrain himself, or wouldn\u2019t that paper-like girl be violently tortured to death? His heart would bleed for her even if she was only pricked by a needle, never mind death. Distracted by his thoughts, he absentmindedly waved his hand, \u201cLeave for now. I wish to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t expect that she would actually be so bold as to launch herself straight at him. Her original intention was to hug Prince Li\u2019s waist, because a man\u2019s waist wasn\u2019t a place to be randomly touched. How would matters not take a sudden steamy turn with this hug? But she hadn\u2019t counted on Prince Li\u2019s martial artist background; there was no way he would drop his guard for a moment. He wouldn\u2019t even let a pet that he didn\u2019t trust easily touch him, let alone a woman.</p><br/><p>And so, a strange pose was born.</p><br/><p>Prince Li was defying common sense and had his palm firmly holding the woman\u2019s head at bay. As for her, she was vainly stretching both her hands out, waiting to be hugged. Unfortunately, Prince Li had longer arms than she did, so he used his hands to block her advances. In the end, she didn\u2019t even manage to grab onto a single finger of his. Prince Li twitched his eyebrows a little and sidestepped.</p><br/><p>Bam! Sun Hong\u2019er crashed onto the floor with a thud.</p><br/><p>This development is unexpected. It seems that the prince has become a lot more ruthless compared to before he left. Although he wasn\u2019t any easier to get closer to before, he would never have treated a beautiful young lady like this.</p><br/><p>But now\u2026</p><br/><p>The girl fell face first onto the floor, stunning herself with the impact. Amidst her daze, she was almost certain that her nose had been shattered. When she clambered to her feet, she found blood all over the floor, and so quickly pinched her nose shut with both hands. Initially, she\u2019d planned on spending the night with the prince while Madame Xiu was still too injured to tend to his needs. Yet, how could she have guessed that she would end up on the ground, face battered and bruised instead?</p><br/><p>She felt abnormally aggrieved and wanted to turn to leave so that the prince wouldn\u2019t see her current ugly state. Unexpectedly,the moment she stood up to turn, a voice languidly came from behind her, \u201cHong\u2019er, were you here to volunteer to be my bedwarmer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Hong\u2019er almost couldn\u2019t believe her ears as she clutched her bleeding nose with her hands. Since when had Prince Li become so enlightened? Except, was something wrong with this man who wouldn\u2019t eat the meat that had been dangling in front of him? She\u2019d been so proactive already. But since he\u2019s suddenly asked such a question, could it be that it\u2019s finally dawned on him to?</p><br/><p>Sun Hong\u2019er became extremely excited. She quickly used her sleeves to forcefully wipe off her nosebleed and said with a voice aching with temptation, \u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She said the words \u2018Your Highness\u2019 with such a coquettish lilt that Long Heng couldn\u2019t help but feel goosebumps pop out all over his body.</p><br/><p>He was so disgusted that whatever impulsive thoughts he\u2019d previously had due to her fragrance scattered into the wind. From a certain point of view, this woman was actually quite competent for being able to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing to do anything for this prince?\u201d Long Heng suddenly thought of a possibility and asked a probing question.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, her body actually froze for a second, and then continued with a fanciful vibrato in her voice, \u201cOf course. This servant will do whatever Your Highness wishes this servant to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then clean up the blood on the floor and get the hell out.\u201d After speaking, Long Heng brandished his sleeves and left. His thoughts didn\u2019t linger the least bit on her at all.</p><br/><p>But after returning to his room, he immediately ordered someone to investigate her affairs. She had seemed like just another widow, but she shouldn\u2019t have been that daring. Although her reaction just now had indeed been suspicious, it had also saved her life as well. If he hadn\u2019t thought that there was more to the story, she would probably have been taken away to be beaten to death by staves by now. If she truly was the mastermind behind that incident, then something simple as death wouldn\u2019t be lying in wait for her.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was only able to sleep for about roughly four hours that night before his man returned. He knelt in front of Long Heng and relayed everything from start to finish. Veins began to throb in Long Heng\u2019s forehead. He commanded, \u201cLock that person up immediately! I want to personally interrogate her!\u201d</p><br/><p>But his man returned shortly, not long after he\u2019d just left. \u201cThat person has already escaped. I\u2019ve sent some men to chase after her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s unexpectedly quick-witted. But I believe that a little girl like her would never be able to escape from all of you, right? What use would I have to keeping all of you on then?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person gave him a quick kowtow and left immediately. They had to catch that girl. Or else, how would they continue working here in the future if they lost face in front of the master? And so, Sun Hong\u2019er was successfully recaptured within the hour. Her nose was still collapsed, making her entire face seem deformed.</p><br/><p>What delicate and charming appearance? What sweet and coquettish looks? At this moment, she was totally the opposite of those things. It would be a compliment to say that she looked like a ghost.</p><br/><p>The corner of Long Heng\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cSpeak. I might give you a chance to live if you confess everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, this servant has no idea what Your Highness is implying.\u201d Sun Hong\u2019er wasn\u2019t dumb. There was no way that she would confess.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

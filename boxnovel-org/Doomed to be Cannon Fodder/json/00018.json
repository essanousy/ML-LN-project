Even if she didn\u2019t mess with the female MC, who knew if she would turn into cannon fodder by staying here?</p><br/><p>The old madame was very pleased by her girly response. Who wouldn\u2019t want their son to marry a pure and cute woman? She quickly called Old Servant Ye 1 over. After introducing the two to each other, she dismissed the two.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu knew this old granny servant belonged to the old madame. As a result, she treated her very courteously. Bai Xiangxiu arranged a room for her, and didn\u2019t assign any work to her. But this Ye-mama had come with a mission in mind. Her task was to teach Mistress Xiu on how to lure the prince to bed.</p><br/><p>Since she wanted to please her new mistress, just as how newly appointed officials always itched to make their mark, Ye-mama got straight to her lessons. It wasn\u2019t like the concubines in the rear court had anything better to do anyway. Their only purpose really was to wait for the master to sleep with them, and hopefully produce a son or daughter as a result. Based on Mistress Xiu\u2019s face, she could tell that the old madame purposely wanted to promote her. Therefore, she smiled the moment she saw her, hoping to leave a good impression. But she was very surprised. Although Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s room was simple, it certainly didn\u2019t lack a personal touch.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere felt very spiritual, and that was primarily due to all the plants in the various corners. Aside from the one plant she couldn\u2019t name, everything else was very delightful to the eyes. She had done a great job with the decor, and there also weren\u2019t any other fragrances when one entered. No wonder the prince had already made the effort to come twice. </p><br/><p>But for Bai Xiangxiu, she was confused about these so called lessons. What was with the first lesson of making a gift for the male lead? Ye-mama said regardless of how rich a man is, he cannot be arrogant forever. If a man receives a woman\u2019s gift, it will make him happy. Therefore, she had to hand make him a gift.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was a bit depressed, but she didn\u2019t have a choice. Since she had to deal with it, she started to learn needlework. Surprisingly, perhaps the former host of her body actually had some skills that she passed on, so she was actually doing alright. But needlework took time, so Ye-mama came each day to guide her a little bit. For the remainder of the time, she sat on one side making a pair of shoes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu started to toss and turn at night. Deep down, she was wondering why the second male lead hadn\u2019t arrived yet. In the novel, it was said that he would come to the Prince\u2019s residence every few days. There were also times he would wander off without the male lead. If not, how else would he have stumbled across the female lead? Could it be that he wasn\u2019t here because the female lead wasn\u2019t here? No!!</p><br/><p>She needed to seduce the second male lead. She definitely wanted to leave this place. She found it extremely embarrassing that her mother-in-law was sending a servant to teach her how to seduce her own husband and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold on for much longer.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiangxiu might appear stupid, she clearly knew why the old madame was doing this. The male lead was a very responsible and diligent person. He was always on the front line. It took him seven or eight years to obtain his title of a common prince, and it was one that could be passed down to his heirs. He was originally a nobleman in the imperial city to begin, and now he was royalty. His treatment would be obviously different!</p><br/><p>Naturally, some things had to be delayed in order to climb to his position. For instance, he was still a virgin. In the novel, when the male lead had given his virginity to the female lead, it had actually been awfully embarrassing. Thinking about the other male leads in other novels, they would always coax and lie to get their way. But this male lead? He had the heart but had no idea where to put his hands. When she\u2019d been reading, Bai Xiangxiu would laugh and frighten the old people she was working with. They thought something was wrong with her!</p><br/><p>Thinking of the plot from the novel, Bai Xiangxiu thought that the old madame was very wise. She wanted the male lead to gain some experience first. Or else it would be awfully embarrassing for him when he was faced with his actual wife. Also, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for the old granny servant to teach the wife how to seduce a man. However, a concubine was different. If something went wrong, they could simply sell or beat her to death, and no one would care.</p><br/><p>In the end, she was still being used as cannon fodder!</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the more depressed she became. It was wrong if she tried to seduce the male lead, but if she didn\u2019t, she would be wasting the old madame\u2019s efforts. She might simply find a reason to beat her to death. For her, it would be as easy as stepping on a few ants.</p><br/><p>After pondering for a while, she decided to embroider something while waiting for her opportunity. She was banking on the fact that an opportunity would rise when the supporting male lead wandered around in the male lead\u2019s residence!</p><br/><p>The timeline of a day turned out to be a few days. She was almost finished with her creation. It was a pair of nice mandarin ducks. Very common. Very common indeed. Ye-mama wasn\u2019t that impressed, but Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s embroidery skills were limited, so she had to make do. She didn\u2019t make Bai Xiangxiu waste her efforts either. When the mistress was finished with the mandarin duck, the old granny sewed it onto a perfume satchel for her.</p><br/><p>As Ye-mama was fixing her work, Bai Xiangxiu closed her eyes for three minutes and started mumbling to herself. The only one who heard her ramblings was Huo\u2019er. She murmured, \u201cI\u2019m so tired. So tired. When is the supporting male lead going to arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of thing is a supporting male lead?\u201d Huo\u2019er asked in a cute tone. It had been quite healthy recently. Most importantly, it had a lot of vitality, so it\u2019d been fine even after being dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe supporting male lead isn\u2019t a thing. His name is Song Jiaoyue.\u201d His name sure sounds nice. When can I seduce you?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Song, what have you been up to lately\u2026 si, si,\u2026.sit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Huo\u2019er sounded like the male lead. It was true. The male lead usually spoke very slowly, as if he needed to taste each word before spitting them out and Huo\u2019er seemed to do just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How do you know that?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was shocked. She didn\u2019t think Huo\u2019er had the ability to imitate humans.</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er responded, \u201cI can hear them. A part of me is still in that person\u2019s finger. But it\u2019s going to disappear soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person?\u201d It must be Long Heng\u2019s pageboy, because he\u2019d tried picking Huo\u2019er up and one of the thorns had poked his finger. This was a stroke of luck! How come she hadn\u2019t realized this until now?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, where is he now? At this moment?\u201d Was the supporting male lead coming? She felt a bit flustered and regretted not asking sooner. Perhaps he might have been around a few times these past couple of days already!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019d already arrived before you started speaking about him.\u201d Huo\u2019er responded cutely, feeling great because it was able to help its mistress.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo\u2019er, you\u2019re too amazing! Could I borrow your thorn?\u201d She wanted to stick a thorn into the male lead, so that the next time Song Jiaoyue was around, she would know immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be a bit painful, but if that\u2019s alright if that\u2019s what Mistress wants!\u201d Huo\u2019er said generously. But it didn\u2019t think its master would want to pull an entire thorn out! \u201cOw ow ow!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It must be very painful! Bai Xiangxiu instantly stopped. She realized that harnessing this stroke of luck would be very difficult. She didn\u2019t want to cause Huo\u2019er so much pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, the thorns at the top don\u2019t hurt.\u201d Huo\u2019er couldn\u2019t move, so it could only direct her by speaking.</p><br/><p>Oh yeah, the top thorns are to protect it! Of course they won\u2019t hurt. Bai Xiangxiu seemed to have thought of something. She smiled and said, \u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>She ran outside and saw Ye-mama working on the perfume satchel. The granny servant had already cut out the shape of it earlier when Bai Xiangxiu had been embroidering. She was now just sewing and looping it together.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu ran to her side as she was looping it, \u201cYe-mama, is the perfume satchel finished?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished.\u201d Why is she so proactive all of a sudden? Ye-mama looped the strap onto the perfume satchel and handed it to her. Bai Xiangxiu smiled, \u201cI\u2019m going to put the spices inside now. I don\u2019t need to trouble you any longer, Ye-mama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-mama had never seen Mistress Xiu this proactive since she\u2019d arrived. Was it actually a good thing for a woman to be so sprightly? What if the prince disliked her? Leaving Ye-mama to her musings, Bai Xiangxiu went back to her room with the perfume satchel. She stuffed the bag with herbs and also placed the thorn she had pulled out from Huo\u2019er into the bag as well.</p><br/><p>The perfume satchel was supposed to be carried around all the time. This meant that she would find out whenever the supporting male lead was coming. This was even more useful than a surveillance camera from the modern world!</p><br/><p>She beamed and kissed the perfume satchel. Ye-mama happened to see this and couldn\u2019t help but think, this Mistress Xiu sure has her heart set on the prince, but the way she\u2019s expressing herself is a bit over the top.</p><br/><p>1.

He knew that there was nothing between them, but he just didn\u2019t like seeing them talk to each other. He genuinely hated what they spoke to each other, even though it was just a simple greeting. \u201cSay what you need to say. Piss off when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026 Long Heng.\u201d No matter what he\u2019s still our savior! How can you be so cold to him?</p><br/><p>Long Heng was depressed. Bai Xiangxiu had gotten used to calling him by name. Truth be told, this was his fault as he was the one who\u2019d insisted that she address him by name in private. And because of that, Bai Xiangxiu was calling him by his name even when others were around. She only acted respectful when there were outsiders present. Everything seemed to have changed, yet it seemed like nothing had changed after they\u2019d officially became husband and wife. Long Heng liked this feeling and had slowly come to accept this change. He didn\u2019t hate it, he just couldn\u2019t come to terms with the fact that the little lass that used to faint at the drop of a blood was slowly growing out of his grasp. Or possibly, it was he who had helped her grow stronger. After all, she was indeed different after a trip to the frontlines.</p><br/><p>Even his mother had said that she\u2019d used to feel that Bai Xiangxiu was unsuitable for the position of the matriarch of the household because of her background from a small family. Bai Xiangxiu was simply too cowardly and low profile back then, but she seemed to have changed, and his mother could now let go of household affairs with peace of mind.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang didn\u2019t mind in the slightest, only Song Jiaoyue soon left with a wry laugh, his mind and heart almost breaking. Yu Kuang, however, was quite thick-faced and sat down without a fuss, accepting the tea that servants offered. \u201cTwo notable doctors have gone missing in the jianghu. I followed their trails to the capital and ran into him and him.\u201d He nodded at Long Heng and looked outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu followed his gaze outside but didn\u2019t see anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is too shamefaced to see anyone, particularly you.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s viper tongue was at work as soon as he spoke, and Bai Xiangxiu wondered just who it was that he disliked so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d A figure vaulted in from outside just as she was confused. He had extremely good qinggong skills and so hadn\u2019t been discovered beforehand, but two people immediately followed him in. One of them was Long Heng\u2019s concealed bodyguard, and the other was Ah Song.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! A m-man\u2026\u201d Xiaoshi had grown used to men leaping around due to her service by Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s side, so this discovery of Ah Song as a man was rather shocking. They\u2019d worked together before, but Ah Song had been a woman then.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we know. He\u2019s a man, don\u2019t be agitated.\u201d It looked like Xiaoshi had received quite a shock as she was staring right at Ah Song, openmouthed.</p><br/><p>Long Heng ignored her and waved his hand, \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards left, but Bai Xiangxiu definitely saw Ah Song walk out with a red face. What\u2019s going on? Does he like Xiaoshi? The more she thought back to that day, the more she thought it possible given how the two interacted with each other. Ah Song\u2019s age wasn\u2019t old either, and he was easily embarrassed. He should be a good man, but it was a pity that he was a concealed guard with an irregular work schedule. His job was also rather high risk as he had to put himself forward whenever his master was in danger, sometimes even blocking the threat with his body. It was a good thing that his master was strong and thus decreased much of the pressure of his job.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you should at least pay attention to me even if you don\u2019t welcome me, no?\u201d Luo Yunzheng was beyond depressed. This woman had cleanly ignored him ever since he\u2019d jumped into the room. He\u2019d discovered that this lass was rather different from when he kidnapped her before, and it seemed that his impression had been confirmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, hello.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s gaze flitted back to him, still oblivious to the pressing situation in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Luo Yunzheng rubbed his nose and laughed, \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re the only one who can handle her.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a bit similar to Lin Qianzi in that they didn\u2019t strictly adhere to propriety, but also different as she would never be shy or act like a little woman in front of another man. She was open and forthright, as if the two were siblings.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it\u2019d been Prince Li saying this, Bai Xiangxiu would\u2019ve definitely looked at him with a reddened face and thought \u2018what\u2019s with this self-glorifying proclamation! You\u2019re showing off our love in public!\u2019 But it was a pity that it was Yu Kuang who\u2019d spoken those words, and he\u2019d used a tone of I\u2019m so very familiar with you, we\u2019re not outsiders with each other. Long Heng\u2019s face instantly darkened a few shades further.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu covered her face with one hand. The hell, this kid hasn\u2019t changed his overly direct habits at all! Good thing he\u2019s part of the jianghu, he\u2019d probably have offended all sorts of people in court already. At least that miserly emperor would\u2019ve chopped off his head ten times over already!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 there\u2019s something going on between you two!\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it, I forgot there\u2019s also a jokester hanging around. He won\u2019t say anything nice.</p><br/><p>Long Heng finally couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and he roared, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be here, then all of you should scram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu flinched at the sudden shout and hastily changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cA friend of mine\u2019s gone missing\u2014that miracle doctor who brought you out of Red Maple Mountain villa before. His wife and kids asked me for help, so I have to help them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So you were cooperating with them back then too\u2026\u201d She\u2019d just responded when the man beside her flashed into action. I say, he seems rather dependable and mature normally, why is he so impulsive when he sees Luo Yunzheng? But Bai Xiangxiu quickly understood after some thought. She had been discovered to be pregnant when Long Heng and Miss Lin were supposed to marry, and Luo Yunzheng had almost caused her to lose the child. She also felt a pang hit her heart now when she thought about the possibility of losing the cute Xiao Lin, so instead of stopping her husband as she\u2019d originally planned, she added, \u201cYour Highness, why don\u2019t you beat him up outside? Don\u2019t break our furniture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng almost fell over, \u201cYour woman is so miserly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince will throw you out if you don\u2019t start speaking of serious matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to, alright? Stop for now, we can fight afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know that her words had actually defused the situation. She\u2019d be sad if things were broken, but how could it be called a fight if things weren\u2019t broken? Therefore, both men calmed down and sat across from each other, as if they hadn\u2019t just been spoiling for a fight just then. Inwardly, she was rather amazing, especially since Luo Yunzheng truly did get down to business and start speaking of the missing doctor.</p><br/><p>The doctor had been hired by a family with a high price, but Luo Yunzheng couldn\u2019t even locate the family when he came looking. The family had only stayed there a few days, and neighbors said that they seemed to have come from the capital. That was why he\u2019d traveled to the capital until he met Yu Kuang.</p><br/><p>There had been a wondrous doctor near White Cloud Mountain who\u2019d gone missing, and he\u2019d also vanished in a manner quite similar to Luo Yunzheng\u2019s description. Yu Kuang had followed the trail to an inn, and apparently quite a few outsiders had come a few days ago. However, the inn had burned down, and that was when he\u2019d bumped into Luo Yunzheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe inn\u2019s secret backer is someone from the palace. This prince was going to investigate who exactly they were, but it\u2019d been burned to the ground today. But, I did find out some details about the person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe came to the Prince Li Manor today and and stayed at that inn for a while before coming. I didn\u2019t know who she was, but learned of Noble Consort Su\u2019s arrival after I returned home today.\u201d</p><br/><p>This chapter translated by moi, etvo!!

Both of them hastily averted their gazes as if they\u2019d been burned, their hearts still beating furiously. To relieve the awkwardness, Bai Xiangxiu asked, \u201cThat\u2026Sun-mama was the widower Sun. Just what happened here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, she\u2019d guessed part of it, but had no way to verify anything.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t hide anything from her, telling her how he\u2019d found out that Sun Hong\u2019er was the one to set the fire. He even explained her motive of wanting to replace Bai Xiangxiu as Long Heng\u2019s new favorite.</p><br/><p>Wah, the hole in that woman\u2019s head was a bit too big. How could one obtain such an imposing prince with just schemes? Wouldn\u2019t all the women in his rear court go crazy then? But truthfully speaking, the women of the rear courts would only go mad when fighting over a man. They lived for men and because of men. Besides him, they had no other good prospects.</p><br/><p>Did she really want to stay in a place like this? Then all she could do was be the male lead\u2019s concubine. Other women would enter the household even without the female lead. She might even be oppressed by the matron of the household forevermore. Reality wasn\u2019t like a novel, and neither was she its female lead.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t tell her how Sun Hong\u2019er had died, only that her parents had found her body. They\u2019d then started causing a ruckus at the Prince Li Manor without even asking about the reason.</p><br/><p>He was blatantly lying to her, but did he really think she wouldn\u2019t understand a thing? Bai Xiangxiu was still undecided as to whether she should stay here, but she was definitely more familiar with him now that they\u2019d had relations together.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, could someone really find a corpse that you disposed of? Moreover, that Sun Hong\u2019er was born of a servant of the household. How could her parents not understand that you punished her because of something she did wrong? Isn\u2019t their behavior a little strange?\u201d After analyzing the situation, she raised her head to look at Long Heng without hiding her curiosity.</p><br/><p>But Long Heng had always assumed she was a timid girl who was afraid of getting into trouble. He\u2019d never expected her to be clever and quick-witted as well. No wonder the head steward had spoken well of her to him before. He was the one who had underestimated her. Since there was nothing to do at the moment, he took off his shoes and climbed into bed, sitting on the side to stare at her until Bai Xiangxiu thought she\u2019d said something wrong. Perhaps men from ancient times didn\u2019t like their women speaking of household matters?</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Long Heng suddenly raised his hand, his long, slender fingers happening to stop before her eyes.</p><br/><p>There was a pop\u2026</p><br/><p>He flicked her forehead, leaving her pained and numbed, but the sensation wasn\u2019t unbearable. But every women liked to act like a spoiled child once in a while, so she gave a delicate little cry as she rubbed her head and looked pitifully at Long Heng.</p><br/><p>Long Heng really thought that he\u2019d used too much strength. He hastily pulled aside her hand for a look, only to see a slight redness beneath. So he gently blew on the spot a few times. \u201cIt is a bit strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hm? No anger, no losing his temper. He didn\u2019t even blame her, but was smiling slightly. Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t resist a small smile in return, her face flushing happily.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s heart beat furiously at the sight, but right now the sun hadn\u2019t even begun to set. He\u2019d yet to eat his dinner, so he had to endure despite his sudden impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen could it be that someone wants to deal with you, Your Highness? So they used this incident to ruin your reputation?\u201d That was how it had been written in the novel, though it hadn\u2019t gone into details. The book only said how despite having power and wealth, Long Heng\u2019s reputation was actually quite poor. Meanwhile, the emperor seemed fond of him, seemingly trusting him without question,, but was actually whittling away at Long Heng\u2019s military power bit by bit.</p><br/><p>Still, the male lead was still a male lead. No matter how the emperor hurt him, he was just a supporting male. Thus, the emperor had to come up with multiple excuses to take military power back from Long Heng. The emperor couldn\u2019t afford to offend the prince, so he was limited to minor schemes that could only happen behind the scenes. Naturally, the emperor had his own help from his fellow cohorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould this prince fear such minor schemes? My reputation wasn\u2019t that great even before my return to the capital.\u201d Rumors of him eating humans here, raping and killing women there, and maltreating the common people had often reached his own ears. If he couldn\u2019t even take that kind of pressure, how was he supposed to accomplish any major feats?</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangiu stuck up a finger and said cleverly, \u201cHow will that do? You don\u2019t care because you\u2019re a man, but Old Madame doesn\u2019t think that way. Everyone wants their dear ones to be praised by others, not met with malicious remarks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male lead might be the male lead, but he was always on the losing end from other people\u2019s criticism. For example, there was how the female lead had misunderstood him in the beginning, and how the ministers had isolated him. Since she could be considered his most \u201cintimate\u201d comrade-in-arms, she had to think of ways to help him.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s heart stirred. Were her words meant to say she was worried about him? Inexplicably, his whole body grew warm. Even his gaze softened as he spoke. \u201cThen you tell me, what should be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019d only asked on the spur of the moment. He had no expectation that this woman from the inner residence would actually have a solution. Moreover, he didn\u2019t need her to waste brainpower on the issue when she was so weak and delicate to begin with. It was enough as long as she took care of herself. Unexpectedly, she actually started thinking seriously before suddenly bursting into a smile.</p><br/><p>It was a rarely seen, self-confident smile that made Long Heng\u2019s heart tremble. That\u2019s right, others thought she was docile and meek because she acted gentle and quiet, but it\u2019d be boring if she was always like this. However, when she wore such an expression, it made people feel that only those closest to her could see her true, mischievous side. Surprisingly, there was even a hint of pride hidden within.</p><br/><p>It was all Long Heng could do to avoid flicking her on the head again. But when that little mouth started to speak somewhat excitedly, Long Heng felt that he\u2019d do as she said even if her words didn\u2019t seem to make any sense. Her very word seemed to hold some sort of magical charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know Sun Hong\u2019er\u2019s style. You didn\u2019t explain things clearly to her family when she was punished, right?\u201d She paused. Actually, she\u2019d guessed that a man with such headstrong and whirlwind methods would never explain anything to other people. What kind of general needed to explain the reasons behind any of his orders?!</p><br/><p>Thus, she added, \u201cYour Highness, you can write down all of Sun Hong\u2019er\u2019s wrongs and put them up on posters. Have the witnesses and those who are equally guilty kneel before them to admit their wrongs. Of course, you have to hang up her corpse too, in case\u2026\u201d In case he was accused of stealing the corpse. She\u2019d seen such intentions in her dream, but she wasn\u2019t sure whether they were real. Just then, she\u2019d almost avoided revealing everything.</p><br/><p>Sun Hong\u2019er had been convicted of being sexually promiscuous in the prince\u2019s manor. As for her other crime, that would have to wait for the results of an investigation. She never expected that the male lead would furrow his eyebrows and look at her again once she was done. Just when she was getting goosebumps, he raised his hand again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu unconsciously clutched her forehead and backed away to one side.</p><br/><p>Actually, Long Heng simply wanted to rub her head to encourage her. Her idea wasn\u2019t bad, since exposing everything openly would make it impossible for others to pick faults at it. But he didn\u2019t expect that she\u2019d run away from him while clutching her head like a little rabbit. His heart couldn\u2019t help but soften. He was about to speak when he saw a certain young lady sitting pitifully in a corner, thinking things over before quietly offering him her head. She had her eyes squeezed shut and said with a timid, tragically miserable voice, \u201cGo ahead and hit me, but can you do it so it doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

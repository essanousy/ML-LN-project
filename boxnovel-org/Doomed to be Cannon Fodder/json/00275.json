She wasn\u2019t actually feeling much pain, but her weak and sickly act made her seem extremely pitiful. Saying that she was innocent really helped her case as well.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi had already been coached to act in this situation. She immediately jumped to her mistress\u2019 aid while crying, \u201cDon\u2019t injure our madame! Her old wounds from the enemy soldiers have yet to fully heal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old wounds? Her wounds hadn\u2019t been all that serious and had fully healed a long time ago. However, Bai Xiangxiu was making it seem like she\u2019d once received mortal injuries and they were causing her so much pain that she couldn\u2019t get her breath back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy keep on acting? Everything today has been meticulously planned by you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts! Please stop! My arm is about to break!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was a very talented actor. She\u2019d managed to trick countless people throughout her life so far. And because of that, a lot of people could no longer stand by and watch when they saw how much pain Bai Xiangxiu seemed to be in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! What are you castrated men trying to do! Who in the world would treat two helpless ladies this way? Moreover, she\u2019s Princess Consort Li! The female Zhuge Liang who helped Prince Li defeat the enemy troops!\u201d That one sentence was like a single stone that birthed a tsunami. No one dared be the first to speak out, even though they were angry. However, their mouths could no longer stay shut once somebody got them started.</p><br/><p>Some people began to riot as their resentment grew. There was even some friction between the palace soldiers and the citizens that wanted to protect Bai Xiangxiu and the doctor\u2019s wife. The scene became quite chaotic once the people were riled up. Su Yun had always been the type to stop violence with more violence. Without much thought, she quickly yelled, \u201cSubdue these misbehaving citizens! They are all intending to revolt! Spare no one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang sucked in a quick breath of air. This was finally his time to shine. He leaned forward, diving from atop a nearby tavern, but Luo Yunzheng\u2019s men had beaten him to the punch. They mixed into the rioting crowd, acting as poor folks from the wulin as they joined the fight. It didn\u2019t take them long to subdue all of the palace soldiers with careful blows. They even scurried left, right and center to keep the citizens safe.</p><br/><p>Noticing the situation quickly turning sour, Su Yun immediately ordered the servants to lift her away. She headed for the magistrate instead of the palace to order the palace officials to capture the rebels. The officials didn\u2019t dare tarry when they realized that this was the emperor\u2019s most favored concubine. They quickly dispatched more palace soldiers to the scene.</p><br/><p>Su Yun believed that nobody in the capital would ever dare to challenge imperial authority. Therefore, in her mind, Bai Xiangxiu and Prince Li must\u2019ve arranged these citizens to be there beforehand. Things would all be under control once those people were subdued. Unfortunately, she hadn\u2019t realized that so many people were already very dissatisfied with the current state of affairs, even though the capital had been relatively peaceful all this time. Because everyone had kept their dissatisfaction repressed, things quickly got out of hand when the first of the riots started, blowing up like an explosion.</p><br/><p>The reinforcements were then naturally embroiled in a full blown conflict with the citizens of the capital. Even Bai Xiangxiu had never imagined that things would get out of hand so quickly. Many of the citizens protected her as she made her way back to the manor. This is strange. These men may be courageous, but I never imagined they\u2019d do such a thing. Come to think of it, their faces do seem a little familiar. However, I can\u2019t seem to remember where I\u2019ve seen them before.</p><br/><p>She slumped to the ground immediately after she arrived at the Prince Li Manor. Long Heng quickly came to pick her up and prepared to enter the palace together to plead for mercy. Bai Xiangxiu suddenly grabbed onto Long Heng and whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t blame me for taking things too far? There doesn\u2019t seem to be a quiet corner in the capital anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! You\u2019re overthinking things. You\u2019ve done a good job. A very good job indeed. I never thought that you\u2019d do so well.\u201d Long Heng caressed her head. He knew that she must\u2019ve had quite a long day today.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was relieved when she realized that Long Heng didn\u2019t blame her for anything. It almost seemed like anything was achievable when she was with this man. The couple was then received by a very furious emperor once they entered the palace. When the very confident Su Yun set out to prove that she had nothing to do with anything, he\u2019d never imagined that she\u2019d come back even uglier than ever before. But his problems didn\u2019t stop at just that. Suddenly, he found himself on a very shaky political footing. People had even come all the way to the palace gates to cause trouble.</p><br/><p>They managed to arrest some of the major rioters, but quickly realized that they were nothing but common citizens. They just wanted to help after being angered by Noble Consort Su\u2019s actions. They hadn\u2019t done anything overboard and it\u2019d be heresy if he were to sentence them to death after just a day\u2019s worth of trial. So, they were all released with stern warnings.</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su had actually quarreled with him over this and called him a short-sighted pansy. Indeed, he liked the fact that this woman was different from any he\u2019d met before. He liked her boldness, her wit, and definitely her ruthlessness. Because of that, she was the only woman he thought capable of keeping up with his footsteps. She wasn\u2019t like other women who would only hide when there was a problem. However, she\u2019d gone extremely overboard today and seemed to have forgotten her place. Because of that, he furiously stomped out from her room. He didn\u2019t even ask if she\u2019d be able to restore her previous looks.</p><br/><p>Seeing Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face after that horrendous face made him realize the stark contrast between them. He finally realized that a fake beauty would never be better than a real one. Noble Consort Su might seem extremely beautiful, but she seemed extremely unnatural at the same time. The main reason for that was because she hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the various surgeries yet, so she didn\u2019t even dare smile too widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may rise. The floor is too cold for kneeling. Princess Consort Li, I heard that you were injured. If so, why enter the palace?\u201d The emperor had calmed down a bit, which showed in his manner of speech. He even seemed to be flirting a little.</p><br/><p>Long Heng clenched his fist and chose not to rise. \u201cYour Majesty, forgive my wife for being discourteous to the Noble Lady. She only wanted to lend Noble Consort Su a hand, but didn\u2019t imagine that her intentions would be misread instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will investigate this matter clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Your Majesty. I hope that the noble consort won\u2019t bear too much of a grudge for this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would she do that? I\u2019m more worried for your well-being, Princess Consort Li. Why don\u2019t you stay in the palace and let the palace doctors tend to your injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA doctor has already tended to her injuries, Your Majesty. She\u2019s always been a little fragile, but it\u2019s nothing a little bit of rest wouldn\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you may return and rest. However, the matter in the capital\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subject will announce that Noble Consort Su has forgiven her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I hope that everything will end here. You are dismissed!\u201d It wasn\u2019t a pleasant feeling to see a beautiful woman falling weakly into the arms of another man. However, Long Heng was protecting her well. In fact, it felt like a luxury to be able to catch even a few extra glimpses of this woman.</p><br/><p>Why would such a demure, well-behaved, and most importantly, intelligent, woman stay by his side? The one by my side is simply too arrogant! But I better still show her some concern. I\u2019ve cast my empress off to the cold palace for her, so now she\u2019s the only one keeping my imperial harem in check.</p><br/><p>The emperor suddenly realized something. An emperor like him was actually feeling helpless in the face of a noble consort! Upon further thought, he realized that Su Yun was simply too clever. He didn\u2019t know how, but she\u2019d pulled together a few officials to support her at some point. He didn\u2019t think too much of it at first, after all, she might become his next empress\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, he finally saw this \u201cempress\u201d of his. Her face was frightening beyond belief. When she wore a veil before, her forehead and her eyes were actually quite mesmerizing. But now, even if she were to cover her face, there was red scars all over her forehead that looked like newly cut wounds which made it impossible to look straight at her. She\u2019d never be able to be an empress like this. It would probably destroy the nation\u2019s image whenever an ambassador from a foreign nation came.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will the noble consort\u2019s wounds heal?\u201d The emperor no longer wished to see that face again and turned to the palace doctors. There weren\u2019t too many doctors in the palace anymore, likely due to fear of this noble consort and the rumours swirling outside.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Long Heng was furious that this man had actually run into Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s room in the middle of the night. This was simply too arrogant!</p><br/><p>However, Luo Yunzheng\u2019s line of thought was, Shit, I fell into that young lady\u2019s trap! I clearly saw her head towards Lin Qianzi\u2019s side in a well-behaved manner. She only had her servant girl call for the doctor in between. I never thought that she would also have the nerve to ask that servant girl of hers to call Long Heng over. I clearly saw her entering the doctor\u2019s residence from afar and didn\u2019t come out after that.</p><br/><p>What did this prove? This proved that the young lady actually wasn\u2019t afraid of whatever poison he had fed her with and had made moves behind his back. Fine, he commended her loyalty to Long Heng. However, she really was an unexpected person for risking her own life!</p><br/><p>No one would be happy after being played for a fool. Thus, when the two met, they didn\u2019t even bother greeting each other before starting to battle it out. Of course, Long Heng hadn\u2019t foolishly brought over a good sum of people this time. He was afraid that this matter would spread and harm Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s reputation. Consequently, these two people fought to a standstill just like they had the last time.</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng\u2019s martial arts were a level higher than Luo Yunzheng to begin with. The prince started to gain the upper hand over Luo Yunzheng in due time. Luo Yunzheng hastily fled, but was quickly discovered by the guards. An arrow struck his shoulder in the midst of the chaotic escape. He muffled a grunt of pain. If it wasn\u2019t for the gadgets on his body, it was very likely that he would\u2019ve died here.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know where he was after that frantic escape, so he just squirmed his way into a nearby room. He hadn\u2019t expected to find a quiet man sitting inside the room. When the quiet man saw Luo Yunzheng, he wasn\u2019t surprised, but smiled instead. Luo Yunzheng squinted. It seems he\u2019d just entered a wolf\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>Long Heng, on the other hand, was beyond worried at this point and rushed to the garden where Bai Xiangxiu was. That man must\u2019ve gone to Miss Lin\u2019s first and then had Xiangxiu call for a doctor. It\u2019d been his oversight that had left this loophole open. Actually, he\u2019d originally shouted out to prevent Luo Yunzheng from entering, but that was only for show. The guards situated there weren\u2019t all that strong. He also knew that it was impossible to prevent Luo Yunzheng from entering if he truly wanted to.</p><br/><p>It would seem that this character had grown courageous for that woman, and truth be told, it\u2019d actually be a good development if he took that woman away. But Long Heng hadn\u2019t thought that Luo Yunzheng would actually barge into where Long Heng\u2019s own woman was after he\u2019d entered the grounds. If he\u2019d harmed her at all, then Long Heng would utterly annihilate him. </p><br/><p>He fretted as he walked. He\u2019d never expected his own small woman to be so formidable. She\u2019d actually informed him of the situation by writing on Xiao Shi\u2019s palm, and had her pass on a message when she was at the doctor\u2019s. This wasn\u2019t something to be dismissed as a small matter. The average person would only know to panic after being threatened. It was a considerably difficult task to think of ways to escape. </p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, the fact that she\u2019d thought of and executed this plan so easily with her maid was already enough to persuade Long Heng of her composure under pressure. Moreover, Luo Yunzheng had wanted to wait for news at her residence. This meant that he hadn\u2019t dared easily make a move, and had likely been surveilling them from the distance. He never would\u2019ve imagined that he\u2019d eventually fall into Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s trap. </p><br/><p>Just as he was about to charge inside, he saw Bai Xiangxiu sending the doctor out. She saw him coming over from afar. As a good subordinate, Bai Xiangxiu hurried over to ask, \u201cYour Highness, are you injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s heart warmed at her concern and lightly shook his head. However, just as he turned his head to look inside, Bai Xiangxiu immediately responded. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Her condition has only worsened.\u201d She signalled the doctor with her eyes as she spoke. </p><br/><p>The doctor had already promised when they were inside that he wouldn\u2019t speak of this matter to anyone. Seeing the clear signals from her eyes, he stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s just a common cold.\u201d Yeah right.</p><br/><p>Long Heng raised his eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d He shifted his gaze to Bai Xiangxiu and saw that she had turned her head to one side, averting her gaze. This was clearly a sign of a guilty conscience. </p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about you?\u201d She seemed to be fine on the outside, but with her timidness, there must be another reason why she could handle this matter so calmly. He\u2019d thought that she would immediately shake her head with a \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>It completely took him by surprise when Bai Xiangxiu blinked and responded, \u201cHe fed me poison and said that if I didn\u2019t do as I was told or if I mentioned this matter to you, then I would\u2026\u201d Her words trailed off as she copied Luo Yunzheng\u2019s action of running a finger across her own throat.</p><br/><p>Terror stuck Long Heng\u2019s heart as he heard these words. How could she still use this sort of tone when talking about such a large matter like this? \u201cDoctor, follow this prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted Bai Xiangxiu into his arms, as his face set into a cold mask. He burst into a sprint, heading straight for his residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe direction seems to be wrong. It seems as if\u2026\u201d Oh my! The expression on the male lead\u2019s face is so scary! She immediately tucked her head down like an ostrich and didn\u2019t dare say another word. </p><br/><p>Long Heng placed her on his large bed and glanced at the doctor. The doctor\u2019s finger trembled after he took Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s pulse. He looked at Long Heng, \u201cShe has indeed been poisoned, but this humble servant lacks in sufficient medical expertise. Hence, I am unable to discern what this poison is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Long Heng knew that nothing would come of him trying to force the doctor. With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the man. He paced in circles a few times like an injured leopard before he found his way to Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s side. He softened his voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will find a way to cure the poison.\u201d </p><br/><p>A poison that came from the jianghu needed the attention of a jianghu doctor. He wasn\u2019t short on such people. </p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I believe you.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu nodded. She really did believe Long Heng, since the novel had once expounded on a plotline where the female lead had been poisoned by the supporting male character and forced to accompany him. In the end, the male lead had found someone to cure the poison. </p><br/><p>Even though the process had been torturous on the heartstrings, the outcome had eventually come out to be good. Moreover, with the male lead\u2019s capabilities, he would be able to find someone to cure the poison very quickly. She remembered that this poison wasn\u2019t anything serious. It would only make a person feel slightly dazed, like the blood had been drained from her head. </p><br/><p>The female lead had been in a continual daze, but the male lead and Duan Yunying\u2019s impression of her had grown even better. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want that either, but that she didn\u2019t like being threatened by that rogue of a man. Besides, if she really had listened to him, then he might\u2019ve used her for more aims.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiangxiu wanted to live a quiet life and spend her days at home, she had a haughty temperament and a bottom line\u2014she didn\u2019t like being used by others. In elementary school, she\u2019d been used by a certain student to bully another student. It had finally led to that student getting into a car accident. Although they had turned out to be fine in the end, she\u2019d hated those who treated her well on the surface but used her ever since that incident. </p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng had said that he would give her the antidote once she\u2019d acceded to his wishes, but when she\u2019d looked into his eyes, she\u2019d known that no such thing would ever happen.</p><br/><p>The clandestine relations between the female lead and Luo Yunzheng were yet unclear. If she became embroiled in this mess, she would very likely be killed again.</p><br/><p>However, she had no idea that her immediate decision would immensely impact the male lead\u2019s heart. There was someone in this world who believed in him to such an extent! She was looking at him with such a pure gaze like a little fool, without any suspicions or doubt in it at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. It was also like this before. That fianc\u00e9e of his hadn\u2019t believed in him at all, nor any of the people in the entire city. It was only her who\u2019d been steadfast when defending him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Song Jiaoyue lacked the domineering air that one could find on Long Heng. These sort of men often give women the urge to conquer them. Men conquered the world with their martial prowess, while a woman conquered men by being gentle and understanding.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes. No wonder they say that young girls are easily attracted to older men. This truly is an eye-opener. Long Heng might be young, but the way he presented himself was even older than any middle-aged man. Therefore, it really wasn\u2019t a surprise that younger girls were attracted to him.</p><br/><p>Sir An was quickly depressed. Why would the prince ask him to explain himself when the meaning behind his words was perfectly clear? What other meaning could there be? He was saying that the princess consort had done something improper and wasn\u2019t suitable to be a princess consort, alright? Moreover, he hadn\u2019t come to the prince just to say these things. \u201cI mean to say that she is an unscrupulous person. Your Highness, please reconsider your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second uncle from the Long family also had something to add when he heard what Sir An had to say. \u201cHah! Your Highness, do think twice before you act.\u201d</p><br/><p>So what if they were both famous and successful? Wouldn\u2019t they still be a laughingstock if something happened during their wedding?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu clenched her fists secretly. With her fighting spirit ignited, she solidified her resolve to chase these shameless vermin away from her home. When it came to protecting her home, she would not hesitate. She suddenly stood up and no longer seemed as weak and delicate as before. She threw a sharp glare at Sir An, making him tremble and lower his head. \u201cYou are Sir An, yes? I wish to ask, have we ever even met before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d The princess consort\u2019s beauty was out of this world. It was unfortunate that they were not fated to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you bear me any grudge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cO-of course\u2026 not.\u201d Sir An\u2019s palms were slick with sweat. He was even more nervous answering her than when he was looking at the prince just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is Sir An fabricating a lie to slander me so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no\u2026 None of what I said is a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then let me ask you. Why do you speak of love, betrayal, and abandonment of morals when we have never even met?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 we have a marriage arrangement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd do you have proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2026 a scholar never goes back on his promises.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a promise between you and my father, not you and me. Besides, my father made that promise when he was drinking at your residence. Can it be that you were the fool who actually took a drunk man\u2019s joke as a promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t a joke\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen have we exchanged age cards and placed them before our ancestors\u2019 altars? Did a matchmaker even come to your home? Are there even any witnesses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWitnesses? My entire family can act as witnesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu laughed in an unreserved manner without even covering her mouth. However, this only served to enhance her beauty and made everyone gasp in amazement at how beautiful she seemed today. \u201cListen, everyone, his family is going to act as his witness. Well, who\u2019s going to prove my innocence if his entire family decides to ruin my reputation? There\u2019s no evidence of this arrangement, and we\u2019ve never even met. Barging in like this and calling me his wife, isn\u2019t this too comical? Then, if all drunken words count as promises in the future, won\u2019t this world go mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I can serve as witness for Sir An. Father has mentioned her betrothal at home, to which mother quickly nodded in agreement.\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er\u2019s tremulous voice suddenly grew stronger. She was taken aback; she wasn\u2019t used to seeing her sister act so arrogant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? If mother was willing to agree so readily, then why was your previous betrothal rescinded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2026 It was them! They were the ones who rescinded the offer, not our family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? And was it their idea as well for the Bai family to voluntarily gift them three hundred taels of silver in order to rescind the betrothal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Rong\u2019er hadn\u2019t expected her sister to know about that! She bit her lip in frustration and looked down. \u201cHe\u2019s just a scholar. Who knows how long it might take him to finally pass the bar to become an official? It was only right for us to rescind the marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow despicable of you.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu continued, \u201cWho would believe the words of such a despicable person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Rong\u2019er was so angry that her cheeks had flushed red. However, she couldn\u2019t say anything else due to the intense pressure from the crowd\u2019s gaze. What went wrong? Didn\u2019t that veiled sister assure me that this would never happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just proof that the Bai family is full of liars.\u201d The Long family\u2019s second aunt quickly interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s voice cut through the air like a knife. \u201cThe manor was already well aware of all this when we accepted the princess consort into the manor. We even made sure that the An family was a willing party before we did such a thing. Both parties had talked, and not a single copper was offered to settle this matter. Aren\u2019t all of you just trying to make a fuss by bringing up this matter during this joyous occasion? But since you\u2019ve already brought up the matter, our manor does indeed feel that we should provide you some compensation. Otherwise, this matter might never be put to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Why compensate them when we\u2019ve done nothing wrong? It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s a mastermind behind the scenes here. Bai Xiangxiu furrowed her brows while looking at Long Heng. She didn\u2019t know why he was doing this.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was looking at Song Jiaoyue. If Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s sister hadn\u2019t been so rotten, he might\u2019ve actually pushed the sister to Song Jiaoyue. That would\u2019ve stopped Song Jiaoyue from looking at his princess consort so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, how do you think this should be settled?\u201d asked the eunuch.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. There\u2019s no doubt that the Bai family is in the wrong. However, my wife didn\u2019t know of such matters as she\u2019d been living a sheltered life in my manor. Since the Bai family has another daughter, why don\u2019t we betroth her to the An family so that the Bai family can correct their previous misdoings?\u201d Long Heng\u2019s smile was completely guileless and without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sir An and Bai Rong\u2019er yelled their objections at the same time, but the old madame had had enough. \u201cThe man that I\u2019ve sent to the Bai family has returned with news that Sir Bai has agreed to this arrangement. Eunuch, this should be enough for you to report that your work is done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThings are exactly just as you\u2019ve said, Old Madame,\u201d the eunuch replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold. Tell me, who reported this to the emperor?\u201d Long Heng felt that if it\u2019d been anyone else, they would\u2019ve called off the wedding by now. Nobody would ever marry a woman who was accused of being an unscrupulous and power hungry liar with no morals. He never would\u2019ve believed that Bai Xiangxiu was that kind of woman when she\u2019d been through the thick and thin with him. Therefore, he concluded that Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mother might be the one behind this.</p><br/><p>The old madame was even more composed. She already knew of this entire charade before she even took Bai Xiangxiu into the manor. She\u2019d given her consent to continue the bowing rites only because she was sure that someone was actively trying to sabotage their wedding ceremony. Her son simply had too many enemies. Therefore, she must clearly delineate between friend and foe. The enemy\u2019s plans had been almost foolproof this time. Ultimately, the Long family had been too cautious and not fallen for the trap.</p><br/><p>The eunuch smiled, \u201cI am here only to perform my duties. I\u2019m afraid everything else about this matter is hidden to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng never imagined for a second that the eunuch would sell out the mastermind, he just wanted to inform the crowd that there was someone trying to do him harm. And to do that, they were trying to harm the people around him, starting with Bai Xiangxiu, whom the citizens in the capital were praising as the female Zhuge Liang. Now that Prince Rong had returned, tales about her journey were reaching new heights along with her reputation. It was only logical that somebody would try to take her out first. Even though there was no overt discussion, everyone knew that Long Heng and the emperor were now somewhat odds with each other, and that this wasn\u2019t a recent development.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He caught the falling bowl with his hand and flashed a cute smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already extremely late, so go scare others with that kind of nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only speak loudly like this when you\u2019re by my side, but you\u2019re always cautious when you\u2019re by his side. Doesn\u2019t that kind of life make you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>So Yu Kuang could indeed feel that. She continued to lie there, staring straight up, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it. And it\u2019s gotten a lot better. His temperament has also warmed considerably, and he is very good to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like people like Song Jiaoyue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense. I was only admiring him, get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said it himself. We drank too much wine once, and he said that the original person in your heart was him, but it was a pity he did not cherish it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, that was also something of the past. I\u2019m very happy right now. I will be the happiest woman in the world as long as nothing happens to Long Heng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you have a child with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu became nervous. Why was Yu Kuang speaking such ambiguous words today?</p><br/><p>However, Yu Kuang looked into the distance, a faraway look in his eyes as he said, \u201cI grew up in White Cloud Mountain. Even from my earliest days, I\u2019ve never cared about anything else besides martial arts. I knew I had a responsibility to bring the White Cloud Mountain to its greatest height, and in order to do that I even sealed my own heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThus, Yu Sh\u016b was born, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know, but when I am Yu Sh\u016b, I am truly happy, because he could do things that I would be forever be afraid of doing. He really misses you. I can feel it on the eve of every full moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only a child,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t want to delve too deep into this topic, but Yu Kuang had already gotten a full headstart. He spoke of Yu Sh\u016b\u2019s feelings and then of his. Even he himself didn\u2019t know that he was such a talkative person. He wasn\u2019t just looking for a chat, he had a rather peculiar feeling of wanting to protect Bai Xiangxiu but being unable to draw close to her. His heart had been unclear in the past, but when he began to open up, he naturally spoke his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also feel differently about you. I will do my best to help you get whatever you want. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are Long Heng\u2019s concubine or someone else\u2019s wife. I only want to be good to you, because you really are too cruel to yourself.\u201d He reached out to touch Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face. She looked a bit perplexed, but then again, she had also sustained injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Kuang, I think it would be best if you leave now. I need to get some rest.\u201d This wasn\u2019t good. Right now, it almost seemed like he was about to declare his love for her. It\u2019d been only Yu Sh\u016b in the past, but it seemed that Yu Kuang had developed these feelings for her. She really didn\u2019t understand these men. She\u2019d been so ugly lately that even she couldn\u2019t bear to look at herself. It was up and down mountains and hills everyday, growing steadily darker beneath the sun. Shouldn\u2019t men who like beautiful women run far, far away under these circumstances? Why were they all flocking to her instead?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was the one by your side, I could allow you to be as free as you\u2019d like your entire life, with no restrictions whatsoever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu tugged on the quilt, deciding she didn\u2019t want to hear his words. But no matter how she tried to sleep, her thoughts kept her awake, running through her head like a herd of galloping horses. After all, Yu Kuang was an excellent person. He was a vaunted wulin Alliance Head, but here he was protecting a little concubine like her. His feelings were never destined to be reciprocated. She could only hope that he would give up soon and go find a woman who was worth his love and protection.</p><br/><p>As her period had been particularly fierce for the past few days, she found herself in a drowsy state of mind all day. It didn\u2019t get much better even when she drank some medicine. However, Long Heng\u2019s troops were advancing quickly. They were remaking camp every two days as they advanced a few kilometers every day.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu ran through a few mental calculations. They had breached three or four enemy camps thus far. According to this speed, they would be at the enemy headquarters soon. Even Long Heng felt it strange why his own soldiers and officers were this gungho. It seemed like each battle was one fought on the line of life and death. It wasn\u2019t until one day when Bai Xiangxiu walked out of the tent and stretched, basking in the sunlight that she saw all of the patrolling soldiers pass by with looks of terror. </p><br/><p>She touched her face, and asked, baffled, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>A little soldier somewhat emotionally said, \u201cMadame Bai, you\u2019re still alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!? I was never dead!\u201d What does this mean? It was almost as if she\u2019d come back from the dead.</p><br/><p>The soldier immediately felt that he had said something wrong and scratched his head, \u201cI heard everyone say that you\u2019d been assassinated by the enemy. I didn\u2019t think that you were safe and sound. Everyone will stop worrying now. Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng immediately understood. It turned out they thought that his wife was dead, which was why they all looked at him with such strict expressions. It would also explain the fervent style of battle he\u2019d been seeing lately whenever they engaged the enemy. They thought they were avenging the death of his wife!</p><br/><p>As he kneaded his forehead, he reflected that for some reason, his luck was always terrific when Bai Xiangxiu was with him. Everything would always turn out for the better. For example, this unexpected mishap had actually expanded his nation\u2019s territory by several thousand kilometers. It really was a wonder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came out of the tent before when we set up camp. Did you all not see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, we were too focused on killing the enemy and didn\u2019t notice what was behind us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026so, I was randomly dead for so many days?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu glanced at Long Heng, at a complete loss for words.</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng suddenly frowned, \u201cWhy are you up and about when your injuries haven\u2019t healed yet? Go back and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInjuries\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu subconsciously clutched at the corner of her dress. Did her monthly period count as an injury?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will have my revenge on them for daring to be so violent towards a weak girl like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the little soldier nodded sagely when he finished. The group of patrolling soldiers then walked off.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu forced a smile, \u201cAren\u2019t you\u2026 being too devious?\u201d This wasn\u2019t quite how one encouraged another person!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really respect you!\u201d Long Heng felt a bit proud. His little wife was unexpectedly a great help!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are very cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense. How can you call a group of rough, burly men cute?\u201d He really didn\u2019t know what to say to her. They couldn\u2019t engage in any intimate gestures either with so many pairs of eyes on them. He could only urge her back into her tent to rest.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu began to ask about the situation of the state soldiers. Long Heng pointed out their location on the map he had drawn, \u201cMost of the enemy troops will be left behind after we cross this mountain. There are poisonous fog, various vipers and fierce beasts protecting the outskirts. It will be a bit difficult to charge through them.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a tropical rainforest,\u201d she nodded as she absorbed Long Heng\u2019s explanation. She began to think quickly; because this forest was extremely vast, it would take them around five days to travel through it. The most crucial thing was that it was extremely dangerous inside. If one wasn\u2019t careful, the army could be completely wiped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder their scattered troops could provoke us with such impunity before. It turns out that they had every confidence in this layer of natural protection,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pointed at the map as she spoke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

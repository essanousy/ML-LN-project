Gentle, beautiful and sensible, his woman was better than her in every aspect.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi could admit to herself that she was a little jealous, but this man was already destined to be her future husband. Other than him, she could not marry anybody else. She couldn\u2019t even run away. Women were the weaker sex, and so she could only suffer this unfairness. \u201cI only wanted to apologize for that day.\u201d As for what exactly the apology was for, she would never say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Long Heng was still filled with resentment over the leg wound he had to suffer, and the situation he\u2019d witnessed had truly filled his heart with disgust.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was hurt by this response, her dejected eyes drifting towards Bai Xiangxiu. Bai Xiangxiu was confused as she just bore the gaze. She was still innocent, just staying on the sidelines, right? I haven\u2019t done anything to her, have I? She had wanted to put in a few good words for the female lead, but did not dare to move at all when she saw the male lead\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>What was it with the male and female leads? Were they currently in the midst of a spat?</p><br/><p>The book had indeed mentioned that the two had quarrelled a lot, breaking up and getting back together over and over again, but all this had been predicated on the male lead\u2019s prodigious interest in the female lead. But looking at the situation now, where was the male lead\u2019s interest? She couldn\u2019t see it at all!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked left and right, finally deciding to keep her mouth shut. Across the room, in Song Jiaoyue\u2019s eyes, her expression displayed her nervousness, or even fright, at being caught in the middle of the two sides. Not knowing who to help and who not to help, if it was already like this now, it would only be more difficult for her in the future.</p><br/><p>He coughed lightly, breaking this awkward atmosphere, \u201cWe have a show prepared for after the monks reconvene, and we can watch it when we enter our seats. Will the few of you come to the Lotus Garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Lotus Garden had been newly established by the old master specifically for this vegetarian meet. He had completely demolished and rebuilt the entire garden, adding a Buddhist hall for him to reside within in the future.</p><br/><p>The Buddhist hall could fit up several dozen tables within. A screen separated the two sides in the middle, allowing men and women to be seated separately. There was another Buddhist table, where the Grand Masters and the monks would be having their vegetarian meal.</p><br/><p>The old master was seated together with the Grand Masters, and there weren\u2019t that many female guests either. The women who had come were mostly devout Buddhist madams. Young girls or daughter-in-laws were a rare sight.</p><br/><p>Back to the awkward quartet, Song Jiaoyue had finally gotten them out of the room with great difficulty, and they\u2019d arrived at the Lotus Garden. There, at long last, they had to separate.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu just happened to have to walk together with Miss Lin. Long Heng didn\u2019t feel comfortable with this, feeling that that soft, fragile n\u00e8e Bai would lose out greatly if she had to walk with that Miss Lin. By this time, he\u2019d actually completely forgotten that Miss Lin was really his main wife, with Bai Xiangxiu nothing but a concubine.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was similarly despondent. Why was Lin Qianzi\u2019s gaze so strange, especially when she\u2019d looked at her with hatred and resentment, making her feel so uneasy? The fine hair on her arm were prickling from the incessant stare, so she had to find something to say. \u201cMiss Lin, how have you been since we last met?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi felt a stab in her heart, feeling as though she\u2019d been betrayed, but she still responded. \u201cEverything is fine. I just feel that the prince seems to be harboring some misunderstanding about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Prince, he\u2026 just has a bit of a cold personality. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu continued speaking up for Long Heng, just as she had before in order not to end up as cannon fodder. At this rate, she felt that she\u2019d reached the glorious rank of \u2018Most Filial Concubine\u2019 already.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi, however, was no longer willing to believe her. \u201cIs that so, Madame Bai? Then, could you please help me to tell the prince that I thank him greatly for saving me, but since our marriage is inevitable, to please not make things difficult for my cousin and other people in the future,\u201d Finishing her words in one breath, she turned and entered the room.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was completely dazed as she watched Miss Lin walk into the room. She was completely stunned by the female lead\u2019s holy mother-esque actions. It was one thing that she\u2019d hooked up with other men, but she even didn\u2019t allow her fiance to be jealous. Wasn\u2019t this a little much?</p><br/><p>While she didn\u2019t know what the male lead had done to the female lead, if these words didn\u2019t anger the male lead to death, he\u2019d probably be spitting blood at the very least. What does she mean, that he can\u2019t do anything about the situation even if she cuckolds him? He can only rub his nose and think himself unlucky?</p><br/><p>She scratched her head. These words were truly difficult to pass on. However, the other party had already told her to pass on the message. If it didn\u2019t reach the male lead\u2019s ears, wouldn\u2019t she be the one at fault then? Out of consideration for her safety, she decided to pass on these words to the male lead as soon as the opportunity arose. As for what reaction he might have, who cares!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes to the heavens, praying that whatever bothersome problems between the male and female lead would stay far away from her. She would be able to return home just after a few more months. Who\u2019d still care about their lover\u2019s squabbles then?</p><br/><p>After sorting out her expression to a semblance of a docile concubine\u2019s look, she patted her face lightly and slowly entered the hall. As a concubine, even if she had helped someone, it still could not be acknowledged openly. Therefore, the position she was assigned was also some ways to the back. Actually, this position was also a way of Madame Song giving her face. Most concubines would not even be given the chance to appear at such a major event.</p><br/><p>For example, despite hosting this affair in their own home, Song Jiaoyue\u2019s women had not received seats. They could only serve others off to the side. Yu Se, for example, had been sent by Song Jiaoyue to serve her. Indubitably, the Song family respected her a lot. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have assigned a seat to her and also sent people to take care of her.</p><br/><p>The show being performed was a great performance and also a classical story of Buddhism, persuading people to be good and not perform evil actions, and others. As someone who had read stories ever since young, Bai Xiangxiu was extremely calm and composed, but some of the other women were truly absorbed in it. That was to be expected as such shows were not usually acted out. One would only have the chance to see them in person at Buddhist gatherings.</p><br/><p>The few madames Bai Xiangxiu shared a table with were all wives of low-ranking officials, but they were also greatly dignified in their appearance and mannerisms. It seemed like they had put in much thought in attending this gathering, at least not letting themselves fall behind others in terms of appearance.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Bai Xiangxiu appeared much more plain. She tended to shy away from the accessories of ancient times, they were much too heavy. Although they looked nice, wearing too many of them was truly exhausting. However, in order to not let the Prince Li Manor lose face, she has still placed some valuable accessories in her hair, even though they were still slightly inferior to these well-dressed madames.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t think much of it, but a madame had noticed instead. She covered her little mouth and asked in the midst of a break between shows, \u201cI wonder which family this madame is from? I have never seen you before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu smiled slightly, Xiao Shi helping her mistress to answer from the side, \u201cThis is the fourth madame of the Prince Li Manor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s the fourth madame. You\u2019re truly pretty.\u201d While her lips spoke those words, her thought ran in a different direction. No wonder her looks are so seductive, so she\u2019s just a concubine. How could a concubine could also appear here? Just how did this Song Manor arrange their matters? While those at this table were lower ranked, it still wasn\u2019t to the point of having to share a table with a concubine!</p><br/><p>How could Yu Se not notice the madame\u2019s thoughts, as she immediately interjected with a chuckle, \u201cFourth Madam is really remarkable, she is a great savior of the Song Manor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu knew that Yu Se was speaking up for her, but she hadn\u2019t placed herself in the position of a concubine anyway. It could be said that from the very beginning, she had never once considered herself as someone of this world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

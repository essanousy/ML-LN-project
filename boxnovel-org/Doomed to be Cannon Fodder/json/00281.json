Luo Yunzheng followed them out, his face looking thoughtful. All things considered, Su Yun had been a one of a kind opponent, so Long Heng granted her death wish. However, for Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s safety, he remained just outside.</p><br/><p>But before the door shut, Bai Xiangxiu could be heard saying, \u201cDump some water on her and wake her. There\u2019s no need to waste time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026. oh.\u201d After the men left, Bai Xiangxiu sat to the side to take some time to reflect. Dealing with Su Yun recently had put her in mind of the female lead. Suddenly, she realized she\u2019d made quite the wise decision to remain low key in this world. Although she may not have experienced significant ups and downs, at least her life was relatively stable. Well alright, she was technically a widow right now, so life wasn\u2019t entirely stable.</p><br/><p>Su Yun woke up just as she was reminiscing. She moaned painfully at first, but gradually regained consciousness. She appeared a bit lost when she opened her eyes, but once she noticed Bai Xiangxiu, it was as if she had regained all her energy. \u201cWho are you really? Why was everything going so smoothly before I met you, but began to fall apart after I encountered you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yun, I\u2019m not the reason why you lost. You lost because human lives mean nothing to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! Why can others be like this and I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat happens in novels and TV dramas. It doesn\u2019t work like that in reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you are a transmigrator! I was right! How could you treat someone from your hometown so cruelly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSu Yun, you\u2019re certainly one to speak. So what if you knew I was from your hometown? Based on your personality, would you have been lenient towards me? I have no doubt that you would\u2019ve constantly tested ways to eliminate me. For instance, back in Tranquil City, those diversionary tactics was clearly meant to assess me. You sent an assassin targeting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? You were helping my enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut from my perspective, they are also my enemies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut afterwards, you still moved against me despite the fact that we were from the same world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen how anxious the doctors\u2019 family members were when they were frantically trying to locate their loved ones? Are you aware of how tragic the lives of the wives and sons are now without their husbands and fathers? Are you aware that one of the wives bled to death during childbirth after hearing the news? You never heard a word. Why? Because you only have eyes for yourself. You only care about your power and status. In order to attain what you want, you treat humans like ants. For despicable people like you, this outcome is already quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! What about you!? It\u2019s fine for you to seduce men and get them to kill for you? You\u2019re like a little white lotus hiding behind others while you enjoy yourself. What\u2019s the difference between you and me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t allow my man to kill innocent people. I don\u2019t make him do things for my own selfish reasons. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are selfish. Aren\u2019t you selfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am selfish. I can freely admit that. I would be more than willing to hurt others in order to protect my family. But I would never kill so many people because of a face. Of course, I don\u2019t expect you to understand. After all, you have always been a spoiled rich young lady without the slightest ounce of respect for others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You knew me from before, don\u2019t you?\u201d Su Yun seemed to have realized why she had lost. So this person knew me from before?! Who is she? Is it my scheming younger cousin? Or my love rival? Or perhaps, a random jealous slut?</p><br/><p>\u201cI do know you, so I was well aware of your personality. I knew that you have no moral integrity. That\u2019s why I have never told you who I am. But now, there is no harm in telling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Su Yun wanted to sit up straight but it wasn\u2019t possible. Her body didn\u2019t have any more strength. She could barely see the person clearly. \u201cTell me who you are, so I can rest in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the person you looked down on so so much. The girl who sold flowers\u2014Liu Yangyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! So it was you!? Did you want revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I only wanted to live in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLive a peaceful life?! Liu Yangyang, don\u2019t be a fool. That\u2019s not possible. Transmigrators don\u2019t belong in this world or time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I belong here. I have a child and a husband. Whereas, you have nothing, regardless of whether it\u2019s in the modern or ancient times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I have everything. I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you have? People who miss you? They\u2019re only into you because of your kinky tricks. Those who were loyal to you are probably all dead, and they mean nothing to you either. So, ultimately, there is only one outcome for you in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pretty damn cold, right? Actually, Su Yun\u2019s current circumstances was the ultimate revenge. Yes, Bai Xiangxiu held some hate for Su Yun. Regardless of modern times or ancient times, Su Yun was the root of some of traumatic experiences. So if she didn\u2019t get any revenge, she would be too much like the holy mother! Don\u2019t blame her for piling on the hurt when Su Yun was down. Su Yun had done her fair share of hurting others as well. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t mind at throwing a few more stones at someone like Su Yun one whit.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Yangyang. I curse you! I hope you die! I hope your man betrays you. I hope your son will have a bad ending\u2026.!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crack! Bai Xiangxiu was furious. So she reached out and slapped Su Yun right across the face. She coldly stated, \u201cCursing is already out of date. Or do you think that you have superpowers from transmigrating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Heng, come in! Long Heng! I know you\u2019re outside!\u201d Su Yun loudly screeched. Still outside, Long Heng quickly rushed in to see what was going on. Seeing Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s close proximity to Su Yun, he quickly pulled her away. \u201cBe careful. She might hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Right now, she\u2019s\u2026.\u201d But before Bai Xiangxiu could finish her sentence, Su Yun cut in. \u201cLong Heng! I told you from the start, don\u2019t think this little bitch actually loves you! She has another identity!. She\u2019s from the same place I am. She\u2019s going to leave you sooner or later and just leave behind a beautiful body. Also, she\u2019s not a good person\u2026 she\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Crack! Su Yun\u2019s head spun all the way around as she landed on the ground with a dull thud. No more words came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was frightened. The innocent Yu Sh\u016b cocked his head as he looked down at her, \u201cBig sister, she really couldn\u2019t take a hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>No duh! Who could take a hit from you? But Bai Xiangxiu was still a bit shocked. Just like that, a life had been snuffed out. Long Heng patted her on the head, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t scared. I just feel like\u2026.she shouldn\u2019t have came here.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu sighed deeply. In the modern times, Su Yun was a bad person, but at least she didn\u2019t kill so many people. Modern society had laws and restrictions that shackled people with those urges. But when Su Yun came here, she felt like she was peerless and unstoppable. That was what led to this outcome. Sometimes, humans must not view themselves too highly.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng, \u201cShe\u2019s dead. In my opinion, we shouldn\u2019t keep the corpse. I\u2019ll bury her in an unmarked grave somewhere.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

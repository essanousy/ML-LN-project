This was definitely unnatural! If Su Yun\u2019s plastic surgeon was brought to the modern times, he would be insanely rich! Aren\u2019t his abilities a little too scary? No. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking things. She likely has some sort of supernatural ability or something from her transmigration!</p><br/><p>But isn\u2019t that even more illogical? If she did, she would\u2019ve used them already. Bai Xiangxiu could feel her brain melting, but she didn\u2019t show a hint of it on her face. She carefully cut out an offshoot of the cactus and put it into another pot. Heh. You\u2019re about to bring this biological wiretap back home. Don\u2019t blame me for the consequences.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Prince Li? I haven\u2019t seen him in the manor yet. His Majesty had asked me to apologize for what happened yesterday. I wonder if\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Oh, he\u2019s gone out hunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Why would he go out hunting after such an enormous occurrence? Does he actually not care about Princess Consort Li?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the type person who can stay still. Since His Majesty is wounded too, why don\u2019t you return and keep him some company? His Highness will be grateful for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Grateful? Him going out hunting so early in the morning and the fact that he didn\u2019t bother entering the palace to convey his gratitude clearly means that Bai Xiangxiu told him everything. But he\u2019s not the type of man to just submit to humiliation. Just what in the world is he planning? Did he even really go out to hunt?</p><br/><p>Long Heng had come back while Su Yun\u2019s mind was still filled with doubt, holding a bloody fawn in his hand. Bai Xiangxiu no longer fainted at the sight of blood, but she couldn\u2019t help but furrow her brows when she saw blood drip all over the floor. Noble Consort Su frowned too. He really went out hunting? And what are you trying to tell me by showing me this bloody fawn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d Long Heng looked at Noble Consort Su with a curious look on his face. He might not be familiar with her appearance, but he already knew who she was as he\u2019d already heard people talking about her outside. She\u2019s Noble Consort Su?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Noble Consort Su. Your Highness, what are you doing? Take that away!\u201d He\u2019s probably trying to frighten the noble consort. Unfortunately, she isn\u2019t going to be scared one bit by that. There also seems to be a little bit of suspicion on her face. She\u2019s definitely not an ordinary person. Bai Xiangxiu was now a hundred percent sure that this woman was Su Yun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis deer was a vigorous one. Its vital blood is very nourishing. I will have the servants serve one bowl to you later to nourish your body. Noble Consort Su, would you like a bowl as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I should leave the both of you to your business. Blood won\u2019t remain fresh for long.\u201d Due to Long Heng\u2019s baleful aura, Su Yan couldn\u2019t help but fear and hate him for disfiguring her. She stood as she made to leave. Bai Xiangxiu handed over the cactus to the palace maid beside her. \u201cThis plant is best kept indoors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It was only when Noble Consort Su finally left with her entourage that Bai Xiangxiu could finally feel at ease. Long Heng definitely hated them. They just needed to force him to make the first move. Since he couldn\u2019t bring his army from Shu County, he\u2019d have to rely on the men currently in the capital to exact his revenge on the emperor. But most of those men had already sworn loyalty to the emperor, so Long Heng\u2019s plans would be exposed immediately. After that, the entire Prince Li Manor would cease to exist, and so would Long Heng and Bai Xiangxiu!</p><br/><p>Su Yan was still feeling quite vexed. As a person from modern times, she\u2019d actually suffered a loss at the hands of Bai Xiangxiu, a person from the olden times! That woman was always acting like a white lotus flower, yet she was a deep schemer. Most importantly, she even dared to stab the emperor and cause them to suffer a loss with no way to retaliate! She will definitely become the scourge of our existence if she continues to stay by Long Heng\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was a conflict of their personalities, Su Yun hated Bai Xiangxiu more than anyone else. However, she\u2019d come to the conclusion that Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t a transmigrator like her, because she couldn\u2019t find any qualities from a modern woman even after a long period of observance. She concluded that because Bai Xiangxiu was smarter than the usual and had a deft touch with plants, it wasn\u2019t impossible for a person from this time to do what she had done.</p><br/><p>Su Yun was also speechless when she thought about the emperor. It\u2019s only a small injury! And yet that breeding stallion is so out of sorts because he can\u2019t visit his concubines. Upon such a thought, she became rather cross and irritable. She would never have wanted to sleep with that public toilet of a man if it weren\u2019t for his power and status. Unfortunately, the opposite was not the case. The only way she could gain power was to stay by his side. If she would be able to bear his child, the entire nation would be hers for the taking!</p><br/><p>To Su Yun, the palace was just like her workplace, and the emperor was her boss. A subordinate that didn\u2019t aim to rise in the ranks wasn\u2019t a good subordinate. So, she was always thinking about ways to get promoted. If she wanted to be promoted, then she would have to eliminate everything that blocked her way. She could then obtain a few boy toys when she\u2019d finally risen to the top. Hadn\u2019t Empress Wu Zetian done the same? What fear would she have when she had no desire to leave a legacy for the annals of history?</p><br/><p>She returned to the palace to deal with her boss and come up with a plan at the same time. The emperor could not move on his own, so he would need her help to relieve his desires. As a woman from the modern age, she had all sorts of ways to make him feel like he was in heaven without needing him to do anything.</p><br/><p>In the Prince Li Manor, Long Heng immediately tossed the fawn away after Su Yun left. He also got the servants to clean up the blood. \u201cDo you feel any discomfort?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot anymore. I\u2019ve already gotten used to the sight of blood on the battlefield.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu frowned as she continued. \u201cTell me, how do you think Su Yun was able to obtain such a beautiful face? It\u2019s so strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know for sure that she\u2019s Su Yun?\u201d Long Heng asked. It really is that woman after all. He had a hunch, but couldn\u2019t be as sure as Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer mannerisms and speech convey her contempt for men, which is something very similar to the Su Yun we knew. Also, it\u2019s womanly intuition. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is Su Yun whether I believe you or not. We must find a way to deal with her, or your troubles will be endless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. But how are we going to get rid of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we start by finding out how she was able to change so much? A woman who wants to be so beautiful would never want others to know about her past. She will surely receive an enormous blow if the truth were to spread.\u201d</p><br/><p>Women that undergo plastic surgery were mostly like this. Since the couple had free time now, they might as well take advantage of the situation by plucking the feather from a goose whenever it passes by. Long Heng pinched her cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, their investigation soon turned up something much bigger. It seemed that a short while ago, quite a few miracle doctors had suddenly gone missing. All of them had very different reasons for their disappearance, but the fact was that they had all disappeared. Moreover, those that disappeared all specialized in treating external wounds. Some of them had entered the palace, disappearing after they left the palace. Others didn\u2019t enter the palace, but they were all very famous. It didn\u2019t matter if it was a doctor from the jianghu, the enemy nation, or just a doctor with no affiliation. A few dozen of them disappeared, all around the same time.</p><br/><p>When Long Heng came back from making his inquiries, he brought someone back with him. This someone was the long absent Yu Kuang! He\u2019d been missing ever since he\u2019d come back to the capital. He\u2019d been in such a rush that he hadn\u2019t even said goodbye before he\u2019d left.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t try to be a busybody because she thought it had something to do with the jianghu. She never imagined that they\u2019d meet again today. Yu Kuang was still looked as saintly as ever and flashed a gentle smile when he saw Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>They greeted each other like very old friends that hadn\u2019t seen each other for a long time. Bai Xiangxiu also smiled and replied, \u201cMm. It\u2019s been a long time. How have you been?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He\u2019d already known everything before he arrived. They\u2019d finally forced the woman away. What was this nonsense about resting at a temple? She was being thrown out after they\u2019d finished using her. She\u2019d likely never be able to return to this opulent yet empty Prince Li Manor. But here Long Heng sat, coldly aloof as usual. Song Jiaoyue treated that person as an untouchable treasure in his heart, while his friend treated her like a blade of grass! How utterly disappointing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Heng, she was personally preparing the food in the icy cold tent last time for the dowager empress\u2019 funeral procession. Do you know how tiring it was to do that for an entire day? She didn\u2019t even take any of the credit for it either, giving it all to the manor and the old madame. But think about what you\u2019ve done! You\u2019ve thrown her into the temple to suffer, and about to take a new, beautiful wife to enjoy the comforts of life in your manor?!\u201d Song Jiaoyue had drunk a little too much, so his words were overly emotional.</p><br/><p>Long Heng could finally hear the undertones that were previously hidden. His friend was speaking up for Bai Xiangxiu, and doing so with quite a sour attitude. He\u2019d only felt hints of it before, but now he was certain of it. \u201cSong Jiaoyue, do you know what you\u2019re saying?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng slammed his hand on the table and surged to his feet, his face black with anger as he glared at Song Jiaoyue.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue didn\u2019t back down at all. He responded coldly, \u201cOf course I know what I\u2019m talking about! You\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t! I\u2019ve come to wish you congratulations on your new marriage and tell you that I won\u2019t easily give her up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Jiaoyue\u2026!\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t bother continuing with words as he lunged for his friend. The two of them had tussled together since their youth, and Song Jiaoyue wasn\u2019t a weakling either. He stood his ground and returned every blow with one of his own. None of these two wanted to talk it out, and both possessed strong martial arts. Heaven and earth shuddered as the aftermath of their fight nearly turned the manor into kindling. No one dared get in the way to try and convince them otherwise.</p><br/><p>The servants could only turn to the old madame for help. She was currently quite weak with her ailment, and so sent two mamas to talk some sense into the men. Long Heng quite respected his mother and so stopped almost immediately, but Song Jiaoyue was caught up in the moment and landed a palm on Long Heng\u2019s chest before he caught himself.</p><br/><p>Blood frothed in Long Heng\u2019s chest as he spat a mouthful of blood out. He laughed coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t ever think of getting her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue clenched his fist and turned to say, \u201cLong Heng, I never voice empty words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t move at all after looking at his back, then turned to speak to his concealed guards, \u201cGo investigate this. See if they\u2019ve been in contact with each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue would never succeed in trying to steal his woman away from him! But when had this thought arisen in his mind? Long Heng had never felt so panicked, because he didn\u2019t know how the currently unhappy Bai Xiangxiu would decide after knowing of this? Yes, she was his concubine and couldn\u2019t shed this identity, but there was no way to prevent her from having someone else in her heart. If she held Song Jiaoyue in his heart, what would Long Heng do then?</p><br/><p>Long Heng paced in circles like a caged leopard for a while before finally notifying the old madame that Bai Xiangxiu was feeling uncomfortable in the temple and that Long Heng was going to take a look. As for why he\u2019d fought with Song Jiaoyue, Long Heng said it\u2019d been too long since the two of them had sparred, so they\u2019d been unable to stop once they started and it\u2019d gotten out of hand.</p><br/><p>The old madame also felt that Song Jiaoyue and Long Heng wouldn\u2019t possibly really get into a fight. They didn\u2019t really have a reason to. Therefore, she accepted his explanation at face value. The old madame also felt that it\u2019d be bad if Bai Xiangxiu grew lonely by herself in the temple. Her eldest grandson was there as well! So she happily let the male lead go to the temple.</p><br/><p>Long Heng rushed to the Eternal Peace Monastery after taking care of Lin Qianzi\u2019s matter. He was also depressed when he heard the name of the temple. Any other temple other than this one would\u2019ve been fine! He remembered a particularly irritating old monk there who had their sights set on Bai Xiangxiu! What if she decided to join the monastery in the throes of her emotional anguish? What would he do then?</p><br/><p>However, he was utterly stunned when he reached the temple, because Bai Xiangxiu had gone missing! Xiaoshi, Xiaohuan and Ye-mama were all there, and said that Bai Xiangxiu had stayed quietly within the fasting room since her arrival and hadn\u2019t left. But when they came over the next day, their mistress was gone! They were looking everywhere for her, but couldn\u2019t find her no matter how hard they looked.</p><br/><p>A chill gripped Long Heng\u2019s heart as he immediately suspected Song Jiaoyue. He had his men join the search as well as he looked through the woods on horseback. However, when he saw no sign of her after a day, he hastily paid a visit to the Song family back in the capital.</p><br/><p>Just as all this was going on, Bai Xiangxiu had actually already been kidnapped from the temple. She was groggily lying in a carriage, quite dejected. Who\u2019d kidnapped her this time? The plot had run so far from its normal course that she had no idea what was going on. Just as she was struggling and wanting to run away, someone had come in from the outside. She quickly feigned unconsciousness as the other carried her into a room, placing her on a bed without much in the way of covers at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop pretending that you\u2019re still out, or I\u2019ll do some things to you that you won\u2019t like!\u201d The rascally tone obviously belonged to Luo Yunzheng. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mouth twitched as she suddenly sat up with a frown, looking at Luo Yunzheng. The rugged man just stood there, looking at her with crossed arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have you brought me here?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt that this man was simply too bold. But more importantly, why was he after her and not Miss Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to wed Lin Qianzi after the new year, do you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe traded her for you once, which means he can do it twice. Otherwise I really don\u2019t know what I might do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt that this man was a bit perverted, or rather hate had drowned out love for him. His gaze wasn\u2019t sweet when he mentioned Miss Lin. Just what had happened? Had this man gone a bit mad? \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such was the charm of the female lead, and it was always the female supporting character who ended up hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also a cute woman. You should leave him while it\u2019s early; there might be a way out for you still.\u201d Luo Yunzheng smiled slightly and suddenly flicked a glance outside. The look in his eyes turned cold, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Luo, did you know that the imperial court has been suppressing those in the wulin lately because of your foolish actions?\u201d The voice was gentle, but the anger within was apparent.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had never heard such a lovely male voice and was curious as to who owned it. Her mind also flew furiously through the novel\u2019s plot at the same time, trying to identify which supporting character this was. However her efforts were quickly dispelled with Luo Yunzheng\u2019s next words. He laughed coldly, \u201cDoes Alliance Head Yu wish to stick his nose in matters of the Cloudlake Faction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally. I look into any power that threatens the wulin. Boss Luo, please stop your actions, or\u2026\u201d A pale, white figure floated in from outside as the words tapered off. Bai Xiangxiu had already guessed who it was when she heard the title \u201cAlliance Head Yu\u201d. This was a passerby that had been mentioned only briefly in the novel!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

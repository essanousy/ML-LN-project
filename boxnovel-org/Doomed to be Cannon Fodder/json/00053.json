He really had the guts to do it. That land was worth at least thousands taels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame him, it\u2019s all my fault\u2026 Let me go and I will definitely beg His Highness to change his mind and not force you!\u201d When had Lin Qianzi ever suffered such circumstances? She\u2019d initially thought it would be interesting to travel with a man she\u2019d encountered in the jianghu. However, as time went by, she was homesick and wanted to go back. But he had forbidden her from doing exactly that.</p><br/><p>\u201cForce? I gave up that den willingly. I didn\u2019t want to go head to head with the Imperial army. But I have a thousand ways to make his life miserable. Do you believe me?\u201d That man walked towards Lin, lifted her chin up and forcefully kissed her on her lips. She tastes so sweet, but what a pity she\u2019s always defending that man.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt him, he\u2019s only trying to bring me back\u2026\u201d Lin Qianzi sobbed and tried to move away, but the man didn\u2019t listen at all. He kept his seal on her small mouth, preventing her from speaking further.</p><br/><p>Women succumb easily to domineering men, and this man was handsome in his tyranny. Although his appearance is not as attractive as the prince\u2019s, she felt that he treated her reasonably well. But men in the jianghu had their own ways of doing things. Although she was not yet accustomed to some of their mannerisms, she was too captivated by him to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 stop it!\u201d Despite using all her might, Lin Qianzi couldn\u2019t push him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to stop and have your fianc\u00e9 treat you like how I do? Qian\u2019er, is your heart made of steel? You know very well how I treated you! Give it to me, right now.\u201d That was just how he was; he would do whatever his mind was set on without much consideration.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Qianzi couldn\u2019t allow him to do so. She may not have known of matters between men and women, but she knew very well that she couldn\u2019t condone going through that which was reserved for married couples in a place like this. She began struggling fiercely to free herself, shouting, \u201cNo, Luo Yunzheng, let go of me! Don\u2019t force me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo YunZheng chuckled by her ear, \u201cQian\u2019er, we are just a single step away from doing it. What part of your body and your bud have I not tasted?\u201d He lifted her up by the butt and positioned her on a boulder, ready to strip off his own clothing.</p><br/><p>Sounds of a disturbance came in with the wind. The man tch\u2019ed in irritation as his attention was diverted. He swept their clothes about in dissatisfaction and leapt out of the cave with the lady in his hands.</p><br/><p>Long Heng dashed in shortly after the two left. He picked up Miss LIn\u2019s outerwear from the floor of the cave and sneered coldly. So they\u2019ve done it already, hmm? Very good, this jianghu man really doesn\u2019t think much of me.</p><br/><p>Even though he\u2019d had moments of not wanting to marry Miss Lin, he might have married her still if the two families had put up a strong objection, but she hadn\u2019t created any trouble. However, looking at the current situation, it appeared that she had lost her chastity and was thus undesirable.</p><br/><p>Despite this, he still had to find her since he\u2019d made a promise to Minister Lin. The least that could be done was prevent any damage to Minister Lin\u2019s reputation.</p><br/><p>Long\u2019s sympathy for the woman had long since been blown into the wind. Instead of holding his warm, soft woman at home, he was out here suffering in the cold. It had also not been easy to apprehend the crafty bandit leader, Luo Yunzheng. Long Heng had had to make use of his hidden forces in the jianghu to track these two down.</p><br/><p>Long Heng tracked them to their hideout in a small town by himself that night. The place was exceedingly rundown, a favorite gathering spot for criminals. The entire town was a sordid mess, with everything ready to be bought and sold. Prostitutes and song girls came and went, lustful sounds and cries coming from all corners. It was quite difficult for a well brought up noble lady like Miss Lin to stay in such a place, but perhaps she was unable to leave even though she wanted to.</p><br/><p>He slipped past the guards in front and saw ta dim light in the rear court and a few guards around the outside.</p><br/><p>These guards looked rather serious as they stood watch. Unlike the others, they weren\u2019t gossiping or causing trouble in a drunken stupor. Long Heng\u2019s suspicions grew. He stealthily avoided the eyes of the guards to climb onto the roof.</p><br/><p>He was strong in martial arts and knew some of the jianghu\u2019s styles. After all, there were teachers for everything in the army.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d also learnt this spying technique in the army. Long Heng gently removed one of the roof tiles. It was especially important to pick up all the knacks needed for this trick. If not, he\u2019d alarm these below. </p><br/><p>The timing was also crucial, and one needed to take each step cautiously in order to leave the people below none the wiser.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had never thought that the little tricks he picked up on a whim would be put to this use He smiled wryly. As he removed the tiles carefully, the scene revealed was one that was only supposed to occur during his wedding night.</p><br/><p>His fianc\u00e9, Lin Qianzi, was beneath a slender man on the bed.She was unable to move and her clothes were unkempt. Her eyes were half closed and she was also biting her lips, looking very seductive.</p><br/><p>Although Miss Lin was born with a good appearance, her looks didn\u2019t compare to those of Madame Bai. Her facial features were greatly lacking, for example, her nostrils were especially big looking from his perspective. Snorting derisively, he watched the scene happening in a rather cold blooded fashion.</p><br/><p>She looked as though she was putting up a resistance, but it was a weak one without the slightest strength behind her motions. The man didn\u2019t actually go through with things and let her off after taking a slight bit of advantage of her. However, he continued to speak, \u201cNoble ladies like you have such good skin, so very fine and tender.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, I\u2026won\u2019t be able to hold my head high when I return.\u201d Lin Qianzi covered her face in shame while sobbing, looking very hurt now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you crying for? If I were to do something, it wouldn\u2019t be just this much. You might even be carrying a baby by now. If not for your young age, and that forcing things when you\u2019re unwilling would harm your body, I would feel heartache even if you didn\u2019t feel pain. Stop telling me you want to go back home before I change my mind. I could claim you now and prevent you from ever returning home.\u201d With that, he pinched Lin Qianzi\u2019s cheeks and made them turn rosy.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng was gradually becoming aroused and his hands started to wander. He wasn\u2019t in a rush to take her since he could have any woman he wanted in the jianghu. She however, was quite special.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this, we are not a couple yet, how could you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I? Everyone is spreading rumors that you\u2019ve gone and eloped with some man in the jianghu . Your reputation is in tatters. Why not live up to that reputation and follow me? I won\u2019t treat you badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 How\u2026?\u201d Lin Qianzi was shellshocked, her eyes going wide.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Yet his words were clear as he immediately dropped to his knees. \u201cThat was definitely no poison. In fact, it\u2019s actually medicine that helps a wound heal faster. Only, it\u2019s too effective and caused the body to give up on the scars on the face. To heal this, I must reopen the scars and reapply some medicine. However, I have no idea to what degree I would be able to restore her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial doctor had already sent his entire family away and was no longer afraid of death. Because of that, he spoke in a very direct manner. He even mentioned how he\u2019d discovered that the noble consort\u2019s face was crafted using highly impressive surgical techniques after examining her face. As for the skin on her face, it was likely transplanted from another person, which explained why it looked so wondrous. However, it wasn\u2019t possible to transplant the entire face, which was why there were still quite a few wounds. The red scars were all wounds from when the doctors had stitched together various pieces of skin.</p><br/><p>Since the doctor was able to ascertain that much, he knew that the rumours spreading outside were all true. He couldn\u2019t help but begin to hate this noble consort. Many of the doctors that had gone missing were his comrades and friends. Moreover, he wasn\u2019t actually lying as far as restoring her face went. The noble consort\u2019s wounds were indeed very difficult to heal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that this seat is now disfigured forever?\u201d Su Yun threw off the covers as she furiously leaped to her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 saying that it will take some time to fully recover.\u201d Make no mistake, the doctor was still trying his best to live; he didn\u2019t dare be openly rude. Yet despite his efforts, he still managed to anger Su Yun. She grabbed his medicine bag and threw it onto the floor. \u201cGet out! Get out of here! Why should I keep you in the palace when you\u2019re so useless?\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial doctor felt relieved. Was he finally going to be kicked out of the palace? He\u2019d actually wanted to leave for a while now, but the Internal Affairs Hall wouldn\u2019t easily let doctors go since they\u2019d become so scarce in the palace. However, being kicked out by his masters was a very different matter. He could leave immediately! He quickly kowtowed and immediately left the room, not even bothering to pick up his things.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so brash. I will definitely find someone who can cure you.\u201d The emperor was growing irritable as well. It seemed like Su Yun wouldn\u2019t be able to calm down today. He\u2019d wanted to fool around with a beauty after his wounds healed, but he couldn\u2019t get into the mood after seeing her face. He\u2019d rather have the empress! However, Princess Consort Li would probably feel amazing. He was an emperor, a man amongst men, yet why didn\u2019t he have such an intelligent woman by his side?</p><br/><p>He was supposed to be the man with the most power in the country, yet he couldn\u2019t even manage to get his hands on one woman. But a bold woman, who\u2019d been courageous enough to stab him. Every single person alive likely had to battle their inner demons at least once in their lifetime, and the emperor was now doing just that. He was deeply convinced that he was the most powerful person in the world, and was stuck in a loop wondering why he couldn\u2019t have everything that he wanted.</p><br/><p>After the emperor left the room, his mind plainly elsewhere, Su Yun began to caress her face. Getting doctors to cure her face was now a lost hope. The old and weak doctors that remained in the palace probably wouldn\u2019t do her any good either. She would probably have a better chance if she started searching amongst the citizens. That male stud would probably lose interest in her if she didn\u2019t cure her face soon. While she was lost in her thoughts, she received news from her subordinates that the emperor had gone to visit another concubine, a new noble lady. Apparently, that noble lady was said to resemble Princess Consort Li. She was famed for her ability to act meek and delicate. Even the old madame said that she could see N\u00e9e Bai\u2019s shadow in her silhouette. However, they didn\u2019t really look alike at all, it was just that their demeanor was similarly on the delicate side.</p><br/><p>Men are all the same. They\u2019re superficial creatures who only judge a woman by her appearance. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it now that I\u2019m disfigured. Su Yun picked herself up after feeling a little sentimental for a moment. She left the palace to look for a doctor to tend to her face. However, she quickly felt depressed when she couldn\u2019t find a single doctor in the capital. After some discreet inquiries, she learned that all of the doctors had left for the outer counties.</p><br/><p>The few that hadn\u2019t left yet had extremely long lines snaking down the streets. Business was booming, and it was very difficult for her to get to the doctor. She decided to fork out a lot of money to gain admission, but the doctor only laughed derisively at her when he saw her face and sent her out. She could tell just from the look in his eyes that this doctor was very aware of who she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by this? How dare a doctor refuse to see a patient? Is there no law in this nation anymore?\u201d Su Yun had a lot of complaints. On what basis was he allowed to refuse her treatment when she\u2019d paid such a large sum of money to gain a spot at the front of the line?</p><br/><p>The doctor turned to face the crowd. \u201cEveryone, this madame is here to seek treatment for the wounds on her face. She is the reason why you all are standing in line. Will all of you give me some face and return to her the money that you\u2019ve received? In return, I will not ask for a single copper for my diagnosis today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone instantly understood what the doctor was trying to say. Even though the crowd didn\u2019t openly rebel, the look in their eyes obviously changed. Some of the more hot-blooded men even tossed the money onto the ground and spat on it. \u201cI don\u2019t need your stinking money!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that, almost everyone threw the money onto the ground as well. The sound of the crowd cursing and swearing gradually grew in intensity. Su Yun never imagined that the situation would develop like this. Were these people really going to rebel? Why wouldn\u2019t they just take the money? Also, when had she gained so much notoriety? It was obvious that someone was behind this too.</p><br/><p>Watching the charade from a dark corner, Bai Xiangxiu whispered to Long Heng, \u201cIs this your doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This one is all her credit. Many of the imperial doctors have left the palace, and almost every doctor in the capital has some connections with those imperial doctors. The imperial doctors likely thought it as a tiny piece of harmless gossip, but the rumors actually began to spread to the point where there\u2019s no one in this city who doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire thing had developed to such an extreme degree, even though Long Heng had only given it the slightest push behind the scenes. There wasn\u2019t too many doctors left in the city, so it was quite easy to locate where Su Yun was trying to find one.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must say that I\u2019m very impressed by your plan. She will probably never be able to restore her looks ever again.\u201d Long Heng gently pinched Bai Xiangxiu. What she did might\u2019ve been a little ruthless, but it had a great effect.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu raised her head to look at Long Heng with a speechless look on her face. \u201cSince when was this my idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng caressed her head. That\u2019s true, how could his cute little wife possibly be so ruthless?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d actually planned to poison her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Long Heng kneaded his forehead. He\u2019d forgotten that his little wife was becoming more and more unbridled. This was probably because he\u2019d been pampering her too much, which had made her become a lot more open than before, and caused her to gain quite a temper. However, this was likely her true personality. Long Heng felt quite content when he came to that conclusion.</p><br/><p>What these couple didn\u2019t know was that what happened today only made Su Yun\u2019s hate for Long Heng grow several times over. After returning to the palace, she immediately requested that the emperor come see her. Then, beside a budding little cactus plant, the two began to hatch a plan to kill Long Heng.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was just about to climb into bed to rest but was promptly interrupted by Huo\u2019er\u2019s summons right. Noticing that she\u2019d stopped moving, Long Heng reached out for her slender waist and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you\u2019d be the one doing everything today? Why have you gotten lazy?\u201d His voice was so sexy that it made Bai Xiangxiu tremble all over.</p><br/><p>She slapped him twice in the hand and scolded him gently. \u201cStop fooling around! Huo\u2019er is talking to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Even though Long Heng knew that his wife had some supernatural abilities, he couldn\u2019t help but find it strange whenever she started talking to a plant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

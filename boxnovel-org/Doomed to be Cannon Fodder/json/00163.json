Duan Yunying smirked coldly inwardly. That woman had been so happy just now, and she\u2019s only now remembering to cry. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, then I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lin Qianzi suddenly sat up to pull him back. She spoke with a reddened face, \u201cNo! We can just\u2026 pretend this never happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>She slowly turned around to put on her clothes and then got off from the bed, preparing to leave. Duan Yunying however, pulled her back and asked carefully, \u201cMay I\u2026 bring my proposal to the Lin Manor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! You can\u2019t do that. Long Heng won\u2019t let you off for that!\u201d Lin Qianzi left tragically after speaking.</p><br/><p>Long Heng would probably only thank me for taking this broken thing off his hands! He\u2019d learned last night that she was no longer a virgin, and the man who\u2019d done so was quite a brutal person. Duan Yunying could guess from the marks on her back that had yet to heal that they\u2019d done the deed just two days ago. Who could it be? Luo Yunzheng or Long Heng?</p><br/><p>He pretended to chase her out in order to escort her back to the manor, also \u201caccidentally\u201d revealing himself along the way so that she knew his sincere efforts in taking her back. But he mused as he walked. He would need to do the deed again before the day of their marriage. That day would be when Long Heng\u2019s defenses were at their lowest.</p><br/><p>However, he had no idea that Long Heng actually knew all about him meeting Lin Qianzi. Prince Li was on his way back to the manor from the palace when he received the news. He\u2019d brought back a small, exquisite hand warmer to give to Bai Xiangxiu. This was a bauble that a foreign tribe had offered in tribute to the royal consorts, and said to not burn at all when providing warmth. A bit of hot water would be enough to keep it warm all day during the winter time.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had wracked his brains out to obtain one for Bai Xiangxiu. Her temperament was fragile and she would cower in her room, shivering whenever she was cold. For some reason, a slight trace of a smile flitted to the corners of his lips when he thought of how happy she\u2019d be upon receiving the gift. \u201cLet that jianghu man know of this. Don\u2019t leave him in the dark that he\u2019s been cuckolded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ai, he was really much too soft hearted in using such a gentle method to settle this. He would\u2019ve otherwise killed the two secretly already. However, he didn\u2019t have time at the moment either, he only wanted to spend time with Bai Xiangxiu and gave no thought to anything else.</p><br/><p>And yet, who would\u2019ve thought that some dratted person would reach the manor before him and tell tales of what\u2019d happened. Long Heng immediately rushed to Apricot Garden with a frozen expression when he heard that Bai Xiangxiu had fainted. But she was awake now, and having a nice little chat with Huo\u2019er. She signed when she mentioned that it was almost new year\u2019s.</p><br/><p>This sigh was quite ear piercing to Long Heng. His fianc\u00e9 had bullied his woman and had run off crying. She\u2019d then slept with another man outside and dared come back afterwards. This woman is truly something else! But, why does Xiangxiu speak to that frightening plant whenever she receives a shock? Could he allow the the plant to stay or not?</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er was a sensitive one, and immediately started crying when Long Heng glared at it. \u201cHe wants to kill me! I don\u2019t want to be here anymore! Mistress! Please take me away from here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er\u2019s sudden yell startled Bai Xiangxiu, and she subconsciously wanted to protect him. But it had spikes, so she ended up being pricked all over for her trouble. \u201cAhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It hurts so much! Tears flowed out like they were worth nothing from her eyes. All her friends said that women became finicky when they had boyfriends. She\u2019d never cried because of a prick before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what are you protecting a dead thing for? Were you pricked?\u201d Long Heng really didn\u2019t understand this woman sometimes. What was she so nervous about a plant for?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu shook her head. What if he destroyed Huo\u2019er in a fit of rage? How would she go home then? However, the more she was thus, the more Long Heng felt that she really treated this plant differently. But it wasn\u2019t time to be conflicted about this. He asked with a frown, \u201cI heard you just fainted. Did she come to make trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu started. She hadn\u2019t expected that Long Heng really would take an interest in this matter. How to put things? She did somewhat believe that he genuinely loved her after her role had been swapped with the female lead. Although the male lead never spoke of it, she could glean such from his actions because that was how he\u2019d treated the female lead in the novel, like treasure. He might not have known how to love in the beginning, only knowing to have someone and be domineering about it. But he slowly changed later on, making others feel that he was a good man indeed. However, even at the time of her transmigration, she\u2019d had yet to read about the male lead telling the female lead that he loved her. His actions however, were enough to prove how much he cared about her.</p><br/><p>And now, he was waiting for an answer from Bai Xiangxiu. A strange mischievous surge struck Bai Xiangxiu. She nodded stiffly and then turned her head because she felt that she\u2019d done something bad. However, Long Heng took that to mean that she was sad. He spoke coldly, \u201cRemember, you\u2019re this prince\u2019s woman. You have no need to fear anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned and strode out with large steps after speaking, a marked departure from his usual attitude of sticking by her side. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s heart pounded. Should she cry from being so touched under the circumstances? The male lead really did care about her! Had he left to take revenge for her? But how would he handle the female lead? What would a fight between two people with main character halos look like?</p><br/><p>But Long Heng didn\u2019t return that evening, making Bai Xiangxiu a bit nervous. Long Heng had spent almost every night at her residence since they\u2019d been intimate, where had he disappeared off to now? She couldn\u2019t help but think random, wild thoughts, but actually received word before long that a thief had trespassed into the manor. The servants hadn\u2019t caught the culprit, and Bai Xiangxiu began to worry about the prince. She didn\u2019t care that it was the dead of night and decided to make for his residence.</p><br/><p>She slipped along the way because she was in too much of a hurry. Just as she was floored from the pain, someone inserted their hands beneath her ribcage and picked her up, grasping her in their embrace afterwards. Bai Xiangxiu sat in the crook his arms, her own around his neck and stammered a bit. \u201cYou\u2026 didn\u2019t you go after the thief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came running out even though you knew there was a thief?\u201d She\u2019s worried about me, isn\u2019t she? Look at her run so fast in the dead of the night. Long Heng was still very happy, so happy that he picked her up in a huge, ignoring the looks of those around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how would I know?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu refused to admit to what she\u2019d done, but the other seemed to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince isn\u2019t so weak as to have a little girl like you worry about me.\u201d What a marvelous day. He\u2019d let the thief in so he could see that woman. His plan would succeed the more the two entangled together.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t speak anymore and she clung docile to Long Heng\u2019s neck, sniffing that familiar fragrance. She felt nothing bad about remaining in his embrace. Although she didn\u2019t know what had happened to her in the modern world, this kind of man was truly rare.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

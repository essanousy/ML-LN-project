She gritted her teeth as she saw a shadow approach her. Lifting her head, she saw that it was Long Heng. She felt a little confused. It was hard to tell whether this was a dream. She hadn\u2019t died but revived, but why was Long Heng before her eyes instead of the supporting male lead!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes, does it hurt a lot?\u201d Long Heng asked awkwardly. His heart was distressed at the sight of her, but, he couldn\u2019t bear the pain in her place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurts\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu hurt enough to want to cry. She didn\u2019t have spare effort to avoid being afraid. No matter who it was beside her, she wanted to lean against them and act like a spoiled child. Only then would her heart feel soothed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 know you\u2019re in pain. Bear with it,\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t know what to do with her, but moved to sit by the bed and take her hand. Unexpectedly, Bai Xiangxiu tightly gripped his hand as soon as it was offered due to her pain. It was as if she could stop hurting just by holding it in a deathgrip. Long Heng allowed her to hold on without moving. Truthfully speaking, she didn\u2019t look beautiful right now at all, just very fragile and weak. It moved the softest part of his heart.</p><br/><p>She even acted this cutely before him, wanting to be soothed. This was something that no one had ever done before. His heart itched as he hoped and wished she could get better instantly. Soon afterwards, the doctor\u2019s daughter came to deliver medicine, while the old female servants sent by the Prince\u2019s estate came to serve her as well. But Bai Xiangxiu was in pain and didn\u2019t want to get up to drink her medicine.</p><br/><p>The two elderly female servants came up and spoke, \u201cYour Highness, why don\u2019t you go out first? We can wait upon her.\u201d The pressure he exuded here was too great, making it impossible to feed her medicine!</p><br/><p>Long Heng knitted his eyebrows and said, \u201cJust do your jobs well.\u201d The two elderly servants nodded as they busied themselves with coaxing Bai Xiangxiu to take her medicine. But how would she agree to getting up? Finally, Long Heng had to add, \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss, take your medicine.\u201d His manner was a bit stern, causing Bai Xiangxiu to feel extremely aggrieved. She knit her brows and turned aside to ignore him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Long Heng was already used to her listening to his every word. When she suddenly acted like this, he was momentarily stupefied. But he quickly realized she was just acting peevish. He had never coaxed a girl before, so he drew a blank for a while. But those two elderly servants hadn\u2019t lived this long for nothing. They finally managed to coax her into drinking the medicine, which seemed to relieve some of her pain. She made a few remarks about how badly it hurt, only causing a slight row before falling asleep.</p><br/><p>Long Heng released a breath while the two servants spoke. \u201cYour Highness, we need to rub down madame\u2019s body. We don\u2019t know whether you\u2026\u201d Will keep standing here to watch? Long Heng almost choked on the air stuck in his throat. He coughed lightly twice before turning to leave.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d wanted to stay behind originally, but he didn\u2019t have to skills to keep himself calm, so just decided to leave instead. Still, he thought and thought before returning to say, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her.\u201d By then, half her arm had already been exposed, as evenly white and slender as a lotus root in the water.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d seen female bodies before, but he\u2019d harbored so many suspicions about them on the battlefield that his thoughts had never wandered. But before his eyes now was his woman, one that he saw in a favorable light. Naturally, some errant thoughts arose that he couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><br/><p>No wonder the married soldiers in the barracks would hide in a corner when writing letters back home. The garish leers that appeared on their faces when they wrote those letters, it seemed that they were thinking of the time when they would reunite with their wives! Back then, he\u2019d found them useless, but now he felt that this was the mark of a true man! He was still young, but he\u2019d been so busy accomplishing his goals that this was the first time he\u2019d thought over matters of men and women.</p><br/><p>He stood in the little courtyard outside the clinic, thinking with his hands behind his back as time passed by. Suddenly, there was a horrific shriek. Without a doubt, it\u2019d came from inside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he said angrily. He\u2019d told them not to hurt her, but why did they cause her pain?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Madame\u2019s just had a nightmare,\u201d the elderly servant shouted from inside. She couldn\u2019t be blamed for not controlling her volume, the prince\u2019s deep voice had truly frightened them all.</p><br/><p>Nightmare? That\u2019s right, she was a lady of the boudoir, how could she have any experience with violence and bloodshed? She must have long been scared out of her wits. Last time, she\u2019d even turned a bit crazy from seeing a servant girl beaten to death. She couldn\u2019t have gone directly insane this time, could she?</p><br/><p>As soon as he thought of that, he couldn\u2019t stand still, but immediately found a doctor to prescribe her some calming medicines. His preoccupation and everything that happened in Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s room were all known by Song Jiaoyue, who was only a few rooms away. The shock in his heart was no less inferior than Long Heng\u2019s. </p><br/><p>He knit his brows and resolved to send over some good medicines as soon as he reached home. Though the Prince\u2019s estate had them as well, it was still a form of his regards!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiangxiu furrowed her eyebrows. What nightmare? She\u2019d woken up because it hurt, all right? She\u2019d been pegged as having nightmares before she\u2019d even opened her eyes. These old ladies really feared being blamed. But because of that, their actions turned even gentler as they took care of her to the greatest degree they could muster.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Bai Xiangxiu was young and recovered well. By the second day, she could feel that the injury didn\u2019t hurt as much as before, though it was numb and bloated as if it had turned swollen. This time, she was clear-headed enough to discover the male lead had come to see her again. His expression was wooden, as if she owed him some money, but he still came to her side and asked, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, just feeling a bit pained.\u201d Now that she was fully sober, she\u2019d completely pushed her act of cuteness in front of the male lead to the back of her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPain\u2026. you\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d Long Heng really had no idea how to comfort others, especially females. Thus, all he could do was speak from experience, but the other person didn\u2019t seem to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d You can get used to pain? Since this guy was a military man, he probably felt that way because he was injured all the time!</p><br/><p>But to have the Prince comfort her was really giving her heavenly levels of face. After all, she hadn\u2019t gotten hurt for his sake. When her thoughts traveled here, her heart felt guilty as she turned aside. \u201cOh, this concubine understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, it\u2019s good that you do.\u201d Hey, what am I saying? Long Heng roared with rage in his heart, but not a trace came out through his expression, which remained carefully indifferent as he looked and looked at her\u2026 In the end, the room fell completely still, an obviously awkward silence hanging in the air.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was falling apart inside at this very moment. Why hadn\u2019t the male lead left yet even though things had gotten this awkward? Did he suspect her of harboring feelings for the supporting male? Was he debating on how to pinch her to death between his fingers? That\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be. No matter what, she\u2019d taken a dagger for the supporting male. He wouldn\u2019t just watch someone die without helping them out, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Xiao Shi?\u201d she strove to find a topic, hoping that the other wouldn\u2019t think about ways to kill her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack at the complex.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s longstanding habit was to never use two words to explain a situation when one would do. But it was clear that the silence had turned awkward again after his words. He was a bit unhappy as he stood up and said, \u201cRecuperate for one more day before going home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis concubine understands,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu released a breath when she saw he was about to leave. Going back home would be more comfortable than staying here. At least, he couldn\u2019t run to her place all the time under the eyes of the entire household.</p><br/><p>But where was the supporting male? Hey, I saved you. Aren\u2019t you going to express anything? Where\u2019s your conscience?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

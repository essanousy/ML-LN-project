However, Bai Rong\u2019er and Sir An had no idea that things would be set in place once the eunuch left. They only remained insistent on begging Long Heng for mercy. \u201cYour Highness, please don\u2019t make me marry her, I already have a wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then you shall have two main wives! You\u2019ve come all this way, Sir An; this prince cannot let you go home empty-handed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNO! It isn\u2019t our fault! It\u2019s all her\u2026 her fault!\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er pointed at her own sister as though she was the root of all this trouble.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked at Bai Rong\u2019er squarely in the eye. \u201cI have never once asked for trouble in my life, but I will never ever allow others to separate me from my husband and child. Those who seek to harm my family should first prepare themselves for retaliation!\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke these words without sparing anyone\u2019s feelings. In fact, she even walked towards Bai Rong\u2019er to jerk her younger sister\u2019s chin up and bite off her words. Oh no. Am I showing too much dominance? Everyone seems to have gone quiet!</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026 The image that I\u2019ve been building all this while is now ruined! I wonder if the old madame will detest me for being too overbearing? Bai Xiangxiu turned around to check, but all she saw was the look of surprise on the old madame\u2019s face. There didn\u2019t actually seem to be any signs of distaste or anger.</p><br/><p>What Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know was that the old madame had always felt that this princess consort was lacking too much backbone. However, Bai Xiangxiu had proven her wrong today. It seems spending so much time by her son\u2019s side had rubbed off on her. This princess consort had truly picked up some sort domineering aura. This was a good thing. She no longer needed to worry about Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s ability to supervise the servants. She would be a good princess consort if she could handle herself so well in front of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t me! This is all because of that veiled older sister! She was the one who made me do this!\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er was scared silly now and blurted out the truth. She was afraid that Long Heng would really betroth her to Sir An. He was a married man, which meant that she\u2019d have to share the position of a main wife with another person!</p><br/><p>Power and authority was a very mysterious thing. Their families would never go against Long Heng\u2019s order, even if he didn\u2019t have the slightest connection to them. What Bai Rong\u2019er didn\u2019t know was that things would be set in stone the minute the emperor heard of it. It was already far too late for regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cOlder sister? Veiled?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu and Long Heng exchanged glances. The two of them quickly realized what was going on. It was Su Yun. She was the mastermind behind all this. And judging by the speed with which the emperor received this news, she must still be in the palace.</p><br/><p>One couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by a transmigrator\u2019s determination and abilities, especially when the transmigrator was from a rich family and knew how to put others down with her background. These two white rabbits in front of her had probably been enticed by Su Yun. However, why did it take her so long to finally get up to her old tricks again? What in the world was she doing all this while?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your relationship with that woman?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-nothing! We only met by coincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd? You decided to help a stranger that you just met harm your sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on harming you! She was the one who proposed this plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Even now you still take her for a good person. Bai Rong\u2019er, do you even realize that you were set up? Forget it. Your Highness, we shouldn\u2019t let these people ruin this blessed occasion. Drag her away and lock her up!\u201d I will question you in detail later.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re my elder sister! Why would you imprison me?\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er was thoroughly frightened as she never imagined that things would escalate to such a degree. She used to joke around with her sister in the past as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cI see that you finally remember that I\u2019m your sister. But did you know that what you did here today could\u2019ve destroyed my reputation? I might\u2019ve been forced to die to prove my innocence! Why should I show you any mercy when you were trying to cause my death?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu waved her hands to order the guards to drag Bai Rong\u2019er away.</p><br/><p>Sir An was almost frightened out of his mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! Bai Rong\u2019er gave me one hundred taels of silver to do this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Take them all away.\u201d Long Heng chucked. Both of them were so timid that it didn\u2019t even take much to unearth the truth. However, this was the end of things. It wouldn\u2019t be good if others were to hear the rest. Like a circus, it was incredibly peaceful after the clowns were gone. After this, the rest of the Long family wouldn\u2019t even be able to do anything to Bai Xiangxiu even if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu no longer hid behind a pretense of frailty after going through all of that. She gave out all sorts of commands calmly and was moving things along. She finally became the new madame of the Prince Li Manor after she was done with her tasks. She was now officially Princess Consort Li that thousands adored.</p><br/><p>Upon nightfall, people from both the Bai and the An families came visiting. They were here to beg mercy for their respective child. Their families had no idea they\u2019d planned to do such a thing as they\u2019d both done it of their own accord. One did it for the money, while the other did it to rise above her own sister.</p><br/><p>N\u00e9e Xiao and Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s younger brother had come from the Bai Manor. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mood actually turned for the better when she saw her younger brother. And because of that, she no longer spoke as coldly as before. \u201cYou may take her home, but she must marry into the An family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that acceptable? The An Manor is like an empty shell! There\u2019s nothing inside!\u201d N\u00e9e Xiao had always doted on her younger daughter the most. How could she let her youngest one marry such an unremarkable person?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was the one who asked for it. There\u2019s nothing you can do to change this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we agree to have her marry into the Song family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I hope that you can understand that it will be practically impossible to marry her off now, let alone the Song family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did she do wrong? She only spoke of the truth!\u2019 N\u00e9e Xiao stood up and yelled in an agitated manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t say that! Second sister nearly harmed elder sister too!\u201d Bai Xueru stood up too. He never thought that his mother would say something like that!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth? The truth is that she nearly killed her own elder sister! That\u2019s the end of this discussion. There\u2019s nothing else you can do about it. Even the prince wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it because the eunuch has already reported this to the emperor. Is the Bai family planning to ignore the emperor\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you absolutely certain?!\u201d N\u00e9e Xiao was so taken aback that her face drained of all color. She immediately continued, \u201cD-does the emperor even care about commoner disputes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor might not care about you, but somebody tried to ruin his close subject\u2019s wedding ceremony. What do you think he\u2019d do?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had resorted to threats. Since neither of them was treating her politely like a peer, why should she do the same?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will send a lot of dowry for my sister\u2019s wedding.\u201d She smiled at N\u00e9e Xiao coldly and had the servants to escort them out. The An family also agreed as they didn\u2019t want to go against imperial orders. However, the Sir An\u2019s wife probably wouldn\u2019t be as elated about this, as she suddenly had to share the position of a wife with another woman.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu originally thought that things would calm down again after a few days of rest, but an invitation from the palace unexpectedly arrived. A noble lady from the palace with the surname of Su had sent her this invitation. Apparently, it was just a simple palace banquet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

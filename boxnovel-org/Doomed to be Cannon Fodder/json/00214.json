But you must be careful of that child. Although he may appear well-behaved, he becomes very violent whenever he discovers that the thing he wants has been taken by others. When he was little, he went so far as to fight with his senior brothers and sisters over a toy. He was only a few years old at that time, but he beat them until they coughed out blood.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He fights people? How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so you must be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t dangerous, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, my understanding of martial arts is inferior to his.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It looks like the child wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. They chatted for more than half a day as Yu Kuang kept her company. It didn\u2019t take long for an official summons came from Prince Rong. Naturally, Prince Rong understood Chen Tao\u2019s thoughts. The news had spread everywhere already because of him. If not, Prince Rong could have helped her conceal some of it. He hadn\u2019t expected that the woman would seek responsibility for all offenses when life and death were staring at her in the face. But it also made sense, she\u2019d come to Ning City because she\u2019d been concerned. Her decision had also helped them greatly. Prince Rong didn\u2019t make things difficult for her. He prepared a specific room for her to wait for Long Heng\u2019s arrival. </p><br/><p>Long Heng rushed back the moment he received the news. He stomped his way to Prince Rong\u2019s place, his expression a study of frost, and raised a cupped fist salute to greet him. Prince Rong was sitting in the top seat, while Chen Tao and Lin Qianzi sat to the side. Long Heng took a glance at Bai Xiangxiu. Although they didn\u2019t interact, their hearts seemed to know what to do. \u201cThis incident has nothing to do with this lady of the inner residence. I told her to come because I know how widely learned she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue had come along with Long Heng. He was standing quietly behind the latter, but suddenly stepped forward at this time, \u201cYes. Prince Li\u2019s only intentions were to break through the horse formation. This humble servant is the one responsible for bringing Madame Xiu here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Rong, please allow this subordinate to say something. Madame Xiu is clearly a woman who lives secluded in the inner residence. The most she would know about formations are from what Prince Li has told her. How can she actually be knowledgeable on this subject?\u201d Chen Tao snickered lightly. There were too many loopholes in their statements.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu retorted, \u201cIn the books, the linked horses formation is called the chained horses formation. Luckily for us, the enemy hadn\u2019t deployed the full form of this particular formation. There\u2019s also another method to break through it. However, it was inappropriate to be used here, which was why we used the sickles. And actually, if we hadn\u2019t been under siege, we could have dug traps from below. The horses would\u2019ve been mired in the holes, and the charge would\u2019ve been broken.\u201d She paused to take a breath and then continued, \u201cNot only that, I also know many other formations. The Seven Star Mallet for instance, Seven Slaughter Formation, Blade Net Formation, Big Dipper Formation, Four Quadrant Formation, and Four Wonders Formation\u2026\u201d It was unknown whether Bai Xiangxiu had been provoked or that she simply wanted to prove her knowledge, but all the generals and soldiers were stupefied from all the formations that Bai Xiangxiu was reeling off. Although they\u2019d grown up studying formations, they had never heard of so many before! </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu struck out her chest and lifted her head in order to maintain her confident posture. She had a \u201cI know more than you, so what are you going to do about it?\u201d expression on her face. Long Heng, on the other hand, was rocked with awe. He had no idea that his wife was just posing, and was only naming formations that she\u2019d heard of and didn\u2019t know of. It was impressive enough for a woman to be able to name all of them, not to mention her look of complete confidence.</p><br/><p>She continued, \u201cYou all normally just use the Crane Wing Formation in battle, and switch to the Fish Scales Formation if you\u2019re attacked.\u201d Long Hong had taught her this bit, and she was currently bringing it out to show off a bit. Yet Prince Rong was already applauding, \u201cWhat a fantastic female strategist. Prince Li, you are blessed to have such a woman by our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Others may not believe her, but Prince Rong was a believer. However, Chen Tao crinkled his brows, \u201cSo what if she knows formations? She still violated an army law. She must be punished accordingly.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cOh? So based on City Guard Chen\u2019s words, you\u2019re saying she should have allowed the military to remain trapped and not make a move? Or allow the strategist to release his poison and turn everyone into corpses? City Guard Chen, don\u2019t forget that you were the one most afraid of their strategist!\u201d </p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s dismissive laughter made Chen Tao feel very uncomfortable. He raised his voice, \u201cAnd what of the relationship between the enemy state\u2019s strategist and your concubine?\u201d \u201cWhat!? We got rid of the strategist thanks to Madame Xiu,\u201d Song Jiaoyue blurted out as soon as he snapped out of his shock. </p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is that so? Then that is a great merit indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe seduced him, didn\u2019t she? Remember, the strategist is a big pervert,\u201d Lin Qianzi suddenly interjected. Chen Tao sneered and seemed to look down on Long Heng. Although Long Heng was furious, he tried his best to suppress his anger. Surprisingly, Bai Xiangxiu was the one who took to the field this time as she pointed at Lin Qianzi, \u201cExcuse me, Miss Lin. I was disguised as a man the entire time. How would I have seduced him? But, I could understand if that person was you. After all, you\u2019d been in that army camp for so long. Who knows who you might have seduced? In addition, how do you know the strategist is a pervert?\u201d She blinked her eyes and sighed. Her lively attitude appeared on her elegant face and warmed the hearts and eyes of all the men around. </p><br/><p>Prince Rong lightly coughed as he looked at Lin Qianzi, \u201cMiss Lin, please do not speak casually of army matters.\u201d </p><br/><p>Chen Tao stated coldly, \u201cRegardless of how big of a contribution she may have had, army regulations cannot be broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Rong agreed, \u201cCity Guard Chen\u2019s words are true. I will personally report Madame Xiu\u2019s contribution to the emperor. But Long Heng, do you admit that you are guilty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed I am guilty. Please punish me, Your Highness.\u201d Long Heng lifted his robe and knelt down, awaiting for his punishment.</p><br/><p>Prince Rong proclaimed, \u201cSince you both managed to save Ning City and led the charge, I will first punish you by a hundred beatings of the stave. The emperor will decide the rest after we return to court.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Long Heng stood up to leave the room. Based on his martial arts abilities, he wouldn\u2019t be severely injured from a hundred canings.</p><br/><p>\u201cA moment.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu suddenly called out, surprising everyone. This is already the lightest punishment. What else does she want? \u201cI was the one who was first at fault. Prince Li was only involved because of me. Please split the hundred beatings between us and allow me to take fifty of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Prince Rong\u2019s brows furrowed together as Bai Xiangxiu continued, \u201cWe are currently in the midst of a war. What if the enemy troops seize this opportunity to attack us knowing that our general lies injured? Please allow me to undertake half of the beating so his injuries wouldn\u2019t be as severe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsurd!\u201d Long Heng shouted. She was such a weak woman. How would she be able to take the military cane? She didn\u2019t have any martial arts abilities that she could use.</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangxiu refused to back off, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault to begin with, and you have responsibilities right now.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Long Heng had no idea of how to deal with this latest turn.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue stood up as well, \u201cThis humble servant also has an official position in the capital. Long Heng wasn\u2019t the only one who violated army regulations. I deserve to be punished as well. Please allow me to take the fifty beatings for Madame Xiu!\u201d </p><br/><p>Another voice rang out before Prince Rong could even think of a response, \u201cThis humble servant also took part in this. Please also split the punishment with me as well, Prince Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWulin Alliance Head, Yu Kuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Rong finally understood why Long Heng had entrusted these two with the raid. It was the wulin alliance head!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

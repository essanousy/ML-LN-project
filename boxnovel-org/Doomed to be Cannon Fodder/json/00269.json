When she noticed that there was no one else in the vicinity, she immediately tugged on Long Heng\u2019s clothes and slipped her hands inside.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You\u2026!\u201d Long Heng nearly took a dive to the floor when she did that. He quickly carried her to the bed and waved his hands, getting someone to promptly drag Xiaoshi back out of the room, even though she\u2019d just entered. She was depressed. Why did they drag her away when she had to tend to the princess consort\u2019s wounds?</p><br/><p>Long Heng could easily tell that something was wrong with Bai Xiangxiu. He was all too familiar with the enemy nation\u2019s parasite poisons. Why wouldn\u2019t he? His enemy\u2019s speciality was in all sorts of weird poisons after all. In a fit of rage, he raised his hands and smashed a nearby table into smithereens. Unfortunately, Bai Xiangxiu just wouldn\u2019t calm down despite her wounds. \u201cLong Heng\u2026 Long Heng\u2026 Come to me\u2026\u201d She kept whispering.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had no choice but to take out a set of clean clothes from a nearby wardrobe. He couldn\u2019t touch her when she was wounded like that. He had no choice but to wait for the effects of the drug to pass. Unfortunately, he\u2019d underestimated Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s charms. It only took a few more passes before Long Heng lost his resolve and willingly climbed into bed to act as her antidote.</p><br/><p>After they were done, Bai Xiangxiu drowsily told him about what\u2019d happened and what she\u2019d discovered. Long Heng immediately shot up when he heard what the emperor had nearly done to her. He paced angrily around the room like a caged beast. Bai Xiangxiu quickly climbed out of bed to calm him down. \u201cLong Heng, what\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t I come back safe and sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did this time, but there\u2019s no guarantee that it won\u2019t happen again. If I hadn\u2019t sent Ah Song to follow you, things would\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not an idiot that would allow them to do as they please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019ve had it with him. I\u2019d only wanted to request a small piece of land to live out a serene life. I didn\u2019t want to live a life filled with wealth and riches, all I wanted was for my family to be safe! But he doesn\u2019t allow it! Now he dares to covet my wife and even tried to lay his hands on you? This is what I receive after risking my life to fight for him?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, not so loud!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! What sort of man am I if I can\u2019t even protect my family? I\u2019d be ashamed if anyone were to hear about this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 Don\u2019t be so agitated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what he was trying to do, I will definitely make him regret this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s make him regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was worried that he would pick up his sword and charge into the palace in a fit of wrath. She quickly pulled the rage-fueled man into bed and calmed him while hugging him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, you don\u2019t have to be so angry. We can slowly come up with a plan to punish them. We\u2019ll take our time when we deal out the punishment, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng was quite enraged, but quickly realized that Bai Xiangxiu had something up her sleeve. He pinched her cheeks and smiled. \u201cWhat kind of shenanigans have you come up with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have tricks aplenty, but we have to plan ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you always have a way to calm me down. But\u2026\u201d Long Heng gave Bai Xiangxiu a hug. As a grown man, he would never admit that he was actually more afraid than angry just now. Yes, he was afraid, afraid of losing the woman in front of him. She was always so lively and cheerful. It\u2019d be worse than death if he were ever to lose her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu knew Long Heng quite well. She had him rest his head on her thighs and held him close. While comforting him, she slowly talked about how she was planning to give Noble Consort Su one of the cactus\u2019 shoots. Unfortunately, getting her to accept it was the hard part. They both went to bed after discussing that topic a little.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Noble Consort Su actually ended up stumbling her way into the mouth of a tiger. Her arrival the next day even helped Bai Xiangxiu by giving her an excuse to avoid one of her problems. N\u00e9e Xiao was visiting her again to beg her to arrange a better marriage for Bai Rong\u2019er. \u201cShe should be the sole wife and not share a man with another woman!\u201d N\u00e9e Xiao was adamant.</p><br/><p>Nobly Consort Su arrived while Bai Xiangxiu was brainstorming a way to deal with the annoyance. Bai Xiangxiu immediately waved her hands to chase N\u00e9e Xiao away. N\u00e9e Xiao had no choice but to leave filled with resentment. Even she wasn\u2019t daring enough to disturb her daughter when a noble consort from the palace was visiting.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu quickly welcomed Noble Consort Su and even invited her to Apricot Garden. She was now even more convinced that this lady had something to do with Su Yun. How else would a noble consort be daring enough to step beyond the walls of the palace harem? To put her theory to the test, she even had someone to place Huo\u2019er on a nearby table. They chatted as they sipped tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty has ordered me to come take a look at younger sister\u2019s wounds. Are they better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have, but it still hurts when I lift anything heavy. What about His Majesty\u2019s\u2026 wounds?\u201d She dipped her head down as she spoke, to make Noble Consort Su think that she was doing this out of remorse. Even though she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong on purpose, women from the olden days normally placed the blame on themselves even though it was the men whose hearts were wavering.</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su also understood what she was hinting at, and laughed derisively on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoble Consort Su, do be careful. This thing can prick your fingers.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu warned her. She turned to ask Xiaoshi to move the plant away. Xiaoshi was confused. Why did she ask for the plant to be moved here, and then immediately ask for it to be taken away?</p><br/><p>However, Noble Consort Su waved her hand and airily said, \u201cNo need. The cactus looks fine when it\u2019s placed on the table. There\u2019s no need to take it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeming a little shocked, Bai Xiangxiu asked, \u201cThis thing is called a cactus?\u201d</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su realized that people from this period may not have seen such a plant. \u201cYes. The cactus is a very good plant to place inside your homes. It can even be used to treat burn wounds and poisonous cysts.\u201d</p><br/><p>She showed off her future knowledge to this woman and expected, received amazement and surprise in return.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe an ugly plant like this would have so many uses. I only planted this because it looks really unique, and it somehow managed to survive! Cactus\u2026 what a unique name too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, Huo\u2019er is not ugly.\u201d Huo\u2019er felt wronged, which was why it suddenly interjected in her head. Bai Xiangxiu glared at Huo\u2019er to make it shut up.</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su then said, \u201cThis is definitely a plant that you would find in almost every household in the future due to how easy it is to keep. It only needs a few drops of water to survive and has plenty of uses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Then it must be a treasure!\u201d Why don\u2019t you take a shoot back? I\u2019ve not prepared anything for your arrival today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since you made it sound like some kind of miracle, I\u2019ll definitely give it to you!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will be more than happy to accept your generosity.\u201d No harm having a cactus anyways, it can help clean up the air in my room.</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su accepted this gift without an ounce of suspicion. After that, she even asked to pay Long Lin and the old madame a visit. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t refuse her and brought her along to visit them. On the way there, she talked about how Long Lin had grown older and that the old madame was going to take him to their old home to honor their ancestors. After all, a child had to be recorded in the family tree when they were of age.</p><br/><p>This was just small talk of course, but it was also to give Long Lin and the old madame an excuse to leave. Long Heng hadn\u2019t seemed to have made his move yet, so Noble Consort Su didn\u2019t seem to suspect anything. It was a good reason to travel. People in the olden days took having a descendant very seriously. However, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s heart was pounding right now. She no longer had any doubt that Noble Consort Su was in fact Su Yun. However, she just couldn\u2019t figure out how she\u2019d changed her face. It was most definitely not a mask. Could plastic surgery from the olden days possibly be so impressive? Was it really possible to turn a woman into such a beauty using the medical techniques of these times?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Bring me to the workshop. The place where you stored the materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, escort the madame to the workshop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d These soldiers were filled with respect for Bai Xiangxiu. After all, she was still trying to create the bombs despite her \u201cillness\u201d. Bai Xiangxiu felt very embarrassed when she saw the reverence in their eyes. This was all their general\u2019s fault alright? She\u2019d been nearly split into half by him!</p><br/><p>Her embarrassment didn\u2019t stop the soldiers from escorting her to a slightly remote location. This was actually by her request. If the worst happened, she would rather she be the only fatality in the explosion. Honestly, there was no need for her to make a powerful explosive; the enemy\u2019s explosives were not that strong either. Her hands would be stained with a lot of blood if the explosives were to be used for the wrong purposes.</p><br/><p>With about a dozen people carefully watching over her, she prepared the ingredients and the required utensils from memory. It\u2019d taken her the whole day just to prepare all that. After toiling tirelessly, she dragged her exhausted body back to her room, only to find Long Heng and many others also coming up with their own countermeasures. They were trying out a metal shield, made specially to shield them from the explosives. Cavalry would be temporarily removed from the battlefields. They would go on an all out assault with soldiers who were equipped with those hopefully blast-proof shields.</p><br/><p>That is a good idea too! My husband is surprisingly clever! Bai Xiangxiu learned more about the manufacturing process in her dreams that night. She also continued to insist that she\u2019d learned it all from books. Long Heng didn\u2019t have time to suspect anything because he knew that Commander Lu would soon assemble a team for another ambush.</p><br/><p>There was nothing much Long Heng could do about it. Because of their unique weapons, Long Heng was worried that he might fall into the enemy\u2019s trap if he led his soldiers into battle. Bai Xiangxiu would really have to do her part well in order to break the deadlock.</p><br/><p>She was being extremely careful as every ingredient was rather special. The slightest miscalculation or slip could lead to disaster. It was fortunate that she\u2019d seen the manufacturing process with her own eyes. By the end, she\u2019d successfully created ten bombs with ease. These bombs were like hand grenades, or rather ball firecrackers that children in modern times played with. Her bombs were quieter than those firecrackers, but much more powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me do it!\u201d Long Heng had seen the way Bai Xiangxiu was shaking, and was afraid that she\u2019d hurt herself. Bai Xiangxiu was looking a little bedraggled at the moment. Her experiments had caused her long silky hair to be burnt right up to her waist. While it might not have sullied her beauty in any way, Long Heng still felt extremely apologetic. </p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t seem to mind it one bit. She smiled gently when she saw Long Heng standing in front of her, holding a metal shield. Song Jiaoyue and Yu Kuang didn\u2019t leave the scene; they were simply too engrossed in whether her experiment had succeeded or not. Bai Xiangxiu took one of the bombs and threw it at a small tree, immediately shrinking behind a shield. Her movements were very swift. It didn\u2019t take very long before she\u2019d crouched into a ball. She actually seemed quite playful.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue shook his head with a smile. This lady is hilariously eccentric. BOOM! His face immediately turned ghastly white. Song Jiaoyue instinctively raised his hands to cover his face with his sleeves and quietly took back everything cute he\u2019d ever thought about the bombs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo dangerous,\u201d Yu Kuang\u2019s reaction was even faster than his. He\u2019d already retreated almost ten steps away.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019d been fiddling with such a dangerous thing this entire time?\u201d Song Jiaoyue was still white with horror.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess! It\u2019s a success!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu leapt into Long Heng\u2019s embrace in her excitement. The soldiers all turned their heads to look away. The scene before their eyes was very heart-warming but was also rather embarrassing too. </p><br/><p>\u201cOuch! It hurts!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s impulsivity had brought her great pain. After all, Long Heng was in a full suit of armor.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Long Heng was somewhat speechless as he helped her up. \u201cThis thing is way too dangerous. You should teach someone else how to make it and manufacture it outside the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone else? Long Heng, it\u2019s better if I do it myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want the formula to land in the wrong hands. It\u2019s unimaginable what they could do with it.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was right. If a weapon as powerful as this were to land in the wrong hands, it could fill many people\u2019s hearts with desire, and plunge this world into chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. As you wish. A hundred of these should be enough for us to deal a significant blow to the enemy and make them think twice before attacking us again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu understood the meaning behind Long Heng\u2019s words. He was worried that she\u2019d be in danger.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was still curious about one thing. Was there really another transmigrator helping the enemy? If that were the case, what was that person like?</p><br/><p>Long Heng used a few days to scout the location of the enemy camp and headed into battle, bringing Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s bombs along with him. He also left behind a brigade of shielded soldiers to protect Tranquil City. Bai Xiangxiu was quite worried. This wasn\u2019t just a one or two days\u2019 skirmish. It was fortunate that Song Jiaoyue and Yu Kuang had gone with him as well. They were both hot-blooded men and wouldn\u2019t sit around to watch their country lose a war they could fight in. Before anyone had realized, autumn had crept across the fields. The weather had gotten colder and the leaves were turning yellow. I wonder how Xiao Lin is right now. He\u2019s probably spoken his first words by now, right?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu suddenly felt a sharp pain on her neck while she was still caught up in her thoughts. Somebody\u2019s ambushing me! Unfortunately, Bai Xiangxiu realized that fact a beat too late. She tumbled to the floor in a dead faint.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo\u2019er, who\u2019s kidnapping me?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was still conscious even though she\u2019d fainted. She could talk with Huo\u2019er in her sleep as long as she\u2019d formed a connection with Huo\u2019er beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo men. They can fly around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFly? How far am I now from Tranquil City? Which direction are they taking me? Who\u2019s behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, talk slowly. Huo\u2019er has to try to sense it one by one.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, take your time. Just do it before I wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re flying south. You\u2019re now one, two, three, four\u2026 five miles away from the city. Also, there\u2019s nobody but you behind them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was a little speechless. She\u2019d meant who\u2019s behind this, not who\u2019s behind them! To think that she\u2019d just praised Huo\u2019er for being a little more knowledgeable! She suddenly heard a loud splash. It was almost like she\u2019d taken a cold shower.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, someone is pouring water for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. By the way, I meant behin-\u201d Bai Xiangxiu awoke before she could finish talking because someone had thrown her roughly onto the ground. She couldn\u2019t help but grimace in pain. It almost felt like her bones had fractured.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d A stone-cold voice asked.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t trying to pretend. She slowly got up and retorted. \u201cWhy did you throw me? Even a dead person would wake up if they were thrown lik-\u201d The person grabbed Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hair before she could finish speaking and threw her onto a wooden bed.</p><br/><p>The man slowly inched towards her while undressing themselves. Your mother! Am I about to be raped?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m Prince Li\u2019s concubine?\u201d She had no doubt that these men already knew her identity. For what other reason would they kidnap her?</p><br/><p>\u201cA concubine. You\u2019re nothing a but a toy for men.\u201d That man\u2019s voice sounded very cold and ruthless. He didn\u2019t even give her a chance to retort. He used one hand to grab hold of Bai Xiangxiu, who was trying to escape, and slapped her twice across the face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

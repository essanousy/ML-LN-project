Xiaoshi, arrange a room for Second Miss to rest in. Send some daily necessities over as well. Handle this appropriately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Princess Consort.\u201d Xiaoshi went off to take care of what had been asked of her, while Bai Rong\u2019er asked in a spoiled manner, \u201cBig sis, it\u2019s a rare thing for me to be here in the Prince Li Manor like this. Can I sleep together with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-mama nearly toppled over when she heard that. The prince rested at the princess consort\u2019s place every single night. Or rather, it should be said that the princess consort had already moved to the prince\u2019s courtyard. Staying in the courtyard where the prince lives, was that appropriate? Still, she couldn\u2019t be blamed for her ignorance. Even in small households, so long as families possessed even a little bit of authority, wives and concubines usually lived in separate places. The master of the household would also have a residence of his own. How would he be like any typical couple, always residing with his wife and not staying beneath different roofs even when her monthly periods came?</p><br/><p>Still, since the prince being willing to do so, they, as servants, were really not in a position to question him. It was just that this suggestion of this second miss was really too inappropriate. The personality of this young lady was really far from comparable to that of their Princess Consort.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Prince Li Manor. There are rules everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Big sis, can you take me around the manor for a tour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t the time. I\u2019m too busy with preparations for the banquet. Ye-mama, find two maids to show the second miss around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old servant complies.\u201d Like this, the girl was still causing up trouble even though she\u2019d wanted to come over to help. Still, she probably wouldn\u2019t cause much of a problem if it was just touring the manor. If they were too distant and they realized that she wasn\u2019t the previous Bai Xiangxiu, real trouble might crop up.</p><br/><p>Sadly, the girl whom she\u2019d thought would be fine still ended up causing trouble in the end.</p><br/><p>Having prepared lunch for herself and Long Heng at noon, a maid ran in from outside, reporting, \u201cPrincess Consort, Your Highness, Second Miss got into a fight with your cousin in the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Miss?\u201d Long Heng had just returned, not knowing that someone had come visiting from the Bai family.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu said rather despondently, \u201cMy younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d When had that cousin come as well? Things were really getting chaotic in the Prince Li Manor. Well, since they were about to hold the family banquet, it was only natural that guests would be coming. Still, wasn\u2019t it a little too early for this younger cousin to arrive?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was at the head of the group rushing to the small garden. There, she saw two young girls fighting it out, pushing each other back and forth. While it wasn\u2019t as barbaric as Bai Xiangxiu and Lin Qianzi\u2019s fight before, it was sufficient for one to realize that the two of them were going at it seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! What are you doing?\u201d She was truly enraged. Of all the times to be fighting! Guests might be arriving at any moment now. With the two girls going at each other in the Prince Li Manor so unbecomingly, didn\u2019t they know what kind of gossip might spread as a result?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis, this woman bullied me.\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er threw herself into Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s arms as she sobbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your younger sister? How fitting.\u201d The cousin snorted instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er turned back towards the cousin and yelled. Her expression changed by the time she looked back to Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cBig sis, this woman is clearly mocking you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rubbed her head. \u201cCousin, I\u2019m really sorry for my younger sister\u2019s rudeness. You there, send His Highness\u2019 cousin back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis, as the lofty Princess Consort, why are you even apologizing to her? Isn\u2019t she just some cousin! It\u2019s just based on her relationship with the old madame, but she\u2019s already off coaxing her grandson now. This Prince Li Manor is yours\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap! Bai Xiangxiu reached out and slapped her. This younger sister of hers was really too arrogant. If her sister continued speaking like this, it would only cause more trouble for her. While this cousin held no actual authority in the Prince Li Manor, if she really offended the old madame due to this incident, Bai Xiangxiu would have a tough time in the Prince Li Manor even if she was the princess consort .</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you actually hit me!\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er was stunned, never having thought that her sister would slap her even when she had clearly been speaking up for the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the lady cousin back. You, follow me,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu responded.</p><br/><p>Having been slapped in front of everyone, a despondent Bai Rong\u2019er had originally wanted to cause a scene. Still, she didn\u2019t dare utter even a single word when her sister glared at her. Since when had her gaze become so authoritative? Bai Rong\u2019er actually inexplicably followed her sister back as meekly as a lamb. When she entered the study, she saw a man with an even greater aura of authority seated within. His gaze was cold, a chill emanating from his entire body. Despite his handsome looks, she was immediately frightened into lowering her head as soon as his gaze fell on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er, has your Bai Family dedicated all their efforts to just educating you? Has no one ever taught her before that she needs to curtsy when seeing this prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Long Heng\u2019s words, Bai Rong\u2019er immediately reacted, dropping heavily to her knees, \u201cI greet, I greet Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-mama, send her back. Tell the Bai family that if they ever have the intention of letting her out of the house, they should re-educate her first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s aura was so intimidating that Bai Rong\u2019er actually didn\u2019t dare to rebut him at all. Most importantly was how those others around her were acting. Even that princess consort sister of hers dared not speak at all, with the servants frightened into kneeling on the ground. If she were to speak now, wouldn\u2019t she be killed on the spot?! She was quickly ushered into a carriage whilst harboring such doubts, to be sent back to the Bai Manor. That couldn\u2019t be! She still hadn\u2019t accomplished her goal in having come here yet. She wanted to meet Song Jiaoyue and let him know that she was Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s younger sister. After she had done so, he would likely start thinking about her. At that time, wouldn\u2019t the chances of a marriage between them go much higher? Still, never would she have thought that she might actually be shooed away because of Prince Li\u2019s cousin.</p><br/><p>Having considered all this, she decided that she would not be going home and stubbornly insisted on getting off the carriage. Unable to deal with her, the carriage could only come to a halt. In the end, she nearly fell down in her haste to disembark.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d A hand supported her. Raising her head, she discovered that it was actually a veiled woman. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a girl as beautiful as you before! Still, you look like you have something on your mind!\u201d That veiled woman seemed to be concerned about her as she furrowed her brows in query.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could I be thinking about? I\u2019ve just been kicked out.\u201d Perhaps due to the other party\u2019s goodwill in assisting her and her concerned words, Bai Rong\u2019er actually felt that she had been dealt an injustice. As soon as she felt wronged, the rumbling of her stomach reminded her that she hadn\u2019t even eaten yet.</p><br/><p>The veiled woman actually laughed, \u201cHow about we have some wine at the tavern? Since destiny has had us cross paths here today, this big sister will treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I possibly do that? You saved me! It should be me treating you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t compete with me! Treating a great beauty like you would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Rong\u2019er\u2019s face turned red as the veiled woman pulled her into a tavern. She seemed to be of a rather high birth, with two male servants even following by her side with extreme deference. She was formidable in her extravagance as well, ordering dishes that Bai Rong\u2019er had never tasted in her life before.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt like this woman was actually even more noble than her elder sister. Thus, emboldened by the wine, she spilled out all the injustices that had been dealt to her, from the matter of the Bai family to that of the Prince Li Manor. It was already late when she finished, with that woman consoling her all the while, even giving Bai Rong\u2019er many precious gifts during their talk. Then, they arranged to meet the next day. She would help Bai Rong\u2019er brainstorm a plan to get Song Jiaoyue to see her in a different light.</p><br/><p>Long since having been overawed by the grand disposition of this big sister, Bai Rong\u2019er deeply believed that she could be of help to her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

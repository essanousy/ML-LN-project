However, he heard someone say that his mother was calling for him, so he went to her place with a frown.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her son\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t right, she smiled, \u201cDidn\u2019t you go to n\u00e9e Bai\u2019s place? Why are you back so quickly?\u201d She didn\u2019t object to her son going to her place anymore, but hadn\u2019t he come back too quickly?</p><br/><p>Long Heng was rather depressed about the whole course of events, but for some reason, he was struck by a need to defend her, \u201cThat place is rather cold and quiet, and she\u2019s also sick.\u201d What he meant was that since she was sick, he couldn\u2019t possibly take her by force like he wanted to!</p><br/><p>The old madame smiled a little and said nothing. She responded, \u201cCold and quiet? You\u2019re defending her now, but did you know that it was by her own wish that there are so few people at her place? Previously, she was the one who used the excuse of insanity to chase everyone away, it wasn\u2019t my idea of a harsh punishment.\u201d He hadn\u2019t even stayed a night at her place and was already speaking for her. Luckily, this tea table was useful. It was a perfect match for the teaset that her son had given to her, or she wouldn\u2019t be this calm right now.</p><br/><p>Long Heng immediately said, \u201cMother, your actions are guided by nothing but reason.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything more, as if nothing had happened. The old madame sighed in her heart. Her son had always been cautious since he was young, but ever since he had returned from the battlefield, she couldn\u2019t guess what he was thinking. He\u2019d just revealed a hint of his true emotions just now, only to be beaten back to his original form by her words. If she had known earlier, she wouldn\u2019t have teased him.</p><br/><p>Men in this world would already have three wives and four concubines at his age. For the sake of this family, he had gone into the army when he was ten or so. Although he had managed to bring back a title of prince with his efforts, his proper business had been delayed. Right now, it was hard enough just getting him to touch a woman, even sending a woman to his room wouldn\u2019t do the trick. It wasn\u2019t easy to get him to go to Miss Bai\u2019s place twice, but he always came out with an unhappy expression. She didn\u2019t know how Miss Bai had angered him but she would have to give her some pointers tomorrow. Ladies did not really understand how to serve a man, especially these virtuous concubines. They were only sent over by sedan, and weren\u2019t even taught how to please their lord by an older female servant. After deciding on her actions for the morrow and chatting with Long Heng for a while, she sent someone to accompany him back.</p><br/><p>The old servant by her side smiled, \u201cThis servant sees that our Prince is upright, not like those loose gentlemen causing trouble all over the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good if he\u2019s too upright. Even if he marries that Miss Lin, with him acting like this, it\u2019s going to be very long before I can hold my grandchildren.\u201d The old madame was helpless.</p><br/><p>The old servant said, \u201cThere are still four lovely ladies in this household. Even a piece of ice will melt in half a year, much less a hot-blooded young man like him. Look at this, hasn\u2019t he been going to Mistress Xiu\u2019s place the past few days? This servant sees the time of enlightenment drawing near. Once he\u2019s been enlightened, your first grandson won\u2019t be far off. If you\u2019re too anxious, then put more beauties near his room, we\u2019ll see how long he can last.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the old madame understood her son well. She shook her head and smiled bitterly, \u201cI understand my son, he\u2019s too tense. It was fine when he was young and didn\u2019t know much. However, now that he knows about things and is used to seeing those women on the battlefield, it\u2019ll be difficult to get him to let down his guard.\u201d Thinking about it, she sighed and said, \u201cGo out there and find me some good teaching servants. Especially those who are good at teaching about the birds and the bees.\u201d</p><br/><p>The older servant stared blankly for a moment before realization dawned, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of teaching that Miss Bai? It\u2019s a good choice, she does look rather honest. She\u2019s also very pretty.\u201d She was also favored by the prince and the old madame. The old servant was a smart person and immediately went looking for an appropriate teacher.</p><br/><p>The next day, Bai Xiangxiu was summoned by the old madame. Her heart was apprehensive. She hadn\u2019t managed to seduce the supporting male lead and had somehow provoked this old ancestor who would be the principal reason for her death. She wondered what was it that she was summoned for so suddenly? She carefully brought Xiao Shi in and stood at the doorway, waiting respectfully to be called in for her audience.</p><br/><p>An old servant came out to lead them in after a moment. She hurriedly gave a very formal, ceremonial greeting. 1 The old madame and the old servant at the side were both startled. This was just a normal meeting; there was no need for such an excessive greeting, it wasn\u2019t a special occasion. The old madame forced the tea in her mouth downwards before imperiously saying, \u201cRise!\u201d She actually wanted to laugh, but she held on to her calm demeanor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Old Madame.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had Xiao Shi support her as she rose. She then stood to one side without daring to even lift her head. She didn\u2019t even dare to sit. However, she did spot the tea table that she had made. It had actually been displayed in the middle of the old madame\u2019s inner room, with a very valuable looking tea set displayed on it. It could be seen that she used them both frequently.</p><br/><p>As expected of an old madame who had been born into nobility, her taste was impeccable.</p><br/><p>The old madame had to say again, \u201cSit,\u201d before Bai Xiangxiu actually sat down.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but frown. She had wanted to give her some pointers, but how was Bai Xiangxiu supposed to help her when she was this cowardly?</p><br/><p>She still wanted to give her a try, so she said, \u201cHis Highness came here yesterday and said that the Winter Garden is a little cold and quiet. After thinking, I have come to concur with his thoughts. You can\u2019t have just the two of you there all the time. If outsiders find out, they\u2019ll think we\u2019re trying to punish you! In a bit, I\u2019ll let someone send a few servants to your place!\u201d</p><br/><p>What? She was trying to seduce the second male lead. How was she going to do that with a few more pairs of eyes around? However, it wasn\u2019t too good if she rejected the old madame\u2019s offer, so she gathered up all her wits and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis concubine is grateful for old madame\u2019s good intentions. However, you know that this concubine hasn\u2019t been able to sleep well and has been sick and depressed quite often. If some lively girls come over, it might make them unhappy. Perhaps some steady old servants would be a good choice?\u201d It was fine for her to bring up this request, right?</p><br/><p>The old madame nodded inwardly. This concubine didn\u2019t just submit meekly to her will, but also didn\u2019t slap her in the face. Most importantly, their wishes were somehow in sync, so it was like killing two birds with one stone. Her thoughts caused her to smile as she said, \u201cYou\u2019re rather considerate of them. Then as you wish! However, I\u2019ve already picked out an old servant for you. She was originally a servant of my family. Her circumstances are a little poor and she\u2019s been married three times now, but, she\u2019s happy now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, as old madame wishes.\u201d The old madame\u2019s words were a bit weird, but then again, she didn\u2019t really understand much of the nuances in the old madame\u2019s words in the first place..</p><br/><p>The old madame knew she didn\u2019t understand and continued, \u201cAlthough she\u2019s had a hard life and married three men, every one of them treated her extremely well. Do learn from her.\u201d After saying so, she put down her teacup and said, \u201cI heard that the Prince went to your place yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the old stave-murderer mention the younger stave-murderer, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s guard went fully up. She hurriedly said, \u201cYes!\u201d You old woman, what are you trying to say?</p><br/><p>The old madame said, \u201cWhat do we women wish for in our lives, Miss Bai? Undoubtedly, it\u2019s to serve our man well and leave a place in his heart. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madame, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d Right, your head. Men don\u2019t count for a damn thing. If she wasn\u2019t trying to escape her death, she would have just left this mansion and gone out to travel, who cared about relationships?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Prince is your man, so it\u2019s not too good if he comes and goes at night. Listen to the old servant\u2019s teachings, and you\u2019ll know how to get your man to stay.\u201d The old madame didn\u2019t care about Miss Bai\u2019s awkwardness. Since she would be her son\u2019s woman sooner or later, the old madame had to say these things.</p><br/><p>However, after hearing this, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t feel good. She thought inwardly, what exactly was this old madame trying to do? Pimp out her son? She felt like she had just swallowed a giant fly, and felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe. Her face was so red it couldn\u2019t get any redder. Half of it was shyness while the other half was anger.</p><br/><p>However, when thinking of her death coming in the near future, she lowered her head and agreed. I agree to it, but if your son doesn\u2019t come, then what can I do? Anyways, the plot was about to pick up right about now. He was about to go chase after his fleeing consort, and she just had to act safely as her background female side character.</p><br/><p>1.

Even though they\u2019d been going head to head with the dowager empress her entire life, all those remaining in the world of living were those who sided with the right party at the right time. They were all part of the dowager empress\u2019 faction. The two women naturally wouldn\u2019t feel well after her sudden death. Hence, they too were constantly depressed in the past few days, unable to ease the stuffiness in their chest. However, ever since they moved two potted plants from Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s residence to their own, the two women would feel much better upon inhaling but a mere whiff of the plants\u2019 scent. </p><br/><p>At first, they didn\u2019t think that the positive change in their mood had anything to do with those plants. But, when they simply threw the plants to a side upon returning to the palace, they would feel unbearably depressed before too long. At that moment, the fragrant scent drifting through the room from the plant would breathe new life into them. When the dowager consorts ordered their servants to bring the plant over to them, sure enough, their moods would lift. </p><br/><p>The two dowager consorts met to discuss this matter and came to the conclusion that this virtuous act was actually the old madame\u2019s doing. They felt that she was really the dowager empress\u2019 close confidante and truly understood the depths of their hearts\u2019 distress. Hence, the two dowager consorts chose a valuable item as a gift in return for the old madame\u2019s kindness, startling the recipient.</p><br/><p>All the return gifts should\u2019ve already been received that day, and most of the gifts should\u2019ve been small items, no? Why was there another return gift? Moreover, one that was quite valuable too. She guessed that the two dowager consorts wanted to look to the Prince Li Manor for support. But that didn\u2019t make sense. Long Heng wasn\u2019t a prince of the royal blood, and they themselves were part of the dowager empress faction as well. Now that she was gone, shouldn\u2019t the imperial consorts be looking for support from the empress\u2019 faction?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until she asked the palace maids that she learned of everything that had happened. Unexpectedly, this series of events had been thanks to n\u00e8e Bai, and now they\u2019d made the good acquaintance of two dowager consorts. One of them was Prince Rong\u2019s birth mother, so it wasn\u2019t as if she was completely without power. Who would\u2019ve thought that n\u00e8e Bai would be such a harbinger of good luck? However, she was a bit stubborn to go to these lengths when she was indisposed.</p><br/><p>The old madame was quite touched after receiving the gift and the shower of compliments that accompanied them. N\u00e8e Bai hadn\u2019t even sought the limelight after doing all this and given all the credit to the old madame. Someone who was such a role model for good behavior were few and far in between. And so, Bai Xiangxiu began to quickly rise in the old madame\u2019s esteem. The old madame picked a few presents to send over to Bai Xiangxiu, but the servants who came back said that the madame had slept for half the afternoon and had no intention of getting up.</p><br/><p>The old madame took it as a sign of her tiredness and didn\u2019t have anyone wake her. The old madame also gave orders to the kitchen to make nutritious supplements to present to Bai Xiangxiu as soon as she woke up that night. As a result, she almost got a nosebleed from consuming it all. She was only tired and didn\u2019t need such enormous supplements! This lifestyle would surely be the end of her.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi and the others, who didn\u2019t know the truth, only thought their mistress really was pregnant and was on tenterhooks around her. Ye-mama in particular would start giving her pregnancy tips at random intervals. For Bai Xiangxiu, it was the height of awkwardness. Sadly, Long Heng wasn\u2019t back yet, so she could only endure it silently.</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng was also depressed when he came back. As he entered Apricot Garden, Ye-mama carefully poured him a cup of water. \u201cYour Highness, Madame Xiu has already slept. Would you like to rest in your own residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do so.\u201d Which courtyard didn\u2019t belong to him? Did he need to justify where he wanted to sleep?</p><br/><p>However, Ye-mama frowned in response, saying, \u201cBut, Madame Xiu\u2019s body is not in the best of conditions right now. Your Highness, why don\u2019t you go to the two other residences first\u2026\u201d and relieve yourself with other women? However, who knew that her master would viciously glare at her before she could even finish her sentence? She couldn\u2019t muster the will to say another word for a very long time. Her whole body had turned so rigid from terror that it was about to turn into a block of ice. </p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did servants start giving orders to their masters in this household? You deserve to be punished.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t say anything else, but that was enough for Ye-mama to go outside and slap herself a dozen times. It was apparent that she\u2019d forgotten her place lately. She could only blame it on Long Heng acting like a young kid completely in love in recent days. Even those next to her had felt the warmth radiate from him.</p><br/><p>However, thinking clearly, he was only ever tender to the one lying in bed. That had nothing to do with them. Unknowingly, she had become too proud in this matter first. She\u2019d thought that because of her mistress, she could lift her head and speak boldly to the prince. This was why she\u2019d ended up where she had today.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiangxiu, she had no idea any of this was happening. She, in fact, was sleeping like a log. Why do we say this? That would be because because she\u2019d almost kicked off all of her covers and wasn\u2019t wearing her clothes properly either. She was revealing everything she should and shouldn\u2019t reveal.</p><br/><p>When Long Heng walked into her room and was greeted by this scene, that body of his that\u2019d wanted to just take a break began to stir. What was wrong with him? Why did his body always act up when he saw her? He coughed lightly and understood that it really wasn\u2019t the appropriate timing for doing any funny business. He got ready for bed and pulled the covers solidly around her, holding her tightly and only falling asleep after a thorough cuddle.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiangxiu awoke the next day, she felt that she had had an extremely poor night of sleep. There seemed to be a mountain lying right on top of her, and she couldn\u2019t turn around no matter how she struggled. By dint of sheer effort, she managed to slightly wriggle around, but then froze. Something\u2019s wrong! This position was quite ambiguous, and it was obvious that a certain man was trying to do something to her from behind. It was definitely something untoward, and she was in quite a precarious position already.</p><br/><p>She knew who this man was and absolutely wanted to avoid him. But at the same time, she couldn\u2019t do so. Firstly, she was only half conscious after waking up, and secondly, the other party seemed to have waited half a day for her to wake up. \u201c\u2026 Ah\u2026 You\u2026 are so bad so early in the morning!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl. You only have to bear with it for a moment. This prince has been holding myself back for the entire night already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was there a need to be so energetic? Was this kind of thing so good that he couldn\u2019t do without it? Reality proved that it was really that good for Long Heng. As a matter of fact, he seemed to be nearing the point of insanity.</p><br/><p>As a result of that, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t get up first thing in the morning. She only ran to the toilet and then continued sleeping. In the end, she\u2019d barely slept for an hour before someone woke her up. They informed her that the old madame was receiving an honored guest and wanted her to make arrangements for said guest. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu got dressed and asked Xiaoshi out of curiousity, \u201cWhere\u2019s the prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince has left the manor, but he mentioned that he wanted to return and have lunch with you.\u201d Xiaoshi smiled as she spoke. The prince really treated her mistress very well. That thought soon flew straight out of her mind when she learned who the guest was. It was none other than the fabled future mistress of the household, Lin Qianzi!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was also at a loss and starting to panic. Why had the old madame asked her to entertain that woman? However, the mama that the old madame had sent seemed to anticipate Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s reaction. \u201cMadame Xiu, Miss Lin is here to fulfill her filial duty to Old Madame, but the old madame needs peace and quiet at the moment, and so has asked you to arrange living quarters for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu understood the meaning behind her words. This old madame was handing this enormous inconvenience over to her on purpose, putting Bai Xiangxiu in a bit of a difficult position. Miss Lin was supposed to live in Apricot Garden, but now that Bai Xiangxiu had moved in, she didn\u2019t want to leave. The old madame probably wanted to test her resolve, but Bai Xiangxiu really didn\u2019t want to leave. Hence, she smiled and said, \u201cHow considerate of Miss Lin.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

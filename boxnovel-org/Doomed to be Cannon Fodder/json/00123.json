His face went absolutely black as he walked in front of Bai Xiangxiu. She was currently closing her beautiful large eyes, and almost seemed to be asking naively and innocently who he was and why he was doing this.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng understood the meaning in her gaze, and was very shocked to realize that one could communicate through looks. \u201cMadame Bai, I have a favor to ask of you. I\u2019ll release you if you can successfully pull it off. If not, then\u2026\u201d He looked viciously at her and measured her chest with his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll strip you of your clothes and throw you onto the streets.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other seemed to be extremely scared, with tears threatening to drop from her eyes, but inside, she was actually thinking: he clearly thinks of me as some sort of little child if he\u2019s threatening me with throwing me out on the streets! But she had to listen to him for now, or he would most likely do something to her.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t recognized who he was in the beginning, but that roguish tone was suspiciously like that male supporting character, Luo Yunzheng. Why was Luo Yunzheng in her room? Were all the guards outside dead? The rustle of a small patrol walking outside caught her ear. It seemed they weren\u2019t dead, but rather the opponent was far too skilled.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her gaze was mostly calm, Luo Yunzheng surmised that she was indeed an honest and weak woman, and so continued, \u201cGo out right now and have a doctor look at what ails Miss Lin. Don\u2019t tell anyone about the diagnosis, or I\u2019ll kill you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The threat wasn\u2019t enough to allay his worries, so he threw a medicinal pill into her mouth. \u201cThat was poison, and you\u2019ll get the antidote once you finish this matter and promise you won\u2019t speak of anything. Obviously, if you reveal this matter to Prince Li, your ending will be\u2026\u201dHe made a cutting motion in front of his own throat, his meaning clear.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked like she was about to sob from fright. She looked pitifully at Luo Yunzheng, proving that she wouldn\u2019t make trouble. Luo Yunzheng relaxed and reached out his hand to release her acupoint, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded and asked carefully, \u201cWill you let me put on my clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPut them on!\u201d She seemed to be rather sensible and obedient, and not about to create a disturbance. He would be at ease if she really invited a doctor to look on Miss Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to my maid?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was a little worried about Xiao Shi. She\u2019d been sitting outside the whole time!</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng said, \u201cI only sealed her acupoint. You only have to go complete this matter. Nothing will happen to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu spoke softly as her eyes rolled in thought, \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be suspicious if I didn\u2019t have a servant girl following me at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng started. At first, he\u2019d thought that she was worried for her servant girl out of the kindness of her heart, and was unexpected that she actually had ideas. He couldn\u2019t help but nod. \u201cPat her and she\u2019ll awaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a way to tease girls, especially girls that didn\u2019t understand martial arts. Their expressions would always be amusing then. As expected, Bai Xiangxiu went to look at Xiao Shi, and her expression turned astonished when she saw how her maid\u2019s acupoints had been sealed. Sure enough, she went to pat her maid awake. </p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng used his finger to unblock Xiao Shi\u2019s acupoint from behind, making her awake.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu made an astonished sound. \u201cShe really woke up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng found this somewhat funny. She truly was a simple girl. Both she and Lin Qianzi were only just noble misses who were accustomed to staying in their residences. He waved his hand from the shadows, indicating that she could leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu naturally left. Not leaving was an act of stupidity. She pulled Xiao Shi over and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s look at the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s already so late at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen viewing the garden, who cares if it is late at night or not. Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201d Xiao Shi was dragged out by Bai Xiangxiu like this as her mistress carried a lantern and dashed to the female lead\u2019s residence late at night. After walking for a while, Bai Xiangxiu suddenly said to Xiao Shi, \u201cXiao Shi, go locate a doctor. Tell him I need to see a doctor, but that the location is that side of the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi felt it was strange, and then noticed that her mistress was writing words on the palm of her hand. She could read, so nodded and went to find a doctor. But when she located a doctor, Xiao Shi awakened a pageboy and had him report to the prince.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu waited in the garden for a while and finally saw Xiao Shi coming over with the doctor. It was only then that she dared to go in with them together. But as they were entering the room, she suddenly spoke when a new idea struck her, \u201cStay on the lookout outside. Don\u2019t follow me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi didn\u2019t know what was going on, and could only stay outside on guard.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu personally brought the doctor over to Lin Qianzi\u2019s room. She smelled a strange odor when she entered. She had never smelled this before, but she didn\u2019t feel too good. She didn\u2019t know that the doctor was an experienced person. He frowned slightly and said unhappily, \u201cCan you light the candle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded, but didn\u2019t summon the servants. Instead, she lighted the candle on the table herself. She took a look at Miss Lin afterwards and felt that her lifelessness was a little strange and scary. And so, she went to lift the blankets and knew exactly what had happened to her after seeing the female lead.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Qianzi\u2019s clothes were worn neatly, it was obvious that someone had dressed her. Furthermore, what was peeking out from the nape of her neck, wasn\u2019t that the legendary hickey?</p><br/><p>Holy, which man was so vicious? Not only had he done this to a sick and weak noble miss, but he\u2019d also left behind many marks of love. Those marks weren\u2019t fun at all. They were very painful when being left behind. This proved that this unknown man wasn\u2019t gentle at all.</p><br/><p>As for how she knew, wasn\u2019t it because of Prince Li\u2026 those\u2026 non-so-gentle interactions? Although he looked to be extremely overbearing, he hadn\u2019t left any excessive marks behind on her body at any time. It was at most some minor kiss marks that would have disappeared by the next day. </p><br/><p>Seeing Miss Lin\u2019s mark, it probably wouldn\u2019t disappear in next three to five days. At this moment, she still didn\u2019t believe that Miss Lin had lost her chastity since she believed that events in the novel were very hard to change. And, the female lead seemed to have done quite a great deal of things with the male lead before going all the way to the end, but they\u2019d always refrained from completing the deed. </p><br/><p>This time, they probably also hadn\u2019t done the deed either, right?</p><br/><p>The doctor walked over and lightly checked her pulse. He felt extreme disdain for this kind of servant. A servant girl had actually done this type of thing in the residence! She truly didn\u2019t know what shame was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked the doctor when she saw him silent for a long while, with only an extremely strange expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis lady had a fever to begin with, but because she had intercourse with a man, she has wounded her foundation. If I don\u2019t guess wrongly, her\u2026is still bleeding. And so, she needs to replenish greatly. I\u2019ll give her a prescription. She needs to take it continuously.\u201c The doctor didn\u2019t reveal a disdainful expression on his face because the mistress was by his side, but he completely looked down upon this type of woman in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You said she, she\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu felt dizzy, not for anything else, but because the plot had escaped her grasp. This type of feeling was not good.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

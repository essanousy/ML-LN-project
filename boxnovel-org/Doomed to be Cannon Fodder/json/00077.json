Many visitors were inquiring where she\u2019d found the chef, but she didn\u2019t give them a straight answer, since the fourth madame was only a concubine. Publicizing it would only bring trouble upon the fourth madame. Moreover, she could tell that the fourth madame was a very sensible person. Therefore, Madame Song did not want to cause any inconveniences for the fourth madame.</p><br/><p>And so, she only described the chef as someone the monastery had invited and managed to keep the identity of the chef a secret. However, Madame Song had made up her mind that she would definitely return the favor in private, at least so that the Long Household wouldn\u2019t find any fault. Plus, the prince had even come to look after the fourth madame. This alone could was a clear indication of how much the prince valued her.</p><br/><p>The female guests didn\u2019t eat much. To their chagrin, they were full by the time half the food had been served. However, they still stayed seated to await al the dishes. If a good dish of food passed across their plates, they would still eat a few bites.</p><br/><p>In Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s opinion, these madames seemed to be eating like they were eating cat food. Almost all of them placed their chopsticks down after taking only one bite of each dish. Bai Xiangxiu herself was starving, but because these people wouldn\u2019t move their chopsticks again, she had no choice but to place her chopsticks down as well. Regardless of how hungry she was, she couldn\u2019t eat a lot. Fortunately, she did manage to sneak bites until she was half-full.</p><br/><p>After everyone had eaten and drunk to their heart\u2019s content, tea and cake were offered.</p><br/><p>After taking two sips of tea, Bai He once again approached Bai Xiangxiu with a smile, \u201cYounger sister Xiu\u2026 Madame Xiu, Old Master is asking if you are free. He wishes to meet with you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Master and Old Master weren\u2019t people who would normally converse while eating. Therefore, it was normal for them to return after they had eaten to the fullest.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu grew a bit embarrassed at the surprise she\u2019d let slip at being asked to meet the old master alone. However, Bai He quickly added, \u201cThe eldest young master and the prince are also waiting outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>They\u2019re all done eating. That\u2019s way too fast! Bai Xiangxiu then quickly remembered that although this was a feast, it was in the end temple cuisine. Since wine was not permitted at these feasts, it was normal for the male guests to finish their meal quicker. Bai Xiangxiu nodded towards the madames sitting with her before she allowed Xiao Shi to support her out of the hall. </p><br/><p>Long Heng frowned when he saw that she was still limping. However, since Old Master wanted to meet her, he couldn\u2019t display a manner of superiority. After all, Old Master was an elder. So he contented himself with a word to Xiao Shi, \u201cSupport your mistress carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng just felt that he had to instruct Xiao Shi before he led the way to the Old Master. Naturally, Song Jiaoyue was accompanying them. Actually, Grandfather didn\u2019t ask to meet Long Heng. Does he have to be so worried? Alright, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m worried too.</p><br/><p>The cadre walked together with Long Heng and Song Jiaoyue walking in front and the ladies following at the back. Because Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t far behind them, they could still see the shadow of her figure on the ground. She walked in a very beautiful posture, swaying like a willow. Seeing this, Song Jiaoyue smiled faintly, yet Long Heng was the one who spoke up, \u201cGrandfather does not have a good temper. Be careful when you speak to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather is a good person.\u201d Song Jiaoyue was afraid that Bai Xiangxiu would be afraid, thus, he hastily tried to comfort her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu answered obediently, but no one knew if she was answering Long Heng or Song Jiaoyue. Actually, she had never been afraid before. She had some experience in how to deal with the elderly. See, she\u2019d even managed to smooth down Old Madame\u2019s fur.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, one of the two men before her was the one she had been secretly in love with. They had already parted ways, but Bai Xiangxiu could tell that Song Jiaoyue looked at her differently this time. At first, Bai Xiangxiu had thought that Song Jiaoyue might have been acting like this because he felt sorry, but as time passed, she realized that she had assumed wrong. Song Jiaoyue seemed to be unknowingly drawing close to her, as if everything was planned.</p><br/><p>However, the more Bai Xiangxiu thought, the more she felt it was impossible, because the two women by Song Jiaoyue\u2019s side would always visit her. If Song Jiaoyue had plans to the contrary, would he let those women meet her? Bai Xiangxiu had to admit that she really didn\u2019t understand the minds of these men of ancient times.</p><br/><p>As for the other one, he had an appearance and style that suited her taste, but he was already someone else\u2019s man and that someone else had the halo of the female lead to boot. No matter how Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s thoughts ran, she still felt that this man would never belong to her. Most importantly, the description of how he killed her in the book was really too bloody.</p><br/><p>She has to admit that in this ancient courtyard, killing someone was just like playing around, all the more so for people in even higher positions. It didn\u2019t help that the male lead was a decisive general who wouldn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest to make that call.</p><br/><p>Whenever Bai Xiangxiu faced these two men, she always felt slightly stressed. Those two walking in front of her would stir any woman\u2019s heart! Bai Xiangxiu had never dated before, so it wasn\u2019t weird that she was overthinking things now.</p><br/><p>When one pondered too much and their thoughts ran too fast, one would always forget to pay attention to one\u2019s steps. Bai Xiangxiu was someone who worked seriously and required full focus when doing a single task. Now that she\u2019d been distracted by her thoughts, it was only natural that she would stumble. And so she did, and her body started its unplanned descent to the ground. Nevertheless, all humans had an instinct of self-preservation To protect her perky nose from being smashed flat, she naturally wanted to find something to hold onto, and in the split second she had to think, she could only reach for the leg of the person in front.</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, this leg was too easy to hold onto!</p><br/><p>In the end, her face did not manage to introduce itself to the ground. In fact, the instant she\u2019d latched onto the leg, someone tugged on the back of her clothes. When she came to, she was already upright and standing safely on the ground. The fall and the lift almost happened within a second of each other. How could the petite body of Bai Xiangxiu, someone from a literary family, handle this sort of acceleration?</p><br/><p>Her entire body grew weak, and dizziness assaulted her in waves. Pressing her hand to her head, she swayed and wobbled. As expected, she has the appearance and body of a second female lead. Was it really good to be so delicate?</p><br/><p>The truth had proven that whether one was the supporting female character or the female lead didn\u2019t matter. One is always good in the eyes of someone who\u2019s fond of you.</p><br/><p>A strong arm completely ensconced her body and a vigorous heartbeat immediately cleared her head. Even without guessing, she knew that this scent that tickled her nose belonged to Long Heng. Was he the one that lifted me up? He\u2019s a crude man, but now, he\u2019s pretending to be someone nice. However, she did feel safe in his arms.</p><br/><p>The body of the second female lead was extremely petite. When she was held in his arms, her head happened to rest just so on his chest. In many ways, this position was very ambiguous. Bai Xiangxiu immediately blushed and lifted her head as she said in a muffled voice, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a second, something\u2019s wrong here. Long Heng was the one who lifted her up and carried her, so whose leg had she held onto?</p><br/><p>That leg was rather thick. Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>With a flushed face, Bai Xiangxiu looked up and saw the supporting male character Young Master Song Jiaoyue, standing amidst the wind, frowning and blushing.</p><br/><p>The hell. I was rejected when I wanted to hold onto his leg. Now that I\u2019ve accidentally hugged his leg, can someone tell me how I should react in this situation? Most importantly, supporting male character! Show some reaction! If you remain expressionlessly silly, how can I apologize?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apologies.\u201d No matter what kind of expression the other displayed, an apology was absolutely compulsory.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Song Jiaoyue recovered from his shock and hurriedly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Did you injure yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu really felt like crying, but she couldn\u2019t shed even a tear in this situation. Why did you have to go and mention what\u2019d just happened\u2026 Bai Xiangxiu really wanted to just slap herself. Can a man\u2019s leg be randomly touched? Look at how dark and gloomy Long Heng\u2019s face is\u2026 I\u2019m dying here\u2026 I can\u2019t even look at him anymore, what should I do?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d With a few words, Long Heng pulled Bai Xiangxiu away from the abyss of her thoughts. She almost thought Long Heng would just chop off her hands as punishment for simply hugging someone\u2019s legs. Thank goodness I still have both of my hands. However, she still felt weirdly nervous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

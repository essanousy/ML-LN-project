The corners of his mouth moved only a little. Bai Xiangxiu wouldn\u2019t have noticed that smile at all had she not been staring at him. However, that smile sent chills down Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s spine. \u201cYou\u2019re probably thinking something amongst the likes of \u2018woman, just wait until I\u2019ve recovered\u2019. Am I right?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu whispered.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was taken aback and immediately caressed his face. Was I that obvious? How does she know?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that so many times in the past with that same look on your face already. It\u2019s so frightening.\u201d It was at this moment when Bai Xiangxiu remembered how it always ended up with her not being able to get out of bed for three days. It was genuinely torture for body and soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite clever of you. No need to be anxious, the day will soon come.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever look anxious?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes at him. Unfortunately, a certain prince automatically classified it as flirting instead.</p><br/><p>The autumn weather today was quite invigorating. The gentle breeze was extremely pleasant when it blew past them. Bai Xiangxiu was looking out at the view through a tiny window in her carriage. At this moment, everything that happened in the battlefield seemed like just a dream. And yet, those were precious memories. She\u2019d never forget about the bravery of the nameless heroes. Their gallant sacrifices would never be forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you wish to go back to Tranquil City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. The people there are cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like that place too. If it were possible, I\u2019d rather go to that city and live out the life of a recluse prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s surprising, I thought you\u2019d wish for me to aim for a higher position!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu turned around to face Long Heng. \u201cThat position is a bottomless pit. Once you\u2019ve jumped into it, you\u2019ll forget all about your friends and family. You would abandon us all sooner or later. Me, our son, the old madame, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow naive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s naive? I\u2019m certain it\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re from a royal family or a normal family, there\u2019s no such thing as family or friends at the face of self-interest. Don\u2019t we both know that this is the truth?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu stared at Long Heng as she was puzzled by what he\u2019d said. Long Heng gently patted her head and said, \u201cMany disgusting things have never tried to approach you as you were just a concubine before.. But soon, you will soon see them show their true face in front of you. You have no idea how much I wish you could continue to remain ignorant of this fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 are you trying to say?\u201d For some reason, Bai Xiangxiu could see a hint of sadness in Long Heng\u2019s eyes. She never thought that he\u2019d actually feel sad over something in life as well. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou must know that I don\u2019t have anyone else except you, mother and Lin\u2019er. It\u2019s same for you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 still have my brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly that rascal from your family treats you with sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d What did he mean by saying that? Was there something wrong with her warm, scholarly family. Just what did that contempt in Long Heng\u2019s eyes mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is why I say you\u2019re too naive, always thinking that others are kind. If your parents were good, why did they send you into my manor to spend your days in loneliness? I won\u2019t say much else, you\u2019ll understand soon enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu seemed to understand something from these words. The old madame had taken in these four concubines before Long Heng had returned from the battlefield, and although it had looked like a most glorious affair, but there was a saying that one would rather be the wife of a poor man than the concubine of a rich man. She had been the firstborn of the wife, but she\u2019d been sent in as a concubine. It looked like the parents of the original owner of this body hadn\u2019t loved her much. Not to mention, they hadn\u2019t come to look in on her after such a long period of time. They\u2019d only sent her some gifts after the little prince had been born, but still hadn\u2019t visited her.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d thought at that time that her family was so thoughtful. They had refrained from visiting her because they hadn\u2019t wanted to put her in an awkward position, right? After all, the parents of a concubine weren\u2019t typically treated with much respect. Did they just not want to see me? Meh. Maybe Long Heng\u2019s just thinking too much.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the carriage chilled for a moment, but thankfully they soon arrived at the Pavilion of Departing Visitors at the east corner of the palace. Everyone was congregated here, with the men leaping astride their horses and the women taking places in carriages as they set out for the hunting grounds of east mountain.</p><br/><p>However, trouble brewed here. Long Heng was escorted off the carriage and then laid down on the soft litter. This was when Bai Xiangxiu discovered that her husband really knew how to put on a good act. His face was the picture of weakness as he laid there, and it really looked like he\u2019d been through a great illness.</p><br/><p>Those around him naturally came to ask about his health and offer words of comfort. The emperor was first delighted and then felt agonized. He was happy that Long Heng had finally eaten a loss at his hands. It looked like he would take at least a month to recover. He was then conflicted because Long Heng\u2019s act was pronouncing loud and clear that the emperor was a heartless man who didn\u2019t know how to treat others kindly. Long Heng was this sick already, but he\u2019d still forced the general to accompany him. This was blatantly making life difficult for Long Heng!</p><br/><p>And so the emperor frowned and comforted Long Heng with a few words, saying that he could remain lying there and didn\u2019t have to alight. Long Heng naturally agreed. It would be difficult if the emperor wanted to make him come down. He wouldn\u2019t joke with his own health.</p><br/><p>The empress hadn\u2019t accompanied them on this outing. The old madame naturally couldn\u2019t come if she hadn\u2019t, as the old madame was her guest. Those who had come were the emperor\u2019s concubines. There were ten carriages full of them, filled with roughly seventeen consorts or girls who had relations with the emperor. Bai Xiangxiu kept shaking her head when she saw the carriages. The emperor was something alright, how did he manage so many women?</p><br/><p>However, Lin Qianzi was also here. Bai Xiangxiu had gotten word of that yesterday. That woman actually still wanted to get revenge and had thought of many plans. It was a pity that Bai Xiangxiu heard them all, but didn\u2019t mention them to Long Heng so that he wouldn\u2019t worry. She was waiting for Lin Qianzi to throw herself into disarray. I just don\u2019t get it, you\u2019re a little girl who\u2019s just had an abortion. What\u2019s the point in taking the field with your injuries? She also probably doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s just cannon fodder for someone else. Someone else is using her in all of this. That person was likely here today as well. Bai Xiangxiu felt that she had to face quite a few enemies today.</p><br/><p>The emperor first rode in his palanquin and switched to horseback when the retinue exited the capital. He subconsciously flicked a glance at Bai Xiangxiu. It was an unstoppable fact that men loved looking at beauties, not to mention a legendary beauty. There were those who hated her, and those who loved her. Those who hated her wanted her to die, and those who lvoed her pitied her. They were all of the imperial harem, with some the emperor\u2019s new concubines, and others the dowager consorts of the previous emperor.</p><br/><p>A pale, tender hand suddenly poked out from the carriage just as they were all musing over their thoughts. It was holding a water skin that it flung forcefully to Long Heng. Long Heng caught it and took a sip of water.</p><br/><p>The married couple were being lovey dovey towards each other. This very ordinary movement was enough to betray that this woman was a bit playful. She could\u2019ve ordered the servants hand over the water skin to Long Heng, but she\u2019d chosen to thrown it herself instead, and had thrown is at a very low angle. She\u2019d obviously wanted to tease Long Heng! One had to admit, while those prim and proper ladies might look demure, they weren\u2019t as lively as a playful woman. There were very few women like this in the imperial harem. Even the extremely seductive Lin Qianzi was quite a dull character normally.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

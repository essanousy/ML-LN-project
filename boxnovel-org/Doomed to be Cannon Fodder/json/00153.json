She patted her face to clear her mind, after which she personally held the cactus in her arms as she headed towards Apricot Garden. Along the way, she encountered both Senior Madame and Second Madame, who\u2019d formed an alliance with one another. </p><br/><p>They appeared to accidentally cross paths with her, but in reality, they ought to have received some kind of news that Bai Xiangxiu would be passing by. As such, they pleasantly called out to Bai Xiangxiu when they saw her walking over in their general direction. They were even waving fans though it wasn\u2019t season to be using one. With smiles plastered all over their faces, they asked, \u201cFourth Madame\u2026 Oh, no. We should address you as Third Madame. Where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since the third madame had been ineffably kicked out of the prince\u2019s mansion, Bai Xiangxiu became the third madame. Bai Xiangxiu purposely hid the matter with of the third madame from everyone else. The reason being that she was afraid Long Heng would find out about it and kill those involved. Thankfully, he\u2019d been preoccupied by many things lately and hadn\u2019t had the time to do so. If he really did have free time somewhere along the lines, then she couldn\u2019t guarantee that he really wouldn\u2019t do so. Hence, to outsiders viewing this situation, this third madame seemed to have disappeared for no reason at all, which made them even more suspicious about the root cause of it all. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu also knew all this, that was why she wasn\u2019t too bothered with them behaving in a manner in which they were purposely trying to defraud her. She only gave them a slight smile as she replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to Apricot Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why bother asking such a question when you guys already the answer? You must have something up your sleeves! Sure enough, the senior madame smiled and said, \u201cOh! Are you going over to tidy up Apricot Garden now? I knew that the mistress of the household was going to enter our house after Old Madame returned.\u201d </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu silently rolled her eyes. Why talk about all this since you already know that I\u2019m going to move in? You\u2019re just stirring up some drama! But, who was Bai Xiangxiu? She didn\u2019t pay heed at all to such small tricks they played. She knew full well that she had the protection of the male lead, so she didn\u2019t take note of this matter. </p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am moving in on account of the prince\u2019s orders.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother explaining any more than that and left. </p><br/><p>But the second madame blocked her way and spoke with a surprised look on her face, \u201cHow is that possible? Third Madame should know the matters of the manor even if the prince himself doesn\u2019t know. This Apricot Garden is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease make way. If you have any questions about this matter, please direct them to the prince. Don\u2019t block my way. The flower\u2019s rather heavy. Would you rather help me hold it so we can have a talk?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t bother being courteous as she shoved Huo\u2019er into the second madame\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Huo\u2019er was shocked, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want this woman holding me! She has a murderous aura around her! She wants to kill Huo\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Black lines appeared on Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face. This cactus was really honest. She was letting the second madame hold it because she had it all planned out! A good number of leaves had grown on Huo\u2019er\u2019s body now. If the second madame really wanted to hold it, she really did have to have a certain level of courage. However, the second madame was very afraid of Huo\u2019er because of her previous injury. She immediately retreated a few steps back, knitting her eyebrows together. </p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just reminding you out of the kindness of my heart. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you, then do as you please.\u201d The second madame\u2019s acting skills were slightly lower than the senior madame\u2019s, so she revealed her true colors when she panicked. </p><br/><p>The senior madame only smiled because she assumed that Bai Xiangxiu really didn\u2019t have the guts to move to Apricot Garden on her own based on her current position. However, the old madame would never let this matter go. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s actions were a flagrant disregard of the manor\u2019s rules. Hence, there would definitely be a scene to watch when the old madame returned from the palace.</p><br/><p>The senior madame tugged on the second madame a little, signalling that the two had more or less completed their task of advising Bai Xiangxiu. When the time came for the old madame to blame someone, it wouldn\u2019t fall on them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu also knew that her behavior didn\u2019t conform to the rules, but she\u2019d been following all the rules since she came here to the point where she\u2019d become the male lead\u2019s woman. If she continued following the rules, wouldn\u2019t that mean letting herself down a little? Even though the male lead and female lead were a match decreed by the imperial powers, but Bai Xiangxiu could see that the male lead had some feelings for her. On her end, she was starting to reveal her true personality the more she became attached to the male lead.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was still looking forward to a raging romance that ancient times would bring her. After all, that was every girl\u2019s dream. People in love weren\u2019t so calm anymore, so she didn\u2019t bother with what other people thought as she started decorating Apricot Garden. She first placed Huo\u2019er aside and watered it.</p><br/><p>The bed in the main house of Apricot Garden was very soft and very comfortable. She remembered that when Long Heng slept on her bed in Winter Garden, it felt as though they could fall off at any moment. She felt that she\u2019d really wronged him during that period of time. After she\u2019d tidied up the place, she received news that the old madame had fainted in the palace. What she\u2019d expected had come after all. Bai Xiangxiu ordered the servants to tidy up the old madame\u2019s room and personally went over to arrange a few potted plants so that the ailed individual could relax.</p><br/><p>After a day, she heard news that the Dowager Empress had passed away.</p><br/><p>The whole country was to mourn for the death of a member of the imperial family, especially if the present emperor\u2019s mother passed away. Bai Xiangxiu had already made discreet inquiries earlier on. Hence, she immediately ordered her servants to hang white cloth and light up white lanterns by the main entrance of the manor at the first possible moment. After that, she ordered them to kneel before the imperial palace and knowtow as they wailed to express that they were in mourning. </p><br/><p>The other officials also arranged for their houses to carry out such activities, so for the Prince Li Manor to do something like this didn\u2019t signify that they were lowering themselves, nor did they exhibit that there was anything different between them and others. This was the result that Bai Xiangxiu wanted \u2013 she wanted to be mundanely neutral. She\u2019d just about wrapped up the matters in the manor when the old madame returned. However, her complexion was rather pallid and all she did was to sit there, crying her eyes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madame, please mourn no longer for fear of harming your body.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had already placed herself in the shoes of being a daughter-in-law, so she was naturally more intimate and concerned about the old madame compared to before. Sitting by the elderly woman\u2019s side, Bai Xiangxiu felt that the other woman sincerely treated that bosom friend of hers well.</p><br/><p>Old Madame waved her hand. \u201cAll of you can take your leave. I don\u2019t want to take over the duties of matters in the manor for the time being. Just don\u2019t bother me with any matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t harp on matters when she saw that the woman\u2019s complexion wasn\u2019t that good. She departed with her servants and personally made some light and refreshing vegetable dishes, sending them over to the old madame. That gesture of hers was considered to be fulfilling her filial duties. However, she never would\u2019ve thought that the senior madame and the second madame would\u2019ve arrived to see the old madame when she had just finished eating her meal. They didn\u2019t beat around the bush and immediately complained about Bai Xiangxiu moving into Apricot Garden. They even added on that outsiders were spreading rumors that the concubine from the prince\u2019s mansion was so spoiled that she wasn\u2019t behaving anymore. </p><br/><p>The old madame really didn\u2019t know about this matter, but she was extremely unhappy with their attitude of coming to her to tell tales about another. As such, she waved her hand and said, \u201cI will deal with this matter. You may leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Bai very rarely committed errors that people could use against her, but she really gone a bit overboard in this matter. Hence, the old madame queried Ye-mama. Ye-mama did know the entire development of this matter, so she recounted how the prince had asked Bai Xiangxiu to move over to Apricot Garden. She even mentioned that the couple had argued about this matter for half a day and Long Heng was the one who\u2019d actually admitted defeat at the end of the day.</p><br/><p>The old madame felt that something was amiss when she heard her son admit defeat. How could a woman from the rear court be stronger than the man? Although she wasn\u2019t in the wrong with regards to this matter, she still had to know her place. Hence, the old madame said, \u201cSummon her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had just finished busying about and her bottom had just touched the chair when she received the old madame\u2019s summons. Didn\u2019t the old madame ask to not be disturbed? Why\u2019s she changed her mind in just a short while?</p><br/><p>She felt that this more or less had to be related to her moving into Apricot Garden, so she headed towards the old madame\u2019s residence, feeling a little sullen about it. But, she never expected that the old madame wouldn\u2019t didn\u2019t bring up the matter of her moving residences, only speaking about a great deal of principles that she had to follow. These principles were what a concubine should do, such as treating the prince\u2019s words as her law, and to not think that she could disregard the prince\u2019s orders just because she\u2019d garnered his favor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those who witnessed the incident were now beginning to talk about how overbearing the prince was, their words tainting his public image. In reality, his reputation had always been something like that. Though he was well known for being heroic, rumors had also spread of his aggressiveness. Nevertheless, his impressive achievements threatened to eclipse that of the emperor\u2019s. After the empress dowager passed away, the emperor gave him the cold shoulder.</p><br/><p>Actually, someone had crafted Prince Li\u2019s image that way on purpose. Though the novel hadn\u2019t specified the culprit, Bai Xiangxiu could guess that it had to be that cold and black-bellied emperor. He didn\u2019t want to eliminate Prince Li, but simply suppress him. This way, he could slowly take reclaim the military power that resided in Long Heng\u2019s hands, or even redirect that power elsewhere.</p><br/><p>Currently, this emperor still lacked any useful subordinates. However, when he did find someone useful\u2026</p><br/><p>Someone useful? That\u2019s right, that dreg of an emperor did manage to find one, and it was a male supporting character to boot. Wait, that emperor\u2019s a male supporting character himself. It seemed like the male and female leads had met him before their marriage. But there was still some time before the marriage happened. She didn\u2019t want to think too much into it, because she really was exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, please pay attention to me, just one look\u2026\u201d Huo\u2019er\u2019s sadly melancholic voice drifted through the air, making Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s heart soften. She immediately got out of bed to sit by the window and apologize softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for leaving you behind for so long. You\u2019ve grown quite a bit, not bad, not bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>She\u2019d definitely pat him encouragingly if he didn\u2019t have a body full of spikes. But she really didn\u2019t dare. Just when she was spacing out and chatting with the cactus, Long Heng arrived in a new set of clothes. He was here to explain himself, because Bai Xiangxiu had fainted away from fright when she heard the news. In his eyes, she was a petite person with a delicate physique. What if she went mad again from the scare? But the first thing he saw on entering was her talking to that strange thorny plant.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t have gone crazy again, right? Without a second thought, he told Xiaoshi, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you calling for a doctor yet? Can\u2019t you see\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t get to finish because he was afraid that Bai Xiangxiu would hear him.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi reacted quickly, but the prince was actually treating her mistress better than anything right now. She was just a little worried, because she\u2019d heard the mamas say that men only enjoyed new playthings for a short while. Moreover, her mistress\u2019s face was like that now. Though it didn\u2019t make her uglier, it was still\u2026 something or another.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiangxiu heard someone talking, she turned around. When she saw that the speaker was Long Heng, her face suddenly reddened before her eyebrows furrowed aftering hearing him call for a doctor. Why call for the doctor? Was it because her stamina had yet to recover? How was she supposed to explain herself when the doctor asked why her body was so weak and listless?</p><br/><p>Both of them had things that weighed on their mind. One wanted to see whether she\u2019d been scared too badly, while the other thought it was to check why her strength was still so lacking. In the end, neither of them chose to explain themselves, leaving an awkward atmosphere in the air.</p><br/><p>It was Long Heng that ended up speaking first. The two of them were already in that kind of relationship now, so how long was she planning to stay in this little courtyard? \u201cPack your things and move to Apricot Garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that old topic again, but Long Heng was absolutely certain that she\u2019d definitely move out this time. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Bai Xiangxiu simply didn\u2019t want to move. Her reasons naturally lay in the fact that she\u2019d transmigrated into this courtyard. She still hoped that she could go back. Although she had already had relations with the male lead, it still couldn\u2019t bury her hope of returning. After living in the other world for twenty years, it wasn\u2019t so easy to just leave it all behind.</p><br/><p>Moreover, she had come from a happy family, not like those novel protagonists who were assassins or grew up in an orphanage. Her parents treated her very well, and she also had both sets of grandparents. All of these were reasons why she couldn\u2019t give up her hope of returning!</p><br/><p>Thus, she felt very conflicted. It seemed like she was falling in love. Furthermore, it was with the male lead and his protagonist\u2019s halo. Their days spent together were very sweet, which meant she needed to muster her courage if she wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I don\u2019t want to move into the Apricot Garden.\u201d Because they\u2019d grown familiar over the past few days, she\u2019d spoken her feelings out loud without any misgivings. But Long Heng grew unhappy when she voiced her desire. He\u2019d originally wanted her to move into his own courtyard, but felt that it wasn\u2019t too appropriate. Thus, he\u2019d taken a step back to have her move to Apricot Garden. This way, he could call on her and visit as much as he pleased instead of taking such a long trip. He could have her meals with her everyday as well, instead of inciting gossip by living at Winter Garden all the time. He\u2019d never expected her to refuse outright. Was she so reluctant to get closer to him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMoving is mandatory and it\u2019ll start right now. What are you looking at? Pack up your things and have the doctor go to Apricot Garden to see you. There\u2019s no need for him to run over here anymore.\u201d Long Heng had always been an aggressive type. Moreover, since this Winter Garden was so close to the borders of the estate, it\u2019d be freezing in winter. Why didn\u2019t she understand his intentions? Not wanting to say anymore, he turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was simply adamant on this point. She hurried over and grabbed him, saying hastily, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, I\u2019ll stay right here. If anyone\u2019s going to leave, it can be you.\u201d In her anxiety, she actually blurted out such words. She regretted speaking as soon as the words left her mouth.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t have experience arguing with women, but his mind was thrown into havoc at the sight of her growing angry. He pulled her into his arms and started walking outside, his movements highly domineering.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu only felt dizzy for a moment before she found herself in Long Heng\u2019s embrace. She couldn\u2019t help but start panicking. Forget about the fact that this house was filled with people, the outside was equally crowded. All that aside, she hadn\u2019t even put on her outer robes yet because she\u2019d been planning to rest. \u201cYour Highness, let me go first, let go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. How could she forget that the man before her now was from ancient times, no matter how gentle he seemed? Furthermore, he was the male lead. How many male leads were unusually gentle towards their woman? It was already quite good if they didn\u2019t treat you cruelly. Thus, she chose not to go against his wishes too much after reading countless novels. Otherwise, his sadomasochistic tendencies would show up in their romance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t put on my shoes.\u201d She pointed out a simple reason for not wanting to go out, afraid that he\u2019d tyrannically haul her there and put her through another round of suffering.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was filled with the heat of his bluster until her words dissipated his temper. Meanwhile, Xiaoshi had hastily brought over a blanket and said softly, \u201cYour Highness, please drape this over the mistress. It\u2019s cold outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng looked down at her in his arms. She really wasn\u2019t wearing thick layers at the moment. Moreover, the look in her eyes were resisting him, and she looked huffy. Even though she clearly felt wronged, she kept her tears back and stared at him as if afraid to speak. \u201cRest awhile, but you have to move over there tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Welp, so she still had to move. Bai Xiangxiu had a temper as well. After being set on the bed, she turned over so her back was facing him, and refused to speak.</p><br/><p>What a childish temper. Was she simply being difficult? What was so bad about moving to a bigger courtyard? Why didn\u2019t she want to leave? He felt frustrated and turned to leave with a dark face.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiangxiu sighed. Why couldn\u2019t she keep pretending? She\u2019d done so well in the past, hadn\u2019t she?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

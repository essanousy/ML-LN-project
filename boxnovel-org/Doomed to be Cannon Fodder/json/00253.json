She couldn\u2019t help but notice that the smile on the old madame\u2019s face was a little sinister. In fact, it bore a lot of resemblance to Long Heng\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>The old madame asked, \u201cHave you finished preparing the enslavement paper for Miss Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 Yes I have.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uneasy, knowing that a human being could be bought and sold in this world.</p><br/><p>The old madame reached her hand out, \u201cGive it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Understood,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had Xiaoshi fetch the enslavement paper and handed it over to the old madame. This was a piece of paper that could decide a person\u2019s fate. Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the old madame would decide to do with it. \u201cMother, are you planning to sell this agreement to Minister Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>We could do this and make Minister Lin owe us a favor. We should set the price a bit high though. However, both Long Heng and the old madame both stared at her. Bai Xiangxiu could tell that mother and son were looking at her oddly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to return this to Minister Lin? He probably wouldn\u2019t dare to take it even if we hand it to him. Having a daughter like that is more like a curse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 It\u2019s his daughter after all.\u201d Moreover, Minister Lin really treats this particular daughter well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be better not to have a daughter like this.\u201d The old madame looked at the enslavement paper and said, \u201cSun-mama, look for a brothel-keeper that you are acquainted with and ask her which brothel in the capital needs a new worker. Of course, we\u2019re only talking about a second-class courtesan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Courtesans in brothels were segregated by class. A first-class courtesan was multi-talented and did more than just sleep with the customers. Even the men that wanted to spend time with these courtesans would have to be knowledgeable and have a high status. A second-class courtesan was an entirely different story altogether. Their customers were there only for carnal pleasures. There would be all sorts of men visiting them, but men of high status would rarely visit. People only visited them to fulfill their desires and would never show them any pity and love. Who wouldn\u2019t do whatever they pleased after spending their hard earned money? Because of that, life for these second-class courtesans were quite difficult indeed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu naturally knew about these things as she\u2019d lived in this world for quite some time already. She couldn\u2019t help but tremble at how ruthless the old madame was. It\u2019d be impossible for the female lead to escape from her fate after sending her to such a place. Doing this would be like a slap at the emperor\u2019s face too. He\u2019d definitely feel the slap even though he was all the way in the palace. No matter what happened, Miss Lin had still once been his woman. What would the men think when they were sleeping with this second-class courtesan? Would they think that they\u2019re the emperor too?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s grinned when she realized this fact, \u201cMother, you\u2019re so evi-\u2026 I mean, this is a great idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old madame was speechless. It\u2019s one thing to be happy, but why show it on your face? What would others say when they see you like this? The old madame handed over the paper to Sun-mama. \u201cSell her for a high price. Five thousand taels at minimum. People there should know her value. They\u2019ll never earn a loss with her around. Give the money to the princess consort after you\u2019re done for her to fortify her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was a little overwhelmed by the sudden good treatment. \u201cOld Madame, many thanks for your great favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why does this sum of money feel a bit like a hot potato? But it makes me feel so happy at the same time! I\u2019m feeling so conflicted!</p><br/><p>Long Heng looked as stern as usual, but the edge of his mouth was slightly raised. As expected, his mother was experienced and wise enough to find a suitable way to handle the matter when they were at loss for what to do.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t talk about much else as the old madame had just returned home. Each family member went back to their own room to rest after they had a sumptuous meal. Bai Xiangxiu even took special care of Lin Qianzi by having the servants to clean her up and cure her illnesses. After all, Lin Qianzi wouldn\u2019t be able to fetch a high price if she was all sickly and dirty. So this is why people say that evilness spreads like a disease.</p><br/><p>Xiao Lin was going to sleep with Bai Xiangxiu and Long Heng tonight. The old madame wanted them to spend some time together as they\u2019d not seen each other for a long time. Bai Xiangxiu had truly missed her son a lot. She sat in front of the cradle and kept staring at him while smiling gently. She didn\u2019t even make a single sound, seemingly extremely afraid of waking her son up.</p><br/><p>Long Heng took a bath and applied some medicine to his body. He didn\u2019t take his injuries too seriously as they were just flesh wounds with no injuries to his bone. Moreover, scabs had already formed. He\u2019d originally planned to spend a warm evening with Bai Xiangxiu. Because of that, he couldn\u2019t help but frown a little when he saw Bai Xiangxiu cuddling their son\u2019s cradle. </p><br/><p>Xiao Lin suddenly woke up, as if he\u2019d sensed Long Heng\u2019s presence. He looked at Bai Xiangxiu and suddenly grinned. After that, he shifted his little head around as if looking for something. Bai Xiangxiu had no idea what he was searching for and thought that he wanted milk. Long Lin immediately broke into tears when he failed to find what he was looking for. He refused to drink any milk when the wet nurse came in to feed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why is he crying so much?\u201d This never happened before. Xiao Lin didn\u2019t cry very often.</p><br/><p>The wet nurse laughed. \u201cThe young prince is probably misses his grandmother. He\u2019s actually very dependent on his grandmother and likely cried when he didn\u2019t see her after waking up.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s because he misses his grandmother. I guess this is not unusual since the old madame has been the one taking care of his. Bai Xiangxiu was a little jealous, but didn\u2019t pay it too much heed since it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for them to be close to each other. So, she turned to Long Heng and asked, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should get someone to take Xiao Lin to mother. It wouldn\u2019t be a good thing if he continues to cry like this.\u201d It\u2019d be great to send him over. I can then continue hugging my little princess consort.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu never even once considered the motive behind Long Heng\u2019s words as her mind was filled with nothing but worry. And so, she carefully wrapped Xiao Lin up snuggly and handed him over to a servant who would bring Xiao Lin to the old madame\u2019s quarters. The old madame probably misses her grandchild very much at this very moment too!</p><br/><p>Long Heng hugged Bai Xiangxiu when everyone else had left the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve truly given birth to mother\u2019s precious grandson.\u201d However, Long Heng was thinking something else inside. Your son really knows how to pick his target. Mother will probably be much more lenient towards you since you\u2019re his mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. But it disappoints me a little that he doesn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a problem. We can just make one more child that will stick to you at all times.\u201d Long Heng picked Bai Xiangxiu up and headed for the bed. She immediately put up a struggle and yelled at Long Heng while blushing furiously, \u201cStop fooling around! You\u2019re still injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou asked for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lass. You will not escape from me tonight.\u201d Right after that, the new princess consort let out a wail so loud that one could see silhouettes of startled birds in the night sky seek shelter in deeper darkness.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was now in an extremely dark place as well. She was extremely frightened and couldn\u2019t even move, though her acupoints had been released. It was no longer possible for her to return to the palace now that the emperor had learned of everything. She began to think about Su Yun, who she\u2019d not seen in a few days. Lin Qianzi couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Su Yun would come to save her. It was Su Yun who\u2019d given her the idea of seducing the emperor to use him to achieve her revenge, after all. But she had now lost another child because of said revenge. She\u2019d lost everything that she once had.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to serve Long Heng, nor did she want to serve Bai Xiangxiu. Even though she clearly knew that it was not Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s fault that her son died, she just couldn\u2019t help but be consumed by hatred. After putting in some thought, she realized that it was probably just jealousy. She was jealous that Bai Xiangxiu was so dearly loved by Long Heng. She\u2019d been with countless men, yet how many truly loved her?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

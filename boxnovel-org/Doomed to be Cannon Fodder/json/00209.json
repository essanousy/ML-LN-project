Let\u2019s Sleep Together!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was taken aback when Yu Kuang suddenly barged into her room. He even bounded into bed like an energetic boy, his arms outstretched. Is he trying to say that he wants to hug me to sleep?</p><br/><p>Hello? Has this guy gone crazy?</p><br/><p>Is he trying to provoke Long Heng to a fight? Countless question marks appeared on top of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s head. She looked rather cute when all a-fluster.</p><br/><p>\u201cOlder sister. Come sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you\u2026 Yu Sh\u016b?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu opened the window to take a look at the sky. Your mother! When did the moon become round? Wait, why didn\u2019t he tie himself up as usual? Why did he suddenly barge into my room?</p><br/><p>No. He must\u2019ve tried to tie himself up. She could see lacerations on his wrist, obviously caused by his attempt to break free from his bindings. His hands were bleeding badly and seemed really gruesome. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou wilful child! Why are you running around when you\u2019re injured?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu crossed the room to grab some medicine for external injuries, and grabbed his hand to apply it. However, Yu Sh\u016b decided to use this chance to pull her onto the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was caught off guard, falling onto the bed. She was instantly swept into a tight hug by Yu Sh\u016b.</p><br/><p>Long Heng witnessed the scene, of course. He\u2019d rushed out from his bath wearing only one thin layer of clothing after hearing the commotion. In a fit of rage, he immediately pulled Bai Xiangxiu away from Yu Kuang and gave him a ferocious punch. Unexpectedly, Yu Kuang didn\u2019t even avoid his attack, taking the full brunt of the punch to the face. What\u2019s wrong with him? Long Heng found that to be particularly strange. Yu Kuang could\u2019ve avoided that kind of telegraphed punch in his sleep with his martial skills. Even stranger, why didn\u2019t he even have the beginnings of a defensive stance? He had gone flying because of the punch. </p><br/><p>\u201cOuch! Why are you hitting people for no reason?!\u201d Yu Sh\u016b was very much a child. He didn\u2019t know how to protect himself. \u201cOlder sister! Older sister! It hurts! It hurts so much!\u201d Yu Sh\u016b leaned on the wall, staggering to his feet in difficulty. There was blood on the corner of his lips and he seemed to be in a lot of pain. There were even tears on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Long Heng was speechless. Is he really a man? Why is he crying?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu suddenly walked over to him and caressed his head, consoling him with a gentle voice. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry\u2026 be a good child. Older sister will help you apply some medicine and will stop that older brother from beating you up. Alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure! Older sister treats me the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Long Heng was struggling to make sense of the situation in front of him. He couldn\u2019t wrap his head around this situation. His little wife was putting medicine on another man\u2026 or a boy, rather, while consoling him and wiping off his tears. It was literally a scene of an adult trying to console a child! Unfortunately, his eyes wasn\u2019t seeing the same thing as his mind. He just couldn\u2019t come to terms with it!</p><br/><p>However, there was nothing he could do about it. He put on the rest of his clothes and stared at them with his mouth agape. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? Is his brain damaged?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly have given Yu Kuang this much brain damage when he hit the wulin alliance head\u2026 right? However it seemed that the alliance head had already been in that state before Long Heng had even hit him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait just a moment. I\u2019ll explain everything when he falls asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep? Here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere else would he sleep? Shh. Don\u2019t be so loud.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t possibly allow Long Heng to continue misunderstanding the situation. However, she had to settle the first problem in front of her before she could move on to the second one. Yu Sh\u016b was simply in too much pain. A grown man like him was now acting like a child, crying and throwing a tantrum. He finally fell asleep while hugging onto Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s arm. He actually wanted to hug her, but that man was staring at him with such a scary expression on his face. He could only take a step back and settle with just holding onto an arm. He continued to whimper in pain until he finally fell asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Long Heng said with extreme impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Let\u2019s talk in the other room.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu dragged Long Heng out of the room and explained everything about Yu Kuang in detail. She didn\u2019t tell him about the slightly more intimate moments of course. She did tell him that she believed Yu Kuang retained no memory of when he turned into Yu Sh\u016b though.</p><br/><p>Long Heng found it difficult to remain angry at the wulin alliance head. After all, it\u2019d be wrong for him to be mad at a child\u2026 right? Unfortunately, this child was in an adult\u2019s body! Was it really alright for him to be acting all cute and cuddly? Well, it\u2019s true that I owe him for saving Bai Xiangxiu in the first place. He decided to endure it for one night and squeeze onto a tiny bed with Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang opened his eyes in a confused state the next day. He couldn\u2019t recollect anything that had happened yesterday. He only felt a stinging pain on his face. His expression quickly darkened when he touched his face. My face is clearly swollen! How did I get such a serious injury out of nowhere? A burly figure soon appeared in front of him. \u201cAlliance Head Yu, why don\u2019t we go outside to spar a few rounds now that you\u2019ve awoken?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Li. Why am I here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo outside to train with me and you\u2019ll soon understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Yu Kuang didn\u2019t back down either after being challenged. Shu\u2019er, who\u2019d come to wait upon his master, got quite a shock when they walked by. The air was suffused with killing intent. What happened? Why is there such a murderous atmosphere so early in the morning?</p><br/><p>The groggy Madame Xiu then came out of the room and frowned. \u201cWhere have they gone?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Shu\u2019er struggled to make sense of the situation. Why did two men and one woman come out from the same room? Why did the prince go out to fight with that weird man? It just didn\u2019t make sense to him no matter how he thought about it.</p><br/><p>Whap! A slap visited his head. \u201cStop entertaining foolish thoughts! His Highness and I slept together last night in the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Why was he sleeping in the same room as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe had something to discuss with His Highness and stayed for the night as it was already late by the time they were done.\u201d This is so awkward. Even a pure child like Shu\u2019er is having such thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Shu\u2019er remained skeptical. He believed that it was inappropriate to stay for the night even if it was late. And even if that was true, why would they go out to fight so early in the morning?</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore those two. Put the wash basin down here.\u201d Men were hot-blooded creatures after all. They\u2019d calm down after a fight. She couldn\u2019t be bothered as it was still early in the morning. Shu\u2019er brought in porridge and picked vegetables for breakfast some moments later. He served three bowls of porridge as there were three people here.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have much of a choice in food selection. Food was in shortage after all. Simply having breakfast was already quite a luxury. She wasn\u2019t picky at all. Long Heng and Yu Kuang entered the dining area after she\u2019d wolfed down her breakfast. They both had some injuries here and there, but it didn\u2019t seem too serious. \u201cTake a seat and have some breakfast. I\u2019ll go check up on the troops\u2019 training progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng opened his mouth but didn\u2019t say much else. He greatly appreciated that she wasn\u2019t even complaining in times like these. When Long Heng saw how Bai Xiangxiu had left in a hurry, he quickly downed his porridge and left after putting on his armor. </p><br/><p>Yu Kuang caressed his cheeks. That kid was missing Bai Xiangxiu more and more. He\u2019d been worried that Yu Sh\u016b might do something wrong, and now his fears had come true. He\u2019d actually gone to the couple\u2019s room to sleep? No wonder Long Heng was so angry. Fortunately, Long Heng hadn\u2019t really fought him for real because Yu Kuang was here to help. Since Long Heng hadn\u2019t gone all out, there had been no need for him to go all out either.</p><br/><p>He would go all out when the war with the enemy began!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu tugged on Long Heng\u2019s sleeves in excitement when he finally caught up to her. \u201cSuccess! They\u2019re so impressive!\u201d Long Heng was oddly happy when she praised his subordinates. The edge of his lips lifted up to form a smile.</p><br/><p>Check out our special releases for Halloween!

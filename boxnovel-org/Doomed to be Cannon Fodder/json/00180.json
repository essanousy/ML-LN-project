We also share similarities in our faces. It looks like these traits really are characteristic of the Bai family. She was just about to get to know her brother a little bit more when she heard the maids outside announce, \u201cGreetings to Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell. Hadn\u2019t he gone into the palace to give his new year greetings to the emperor? Why was the prince back? Bai Xiangxiu hastily stood up and took a look at her brother, noticing that he had tensed up as well. He seemed to be acting like he\u2019d done something wrong. Although Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t understand, Bai Xueru did. There were many rules and customs when it came to the residences of nobility and royalty. Women of the rear court weren\u2019t able to easily receive male guests. Even brothers couldn\u2019t be brought to their own courtyard. Although rumors abounded outside of how favored a concubine his sister was, she was still just a concubine at the end of the day. If others found fault with her, she might not even be able to pay a visit home ever again!</p><br/><p>Bai Xueru\u2019s face was a bit pale as he looked worriedly at his sister. However, she flashed a comforting smile at him instead, seemingly telling him that all was fine. That\u2019s odd. His sister hadn\u2019t liked him before, particularly after she\u2019d found out that she was going to marry a prince. She\u2019d been extremely arrogant towards the rest of the family, so why was she suddenly being nice?</p><br/><p>As he pondered, a series of dull footsteps sounded from outside, as if thudding on one\u2019s heart. Next, a man whose looks would brighten whichever room he was in came into view. He was dressed richly and had a cold expression on his face. His eyes were unusually sharp and were immediately filled with hostility when he caught sight of Bai Xueru. Goosebumps formed over his back, and his heart seemed to start trembling as well. As a young man from a scholarly family, he had difficulty maintaining his composure in front of such a bloodthirsty prince. He dropped to his knees with an audible thunk but found himself unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>Why was this scene so bizarre, almost as if she\u2019d been caught cheating on the prince? Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face flickered through an odd expression as she immediately made introductions, \u201cThis is Bai Xueru, my younger brother. He\u2019s brought some gifts from home to present to Your Highness in celebration of the new year.\u201d</p><br/><p>How would the younger brother of a concubine have the right to greet the prince in the new year? She was just mouthing empty platitudes. However, Long Heng displayed a rare show of controlling his temper. A composed expression settled on his face as he took a seat, \u201cYou may rise. Your sentiments are appreciated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a small town in the countryside and doesn\u2019t possess many treasures. As long as Your Highness finds no fault with things.\u201d Bai Xueru heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the lofty Prince Li had no intention of censuring him, but he still stammered as he spoke. However, Bai Xiangxiu could sense that this one sitting beside her had drunk wine, and more than his fair share at that. Although he seemed to be behaving as per his usual, the look in his eyes was completely different from the usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cMama, go stew a sobering soup for the prince.\u201d Someone grabbed her hand as she spoke. It was Long Heng! Playing with her hand in front of others! He was caressing her hand like he was lovingly stroking a precious treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m drunk? Silly one, I\u2019m completely fine even if they are drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d He\u2019s really very drunk. Bai Xiangxiu blushed to her ears in her embarrassment. She pinched his hand lightly, silently telling him not to get out of line.</p><br/><p>However, Long Heng seemed to pay her no heed as he tugged her over to him, plopping his head on hers to take in her fragrance, \u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hell. What are you doing, Your Highness?</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no. Mama, take Xueru to go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, X-Xu-Xueru will take his leave for now.\u201d He really couldn\u2019t stay here any longer, Bai Xueru felt that his face got any more red, it would catch fire. He hadn\u2019t thought that the coldly aloof prince would have such a side to him. His sister really did seem to be favored, but he didn\u2019t know whether this was a good thing or not.</p><br/><p>Setting aside the fact that Bai Xueru had been summarily dismissed, Bai Xiangxiu was quite troubled at the moment. The usually aloof and distant Prince Li was now a lecher who wouldn\u2019t give up. It seemed that men who\u2019d had a drink really became unreasonable lifeforms, and there was no telling what they\u2019d do next. Bai Xiangxiu was afraid that he would actually harm her because his movements weren\u2019t gentle. In the end though, he didn\u2019t. Although he did become a little too wild, and pulled all sorts of tricks out of his repertoire. She really couldn\u2019t hold up by the time he came to a close.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d already tried her best to hang on since it was the first of the new year, but after this bout, she really felt that she wouldn\u2019t be able to alight from the bed for three days.</p><br/><p>It was just as she\u2019d thought, she was rendered incapable of leaving her bed for at least three days. She could only lie there helplessly and accuse Long Heng with her eyes. He too felt that he had done wrong, so he had servants send over nutritional supplements every now and then, but they seemed to have no effect.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiangxiu could finally get up, she had an unexpected visitor. At least, she found it quite strange, why had the female lead come visiting? What did she want? Bai Xiangxiu still decided to receive her and noticed that her counterpart wasn\u2019t any better. There were dark circles beneath her eyes and her steps were shaky. Bai Xiangxiu was entirely too clear on what that meant. It was a sign of over-indulgence in one\u2019s desires!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business might Miss Lin have with me?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu coughed lightly as she asked. She didn\u2019t want the female lead to see that they had the same problems.</p><br/><p>Miss Lin glanced at her and lowered her head, \u201cThe prince treats you very well, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to back down in front of the female lead this time!</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi\u2019s expression was a bit dull. \u201cI know that the prince genuinely loves you, but I don\u2019t want to ask for anything other than being able to reside peacefully after entering the manor, and having a child with him. This is my parents\u2019 expectations. Can you allow that?\u201d She began crying as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately rose from her chair, and took two slow laps around the room. At the end, she turned to transfix Lin Qianzi with a cold glare, \u201cMiss Lin, do you like anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Two figures suddenly appeared in Lin Qianzi\u2019s mind. One of them was the rascally rogue Luo Yunzheng, the other the gentle and tender Duan Yunying. Both had great spots in her heart, but she had to forget them both.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d Lin Qianzi asked Bai Xiangxiu, perplexed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu laughed coldly, \u201cWould you give your beloved man to another woman so they can have a child together? That\u2019s not true love then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi started, and started to cry even more heartbrokenly. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to take him away from you. It\u2019s just that my parents\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do your parents\u2019 expectations have anything to do with me? Shouldn\u2019t you be asking the prince for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince, the prince hates me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, then how do you want me to help you? Drug the prince and have him sent to your bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d These words were very crude and hurtful. Lin Qianzi was instantly halted in her tracks.</p><br/><p>Even Long Heng listening outside was stunned, much less Lin Qianzi. What had she just said? Was he the man she loved? Was this why she wouldn\u2019t give him away to any other woman? Do women also have thoughts like these? But she really had been very direct, to the point of making others speechless.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

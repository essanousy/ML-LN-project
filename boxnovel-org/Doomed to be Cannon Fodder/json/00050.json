She spoke up quietly, \u201cSisters, hurry and change the bedsheets. The doctor is coming soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange? Ah, yes change\u2026\u201d They still couldn\u2019t quite react properly, and could only yank off the bedsheets to replace them with new ones. They\u2019d just got the new sheets on the bed when Bai Xiangxiu walked inside in a new set of robes, her face still a bit pale. She held her stomach as Xiao Shi supported her over to the side of the bed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi had finally helped her mistress to bed when the doctor walked in. He took Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s pulse through the bed curtains and asked, \u201cIs it Fourth Madame\u2019s monthly time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s just arrived.\u201d Xiao Shi responded from the side.</p><br/><p>Bao Qin and Bao Yu had finally come to their senses from the shock resulting from the prince\u2019s short\u2026 endurance, but was then plunged headfirst into the new shock of Madame Xiu\u2019s monthly time and the prince\u2019s face that was dark with anger.</p><br/><p>After the doctor took the madame\u2019s pulse, he said that nothing much was the matter, only that her womb was too cold and needed conscientious care. He bowed in farewell to the prince after prescribing some medicine and left in a hurry. Even though he hadn\u2019t lifted his head throughout the entire process, he could still feel the exceedingly cold atmosphere within the room. He almost couldn\u2019t breathe!</p><br/><p>When everything was settled, Bai Xiangxiu gnawed on the back of her hand and ultimately decided to apologize. She would only die faster if she didn\u2019t. Therefore, she got off the bed with an aggrieved air and tried to look as weak and gentle as possible as she walked out, supported by Xiao Shi. But when she walked outside and saw the prince glaring at her cactus with an icy expression, she naturally grew weak at the knees. That\u2019s my only hope of returning home! Don\u2019t vent your anger on it\u2026. even if it\u2019s irked you!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Madame Xiu\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Xiao Shi pulled her back upright. With Bao Yu and Bao Qin coming up from behind, the three of them finally got her upright as they combined their efforts. Every one of them had broken out in a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Long Heng, \u201c\u2026\u201d Could someone come tell him if all girls were this weak during their monthly time? She didn\u2019t even seem to have the strength to stand up straight. What was he supposed to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit! You servants should make more effort in serving your masters. Go serve some soup.\u201d What else can she eat? He didn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t ask. He could only give orders in a noncommittal tone.</p><br/><p>Bao Qin swiftly went to the kitchen. Actually, there was likely no one up at this hour to cook nutritious soup, but what choice did she have? Ignore the prince\u2019s orders? And so in this manner, as Bao Qin searched for a cook, half of the complex learned of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s monthly matter. Bai Xiangxiu was now firmly convinced that she wouldn\u2019t be able to set foot out of her courtyard the next day for fear of meeting anyone\u2019s eyes, but she said nothing and only responded docilely, \u201cThank you for Your Highness\u2019 care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe nights are cold, sleep early!\u201d He\u2019d come hot and bothered, but now was escaping from fright. He decided right then and there, he would never speak of this to anyone. With a flourish of his sleeves, Long Heng straightened his clothes and left. He wanted to stay the night, but he couldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t that he paid any attention to talk of a woman\u2019s monthly bleeding adversely affecting luck. No, it was because he wasn\u2019t familiar enough with Bai Xiangxiu yet. He knew that she\u2019d only feel uncomfortable if he continued to stay. Since that was the case, he might as well return and let her servants focus on taking care of her. Resting well and recovering her health was the most important matter.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu almost knelt on the ground in gratitude. Who wouldn\u2019t thought that Long Heng would have moments of compassion? The most important thing was that Huo\u2019er was fine. It had been frightened into babbling nonsense already. \u201cMistress, mistress, that man is so scary! His aura is so deadly! He\u2019s going to kill you and then kill Huo\u2019er\u2026\u201d Look, it was even crying with fright. She began to comfort it mentally as Xiao Shi pulled her off to bed.</p><br/><p>When Long Heng returned, the pageboys were all frightened. Didn\u2019t he say he was going to spend the night at Winter Garden? What was he doing back here instead of consummating his union in the middle of the night? However, no one dared ask him and Long Heng flopped onto bed without another word. He was thinking, seven more days\u2026</p><br/><p>The doctor had said that most girls needed three to seven days before their body was clean. But Long Heng felt that with n\u00e9e Bai\u2019s health, seven days was completely insufficient. At least ten days were necessary! Then ten days it would be. It wasn\u2019t as if he couldn\u2019t afford to wait. He\u2019d gotten something for his troubles today anyhow. Sleep wasn\u2019t forthcoming as thoughts of that pale, tender body continued to torment him.</p><br/><p>However, who would\u2019ve thought that the old madame would learn of this matter. When he visited his mother the next day, the old madame seemed to have just finished saying something to the mama\u2019s. She stopped immediately when she saw her son arrived, but the twitching at the corner of her lips revealed her repressed desire to laugh.</p><br/><p>Long Heng froze at the door, then spoke, \u201cYour son will leave for now so that I won\u2019t cause mother to suffer from repressed emotion.\u201d Obviously, his mother had found out about last night, and was laughing at him! He felt quite depressed but was still worried about n\u00e9e Bai, so he ordered servants to send over some medicinal herbs.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d thought that she would stay at home and rest, but the servant who delivered the herbs came back to say that she\u2019d gone to Sandalwood Courtyard on some business. \u201cWhat is she doing, not resting?\u201d He hadn\u2019t set foot outside all day because he felt that he had lost face because of the matters of the previous night. Although the servants didn\u2019t say anything, they were likely braying with laughter inside. But she, she\u2019d gone out! Long Heng grew depressed at this news.</p><br/><p>The servant responded, \u201cSandalwood Courtyard bought some bolts of inferior cloth yesterday. They were to be delivered to the Old Madame and other madames to be made into clothes, but the Senior Madame said something was wrong with hers, so Madame Xiu has gone for a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such matters were within her purview. He had no response other than, \u201cKeep an eye on things. Have her go rest if she\u2019s tired and tell her those are my orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The servants were dismissed.</p><br/><p>Long Heng kept paying attention to this matter because he was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it all. The servants dutifully reported back before long that he needn\u2019t have worried at all. N\u00e9e Bai had sent back the cloth with a few words and ordered new ones. She\u2019d given the senior madame one more bolt of cloth out of gratitude, and had taken it from her own share.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that she\u2019s quite good at taking care of affairs? No one will be able to say a thing about what she\u2019s done. He was quite pleased, but also felt that she\u2019d come off worse in the exchange. Everyone had two bolts of cloth, but she only had one.</p><br/><p>He started walking around as he thought and headed into the city streets. Long Heng was still speechless by his own actions after he passed by a few stores selling cloth. Why was he doing this himself? And why, after walking for so long, did he feel that none of these ordinary cloth was worthy of her tender skin?</p><br/><p>He browsed through a few more stores before finally finding a bolt of lacy satin from the outer regions. It would be wonderful if she wore clothes made out of this. He paid five hundred taels for one bolt and happily sent it to Winter Garden. Long Heng had thought that she would be uncommonly happy, but hadn\u2019t thought that he\u2019d create quite a joke with his actions.</p><br/><p>The ladies of Winter Garden circled the bolt of lacy satin, staring at it in a daze. The prince had ordered their mistress to turn it into clothes, but all the women knew that although the lacy satin was luxurious, it wasn\u2019t suitable to be made into clothes because it was too soft. It could only be used in decoration or undergarments. Just what did the prince mean with his order?</p><br/><p>The girls were in a dilemma. Bai Xiangxiu frowned, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Of course she would pose this question to everyone, she wasn\u2019t born and bred in ancient China.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi answered, \u201cWe can\u2019t make something this soft into outerwear. What about a skirt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be too easy to trip on the skirt if the fabric is too soft.\u201d Bao Qin responded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If it hadn\u2019t been for that particular innovation, things would have been rather problematic. The expression on Long Heng\u2019s face was clearly much better than before, but he didn\u2019t know the pains that she\u2019d gone through to preserve her chastity. Even so, a hot finger brushed against the wound on her face. \u201cFoolishness.\u201d Long Heng spoke in a slightly harsh tone as he draped a robe over her. </p><br/><p>As soon as the robe was settled over her shoulder, Long Heng had leapt up to engage Luo Yunzheng in combat. He didn\u2019t hold back this time, and commanded all his men to attack Luo Yunzheng with a wave of his hand. Luo Yunzheng wasn\u2019t afraid either. With a quick flick of his finger, he summoned a few of his fellow jianghu experts from a few floors above.</p><br/><p>So, this is the reason he wasn\u2019t afraid! Long Heng sneered at the sight of the reinforcements and said, \u201cDo you really think that your few men can stop the Prince Li troops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you made preparations from the start!\u201d Luo Yunzheng didn\u2019t want to lose men unnecessarily, so he glanced at Lin Qianzi and said, \u201cI\u2019ll come for you later tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to see you again\u2026\u201d Lin Qianzi hastily retreated, waving her hands. From her expression, she seemed extremely afraid.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng\u2019s only response was to whistle as he jumped out of the window. His men followed closely behind, putting up a fierce rearguard action. Long Heng didn\u2019t pursue them because Bai Xiangxiu, who had been standing upright just now, suddenly swayed and collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu hadn\u2019t wanted to faint either, but she\u2019d really endured too much hardship over the past couple of days. It was almost as if she wouldn\u2019t be doing right by this body if she didn\u2019t faint already.</p><br/><p>How would Long Heng still have the heart to chase after Luo Yunzheng after seeing her in a dead faint? He immediately carried her to the bed and gently lay her down. After that, he summoned a doctor to check her. </p><br/><p>When Bai Xiangxiu regained consciousness again, she was lying down on a bed inside Red Maple Mountain Villa. She was clean and tidy, though her face hurt a little. Brushing her hand over her injury, she realised that it\u2019d already been tended to. The only difference was the lack of band-aids in ancient times, and the resulting bandages made her a bit of a scary sight.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi and Xiaohuan were attending to her at the front of the bed. Both of them were crying to the point where their eyes looked like walnuts. She originally thought that they would ask the classic, \u2018Madame Xiu, are you feeling alright?\u2019 when she woke up.</p><br/><p>However, contrary to what she thought, Xiaoshi\u2019s immediate response was to turn her head and direct her words to the outside, \u201cYour Highness, Madame Xiu is awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following which, an enormous shadow covered the side of the bed. The knots in her heart actually loosened a little as the shadow covered her. She raised her head to look at the man who had walked over. Why were his eyes a little red? Had he not slept well these days because of her? Her heart was pounding hard. She\u2019d never been in a relationship before, and it was just too unbearable for a woman who had been afflicted with the \u201cThree Days of Inebriation\u201d poison. Her entire body was burning up just from his manly scent. What was she to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d She struggled in hopes of getting up, but someone pushed her back down instantly. His warmth burned Bai Xiangxiu for a moment, causing her face to turn beet red in response. She no longer dared to struggle against his hold on her.</p><br/><p>Long Heng said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to get up. How is your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She was disfigured, but the look in his eyes didn\u2019t change. Albeit rare, he was still looking directly at her!</p><br/><p>Long Heng paused and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have someone treat your injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, will you disdain this concubine now because of my destroyed face?\u201d Actually, saying that her face was destroyed was a little excessive. The other party had only scratched her face with their long fingernails and left a long wound. It wasn\u2019t deep enough to see bone. If the appropriate medical treatment was administered to the wound, she was unlikely to be so ugly to the point that she couldn\u2019t show her face to the public. However, it would definitely leave a scar. Any man who loved beauties would mind if a woman had a scar on their face.</p><br/><p>As it happens, Long Heng was never one who\u2019d cared about the appearance of others. Putting it another way, he\u2019d never formed a favorable opinion of beautiful women due to his experience on the battlefield. Hence, it didn\u2019t matter to him whether her face was scarred or if she looked disfigured. He was only upset when looking at that scar only because he felt that it was very embarrassing for him, as a man, to have his woman abducted from right beside him. </p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense. Take care of your injuries.\u201d He really wasn\u2019t a gentleman at all! If he\u2019d been slightly gentle to her now, she\u2019d have gladly thrown herself into his arms! However, she felt a shiver run down her spine when her mind conjured up an image of a gentle Long Heng. Deep inside her heart, she felt that it was already quite good for him to act this way already. </p><br/><p>Even though Long Heng hadn\u2019t asked her about the matters that occurred after she went missing, she still wanted to make life difficult for those like Duan Yunying and Yaya.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had already concluded that Yaya was a woman who\u2019d been reborn. That was why she could speak with such arrogance and pride. Being reborn always created a chip on one\u2019s shoulder because they knew the plot. This was why they had the haughty attitude of being able to see through everything and everyone. But, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t understand what exactly she knew that justified her arrogance. She\u2019d also read the novel, and the author had even replied to a comment she\u2019d written afterwards, yet Bai Xiangxiu still didn\u2019t dare make any large moves. Wasn\u2019t Yaya afraid of being burned?</p><br/><p>Besides, that woman\u2019s master was a pervert, to put it nicely. To put it bluntly, he was a control freak. If someone broke free from his control, he would want to chase after them and put them under his thumb once again. That was originally why he\u2019d wanted to control the female lead. His poison had had no effect on her, since the male lead had been the unexpected beneficiary. As for herself, she was in even greater danger. Hence, she wanted the male lead to understand how dangerous they were before he made a move. At least, this matter could possibly be related to them. </p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, Sir Duan was the one who saved me. I hope he\u2019s not in danger!\u201d She narrated everything that had happened, and naturally wanted to emphasize how Duan Yunying had \u201caccidentally run into her\u201d on the way. She even acted like a little white flower and deviously related, \u201cAi, I could actually come back when I looked that way. It was a pity that Sir Duan just had to protect me as he is such a warm hearted and upright person. He only ran into danger as a result of that. Your Highness, you must save him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng couldn\u2019t help but to be suspicious after carefully listening to what she said. He thought for a moment, and admitted that not many would\u2019ve been able to recognize Bai Xiangxiu if she looked like she had when she\u2019d returned today. Since Duan Yunying had recognized her, it was natural that he\u2019d want to protect her, but the process had been slightly awkward. Although Long Heng had indeed just received Duan Yunying\u2019s letter about Bai Xiangxiu, the letter hadn\u2019t mentioned where to go find her. Besides, the letter had come a bit late, since it\u2019d only just arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince knows what to do.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel good at hearing that she was placing another man in her heart, and had already silently decided that he would have to chase this Duan Yunying far, far away regardless of his background. </p><br/><p>But, Bai Xiangxiu felt as though she hadn\u2019t put enough pressure on the matter and redoubled her efforts. Hence, she touched her face lightly. \u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the characteristics of the woman who harmed you?\u201d Long Heng asked in a cold voice. </p><br/><p>He truly did care for her! He\u2019d finally asked that question! \u201cThat woman is a little scary. She\u2026 seems to be crazy! Moreover, she hates this concubine with a vengeance. It was almost as though I\u2019d stolen something from her. Actually, it looks that she knows you, Your Highness. She even knows martial arts!\u201d </p><br/><p>Long Heng nodded as he wondered who fit that particular description. Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t help but try to remind him. \u201cShe ought to be a fine-figured beauty with a very fragrant scent around her. But, there was something a little odd about her. Her eyes seemed to shine with the faintest tinge of blue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A tinge of blue in her eyes? Long Heng wasn\u2019t an idiot. When even this point had even been called to his attention, how could he not guess who that person was then!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

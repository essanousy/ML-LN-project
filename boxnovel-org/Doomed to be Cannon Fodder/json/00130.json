Before long, her palms were trembling from pain as they gamely held onto the chafing handles of the wheelbarrow. Nevertheless, she persevered until she made her way out the city gates.</p><br/><p>She had just inquired about the location of Red Maple Mountain Villa. According to the directions, she would arrive once she\u2019d walked 2.5 kilometers from the city towards the mountain. The mountain wasn\u2019t easy to climb, but she could discard the wheelbarrow when she reached the foot of the mountain. </p><br/><p>After all the trouble she\u2019d gone to in order to push it out of the city, she tried her best to keep the wheelbarrow under control, but she was too tired, and her arms were beyond sore. The wheelbarrow wrested itself from her hands in the end and bumped into someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m extremely sorry. Did that hurt you?\u201d She ducked her head as she apologized, but froze when she heard the voice above her, \u201cYour voice, cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it. She still hadn\u2019t managed to get away! She was so close to being able to ascend the mountain. Bai Xiangxiu subconsciously thrust the wheelbarrow away and turned to leave, but that person had already tightly grasped her hand.</p><br/><p>She could feel it, there was no way to escape now. She gritted her teeth as she turned around. She feigned an extremely innocent appearance and shed a few tears as she spoke. \u201cYou are\u2026 are Sir Duan. Were you searching for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at her appearance, Duan Yunying hated her with a passion. He didn\u2019t expect that he would actually come upon her by accident on his way back to Red Maple Mountain Villa.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d already given up finding her. He\u2019d tried his best, but hadn\u2019t thought about how well she could hide. She really was quite adept at it, and looked so slovenly that he couldn\u2019t recognize her at all. If it hadn\u2019t been for her voice, he may have just overlooked her right now. </p><br/><p>Well, this was also good. Since she\u2019d bumped into him, she wouldn\u2019t be able to blame him for being impolite. Only, this current appearance of hers really killed his appetite to eat her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu, you\u2019ve suffered greatly. The prince even dispatched all of his people to find you. The world outside is too dangerous. Why don\u2019t we find a place to hide while I search for an opportunity to secretly send you back to Red Maple Mountain Villa?\u201d Duan Yunying could smell the sheep manure clinging to her body; it was incredibly disgusting. This wouldn\u2019t do! First things first was to wash her clean. With this appearance, he wouldn\u2019t want to make a move no matter how hungry he was. </p><br/><p>How would Bai Xiangxiu not know of the conflict in his mind? Although Duan Yunying appeared very calm and steady, his heart must be torn between disgust and the itch to spring into action!</p><br/><p>Judging from how badly his hand was trembling, he was fast losing the fight to conceal his inner turmoil. Alright, since he wanted to take her to bed so urgently, why not help him along? Bai Xiangxiu smirked inwardly and suddenly pounced into his embrace, trembling like a leaf, \u201cAlright, all will be as you say. But, in order to let the prince know I\u2019m safe, could we send a letter to him first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying\u2019s chest heaved. He was inches away from throwing up. Bai Xiangxiu was cackling with crazed laughter inside, but she was afraid that he would really throw up on her, so she hastily stood up to fake an extremely shy appearance. </p><br/><p>Duan Yuanying clutched his chest, and his voice came out in stilted, pained words, \u201cPlease come this way.\u201d He was really struggling to hold it together. He let go of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t seem to want to hold it again. Bai Xiangxiu discreetly sighed in relief. It looked like she would be safe for now. However, it\u2019d be a different case once she\u2019d cleaned up. He\u2019d likely want to immediately roll in the sheets with her and plant the parasite in her.</p><br/><p>She was brought into the city again. Because his identity was already in the open, and out of worry that she\u2019d become suspicious, Duan Yunying naturally wouldn\u2019t wear the peach blossom mask in front of her. He\u2019d also thought this way in the novel, and had stayed by the female lead\u2019s side with the identity of a little white rabbit.</p><br/><p>Alright, since he hated her current appearance, she would do her best to maintain it then. If she couldn\u2019t win in a fight, she would just disgust him to death! I\u2019m willing to bet that he won\u2019t force me to take a bath! Even though her current appearance was very disgusting, she could only continue to suffer in this way. Fortunately, she herself was unaffected, since she had become used to the smell.</p><br/><p>Alright, truth be told, she was just trying to convince herself. She really did stink. But that was how things would be! She looked at the water that\u2019d been fetched for her and viewed her reflection. A mutilated face, topping a body covered in filth, stared right back at her.</p><br/><p>Even she hated the sight of herself, let alone any other man. The gash on her face in particular was jarring. It wasn\u2019t deep, but was terribly painful.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d actually liked this face very much. It was such a pity that it was destroyed. But that was alright. Once she returned to the male lead\u2019s side, he would search for methods to help her fix it. She remembered that the plot had once gone that way as well with the female lead, but she wondered if he would be so disgusted by her appearance that he\u2019d want to throw up as well, and keep his distance? </p><br/><p>Someone suddenly knocked on her door. If she guessed correctly, it was likely the newly washed up Duan Yunying. Alright, then she would continue to disgust him. There was nothing else to do for the time being, anyways.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had honed her acting skills to an exceptional level since she\u2019d started living in the prince\u2019s manor. Even if she couldn\u2019t turn it off and on like a switch, she was leagues ahead of her previous self.</p><br/><p>She opened the door and carefully looked around. \u201cSir Duan? Please enter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying couldn\u2019t help but frown when the odor hit him as soon as the door was opened. After all the trouble he\u2019d taken to wash himself clean, why was she still like this? He\u2019d thought that she\u2019d finished ahead of him.</p><br/><p>But, Duan Yunying was currently playing a very weak scholar, so he had to feign delicacy and weakness to the best of his ability. He coughed lightly a little and said, \u201cMadame Xiu, why have you not washed yet? Are the servants not serving you properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Come in first and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu pulled him inside, even though she knew he would hate her for it. She was quite happy and almost trembling with delight just imagining the contortions his inner self was going through. Indeed, Bai Xiangxiu felt that she was becoming a little odd. Was it that all those who were mistreated would end up becoming a little warped as well?</p><br/><p>All in all, she felt that this was how she was right now. She wouldn\u2019t surrender to this pervert, but rather fiercely counterattack instead. Although she would suffer a bit for it, he wouldn\u2019t have an easy time of things either.</p><br/><p>Duan Yunying\u2019s entire body tensed up after he was pulled in. He almost forgot to breathe at that moment. A killing desire rose in his heart, but he couldn\u2019t do so right now, so he could only suppress it.</p><br/><p>He calmed down and forced a smile. \u201cWhy are you still this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is because this concubine was kidnapped out of the Red Maple Mountain Villa by some villains and was forced into this appearance. That group is extremely perverted, and they\u2018ve been continuously chasing me. If I recover my original appearance, I fear that I will bring trouble to you. Since Sir Duan is a scholar, it is best to be careful.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu explained it away as if speaking of the weather. Duan Yunying was stumped, and left without an appropriate retort. First off, the acrid odor was slowly eating away at his insides. Secondly, it seemed that he had just been called a pervert.</p><br/><p>He forced himself to smile faintly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected that Madame Xiu would\u2019ve considered the matter so thoroughly. Although, you will suffer for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t refute her words since Bai Xiangxiu had identified that he was a \u201cscholar\u201d. This was indeed his identity in front of Long Heng. He\u2019d used medicine to hide his qi so that Long Heng wouldn\u2019t see through him.</p><br/><p>Then again, how would he dare mention anything else in front of this sly woman? This woman was almost the opposite of the honest and gentle woman from the rumors. She\u2019d meticulously planned her escape step by step with all kinds of schemes. How could those be the actions of a good and gentle woman?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

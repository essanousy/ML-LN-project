Just as she was about to relax, her son burst through the doors. He obviously wasn\u2019t here for a casual stroll or to look at the flowers. He was clearly only here out of concern for n\u00e9e Bai. Why is he so concerned about her? How can there be danger when she\u2019s with me?</p><br/><p>But when she saw the way Madame Song was holding Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hand, the old madame immediately knew that her son must know something that she didn\u2019t. That was why he was being so cautious. However, she couldn\u2019t help but be rendered speechless when she saw how Madame Song was looking at Bai Xiangxiu. It was almost like she was staring at a rare and excellent delicacy. Realizing that the banquet was about to start, the old madame notified Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cA mama will serve some food to you later. There are some dishes here that you cannot eat right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Old Madame.\u201d Why go through all that trouble? I already know what I can or cannot eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Do you have some food you can\u2019t eat?\u201d Madame Song asked while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. She has a large list of prohibitions at the moment. Any food that might invigorate blood flow or food that are too yin in nature are all off-limits.\u201d The old madame covered her mouth with her handkerchief and smiled joyfully. Her smile was so wide that even the wrinkles on her forehead seemed to have gotten deeper.</p><br/><p>Even though publicly announcing a three-month pregnancy was said to bring bad luck, every lady at that table clearly understood the old madame\u2019s implication. They all immediately congratulated Bai Xiangxiu, embarrassing her greatly. The banquet thus began in a joyous mood. However, nobody noticed the killing intent hidden deep in Madame Lin\u2019s eyes. Surprisingly, she was quite good at keeping her calm. Her priority right now was to redeem her family\u2019s name, so she could suffer a little for now. </p><br/><p>Even though Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s morning sickness was no longer as big of a hindrance as it was before, she was still sensitive to all sorts of odors. She started feeling unwell after just a few bites of food. After sending someone to notify the old madame, Consort Rong then had her servants escort Bai Xiangxiu from the banquet to rest.</p><br/><p>She had barely rested for more than five minutes at a nearby pavilion before a maidservant came up to her with a letter. Bai Xiangxiu was puzzled. Why would somebody send me a letter in Prince Rong\u2019s manor?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 Song Jiaoyue?</p><br/><p>Impossible. That man would always observe proper decorum. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d do something strange like this. She opened the letter to take a look. \u201cMadame Xiu. See you in Prince Rong\u2019s rear garden. I have something to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>The letter was actually sent by Lin Qianzi!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the female lead. Why did she return all of a sudden? Hasn\u2019t she already eloped with Luo Yunzheng? I mustn\u2019t meet with her. The last time I did, she\u2019d nearly caused a miscarriage. Only an idiot would want to meet with her after the last time. Thus, she handed the letter over to Xiaoshi and acted like she hadn\u2019t seen it. </p><br/><p>The messenger was unhappy when she saw what Bai Xiangxiu had done. After some careful thought, she spoke up, \u201cThat lady is very pitiful. Won\u2019t you meet with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>So it seemed that Lin Qianzi\u2019s white lotus act wasn\u2019t exclusively used on the male lead and the supporting male characters. She was clearly using it on the other members of the supporting cast as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow she is is none of my concern.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s temper had been really bad lately. Why the hell would she be afraid of these lowly servants when she\u2019d dared talk back to Prince Li himself?</p><br/><p>The servants from the Prince Rong Manor quietly backed away, not daring to press the matter. They took their leave, and went to inform the pitiable lady that Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t going to meet with her. However, they didn\u2019t foresee that the pitiable lady would grow enraged after she heard the response. She began to weep, \u201cGood\u2026 very good. She dares treat me like this? Good\u2026 They killed him. I must have revenge\u2026 revenge\u2026\u201d </p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi had gone insane. She stormed into Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s rest area to personally meet the concubine. Bai Xiangxiu had just finished vomiting at that moment and was just about to make her way back to the manor. However, Lin Qianzi suddenly appeared and charged towards her. Unbridled fury colored her voice as Lin Qianzi shouted, \u201cBai Xiangxiu! Why are you afraid to see me? You slut! It was all your fault! He came to find you, but the both of you murdered him when he came to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMurdered? Who?\u201d Duan Yunying\u2019s murder immediately came to mind. As a matter of fact, she\u2019d seen his gruesome murder with her own eyes. When that scene began to rise in her memories, she couldn\u2019t help but feel the urge to vomit rise yet again. She held her hands over her mouth and began to retch.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi followed up, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to put on a piteous act. Summon that murderer named Long Heng! Was loving you such a sin that it justified murder?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Blarghhh\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu truly vomited this time. This one though, she believed, came from her disgust for Lin Qianzi. Your mother. Is her brain wired differently or something? When did that man ever say that he loved me? And why does she think that Long Heng would murder him for that reason alone? Is there a hole in your brain? How do you manage to come up with such absurd things?</p><br/><p>The old madame and the other ladies had already finished their meals and were on their way to the pavilion. They were chatting as they walked, and came onto the scene as Lin Qianzi screamed at Bai Xiangxiu. Across from the former, Bai Xiangxiu was clutching her chest with her hands, her complexion ashen. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu and Lin Qianzi were currently worlds apart in terms of their outer appearances. Bai Xiangxiu looked delicate and pitiable, dressed in simple but luxurious clothes. As for the eldest daughter of the Lin family, she now looked like she had gone insane. Her hair was messy, and her complexion as pale as a ghost. Even her silky-smooth, fair face now looked a bit little rough around the edges.</p><br/><p>Madame Lin was devastated when she caught sight of her daughter\u2019s current state. She immediately ran up to her and hugged her tightly. \u201cMy daughter! What have you been through to end up looking like this? It hurts mother so to see you this way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadly, Lin Qianzi pushed her mother aside and said, \u201cDon\u2019t get in my way. I want to avenge him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that man dead? He deserves to be killed!\u201d Madame Lin vented. That man had dared kidnap her daughter. The heavens were indeed just.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not him. It\u2019s Duan Yunying. Long Heng murdered Duan Yunying. He\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Madame Lin quickly interrupted her daughter. Since Duan Yunying was her daughter\u2019s teacher, she naturally knew who he was. She also knew that they had had ambiguous relations, but why would her daughter bring it up in front of so many people? Was her reputation no longer important to her? Moreover, why would that man be murdered all of a sudden? What was going on?</p><br/><p>The old madame scrunched up her forehead as her voice turned graved, \u201cWatch your words, Miss Lin.\u201d Was she trying to smear the good name of the Prince Li Manor?</p><br/><p>Her words served as a reminder for Bai Xiangxiu as well. Why had she suddenly gained another admirer all of a sudden? If word was to spread, wouldn\u2019t she end up in exactly the same spot as the female lead?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to be known as the men\u2019s lady, so she immediately hid her face behind her hands and started crying. \u201cThis concubine has only seen Sir Duan once when I\u2019d accompanied His Highness to the Red Maple Mountain Villa. Miss Lin, what would you gain from slandering me like this?\u201d She had no choice but to redirect attention back to Lin Qianzi to avoid suspicion. Being slandered for doing something she hadn\u2019t done truly felt awful. </p><br/><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t like you\u2026 Then why would he\u2026\u201d ignore me? Lin Qianzi somehow managed to swallow her words before they landed her in trouble. Undeterred, she followed up with, \u201cThen why would he stare at you during my wedding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could feel her brain shrink. She then carefully replied, \u201cThen who should he have stared at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was at a loss for words after she heard that impartial sentence. Lin Qianzi could only glare at Bai Xiangxiu with eyes that were red throughout, as if she had suffered a great insult. </p><br/><p>Even though the novel mentioned time and again how you love everything and everyone, isn\u2019t your heart a little too wide for your own good? Why would you come back to ask about Duan Yunying when you\u2019ve already eloped with Luo Yunzheng?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

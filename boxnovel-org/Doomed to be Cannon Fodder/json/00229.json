She thought that a concubine was no different than a modern world\u2019s mistress, so her voice was naturally filled with contempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu answered with her head down, almost like she was shy. </p><br/><p>Su Yun furrowed her brows. Is this really a woman who had her soul transmigrate over? \u201cWhy are you blushing?\u201d Su Yun couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>However, the other person only seemed to instinctively touch her cheeks and asked in a confused manner, \u201cAm I really blushing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Yun replied, \u201cWhy do you know how to manufacture gunpowder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read about it in some books.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBooks? You\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ve learned it from books?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the ratio\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRatio? What\u2019s a ratio?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t communicate with you. How did you know how much of each ingredient you needed to use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all written in the book?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu decided to follow through with her act to the end. There was no way Su Yun could recognize her since only her soul had transmigrated to this world. Moreover, she hadn\u2019t done nothing out of the ordinary up to this point, so she wasn\u2019t too worried that Su Yun would realize who she really was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of book is it? Can I have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoman. Don\u2019t overstep your boundaries,\u201d Long Heng snapped. He didn\u2019t want her to continue questioning Bai Xiangxiu. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay a few days since you\u2019ve already come? Stop thinking about unrelated things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes General Long really not need my assistance? What if I tell you a way to take down their main army camp?\u201d He will definitely agree. After all, isn\u2019t he here to do just that? Once he agrees to my help, I\u2019ll be able to find a foothold here. If this concubine really was a woman from the olden times, Su Yan wanted to see if she could get a thrill from stealing that concubine\u2019s man right out of the lady\u2019s arms. </p><br/><p>\u201cI, Long Heng, do not need your help, nor do I see them as a worthy enemy.\u201d He turned around and left, one hand pulling Bai Xiangxiu along. He couldn\u2019t help but frown. He\u2019d seen all kinds of women, but he\u2019d never seen one as bold and arrogant as her. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss even if he didn\u2019t receive her help. After making some arrangements for Bai Xiangxiu, he turned his attention back to trying to take down the enemy. However, he had to first make suitable preparations to deal with the enemy\u2019s poison and parasites. Long Heng was actually quite experienced in dealing with both of these. He wasn\u2019t too skilled in them, but he had some subordinates who were. Many of those subordinates were from Shu County. The army easily came up with many countermeasures with the help of the Shu County citizens that Ah Quan had brought over to help.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had decided not to leave her tent as she had no interest in dealing with Su Yun at all. Everything would be fine as long as her husband ignored that woman. It\u2019d be even better if she kept herself out of sight so that Su Yun wouldn\u2019t cause problems for her. Bai Xiangxiu could tell that Su Yun\u2019s princess syndrome had flared up again just from the look in her eyes. Su Yun\u2019s thoughts always became extremely twisted whenever she saw a man that she liked but the man didn\u2019t return her feelings.</p><br/><p>What a classic case of princess syndrome. Bai Xiangxiu thought to herself as she tidied Long Heng\u2019s tent. Men are men after all. They\u2019re all the same, whether from the olden times or from modern times. Their rooms are always a mess if nobody picks up after them. Aren\u2019t they afraid that they might trip on the things laying around on the floor or something?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu suddenly felt a presence behind her as she was putting things away. She turned to look, but her acupoints were struck before she could utter a single word. In fact, she didn\u2019t even manage to make a single sound. Commander Lu loomed above her, wearing a soldier\u2019s uniform from Long Heng\u2019s army. \u201cAsk whatever you need to ask quickly. I\u2019ll wait for you outside,\u201d Commander Lu said to Su Yun beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t expect Commander Lu would personally come to save her. It seems that his feelings for her are genuine. Su Yun had brushed Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s hair aside while the latter was still caught up in her own thoughts, allowing Bai Xiangxiu to look upon her adversary clearly. \u201cYou truly are very beautiful. You can talk now, but you better not shout. I can cut up your pretty face whenever I feel like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what do want from me?\u201d It was almost like a white lotus flower had possessed Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s body. Her entire body trembled like a leaf as tears streamed down her face. Most female transmigrators hated white lotus characters very much. Bai Xiangxiu guessed that Su Yun probably felt very much the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Why are you crying before I\u2019ve even said anything? Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re some kind of newborn kitten. Tell me, did you transmigrate into this world? I\u2019m not a patient person. If you did, then come with me. What\u2019s the point of being a concubine to another man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing! You might as well surround yourself with men if you\u2019ve transmigrated here. Make them your chess pieces and have them worship you! Make use of them when you feel like it and kick them away when you\u2019re tired of them! There\u2019s a lot of men here anyways. Just wave your hand and a bunch of them will come running to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound like a good thing to do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not good about it? Isn\u2019t looking at high quality men the entire point of transmigrating into the past? Why would you willingly be owned by them? There\u2019s all sorts of men around here. You need to taste them one by one to really take in their flavor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face was full of horror. Dearest missy, aren\u2019t you quite a player? You\u2019re planning on fooling around even in the olden times as well? Color me thoroughly impressed. </p><br/><p>\u201cWipe that look of horror off your face. Why are men allowed to fool around with women but not the other way round?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how are you different from the prostitutes in brothels if you sleep around like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap! Bai Xiangxiu suffered a slap to her face. Su Yun laughed derisively and continued. \u201cThose women are being played by men. They have no choice! But big sister here is the one playing with men instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. So you\u2019re just a higher class prostitute than them,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu said, nodding as if she\u2019d finally understood. \u201cThere are men with good hearts here as well. Why would they treat you with sincerity when you don\u2019t treat them the same way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that women must treat men with sincerity? Men will make you the center of their world if you have the capability. Hurry up and tell me. Did you transmigrate into this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But that book did say it had come from a different kind of world. It said that it had come from a peaceful world, and that everything they\u2019d learned were now obsolete so they wrote it down in a book.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And have you brought the book here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI read it when I was young. The book is long gone by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Your memory is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis concubine is from a family of scholars. My memory is naturally a little better than most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then you have no choice but to come with me.\u201d Su Yun immediately began to drag Bai Xiangxiu away. Since Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t a transmigrator, Su Yun had no choice but to bring Bai Xiangxiu back to the camp and interrogate her thoroughly to get the formula. Conquering nations would be as easy as flipping one\u2019s hand over if she could mass produce gunpowder. Long Heng would then wallow in regret for not begging for her help. Bai Xiangxiu was now genuinely afraid to call for help. She knew very well that Su Yun was a ruthless person. She\u2019d never hesitate to kill if she felt like it.</p><br/><p>Out of nowhere, a sword tore a hole in the tent\u2019s wall. A figure dashed towards Su Yun wielding a sword. She was quick to react and evaded the attack almost instantly. But by doing so, she also tossed Bai Xiangxiu aside. Su Yun received quite a shock when she saw the rescuer\u2019s face. She\u2019d never imagined that there would be someone who looked so much like a celestial being in the enemy camp. However, she also knew that now was not the time to gawk at him. She quickly ran out of the tent and escaped with Commander Lu.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang wanted to chase after them, but he quickly realized that Bai Xiangxiu was still lying on the floor and wasn\u2019t moving. Moreover, her face had drained of all color as she grit her teeth in great pain. He hesitated a little before running to her side and releasing her acupoints, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2026 it hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The last chapter was translated by Grace, who\u2019s also translating the very cute mystery Supernatural Girlfriend!

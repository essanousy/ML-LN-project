Her hand holding the tea shook, causing her to spill half the tea. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t hot enough to burn her. However, her heart was another matter, as it was afire with anxiety wondering whether the male lead was thinking about her.</p><br/><p>Actually, there was nothing bad about that. The male lead was both handsome and powerful, as well as capable\u2026 cough, she hadn\u2019t read that novel for nothing, nor did the male lead\u2019s halo exist for naught. He had many aspects that attracted people. But in the end, no matter how many good points he possessed, he was still the chief culprit of her death!</p><br/><p>As a girl with exceptional memory, she clearly recalled the other servant girl who\u2019d been beaten to death, and felt awful all over. All of her thoughts, proper or improper, scattered in the wake of that one memory. On the other hand, Xiao Shi had a brilliant idea as she ran to blow on her mistress\u2019s hand with a distressed air. \u201cMadame Xiu, your skin is so tender, burning it must hurt. Hurry and blow on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you blowing for? Go get some Red Pearl,\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t want to speak up, but he had to when it looked like this servant girl would keep blowing without stopping.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi was about to fetch the item when Bai Xiangxiu stopped her. \u201cDon\u2019t go. I wasn\u2019t burned, so there\u2019s no need to waste it. Go out and have a look, Old Madame should be on her way.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t any worried mother come running over to see this wounded victim here?</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi nodded and left. Someone had to receive the old madame when she arrived. Once she was gone, Long Heng said, \u201cThough you\u2019re in charge of the household, don\u2019t be so tightfisted with yourself. If there\u2019s anything you need, just bring it up with me. How would I let you lose out on anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks to Your Highness!\u201d She seemed overwhelmed by an unexpected favor, but kept to established etiquette.</p><br/><p>This time, Long Heng felt rather depressed over how she always kept her distance from him. Couldn\u2019t she tell his feelings for her? Thus, the prince began to self-reflect and realized it really was hard for the other party to tell.</p><br/><p>The closest they\u2019d been together was when they\u2019d met each other with full sincerity, 1 but before they could do the deed, she\u2019d ended up \u2018bleeding\u2019 instead. Later on, his nervousness had kept their meetings brief and their partings long. Would they ever be on intimate terms if this was the style of their interaction?</p><br/><p>As his thoughts reached this point, he sunk into low spirits. At that moment, the old madame entered the room, tears welling up in her eyes as she laid eyes on her precious son. Her voice was choked as she spoke, \u201cYou child, you\u2019re not that young anymore! Why are you still stirring up trouble everywhere? Where did you get hurt? Let mother have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, the old female servants helped her to the bedside while Bai Xiangxiu quickly brought over a seat. The old madame sat down and spread her hands, but she was too scared to know where to put them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu spoke up from the side, \u201cThe prince\u2019s wound is on his leg. The doctor has already applied medicine and said that it\u2019s just a flesh wound. It was a good thing that it hadn\u2019t reached the bone, so he has just lost a lot of blood. But he will be fine after spending some time recovering.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Old Madame immediately went to look at her son\u2019s legs beneath the covers, but was stopped by Long Heng\u2019s outstretched arm. \u201cMother, I get major and minor injuries all the time. One more is of no consequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose major and minor injuries come from the battlefield. This is the capital; how did you become so hurt? You couldn\u2019t even make it back to your own courtyard and didn\u2019t call for anyone either. Are you going to tell me or not?!\u201d The old madame was truly anxious as her voice grew in volume. By the end, she was almost shouting, disregarding anyone who cared to listen.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t grow angry, but waved his hand to dismiss people who had no business being there. The old female servants and young maids all understood and slowly retreated outside with a bow. Bai Xiangxiu was planning to leave as well, but Long Heng said, \u201cMadame Bai, pour some tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he wasn\u2019t letting her leave? That\u2019s right, now that everyone else had gone, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to serve them if she left too. Thus, she poured two cups of tea and placed them on the little table by the old madame\u2019s side. Then, she blinked. Do I leave now?</p><br/><p>The old madame didn\u2019t care about that, but asked, \u201cIs it something that others shouldn\u2019t know? Perhaps, that girl from the Lin family?\u201d Her son had left this time to look for her, but came back with a body full of injuries. If this wasn\u2019t related to her, then what?</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t conceal anything, revealing the entire story from beginning to end. Although he found the girl disagreeable, he didn\u2019t reveal how she\u2019d been pressed beneath the body of that man from the jianghu, or how her clothes had been nearly stripped bare.</p><br/><p>But the old madame still smote the table hard once she heard him speak. The shockwaves were almost enough to sent the teacups falling. Bai Xiangxiu was worried that she\u2019d burn her hand and quietly picked up the teacup, waiting until her temper settled before she put the teacup back.</p><br/><p>Long Heng remained calm as he drank his tea without batting an eyelid. \u201cShe\u2019s done too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not just too much, but something completely out of bounds from the novel. But truthfully speaking, that number two supporting male was quite formidable, though his martial arts skills were slightly inferior to Long Heng\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Still, what\u2019s the female lead doing? Can\u2019t she figure things out? She actually went to help the person who kidnapped her, resulting in the male lead\u2019s injury. How could the male lead like her after something like this? Admittedly, that really was like the female lead. A little white flower who couldn\u2019t keep her priorities straight. But didn\u2019t all the men fall for her because of that? When had that changed?</p><br/><p>It might\u2019ve been because of the male lead. Who knows how he\u2019d found out about the circumstances behind the female lead fleeing that day. Maybe he\u2019d changed then.</p><br/><p>In other words, when something like this happened before the male lead developed feelings for her, it was just like adding frost on top of snow. If things kept going like this, the story would completely change. Could she still be a proper prophet then?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wrung her handkerchief as she stood on the side. Once the story escaped from her grasp, what could she do? Keep hugging on to someone\u2019s thigh, or find a way to leave?</p><br/><p>No, there was no place to go once she left the prince\u2019s estate. Even surviving would become a herculean task. Moreover, she still had a chance to return as long as she pricked herself on the cactus on the same day she came. If she left this place, it\u2019d be harder than before to get in again. Though the story had shifted, the male and female leads were still the same. She\u2019d keep hugging a thigh and avoid courting disaster or becoming the target of jealousy. What can possibly happen after that? Suicide? She didn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>After making her decision, she kept listening but inadvertently caught Long Heng glancing at her. Their gazes met in midair, but both of them averted their eyes before sparks could happen.</p><br/><p>The old madame had rapidly become indignant as she spoke. \u201cA woman like this who offends public decency can\u2019t marry into our family. I\u2019ll go reject this marriage proposal right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not that simple. Minister Lin and Madame Lin naturally understand the state of their daughter\u2019s public standing. If we bring up cancelling the marriage now, it\u2019ll completely destroy Miss Lin\u2019s reputation. So they\u2019ll definitely oppose or delay the idea.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s analysis was sober and practical, but when he looked up, it was to catch Madame Bai\u2019s surprised, disbelieving gaze. She didn\u2019t seem to think he\u2019d reject the marriage proposal.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this woman was entirely kindhearted. No one in the estate had a dissenting opinion when it came to that particular tidbit. When a servant\u2019s house was destroyed in the floods, she\u2019d even given her money in secret. If any of the servants had troubles, she made sure to help them. She really was a compassionate, uncontentious person who never offended anyone.</p><br/><p>But he\u2019d incurred injuries for the sake of bringing that other woman back. Shouldn\u2019t she worry about him before worrying about other people? Thus, Long Heng was currently feeling jealous on behalf of a group of pitiful and clueless people.</p><br/><p>1.

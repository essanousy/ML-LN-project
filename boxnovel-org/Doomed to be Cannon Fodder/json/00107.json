Everyone had a tinge of rashness to their personality. Otherwise, why would the ancients say that even rabbits would bite when pressured?</p><br/><p>Even though Bai Xiangxiu was a little rabbit, however quiet and likable she appeared, there would always be a time when she was unable to hold herself back. It was just that he hadn\u2019t thought it would appear while she was sleeping. A feeling of sweetness came over after he was smacked, and he decided not to disturb her further. Since you want to sleep, then sleep!</p><br/><p>\u201cWarm the room a bit more,\u201d Long Heng instructed unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi\u2019s mouth dropped open for a moment before she snapped it shut and answered, \u201cYour Highness, if the pit is too hot, one can easily suffer from excessive internal heat,\u201d If not for her mistress\u2019 own good, she never would\u2019ve dared to say that.</p><br/><p>Prince Li glared at her for a moment, but didn\u2019t follow through with his earlier instruction. With his concubine asleep, it was really not good for him, a man, to remain here! Therefore, he thought for a bit before deciding to personally make preparations for leaving. There were a couple of matters within the manor that would have to be taken care of by the steward, and he needed to leave behind a few instructions on how to handle them.</p><br/><p>When all the preparations were completed, he went to Winter Garden again, finally seeing the person he wanted to see. However, she appeared rather nervous at the sight of him, even colliding with a table while walking. Prince Li rubbed his head. When an opportunity was missed, it would not come about so easily again. Therefore, he decided to let it go today.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu also felt despondent. After she\u2019d been kissed, she\u2019d then slept for the greater part of an afternoon since her brain had been starved of oxygen. She just couldn\u2019t compose herself after seeing the person in question again. Especially when the person had actually been gentle then, her mind had actually come up with a few fantasies.</p><br/><p>After all, she was considered rather old already in modern society, having long since reached marriageable age. Being hugged by a man like the male lead was the stuff of dreams. Think about it, this was the male lead! He had a possessing appearance, strong figure, insightful knowledge as well as a high position. He\u2019s literally the tall, rich, handsome and domineering CEO of ancient times. If a girl didn\u2019t like him, then there was clearly something wrong with her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had always felt herself to be a good girl with normal principles. It was only natural that there were times when her heart itched for action. However, after calming down, she thought of that accursed Mr. Plotline once again. She\u2019d been receiving blows silently thus far, which was the reason for her lack of progress. But if he flirted with her again, she would definitely be unable to control herself. Therefore, while she scolded herself for being lustful, she also scolded herself for being too ridiculously bold. She dared to even have the male lead on her mind and wasn\u2019t at all fearing that she might be discovered and instantly killed by the female lead one fine day, and be left unable to return to the modern world.</p><br/><p>She had continuously made mistakes because she was too conflicted. She\u2019d thought that her act thus far would\u2019ve lead to the male lead disliking her, but the male lead had actually said that he would stay. Although, he\u2019d asked her to go an adjoining room. What was the significance in doing so?</p><br/><p>She was just about to go rest some more when she saw the male lead. He already seemed to have taken a bath, and said, \u201cSit, let\u2019s talk for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>What an honor, the male lead actually wanted to chat with her? Bai Xiangxiu sat down, slightly agitated but wanting to hear what this usually steady, cold male lead intended to say. However, even after some time had elapsed, the other party had yet to speak.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t speak until she\u2019d accidentally yawned out of tiredness. \u201cPack up your luggage when you have time. We head to Red Maple Mountain Villa tomorrow at noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Maple Mountain Villa?\u201d That sounded like a familiar name! Bai Xiangxiu thought for a moment before she remembered. Wasn\u2019t this Red Maple Mountain Villa the place in the novel where the male lead and the female lead solidified their love?</p><br/><p>In the novel, it\u2019d seemed that the male lead wanted to spend some time alone with the female lead. Therefore, he\u2019d forcefully brought her to that specific location after the old madame had left home to recuperate with the goal of secretly spending time with her.</p><br/><p>The female lead had still resisted him greatly at that time. Therefore, the male lead had tyrannically grounded her inside, spending an entire day with her in that location. In the end, the jianghu supporting male lead had also found his way over there and some conflict or the other had resulted. Because it was related to something that had happened early on, Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t too clear about it.</p><br/><p>It was just strange. With the plot having diverged so greatly, why was he still going there? Even still, Bai Xiangxiu felt a little afraid. Could it be that amidst all this chaos, everything would still converge back to its original path? Then, then, wasn\u2019t she doomed no matter what? I really want to cry. So she asked in a very casual manner, \u201cIf I may, why are we going to the Red Maple Mountain Villa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who knew that the male lead\u2019s face would darken as soon as she asked? He suddenly stood up and paced around the room.</p><br/><p>This matter was a loss of face and not actually something he should\u2019ve mentioned. However, while he clearly knew this, he was actually still unable to hold it in because he no longer treated Bai Xiangxiu like an outsider in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Qianzi is not as good as you think she is. She\u2026 outside\u2026\u201d Such a dirty matter was indeed rather inappropriate to mention to her. As a girl from a scholarly family, how would she be as \u2018capable\u2019 as that Miss Lin, finding a man less than a day after running away? That man was also well known as a womanizer, but who would have thought that he would be obsessed with a noble miss like her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to her outside?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu wanted to hear some gossip about the female lead, and so she blinked rapidly and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen she fled last time, she was saved by a man in the jianghu., And that man\u2026 fell in love with her at first sight. Thus, he\u2019s shown up continuously at the Lin Manor to cause trouble. We might have to bring her along this time, but that\u2019s nothing you have to worry about. Just take it like going on a trip.\u201d He really didn\u2019t want to speak more on anything regarding that woman, yet he wanted to converse more with Bai Xiangxiu. Looking at her figure under the light of the candles, she was simply beauty incarnate.</p><br/><p>Who said that beauties were no good? At the very least, they were good for admiring, alright?</p><br/><p>Oops, it seemed like the one who had hated beauties before was himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she very pitiful then?\u201d These were not Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s true thoughts. What she was currently thinking was that the female lead had indeed found that supporting male lead. If that was the case, things were a bit chaotic then. That man seemed to have taken advantage of virtually all parts of the female lead apart from that final step. Thinking about it, it was rather a loss for the male lead.</p><br/><p>Also, in the novel, in order to obtain the female lead, he had even brought together many martial arts experts from the jianghu to take a stand against Prince Li, forcing those of the imperial court and those in the jianghu to view each other as hated enemies. This had caused a great deal of trouble for Prince Li at court. He had even been stripped of his power to marshal soldiers for a time afterwards.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, she furrowed her brows. Seeing this, the male lead actually felt a little jealous. She was actually concerned about a woman like that. Really, what was there that should be pitied? If she\u2019d just stayed obediently at home, what were the chances of encountering a man like that? Also, that cousin of hers was probably no honest person either. Who knows how stained she was now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to pity that woman. If you have time to, you might as well water the plants\u2026\u201d and spend time with this prince. However, he didn\u2019t have the courage to openly voice such words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater\u2026the plants?\u201d Prince, what\u2019s with your hatred towards the female lead? Could it that jealousy has already been born? Looking at it, it didn\u2019t seem like it. It was like he really was irritated by her. From the original novel, Long Heng was a principled man with strong opinions on many matters.</p><br/><p>Whether it was matters of the country or the family, his was a personality that would not let others easily in. It was just that he was inexperienced in the area of relationships, perhaps not knowing how to deal with them, which was why he often gave the appearance of being a little naive and direct, perhaps even violent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

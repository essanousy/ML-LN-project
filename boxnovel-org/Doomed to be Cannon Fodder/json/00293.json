So, generally, she was so busy that she didn\u2019t think of other things. This lasted right until Ah Song gave her a hairpin before he departed with Prince Li to Tranquil City. This was clearly not related to the medicine. This was definitely a token of illicit relations! Xiaoshi\u2019s heart began to feel unstable. Surprisingly, her mistress immediately guessed that Ah Song was responsible and said that he treated her differently from the others. Xiaoshi wasn\u2019t sure how differently Ah Song treated her, but she definitely knew that her heart was in disarray. She actually prayed that he would return safely and hurry back from Tranquil City.</p><br/><p>She waited for a very long time to finally see Prince Li and Ah Song return. But the moment he saw her, his face reddened and he ran off. Xiaoshi was depressed. At least say a few words before running away, why don\u2019t you? Why does he always run away with a red face?</p><br/><p>Later that night when she and her mistress were about to set out somewhere, something flew through her window and landed on her foot. It didn\u2019t hurt all that much, but it certainly surprised her. Xiaoshi hurriedly picked it up and realized it was a strange piece of jewelry. The next day, she found out from the princess consort that it was an item women in Tranquil City wore around their ankle. It signified that she would follow the man who gave her the item, never to leave his side.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi stomped her feet. How could Ah Song give me something like this? It\u2019s too\u2026.</p><br/><p>Too laden with meaning!? Xiaoshi agreed with the princess consort\u2019s analysis. But who knew that an element of waiting would appear in Xiaoshi\u2019s life? By the time Prince Li returned, the princess consort was in the process of giving birth. Xiaoshi didn\u2019t have time to think of anything else as she waited for the child\u2019s birth. Xiaoshi\u2019s next encounter with Ah Song was in early spring.</p><br/><p>He still blushed very easily; so much that his eyes would wander in all four directions whenever he saw her. It was as if he was prepared to escape at any moment. Yet, Xiaoshi actually smiled at him. She was quite happy to see that he had safely returned without missing an arm or a leg. For some reason, Ah Song was so stunned by the smile that he could no longer stand properly. He tensed and turned, ready to run. If not, he was afraid he would do something he couldn\u2019t control. </p><br/><p>\u201cStay where you are!\u201d Xiaoshi was flabbergasted. Why was he running off again? At least make things clear first!</p><br/><p>Ah Song instantly halted his steps, but didn\u2019t dare to turn around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back. You\u2019re too far. Can you hear what I am saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes\u2026.. I can. Regardless of how low your voice is, I can hear you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I still want you to come back. If you\u2019re not coming back, I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m never going to see you again\u2026. You\u2026 why did you come back so fast!?\u201d Ah Song was in front of her in the blink of an eye. He almost scared her to death!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026..I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and mention our situation to the princess consort soon!\u201d Xiaoshi sighed again. If she didn\u2019t speak up, the two of them would probably remain in this agonizing state forever.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Ah Song appeared very ecstatic. He reached his hand out and took it back. Then, he lowered his head and stated, \u201cUmm.. Prince Li has already promised to betroth you to me. I\u2026 can remain in the manor and y-you\u2026.don\u2019t have to leave as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi\u2019s face flushed. He\u2019s already mentioned it to the prince?! For a man who turns red as easily as he does, he must really want to be with me, right?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, remember to hire a matchmaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-big s-sister Xiaoxiaoxiaoxiaoxiaoshi..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.sister your head! I told you to call me that before because I thought you were a woman. But now, you\u2019re actually a man. Not only that, you\u2019re older than me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Then, Xiaoshi, look forward to the day I take you as my wife.\u201d Ah Song disappeared right before her eyes again after this statement. Xiaoshi felt that she was destined to marry a man who was way too similar to a ghost in this lifetime. What was with this ability to vanish whenever he wanted to, anyway? </p><br/><p>The two of them waited until after the princess consort was finished with the traditional one month confinement period following childbirth. But before Ah Song could see the princess consort, his master became the emperor, and the princess consort became the empress. All of a sudden, the two were very busy and had other priorities. </p><br/><p>Xiaoshi was fine, but Ah Song was beginning to feel inferior. Xiaoshi had been promoted to a senior position in the palace, and her monthly salary was now much higher than his. Furthermore, men weren\u2019t allowed to live in the chambers of imperial concubines. So, he had to be squished in a room filled with other hidden guards. Now that Xiaoshi\u2019s position was much higher than before, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if she were to marry a minor male official.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Ah Song hadn\u2019t seen her in a very long time. He missed her. Hence, one fine day when Xiaoshi was carrying tea out of a building, Ah Song swept past and abducted her, taking her behind an artificial mountain. It was the first time he had kidnapped someone before. Then, he surreptitiously inserted a lovely headband into her hands as he smiled slightly. She could marry whoever she wanted. Or she could continue being a palace maid. He would always remain by her side to guard and protect her.</p><br/><p>But Xiaoshi suddenly pulled away and stopped him, \u201cYou idiot, fool, Ah Song\u2026 If someone sees us, we will be severely punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hidden guard engaging in an illicit relationship with a palace maid. That was a capital offense!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If someone discovers us, run. Tell them I forced you.\u201d Ah Song rushed through his explanation. He was worried she would be negatively affected by his actions. </p><br/><p>Xiaoshi was touched. \u201cThe empress said I could marry you at the end of the month. As long as you buy a house, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Really?\u201d Ah Song was so excited that he began to jump up and down. He leaped to the top of the artificial mountain, but then came back down because he felt it was inappropriate. Then, he awkwardly rubbed his head.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi was happy to see him acting so giddy, \u201cOh yeah, do you have money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes I do. Prince Li\u2026 I mean, the emperor often rewards us. I have accumulated four to five hundred taels. It is enough to buy a house. You can keep the rest and buy whatever you want with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly, what else do I need?\u201d As a palace maid living in the palace, she wasn\u2019t lacking anything. Her secret stash of money was more than five hundred taels, but she felt very warm when Ah Song told her about his savings. It seemed her courage in raising that issue with the empress hadn\u2019t been in vain. Although she\u2019d miss her mistress after marrying out of the palace, having her own home was also something she very much looked forward to. So just like that, Xiaoshi was married half a month later. The empress was very generous to her servants and gave Xiaoshi quite a lot of dowry.</p><br/><p>But no one knew how stressful Xiaoshi\u2019s bridal night was. It turned out that Ah Song didn\u2019t know how to take off a woman\u2019s clothing; especially the bridal gown. He\u2019d spent nearly an hour trying to take it off. By then, Xiaoshi\u2019s face was practically green.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit trembling. Why don\u2019t I just do it myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Today, I must be the one to serve my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you can do so!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I am positive!\u201d After that particular exchange, the two of them turned red. Why did it seem like there were hidden meanings behind those words?</p><br/><p>Eventually, the clothes came off. The next day, Xiaoshi understood why her mistress had always walked around rubbing her sore lower back. She would complain and say men who knew martial arts were all wolves. That day, Xiaoshi finally understood what her mistress had meant. Ah Song was truly a wolf. And he was definitely very capable. She honestly shouldn\u2019t have said those words to him last night. She had ended up digging a deep hole for herself.</p><br/><p>See, she had dug such a deep hole for herself that she couldn\u2019t even move to make breakfast. It was Ah Song who had gone to cook her breakfast in the end. However, when Xiaoshi saw Ah Song\u2019s bashful smile as he looked at her, she felt like her life was perfect.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

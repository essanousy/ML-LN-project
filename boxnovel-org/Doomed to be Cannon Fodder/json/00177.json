There truly weren\u2019t any flaws in her story for him to pick out. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t tell him about the incident where she\u2019d taken a knife for Song Jiaoyue\u2026 </p><br/><p>Believing only about half of her story, he said coldly, \u201cEven if he pleads for your release, I will keep you in my manor for the rest of your life. Don\u2019t even think about leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no intention to leave either! Alright?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu countered resignedly as she blinked her eyes. It was as if she was saying, \u201cWhat can you do about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s anger immediately evaporated. Why does my anger vanish into thin air every time she makes those faces? Even though he knew that her words weren\u2019t trustworthy. he couldn\u2019t stop trying to convince himself that she wasn\u2019t that sort of person and that he was overthinking things.</p><br/><p>One part of him wanted him to be skeptical, yet the other part wanted to believe her. He felt very conflicted indeed. Every time he confronted her in anger, her charm would mellow him out instead. Then he would enter a valley of tenderness and just couldn\u2019t bring himself to scold her anymore. Even when she wanted to go out for a stroll, she would just have to poke him whilst they were in the sheets and he would immediately give in. </p><br/><p>The imprisonment quickly turned into one only in name after a few days. Even though she was technically being imprisoned, she was allowed to go out for a stroll everyday and would only return when she felt like it, all the while with Long Heng\u2019s accompaniment. But just when Long Heng was about to unground her, something worrying happened. </p><br/><p>A mysterious man snuck his way into the prince\u2019s manor without being seen by the guards or even Long Heng\u2019s concealed bodyguards. He\u2019d lingered in the manor for quite a some time before finally arriving at Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s room. At that moment, Bai Xiangxiu and Long Heng were playing a game of chess while drinking tea.</p><br/><p>When she caught sight of the mystery person, she dropped her teacup in disbelief. Because Long Heng was right in front of her, she tilted her head and took a closer look at the newcomer, afraid that her eyes were playing tricks on her. In the end, there was no doubt. This person was indeed Yu Kuang.</p><br/><p>Why has he come to the Prince Li Manor? How did he find this place? Most importantly, why is he looking at Long Heng with so much hate in his eyes? Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t react in time. Eyes wide open, she stared stupidly as Long Heng stood up to ask coldly, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Kuang. I assume you\u2019re Prince Li?\u201d Yu Kuang closed the door politely and looked at Long Heng straight in the eye, as if he wished to have a private chat with the prince. His aura was in no way less imposing than that of Long Heng\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Kuang? Alliance Head Yu? To what do I owe the honor of your presence?\u201d Long Heng asked while calmly looking back at him. Even though he seemed completely at ease, he was actually highly guarded and had subtly blocked the path to Bai Xiangxiu. If this man made any suspicious movements, Long Heng would find a way to have Bai Xiangxiu leave first. He was well-aware that this man was here for the woman behind him.</p><br/><p>Just as he expected, Yu Kuang then pointed his finger to Bai Xiangxiu and said, \u201cShe\u2026 is your concubine. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot your official wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026No. But what does that have to with you?\u201d Long Heng was turning into a block of ice, flooding the room with frost. However, Yu Kuang wasn\u2019t the least bit affected by it as he continued, \u201cSince she\u2019s not your wife, why don\u2019t you give her to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Swish! A hidden blade flew across the room. Yu Kuang tilted his head slightly to evade the attack. Unfazed, he continued, \u201cYou have more than one concubine. What does it matter to you to give one of them to me? To right my wrongs, I have to fulfil my promise and make her my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife?\u201d Long Heng clenched his fist and retorted coldly, \u201cDoes a well-respected wulin alliance head such as yourself have trouble finding a wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu gulped nervously. This is bad. A wulin alliance head is here to add to the trouble before the Song Jiaoyue matter is resolved. And he has multiple personalities at that too! Thank god it\u2019s Yu Kuang that came. Yu Sh\u016b would probably have just taken me before anything else. </p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the vaunted Prince Li have trouble finding more women? If you truly can\u2019t find any, I can locate some beauties and send them to you. That person alone is enough for me.\u201d Yu Kuang was absolutely serious. His celestial-like face was now voicing words that would cause many other women to swoon over him.</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know whether I should sing his praises or scold him for speaking this nonsense. Bai Xiangxiu was a little touched. Not a lot of men were able to say such a thing in the olden times. Apart from being ascetic, he likely really wasn\u2019t much of a lecher.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Long Heng had noticed the expression in her eyes. Unable to suppress his anger, he ordered, \u201cGet out or don\u2019t blame me for being discourteous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng had already made his move before his words came out, yet Yu Kuang met him straight in the middle. No weaker than each other, their battle was highly perilous. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t expect these men to be so hot-blooded to start fighting at a moment\u2019s notice. However, it was obvious that they didn\u2019t want to alarm others. Even though they were fighting, they did so only inside the room and only made muffled and quiet noises. Yu Kuang obviously doesn\u2019t want people outside to be alarmed, but why is Long Heng doing the same as well? After putting some thought into it, Bai Xiangxiu finally understood why. Is Long Heng doing this to avoid tarnishing my reputation? The truth didn\u2019t really matter. She was touched by his gesture nonetheless.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Your Highness, Alliance Head Yu is actually my benefactor that saved my life when I was kidnapped by Luo Yunzheng. Do you remember the benefactor that I mentioned earlier? This is him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng had no intention of stopping. Instead, Yu Kuang had something to add, \u201cI\u2019m not your benefactor. I promised that I would marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t agree to that. So\u2026 Alliance Head Yu. You\u2019re being a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiangxiu!\u201d Yu Kuang had raised his voice at her a little. He was likely worried that she might reveal the fact that he had multiple personalities.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was extremely displeased when he heard Yu Kuang call out his concubine\u2019s name. He warned sternly, \u201cShe is this prince\u2019s woman. You have no right to order her around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang immediately retorted with, \u201cShe\u2026 must become my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>He remained thus insistent because he had finally recalled everything that had happened between Yu Sh\u016b and Bai Xiangxiu, including seeing her shoulder and her wounded back. But most importantly, he had seen her gentle and caring side. Yu Sh\u016b was so captivated by her that his feelings had spread to Yu Kuang as well. </p><br/><p>When he\u2019d come looking for her after settling his business, Yu Kuang realized that she wasn\u2019t Song Jiaoyue\u2019s concubine after all. After listening in on the conversations between Song Jiaoyue and his maidservants, Yu Kuang realized Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s true identity was Prince Li\u2019s concubine. </p><br/><p>But it hadn\u2019t been easy to locate her. He\u2019d had to hide within the manor and eavesdrop on the servants to finally piece the clues together. It turned out she had been imprisoned by Prince Li. People from the jianghu didn\u2019t care much about the status and identity of women. They simply followed the whims of their heart. Moreover, he had actually come with the intention of negotiating in peace, but this Prince Li just wouldn\u2019t let her go. Finally remembering that he was actually here for peaceful negotiations, he quickly added, \u201cWe can talk terms if you hand her over me. I can give you anything as long as it\u2019s within my capabilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng smiled coldly and replied, \u201cAlliance Head Yu. The only wish I have is for you to get the hell out of my manor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang was furrowed his brows. Could it be that she was speaking the truth when she said that they are truly in love with each other?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

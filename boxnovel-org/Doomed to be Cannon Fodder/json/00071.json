She said, \u2018They speak not of human matters when meeting with humans, and are humans with no matters in the human world.\u2019 Young master, won\u2019t you say these words are ingeniously clever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue\u2019s eyes brightened as he spoke. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Se thought a bit and said, \u201cThere is, there is; she even told a story to your servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of story?\u201d Song Jiaoyue rose until he was sitting up on the bed, smiling as he listened to her talk about Bai Xiangxiu. He was growing more and more attracted to her inner self. There were plenty of beautiful women in this world, but few who were both beautiful and talented. Those who were talented as well as interesting were as rare as a golden toad.</p><br/><p>It just so happened that Bai Xiangxiu was this kind of woman, because the story she told Yu Se and Bai He was none other than, the women at the bottom of the mountain are tigers! 1</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue couldn\u2019t stop laughing upon hearing it, gasping, \u201cShe\u2026 where did she hear this from, it really\u2026 really is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he thought of the little monks at the Buddhist ceremony who knew nothing but pretended they did, he felt even more strongly that this story was both justified and amusing.</p><br/><p>Yu Se spoke up as well. \u201cCompared to her, your servant\u2019s stories aren\u2019t that interesting anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Now that Song Jiaoyue had heard and laughed his share, he waved a hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go sleep as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, do you not need anyone to serve you tonight, either?\u201d Yu Se\u2019s face flushed. It wasn\u2019t that she wanted to spend time with him, but that she worried he\u2019d hurt his youthful body if he persisted in this way.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue adopted a stern look and said, \u201cWithdraw!\u201d With her in the estate, how could he be in the mood to frolic with other women? She was that very same tiger at the base of the mountain. By now, she\u2019d already burrowed into his heart.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a certain Prince Li who was still painfully oblivious of his feelings was wearing down the floor in his room as he paced. It\u2019d been two days since he\u2019d started this strange behavior. He couldn\u2019t seem to get her out of his mind. The only times when he stopped thinking about her was when he had to go to court. \uff2ftherwise, he could only think about being at her side.</p><br/><p>But she wasn\u2019t here.</p><br/><p>Ye-mama came everyday to report the situation at the Song estate to Old Madame. She always came back with praise, such as how much Madame Song liked her, or how the people by Song Jiaoyue\u2019s side appreciated and admired her, or how she was doing her utmost for the Song family, or how she hadn\u2019t lost any face for the prince\u2019s estate.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t care about any of this. It was fine even if she raised a row and turned the Song estate upside down. As long as she could come back earlier! But today Ye-mama had actually come back and said that she was doing quite well at the Song estate, and that Old Madame and the prince had no need to worry.</p><br/><p>Long Heng creased his brows. Did this \u2018quite well\u2019 mean that she didn\u2019t want to come back? Coincidentally, the old madame was feeling well enough to attend the vegetarian banquet, but he immediately jumped at the chance to represent her, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Madame nearly dropped the teacup in her hand. Fortunately, the old female servant on the side managed to lend her a quick hand to straighten the cup before its contents could burn anyone. She coughed lightly twice before peering at her son. Though her lips twitched, she managed to contain her smile. A man with such a volatile aura as him wanted to attend a vegetarian banquet. Wouldn\u2019t all the jaws in the capital drop at the news?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so surprised? I\u2019m going in your place, so they can\u2019t say anything.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t think he was losing any face, mostly because his overarching goal made him ignore everything else.</p><br/><p>The old madame adopted a stern countenance. \u201cHeng\u2019er, no matter how bad Miss Lin is, she\u2019ll be an official wife once she steps past the door. Madame Bai will always be a concubine. You have to remember, a concubine is a servant, while a wife is the real\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she finished, Long Heng snorted and stood up, his face going red with fury. \u201cIf she\u2019s going to be someone\u2019s official wife, she has to act like one. With her shameful ways\u2026 forget it, you should take care of recuperating first. Don\u2019t get angry over trifles.\u201d</p><br/><p>He almost blurted out the details of how he had found Miss Lin under another man\u2019s body that day. Who knew if they\u2019d even done the deed before. If news of that day spread, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to marry again. Plus, he had to leave himself a backup for any circumstances. He only wanted to comply with the imperial decree so far as to bring this person into his house as an ornament. If he was forced, he didn\u2019t mind spreading this incident around until everyone knew.</p><br/><p>Old Madame sensed that her son was keeping something from her, the critical point that made him unwilling to marry Miss Lin. It must have been something he found out while going to rescue her. But, she really couldn\u2019t interrogate it out of him if he didn\u2019t wish to say. Forget it, since marrying Miss Lin made him so indignant, why not follow along with his wishes!</p><br/><p>He could like whoever he wanted. Large households had their share of enemy husbands and wives. But a proper son had to come from the official wife\u2019s belly. In this situation\u2026 well, </p><br/><p>Old Madame didn\u2019t say anything. Her son was still smooth and evasive when it came to handling matters, so she didn\u2019t need to worry about this point.</p><br/><p>Going over to the Song estate, Bai Xiangxiu was currently overseeing the collection of vegetables as well as directing the cooks in the kitchen. Though the dishes were supposed to be delivered at noon, cooking a hundred of them required at least two working kitchens. Disregarding the pounding headache she had when she woke up, she began walking between the two kitchens as soon as she woke up in the morning. Sometimes she could sit in the center room and rest a bit, but she\u2019d be called over after only drinking two sips of tea. Bai Xiangxiu had always been scrupulous in her work, so anytime someone asked her a question, she would go see them personally.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu, you should slow down in case you fall.\u201d There were so many hands in the kitchens that she was almost knocked over by a young pageboy carrying firewood.</p><br/><p>Yu Se\u2019s face was drained of color in her shock. Her master would worry himself to death if she fell. She had been instructed that morning to help out Madame Xiu in the kitchens, but never expected her to be such a diligent, hardworking mistress who personally oversaw every issue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. The taste of this dish isn\u2019t quite right. You can\u2019t put too much salt with the vegetables, but you can\u2019t put too little, either. There\u2019s too little salt in this one.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu waved at Yu Se to signal her not to worry. One of her hands rested in Xiao Shi\u2019s palm, while the other pointed at the dish she\u2019d just sniffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Madame Xiu. I\u2019ll cook another plate for your inspection before I put it in the big pot.\u201d The cook nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be prudent,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu nodded as she praised the cook\u2019s meticulous attitude. It made his old face turn red. Why did it have to feel so good being praised by a beauty?</p><br/><p>After finishing up here, Bai Xiangxiu walked quickly to the monks\u2019 kitchen. Everyone here was a great master, each and every one of them calm and composed. When Bai Xiangxiu entered, some of them even greeted her with Buddhist greetings. Even though they were busy with cooking, they still had time to think about such things. They were truly living up to their name as monks.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Master, do you need help on this side?\u201d Could they really make it in time if they were so calm?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no harm, we don\u2019t need any help. Patron, go ahead and busy yourself!\u201d A great master laughed as he saw the visitor out. Monks couldn\u2019t get too used to dealings with women, after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. You keep busy then, Great Masters. Just let me know if there\u2019s anything you need.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu made a Buddhist gesture as well as she left. It was such a busy day!</p><br/><p>Some of the people liked her fussing, while some others only felt dejected. In this case, the depressed party was none other than the Song kitchens\u2019 Steward Fang. Nothing of this sort had ever happened since he assumed the position of kitchen steward. Everyone treated him with the utmost respect.</p><br/><p>But ever since this Bai Xiangxiu had arrived, he\u2019d become a bystander. For some reason, everyone went to ask Madame Xiu instead of him when they had questions, even if it was about the firewood. It seemed as if they were treating her as the mistress. She was only here to help, so did she really think she was the boss here?</p><br/><p>He smiled stiffly and walked over, \u201cMadame Xiu, see here. You\u2019re not very familiar with these kitchens, so why not rest inside? I can take care of everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>1. Reference to a Chinese pop song in which the old monk warns a young monk that women at the foot of the mountain were tigers. The young monk found it curious how the \u2018tigers\u2019 were all very cute, until the old monk told him that these kind of tigers were the scariest. That was when the young monk realized one of the tigers had barged into his heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

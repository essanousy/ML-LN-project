Long Heng knew very well that he would only have two choices if that happened. One would be to open the city gates, while the other would be to personally shoot Bai Xiangxiu to keep her dignity intact. However, he would only have one choice if they decided to place her out of range of his arrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really plan on doing such a thing?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked, seemingly uncaring. In fact, there was even some hints of contempt ringing in her tone. Long Heng almost thought that he\u2019d heard wrongly. </p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a reason not to?\u201d This woman isn\u2019t as simple as she seems. How did those words fail to upset her? Actually, if Bai Xiangxiu cooperated, he would be able to deal a blow to Long Heng without needing to open the city gates.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that others would would call you a coward if you openly rape a woman during a war between two armies?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu cracked a rakish smile. She crossed both her arms in front of her chest and looked him up and down, as though checking whether he was truly a man or not.</p><br/><p>Men were very susceptible to taunts like that. Commander Lu was naturally no exception, leering right back at Bai Xiangxiu, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I personally show you\u2026 whether I\u2019m a man or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine by me. Take off your pants and show me.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was going all out. She no longer cared for the consequences of her words, which shocked Long Heng greatly. She arched her eyebrows, indicating for Commander Lu to take off his pants.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu could no longer remain calm. He\u2019d heard from Lin Qianzi that Bai Xiangxiu was actually very fond of Long Heng. But, how could she so easily sit there and tell another man to take off his pants? Something\u2019s not quite right. He\u2019d seen many women, but none of them were quite as bold as her. Even Yaya, the loose and flirtatious woman that followed his second brother, wouldn\u2019t have dared say such a thing in front of a man.</p><br/><p>Outside, Long Heng was on the verge of fainting. If Yu Kuang hadn\u2019t reacted quickly and propped him up, he might\u2019ve fallen to the ground already. He\u2019d never imagined that Bai Xiangxiu would have this much of a wild side. It\u2019d made him even more speechless than Commander Lu\u2019s suggestion just now. He just couldn\u2019t handle it. Could someone please tell him what had happened to the cute and feeble girl who was so frail that he would hurt her when they did the deed too roughly? What had she gone through to become like this?</p><br/><p>Silence filled the room almost immediately. This came as no surprise to anyone listening; Commander Lu was obviously taken aback by her words as well. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t let the atmosphere stop her either, continuing to taunt him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Your mother! I\u2019ll kill him if he really does take off his pants and try to violate me! I\u2019ll make sure to chop off his manhood and commit suicide even if I fail! It was the only reason she was trying to seduce him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! You truly are one of a kind! It\u2019d be such a waste to let so many men sully you. Why don\u2019t you follow me instead? Not only will you get to keep your life, you get to become my woman too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would I gain by becoming your woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will gain aplenty. At least, you\u2019ll realize that I\u2019m a better man than Long Heng will ever be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? I really wouldn\u2019t know until I give it a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thud! It felt like an arrow had struck Long Heng square in his heart. He was paralyzed, mere millimeters away from a mental breakdown. Yu Kuang was now so curious that he had to take a peek inside as well. However, the corners of his mouth eventually lifted to form a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour wish is my command. I\u2019ll give you a little preview.\u201d Commander Lu slowly walked up to Bai Xiangxiu. He placed both his hands on top of the chair she was currently sitting on and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we\u2026 take a bath first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can. However, why don\u2019t you let me check the goods first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me too. But it\u2019s very easy to mistake you for a man based on what you\u2019re wearing. I\u2019d better check your goods too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you going to check the goods yourself? Or do you want me to show them to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI prefer to watch. Show them to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I want to inspect your goods\u2026 personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I like that.\u201d Commander Lu walked up to Bai Xiangxiu to let her undress him. No one had ever imagined that Bai Xiangxiu would actually be so daring. She slowly started removing Commander Lu\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>Long Heng could no longer keep his cool when he heard pieces of armor hitting the ground. An unbridled fury began to overwhelm him. He wouldn\u2019t allow Bai Xiangxiu to do anything more, no matter how much he trusted her!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve removed some of your clothes. Now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu removed her outer layer of clothing. She then began to pull out her chest bindings while still covered by her inner clothes, which made her look even more enticing. She\u2019d been tightly bound because of her man\u2019s garb, and the newly blossoming curves made the view even more stunning. Adding the blood stains on her white shirt which showcased a little bit of a cruel beauty and perseverance in pride, no man could hope to resist the visual impact of such a scene. Most would lose their minds in the heat of the moment and immediately pounce on her. Since his armor had already been removed, it was obvious that Commander Lu was reacting to her.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu smiled. \u201cNot bad. Come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little vixen. Such a cute little vixen.\u201d Commander Lu couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He immediately leaped towards her and hugged her. He didn\u2019t even hesitate to start fondling her body. But how could Long Heng possibly stand outside enduring such a thing? He immediately charged inside, no longer caring whether he\u2019d alert the enemy or not.</p><br/><p>Just as he did so, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s voice rang out coldly, \u201cLet me give you a gift before I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!! Bitch! You dare hurt me?\u201d Commander Lu immediately leaped back, clutching his leg tightly. He never imagined that Bai Xiangxiu would have a dagger hidden on her body. No wonder she was able to escape last time. I just thought that the knot had been tied loosely. Now I understand,so she had a weapon on her!</p><br/><p>He\u2019d never imagined that he\u2019d be duped by her to the point where he almost lost his pecker. He really would\u2019ve lost his manhood had he been a tiny bit late in dodging. The blade had missed by a hair\u2019s breadth and planted itself in his leg. The injury was actually somewhat serious. In the heat of the moment, he showed no mercy, blasting her out of the room with a backhand.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d thought she\u2019d be dead for certain after such a strong blow, but someone came out of nowhere and caught her while she was still in the air. That someone then proceeded to escape with Bai Xiangxiu held in his hands before Commander Lu could make out who it is.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen! Assassins!\u201d Commander Lu couldn\u2019t afford to let the woman escape. He didn\u2019t want to lose such an important chess piece.</p><br/><p>But how would he know that Long Heng had a secret underground path into the city? The entrance to the underground path was extremely well-hidden. The pursuers Commander Lu sent utterly failed to capture them. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only reason, Long Heng and Yu Kuang\u2019s mastery of qinggong was simply too high. The pursuers just couldn\u2019t catch up.</p><br/><p>His heart beating furiously, Long Heng quickly jumped into a dry well with Bai Xiangxiu in his arms. He then moved aside a large boulder to reveal the underground tunnel that led into the city. He\u2019d intended to ask Bai Xiangxiu to crawl through the hole herself, but she\u2019d already fainted dead away. The situation just now had simply been too precarious. She must\u2019ve fainted because she had been too scared and anxious while she was thrown through the air!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where did you find the courage to attempt assassinating Commander Lu?\u201d Long Heng mused resignedly. He began to crawl through the tunnels with Bai Xiangxiu in his arms.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang followed him into the tunnel as well, rolling the boulder across the tunnel as he did so. It didn\u2019t take long for the trio to reach the other end of the tunnel inside the city. A hand extended down from the surface, but Long Heng didn\u2019t grab it. A graceful hop, step and a jump and he gently landed above the tunnel. The first thing he did when he landed onto the surface was grab a cloak to cover Bai Xiangxiu up. He glared at every single person that came to receive him. If anyone were to run off his mouth about what happened here, they\u2019d be beheaded without mercy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

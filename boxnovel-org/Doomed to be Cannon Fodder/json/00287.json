Is she missing her son?</p><br/><p>Xiao Lin was a cute child. After not seeing his mother for such a long time, it seems he\u2019d missed her. He actually began to speak his first word. \u201cMommy\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! The young prince has spoken!\u201d The old madame\u2019s old servant exclaimed from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes. He can say mommy now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespite not seeing his mother for so long, he called for her the moment he laid eyes on her. It\u2019s quite obvious that the young prince missed his mother dearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, you should say grandmother first.\u201d Although Bai Xiangxiu was very happy internally, she lectured her child as she enfolded him in a flurry of hugs and kisses.</p><br/><p>\u201cMommy is easier to say than grandmother.\u201d The old madame was feeling somewhat jealous at the moment. She was the one who\u2019d taken care of her eldest grandson all this time! But Bai Xiangxiu insisted, \u201cIt\u2019s true that grandmother is harder to say, it\u2019s so long! You should say \u2018Gramma\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gramma was what villagers used, an informal way to address a paternal grandmother. Wealthy people weren\u2019t very fond of this term. However, it did sound more intimate. So, the old madame began to beam with joy. The little imp in Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s arms got as far as, \u201cGram\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! He\u2019s saying it.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu handed her son to the old madame. She secretly wanted to break down in tears of love. Her son was amazing. He knew how to wholeheartedly win over his grandma. In silence, she wiped the sweat from her forehead. It was true that old people and children were similar. They both required plenty of coaxing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Go and have a seat. Why didn\u2019t you send a letter to notify me of your pregnancy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen that child once since I left. He came to give Lin\u2019er a pat and left. We basically didn\u2019t exchange any words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu began to feel unwell everywhere when she sat down. The old madame thought it was already quite impressive that Bai Xiangxiu had managed to hold on for as long as she had, and consoled her daughter-in-law in various ways. In the end, the old madame decided to take back some duties from Bai Xiangxiu so she had more time to rest.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was moved to tears. She honestly didn\u2019t understand why so many people desired to take charge of things. Weren\u2019t they aware that the most difficult tasks in the world were household affairs? Now that the old madame had returned, she felt a lot more at ease. This confirmed her feeling that a household must always have a master.</p><br/><p>While resting, Bai Xiangxiu began to worry over the state of Tranquil City. She couldn\u2019t simply read Long Heng\u2019s letters and sit around doing nothing. Although the enemy had just weathered a massive defeat, everything had already been set in motion well in advance. So it was nerve wracking waiting for the results. Unfortunately for the enemy state, they had already been thoroughly defeated once by Long Heng. His appearance was like a thunderbolt. Every battle was a complete victory. Long Heng eliminated the enemy state in a meticulous campaign. He didn\u2019t have any golden tokens to worry about this time, and so led his men straight to the enemy\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>The enemy state was exterminated in short order, their commanders dead or captured. There weren\u2019t many left in the end. By the time Long Heng was done, the year was over. Spring had arrived. He missed his family dearly and prayed that from now on, the world would be peaceful with no more war. That way, he could remain home and stay by his wife and son\u2019s side. But the moment he stepped inside, he could see the servants all running back and forth in a frenzy. He was flabbergasted and randomly seized a servant who shot past him by the arm, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe princess consort is about to give birth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout\u2026 to give birth?\u201d Long Heng rushed in. He absolutely had not imagined that he would walk into this kind of situation. Fortunately, since the old madame was around, everything was arranged properly.</p><br/><p>By the time he had arrived, Bai Xiangxiu was already cloistered inside a room. The old madame was carrying Xiao Lin while waiting outside. When she saw Long Heng, she consoled him, \u201cGo and wash yourself first. It\u2019s just begun, so it\u2019s going to take awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I want to remain here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was screaming like she was being slaughtered. Long Heng\u2019s heart shook along with it. He rushed to the door and shouted, \u201cXiu\u2019er, I\u2019ve returned. Don\u2019t worry! I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was nearly in tears, \u201cWhat use is it if you\u2019re here or somewhere else!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much use\u2026\u201d Long Heng was speechless. How come his wife\u2019s temper was so bad?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with her. She has already been through a lot to get to this point. It\u2019s natural for her to be a bit fiery.\u201d The old madame was also a woman, therefore, she could understand her daughter-in-law\u2019s feelings right now.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Long Heng understood. He had been gone for such a long time. He\u2019d barely said anything to her before he\u2019d left, and he\u2019d finally returned to the scene of his child being born. He felt quite guilty so he stood by the door and stated, \u201cIf you feel depressed, feel free to let it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes at the sky. He was already home safe and sound. What did she have to yell about? If she wasn\u2019t giving birth right now, she would\u2019ve already climbed into his arms and cried her head off. But right now, she wasn\u2019t in the mood to cry. She was using all her strength to give birth.</p><br/><p>Since she had the experience from before, both her mindset and her correspondence with the midwives were much better this time. She was quite good at grasping when she should be using strength and when she should be resting. Long Heng began to panic when Bai Xiangxiu cut off in mid cry. He pushed open the door and stormed in. The others wanted to stop him, but he was altogether too fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and drag him out. This is unlucky!\u201d The old madame was carrying Long Lin and didn\u2019t dare enter. She was calling the servants for help.</p><br/><p>Men weren\u2019t allowed in, but the midwives didn\u2019t dare to say anything when they saw Prince Li storm in. On the other hand, Bai Xiangxiu had been about to push. Her expression crumpled when she saw Long Heng enter. Should she give birth or not? It seemed so horrific if she gave birth. Her eyes would be bulging and green veins would appear. This would ruin her pretty image. After all, it had been a long time since she had seen her husband. She wanted to present her best self. So if he saw her at her ugliest state, she would feel quite uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>But Long Heng didn\u2019t care about any of that. He had missed her too much. The two of them made eye contact without speaking until Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s stomach suddenly rippled with a contraction and she couldn\u2019t help but cry out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince Li, please leave the room. The child is about to come out.\u201d Since the midwives insisted, Long Heng had no choice but to leave. The moment he exited, someone alerted him that the emperor was hosting a feast in the palace and wished his attendance. Long Heng waved his hand to decline, \u201cTell the emperor that I have family issues and I don\u2019t have time to attend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that actually a good idea? Regardless of whether it was a wise decision or not, Long Heng had the authority to do as he pleased. Plus, his wife giving birth was different from a concubine giving birth. Therefore, no one dared tell him that he couldn\u2019t stay with his wife right now.</p><br/><p>After waiting outside for a long time, the sky had begun to turn dark. At long last, the sounds of a baby\u2019s cries pierced the air. Long Heng paced in front of the door, his emotions a stormy sea. A midwife came out excitedly, \u201cCongratulations, Prince Li! It\u2019s a little young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old madame smiled. More sons, more fortune! But before the smiles had even solidified on their faces, another midwife exclaimed from inside, \u201cGet back in here! It\u2019s not time to celebrate yet! It looks like there\u2019s one more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Long Heng.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The old madame. She had always envied those who were very good at bearing children. She had always felt that having only one son was much too little. It was great that she had such a fruitful daughter-in-law. She had already given the old madame three grandchildren in less than three years! The old madame could foresee how busy she would become in the future while taking care of babies. If her daughter-in-law continued to work hard, the household will be extremely lively in no time!.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, Xiaoshi had quietly come in to clean up the shards of the flowerpot and couldn\u2019t hold back her snort of laughter. Only her mistress could think up things like hitting someone while making sure it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was held in suspense until she realized she wasn\u2019t going to be hit. Feeling both ashamed and angry by Xiaoshi\u2019s laughter, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to laugh about? Dismissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her maid really lacked insight. The happy couple were \u2018having a chat\u2019 on the bed, but she was still cleaning up the flowerpot and dirt over there!</p><br/><p>Her flustered state made Long Heng\u2019s heart itch. As soon as Xiaoshi ran away, still muffling her laughter, he took his beloved in his arms. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to hit you without causing pain. Let\u2019s see if you want to try it right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>When had the male lead turned so dangerously sexy? Even if Bai Xiangxiu really was too innocent and pure to understand things, his hands made his intentions all too clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 hnngh\u2026 touch, don\u2019t pat, don\u2019t pinch, ah\u2026\u201d She struggled as her eyes silently filled with tears. She hadn\u2019t even rested for three days yet and still felt dizzy when she got off the bed. Was she doomed not to have any more normal days after this?</p><br/><p>Long Heng had already been thoroughly bewitched by her. Her breathy cries nearly made him forget the last shred of reason. He\u2019d always thought his endurance to be greater than many others. Where was his self-respect as a man? He\u2019d never imagined that this sweet and soft little body could make him cast away so many things and make everything else pale in comparison.</p><br/><p>Right when things were about to reach another level, someone knocked on the door. Long Heng finally remembered that it was dinnertime and reluctantly let her go. He quietly murmured into her ear, \u201cI\u2019ll settle things with you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had no words beyond murmuring, \u201cCan you not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can even hear something so quiet, seriously\u2026\u201d Then she just wouldn\u2019t talk about him behind his back in the future, alright?</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t get off the bed, but piled up the covers on one side. \u201cSomeone come, bring over a small table.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I can get off the bed.\u201d She felt a little weak when she walked, but it didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t walk at all, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust sit there and don\u2019t move.\u201d Long Heng sat with his legs crossed to wait for the servants to bring over a table, then some bowls, chopsticks, and dishes to pair with his wine. Every night, Long Heng had had the habit of drinking a cup of wine, a habit of multiple years. But Bai Xiangxiu had always heard her parents and their friends speak ill of alcohol. They knew of moderation, so they said a small cup a day was better. Any more and it\u2019d hurt the body. Long Heng\u2019s body was strong and sturdy, and he naturally liked wine. Still, it wasn\u2019t good to drink too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong alcohol harms the body. It\u2019s cold, too. Don\u2019t drink too much!\u201d She regretted her words as soon as she said them. Now she was meddling in other people\u2019s business, and a man\u2019s business at that. He\u2019d probably be unhappy!</p><br/><p>Long Heng did indeed love his alcohol, but he liked the woman eating with him even more. Of course he\u2019d be happy that she cared about him. \u201cThis wine isn\u2019t worth drinking.\u201d But then he glanced over at her and added, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the smell of alcohol, I won\u2019t drink it in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were as good as his actions, because he promptly had someone take away the wine. Did he have to be so docile? It even made her a little embarrassed. Long Heng didn\u2019t seem to mind at all, and simply ate a lot in place of his usual wine. After he finished his meal, he saw that Bai Xiangxiu had only taken a few bites from her bowl. She really did eat slowly, but what did she mean by stopping?</p><br/><p>\u201cEat everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d What did he mean, eat everything? She looked at her bowl, still half full of rice. Because she\u2019d drank her medicinal soup just then, she couldn\u2019t eat any more.</p><br/><p>But Long Heng wasn\u2019t planning to let her off. He stared at her bowl as he arched an eyebrow. His eyebrow was slender and long, very good-looking. As if entranced, she couldn\u2019t resist eating a few more bites. Finally she spoke up when she couldn\u2019t eat any more. She might not have dared to in the past, but her courage had been growing in the last two days.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get indigestion if I eat this much at night. It\u2019s not like I can go out and take a walk.\u201d This was the truth, she really couldn\u2019t muster enough strength for walking!</p><br/><p>Long Heng thought it to be true as well, but his other brain disagreed with her words. Though she couldn\u2019t walk, if they made merry on the bed later, she\u2019d be even more exhausted than strolling! Thinking up to here, he awkwardly turned aside, wondering what was wrong with himself. His brain never failed to come back to that.</p><br/><p>But there was no helping it. He was always hoping for it, wishing that the skies could get dark sooner so he could be together with her. He\u2019d run over to keep her company even though she didn\u2019t want to move out. It really did make him lose some face as a man. Originally, he\u2019d come while still indignant, but all of his fury and flames had dissipated the second he saw her.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Bai Xiangxiu said with him on the bed and talked for a bit. Since it was about to grow dark, Long Heng shamelessly delayed his stay here. It looked like he was planning on sleeping over. It was very normal for the male master of the house to stay over, so each of them made their own preparations in a harmonious manner. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu went to wash up first, then changed her clothes. By the time she got out, she was already tired enough to heave a sigh. Though her body was weak, she hadn\u2019t done anything of note today. Why was she so tired?</p><br/><p>She snuck a peek at that tall figure by the bed. He should be the one who\u2019s the most tired. Not only did he move about and shed tears, he had to repeatedly move her around. This was obviously physical work, but he looked like he\u2019d eaten some sort of stimulant, given how flushed his face was.</p><br/><p>The novel hadn\u2019t lied to her. This male lead really did have formidable stamina. </p><br/><p>\u201cYou may all leave!\u201d Although he seemed very calm, his eyes were filled with sheer impatience. It looked like he would swallow Bai Xiangxiu whole right then there and there, disregarding any watching eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was scared. Dang it, why did it feel like she was facing a wolf? What was this sudden urge to run away? Thus, she came to a stiff halt between the bed and table, afraid to approach him. She was thinking of how much she\u2019d suffered being held and tormented by him. Of course, there were other feelings as well. Still, the dread overpowered the joy.</p><br/><p>Once the room had cleared, Long Heng noticed that Bai Xiangxiu was still standing there, hesitant. Her eyes were avoiding his to look around the room, as if she was afraid to come over. Instead of growing angry, he personally undid the clothes hanging loosely on his body, and tossed them to the side.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu only took a single glance before she felt her pulse quicken. Those healthy looking muscles covered in a light sheen of sweat had already burned themselves into her mind. Now even her body felt a little hot.</p><br/><p>The novel had said that the supporting female character Bai Xiangxiu had an exceedingly sensitive body. She especially liked muscular men like the male lead. The character had even had a lustful dream once after seeing his arms, increasing her desire to present herself to the male lead. When she\u2019d first read about it, she hadn\u2019t understood. How could the sight of someone\u2019s arms throw her so out of control? Just how sensitive was this woman, and how thirsty? But now she understood completely, because a single look had turned her legs to jelly. Had this kind of male lead seduced her, too?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

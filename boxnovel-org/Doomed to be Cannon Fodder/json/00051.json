It\u2019ll definitely be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt the fabric and couldn\u2019t help but think that it had some elasticity. It\u2019d do well as tighter shorts and lingerie. Still, this roll of cloth was meant for making clothes, so she decided to use the leftovers for her idea.</p><br/><p>Were undergarments still considered proper clothes? Still, these servant girls seemed to understand a bit more than her. Bao Qin clapped her hands and said, \u201cThen we\u2019ll make inner robes. It\u2019ll be comfortable to wear at night and cooling during the summer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi was still muddleheaded. \u201cThen what do we tell the prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bao Qin grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the prince won\u2019t see. This servant will have Ye-mama drop the prince a word so he won\u2019t blame Madame Xiu.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a clever girl. When she went out to tell Ye-mama, the latter muffled her laughter. \u201cI know what to say. You all just make the clothes. Try to finish it by tonight so she can put it on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Thank you to Ye-mama for going to the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bao Qin returned to discuss the pattern and make with the rest of them. They were quite conflicted originally. What kind of inner clothes could they make with this fabric? But it was obvious that Madame Xiu had long since made up her mind. When she voiced her ideas, they were both unique and unconventional.</p><br/><p>Bao Qin and the rest assumed it was her way of attracting the prince, so they didn\u2019t point out the obvious. Instead, they took out scissors and got to work. Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s needlework was truly subpar, but after watching them work, she had some insights as well. She too, began to sew her own version of modern shorts. However, she was oblivious to the fact that Ye-mama had spoken exceptionally ambiguous words to the prince so he wouldn\u2019t blame Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t know what that lacy satin was used for, so his ears burned as soon as he heard Ye-mama\u2019s words. With a light cough, he said, \u201cYou all can do as you like. There\u2019s no need to explain to this prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019d originally intended to give her something that could be made into resplendent robes, but never imagined he gave her something for undergarments instead. No wonder the fabric was so comfortable. It shouldn\u2019t be bad if she wore it next to her skin. Her skin was akin to that of a freshly peeled egg. The more he thought about it, the hotter he felt inside\u2026</p><br/><p>Ye-mama insisted on teasing him further as she laughed. \u201cBut Madame Xiu\u2019s already said that she\u2019ll have the prince be the first one to see her in these clothes. Those servants of hers have set their hearts on choosing out a make and pattern!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Long Heng thought of her alluring body, then of her dressed in clothing made from lacy satin, he suddenly felt his nostrils heat up. Sensing something amiss, he hurriedly waved his hand. \u201cThis prince knows now, you can leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-mama could tell that the prince wouldn\u2019t blame the mistress and left with delight. How would she know that the moment she left, Long Heng would get caught in a predicament? When he removed his hand from his nose, he discovered his palm was covered in fresh blood\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Your Highness, why is your nose bleeding?\u201d Shu\u2019er jumped in fright, but only heard the prince coldly rebuff him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet, bring over some cold water. Don\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d Other people got nosebleeds because they were ill. He deeply understand that his wasn\u2019t due to sickness, but that woman.</p><br/><p>Perhaps other men wouldn\u2019t endure to this extent, but he\u2019d been self-disciplined since youth and rarely boasted of his exploits. After undergoing training in the army, he was even less inclined to act brazenly. Even as a man, he wouldn\u2019t be affected by outside restrictions regarding these matters. Moreover, he\u2019d harbored a hundred percent vigilance towards others even since returning from the battlefield, especially towards women.</p><br/><p>It was perfectly normal to die on the battlefield, but seeing his fellow brothers assassinated in his own corps was a heart-chilling, depressing feeling that wouldn\u2019t fade away completely with time. As a result, he found it very difficult to trust people, especially females. Strictly speaking, he could find other woman in his estate since she wasn\u2019t his only one. But getting close to them only made him irritated, much less doing the deed with them.</p><br/><p>Shu\u2019er couldn\u2019t bear to look anymore, but realized what was going on once his master had washed away the blood. He coughed lightly and said, \u201cYour Highness, Third Madame sent soup over again today. Should I have someone warm it up and bring it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think this prince needs to nourish his body? Dump it.\u201d If he, if he nourished himself any further, there\u2019d be big problems. In order to get rid of the excess impulse, Long Heng decided to travel to the outskirts of the town and drill his soldiers.</p><br/><p>The emperor showed compassion for his many years of fighting and hadn\u2019t given him many tasks upon his return to the capital. As a result, he was always very idle. Drilling soldiers was probably the only big task he could undertake, so he rode to the military barracks.</p><br/><p>Once he arrived, the barracks were doomed. At first, they were touched to see the prince practicing swordsmanship, and jogging by their sides until he was pouring with sweat. But all of them were new recruits. How could they bear his superhuman exercises that pushed one to the limits?!</p><br/><p>Only a few days had passed before many of them passed out from exhaustion.</p><br/><p>As a result, the person in charge of the military barracks quietly found Long Heng and smiled. \u201cYour Highness, these few days the soldiers have united their hearts to practice diligently. But many of them are from peasant families and have weak bodies. Right now they need to recover before they can continue to practice. Why don\u2019t you return to the estate and rest a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Is he here to take these new recruits\u2019 lives? Since they were already training while living at the barracks, and they didn\u2019t need to deploy troops at the moment, why was the prince going all out?</p><br/><p>Long Heng was preparing to return, but his voice turned cold hearing these words. \u201cTheir physical strength is too low, just give them a day\u2019s worth of break. Continue as usual the day after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d the person in charge narrowly avoided vomiting blood. He\u2019d joined everyone else in running around these past few days and was nearly on his last breath.</p><br/><p>Only then did a satisfied Long Heng leave the barracks. Unexpectedly, the first thing he saw was someone sent by the Lin family. Apparently, Minister Lin had invited him over! He gave a cold smile. Did this mean the man finally couldn\u2019t wait any longer?</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t say much, but rode to the agreed meeting place at the capital\u2019s Huayang Tavern, a gathering place for elegant guests and the literati. He took broad strides upstairs, his suit of armor turning the owner\u2019s face pale white.</p><br/><p>The owner personally led him to Minister Lin\u2019s spot before immediately calling for someone to prepare the dishes. Even though this young man was handsome and attractive, he was too imposing. It was obvious he wasn\u2019t someone to be trifled with!</p><br/><p>Minister Lin stood up at his arrival, his scholarly, refined air revealing his cultured upbringing and social standing. He extended a hand and said, \u201cWorthy son-in-law hasn\u2019t been attending court these few days, have things been very busy at the barracks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were just some unimportant matters at most. I don\u2019t know for what reason Minister Lin has invited me here for?\u201d Long Heng wasn\u2019t politely, but asked outright as soon as he sat down.</p><br/><p>Minister Lin\u2019s face turned stiff at the unfamiliar address. Anyone could tell the difference between worthy son-in-law\u2019 versus \u2018Minister Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>But in truth, their Lin family did harbor a guilty conscience with regards to Prince Li. Thus, Minister Lin smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be anxious, worthy son-in-law. There are some household affairs I\u2019d like to discuss with you, I don\u2019t know whether you could dismiss your men?\u201d He glanced at Shu\u2019er standing behind Long Heng, indicating that he\u2019d only talk with the servant gone.</p><br/><p>Long Heng waved a hand and Shu\u2019er retreated as per established custom. \u201cPlease speak, Minister Lin.\u201d Long Heng poured himself a cup of tea. Because his official position was higher than that of Minister Lin, he had no need to leave the other man any face.</p><br/><p>Minister Lin could be called an old fox who had drifted along for years in court. Thus, he said, \u201cWorthy son-in-law, Qianzi has been spoiled rotten by my wife and I since childhood. A few days ago, she went to the temple to pray for blessings for her mother, but on the way back, she listened to her servant\u2019s idea and went on the wrong path. Now she\u2019s lost all contact with the estate.\u201d He paused to check Long Heng\u2019s expression, his heart turning cold when he saw that it remained unchanged. So he already knows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough we\u2019ve sent servants out to search, there hasn\u2019t been a hint of a clue. But worthy son-in-law has the military tally to prove his authority and can transfer troops as needed. May I ask you to step forward to find and bring her back?\u201d Minister Lin was already being exceedingly polite. That daughter of his had snuck away for too long. If she didn\u2019t come back, who knows what sort of rumors would fly about her in the capital city. By then her namesake and reputation would be completely ruined.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

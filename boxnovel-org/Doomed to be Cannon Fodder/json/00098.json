He could tell that much from her glistening, limpid eyes. Song Jiaoyue could feel his heart melt as he met her gaze. He asked, \u201cFor what matter do you require my help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Actually, that sort of thing was a little difficult for a lady like her to say. Her behavior was really too bold by olden times\u2019 standards. However, she still gritted her teeth and described the incident from beginning to end. Then, she gave Song Jiaoyue an expectant look, hoping that he would agree to help.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue didn\u2019t expect that she would tell him about the secret affairs of the prince\u2019s estate, and then even look at him with such an expression. She was clearly not playing fair! He immediately began to panic and nodded before he even asked what help she needed. But he immediately regretted his actions; this was quite the difficult issue to resolve.</p><br/><p>But after seeing the joyous expression on her small face, he couldn\u2019t bear to reject her. He only asked, \u201cSo, what sort of assistance do you require from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u2026\u201d She ducked her head and blinked. She wasn\u2019t too familiar with this world, so she really didn\u2019t have a good way of solving this problem. She had hoped that the supporting male character would have an idea, but in the end, it seemed that he didn\u2019t have the slightest clue either. Well, it wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected either. Cheating in the modern times would at most land in a courtroom of some kind, and everyone would eventually return home to look for their mothers. Society\u2019s condemnations wouldn\u2019t be too severe either.</p><br/><p>But the same scenario in the olden times couldn\u2019t be handled so casually. This was a place where propriety and honesty were followed to the letter at every corner. But of course, the rich would only be called flirtatious when they did such things, but when the servants did it, they were called base and low.</p><br/><p>This was simply inconceivable!</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue knew that she didn\u2019t actually have any ideas when he noticed her conflicted expression. \u201cHow about this? If they truly want to be together, arranging that isn\u2019t that difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was almost crying from worry. Hearing him say that it wasn\u2019t totally impossible almost sent her to almost plaster herself against him to listen closely.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue\u2019s heart pounded crazily. His feelings towards her had become almost irrepressible after he\u2019d learned of her kind nature. He sighed lightly as he spoke, \u201cYou only have to say tomorrow that you intend to sell of the third madame, and then let a trusted maidservant out to find a slaver. I will send someone to wait for your maidservant in the back alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter sending your maidservant out, you can then announce that you are handing over the man to the court officials. They will no doubt send him to be arrested. I\u2019ll notify the proper people before that happens and have sentenced him to banishment. Then, we can arrange for both of them to be sent to some other place for them to live together.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat idea. It truly is such a great idea. Thank you so much\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had finally found a reason to smile. Although the plan was simple, the only person capable of enacting such a plan was probably him. His plan required connections with all sorts of faction within the capital. It would be impossible to achieve without a proper network and wealth.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue couldn\u2019t help but smile after seeing a smile dawn on her face. He suddenly noticed something stuck in her hair. He nonchalantly plucked it from her hair, but was quick to realize that it was actually a piece of cabbage leaf. Even worse, the cabbage leaf was actually rotten. He stood stunned for a second, then asked, \u201cHow did you get out of the estate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was flustered by his tender action. If he hadn\u2019t rejected her previously, she probably would\u2019ve wanted to seduce him again and borrow his influence to slip out from the estate! She let out an awkward cough and said in a small voice, \u201cI snuck out from the estate using the vegetable trader\u2019s cart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leaf was already in his hands. What other explanation could she conjure up?</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue couldn\u2019t help but furrow his brow. He quickly said, \u201cYou\u2019re truly too bold. Hurry on back to the estate. We will deal with this matter using my plan. You can leave everything after that to me. If anyone finds out what you\u2019ve done, you will surely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even his heart was trembling at the thought. He was well aware of what Long Heng was capable of. If Long Heng were to investigate, he would surely find out that she had snuck out of the estate. Even if he didn\u2019t, Long Heng would still come to know that he was the one who had helped her. If Long Heng ever got wind that they had met in private, the girl who was currently in front of him probably wouldn\u2019t have much longer to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you return, write a letter and have Xiao Shi deliver it to the Song residence. No one must know that you snuck out of the estate.\u201d He paused and then continued, \u201cOh right. The vegetable trader has helped you a great deal. As a lady of the inner residence, you\u2019re not at liberty to thank him. I\u2019ll send a man over to give him some silver as a token of gratitude !\u201d</p><br/><p>Hmm?</p><br/><p>What he said doesn\u2019t seem right?</p><br/><p>No. In fact, what he said seems a little familiar! She tugged on her hair for a bit and suddenly remembered a sub-plot from the novel. No, rather, calling it a familiar line would be more accurate.</p><br/><p>In that sub-plot, the novel had gone to describe how the female lead had told someone that she\u2019d often used Sun Si\u2019er to conveniently sneak in and out of the estate. After that, Sun Si\u2019er seemed to have been secretly removed by someone. </p><br/><p>Yes, that one line was enough to destroy him, and all because someone was afraid that Sun Si\u2019er would betray the female lead\u2019s secret rendezvous. As for that somebody, it had been none other than the person in front of her \u2014\u2014 Song Jiaoyue.</p><br/><p>No way\u2026 right? She remembered that in the novel he had asked the female lead the same exact question, and then Sun Si\u2019er was soon no more. The female lead had been clueless about these things. Long Heng had still found out that she had been sneaking out of the estate afterwards, so no one ever looked for Sun Si\u2019er again.</p><br/><p>Ah, feudalism is to be blamed for this. Although he is obviously a gentleman, he still shows no mercy when he needs to kill a person. And why are you asking for Sun Si\u2019er\u2019s name with such a tender voice? Do you think I\u2019m just as dumb as the female lead?</p><br/><p>Or rather, if she hadn\u2019t read the novel, she might\u2019ve seriously believed that he had wanted to thank Sun Si\u2019er in her stead. Nobody would ever suspect that a man like him could ever be cruel enough to kill without remorse. \u201cHehe\u2026 there\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ve already rewarded him. Besides, he doesn\u2019t know my identity.\u201d Luckily, she hadn\u2019t disclosed her identity to him, unlike the female lead who had told him everything.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue inwardly snapped to attention when he noticed her eyes darting left and right. Had she guessed my intentions? After he noticed that her expression did indeed indicate so, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. This lady is both kind and smart. What a rarity.</p><br/><p>Smart people would normally understand that to achieve greatness, they mustn\u2019t meddle with trifling details. So, they would never trouble themselves with matters that they could afford to ignore. Yet this lady was different. She was intelligent, but would never harm another life. She was intelligent, yet she never used her smarts for her own gain. Instead, she used it to help others and help them obtain their happiness.</p><br/><p>But had she ever considered her own happiness?</p><br/><p>No. She had indeed considered it before. That had been why she\u2019d attempted to reach out to him with her own hands last time. But he had brushed her off and single-handedly nipped her attempt in the bud.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will escort you back, and I will cause him no harm. You can trust my words.\u201d Oh how he wished that she would believe his words.</p><br/><p>Unbeknownst to him, Bai Xiangxiu did in fact believe him, since the novel had portrayed him as a highly principled person with conviction. Although he had done some bad things for the female lead later on, he had never gone back on his word. Otherwise, there was no way Bai Xiangxiu would\u2019ve chosen him as her target in the first place. He hadn\u2019t been the only male supporting character that the fleeing female lead could pick from, and at the very least, he wasn\u2019t the only one who had authority to his name.</p><br/><p>With such an incredible male lead, such an attractive female lead, and such a high word count, how could the story proceeded if the supporting male characters had been instantly killed and didn\u2019t hold their own weight?</p><br/><p>She lightly nodded, \u201cI believe you, but there\u2019s no need for you to escort me back. They have a schedule for deliveries, so his cart wouldn\u2019t be there anyways if I went back too early. I would have to wait for him to come back.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

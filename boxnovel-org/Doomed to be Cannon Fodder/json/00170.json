Her heart started to fill with gloom. As they began their journey, she tried to explain to the person outside, \u201cAlliance Head Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful what you call me,\u201d Yu Kuang had a skinny build and looked completely different from men like Long Heng. More importantly, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t fear him at all, so she didn\u2019t take his words to heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Sir Yu then. Actually, there\u2019s something you didn\u2019t let me clarify. See, you\u2019ve misunderstood. We didn\u2019t do anything on that day, so you don\u2019t need to take any responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat blood came from an injury on my finger, see?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu stuck out her injured hand.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang really did take a look and saw the cut there. So they hadn\u2019t done anything? All they did was sleep side by side? That did seem like something Yu Sh\u016b would do! He exhaled before his eyebrows furrowed again. \u201cSince you and I have already touched skin, this isn\u2019t something that can be changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Sir Yu. I\u2019m actually a concubine of another household. Who are you going to ask for my hand in marriage?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Kuang suddenly hauled back on the reins, bringing the curtain to a halt. He lifted the carriage curtain to look at Bai Xiangxiu. This was probably his first time looking at her properly, and it made her inexplicably nervous.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang possessed a chilly and desolate aura to his beauty, but his iciness differed from Long Heng. Long Heng\u2019s coldness carried a sense of dignity and hints of killing intent, giving off a violent, tyrannical air that made it hard for people to meet his eyes. In contrast, Yu Kuang\u2019s coldness came from a lofty aloofness that made him feel indifferent. It seemed like nobody was worthy of his gaze, or that he was the type to disdain deep friendships and so kept people at a distance. It was an awful feeling to be stared at by someone who feels like he pushes you far away.</p><br/><p>However, this was Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s first time observing such a handsome man in close proximity. Even though he was a member of the jianghu, he didn\u2019t carry any hints of the ruffian air that surrounded Luo Yunzheng. He had beautiful eyes akin to those oft-described \u2018limpid pupils.\u2019 Seriously, what was a woman to do when a man possesses such eyes?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu found herself unable to take the onslaught after a few seconds of staring. She was about to look away when she found that he beat her to it. In a flash, she realized that this Yu Kuang might even be the easily embarrassed type. Why did it feel like he\u2019d averted his gaze in a hurry?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have that man cast you out and wed you as a proper wife.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu gave a start. Indeed, this man was a member of the wulin. He didn\u2019t care much about the opinions of the world. After all, the usual case for any concubine who left the house was to marry an old bachelor or go into prostitution. Either that, or live alone for the rest of their lives. It was rare for anyone to forgo such things and willingly take one as a proper wife.</p><br/><p>She was momentarily touched, before speaking, \u201cSuppose that man and I are truly in love with each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, she wanted to tease him when he was being so serious and earnest. Perhaps she\u2019d held back too much since coming to this world, resulting in such thoughts now. But after a brief introspection, she realized the reason. If he was simply Yu Kuang, she wouldn\u2019t have dared to tease him. But since he also Yu Sh\u016b, the same childish man who\u2019d acted spoiled in her arms, she was inclined to treat him differently despite her efforts to the contrary.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang didn\u2019t reply, but snapped the reins and had their carriage continue. Their horses clip-clopped on the road as the silence lengthened. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know what he was thinking. Why was he still moving forward after she mentioned true love? And it looked like their destination was still the capital. Forget it, she\u2019d take this one step at a time.</p><br/><p>But he suddenly stopped to say in a small voice, \u201cLie down, and don\u2019t casually reveal yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? Bai Xiangxiu felt that this situation seemed somewhat familiar. It was something that always came up in TV dramas! She obediently lay down, but gave herself a way out by edging to one side as she retreated. This way, if things got serious, she could kick open the back of the carriage and escape with her life intact. Meanwhile, she kept her ears open to listen for sounds from the outside, but she didn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><br/><p>There was suddenly a loud crash overhead. When she looked up, it was to see a concealed weapon buried in the ceiling. A dangerous looking ridge ran down its edge. Oh my god, it had missed her head by a hair. So dangerous.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu really was a little scared as she trembled and thought of ways to escape. It was at this time that a hand pulled her collar, dragging her into an embrace before a streak of white light appeared. She saw the flash of a blade right before they dove into the forests. Though Bai Xiangxiu hadn\u2019t seen anyone, she did see blood, and then promptly fallen faint at the sight\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though she\u2019d been well-protected, she still came close to losing her life. She was dizzy and nauseous, but being spun this way and that had left her no chance to throw up. In the end, she could only choose to faint away. These jianghu matters really were too dangerous for her. That was her last thought before losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>By the time she woke up, she realized she was lying on a pile of grass, a little chilly from the cold weather. When she crawled to her feet, it was to see a man sitting before her. Bai Xiangxiu sat up straight, but her movements were too sudden. She swayed and fell back down, painfully banging her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hurk, the person had spat out blood. Feeling sickened by the sight, Bai Xiangxiu covered her mouth and dry heaved a few times.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang quickly tapped a few major acupoints before he said, \u201cI was injured, don\u2019t act rashly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu made a noise of assent before closing her eyes to recover. By the time she opened them again, it was to see a very obvious handprint on the back of Yu Kuang\u2019s clothing. It was obvious that this hand had injured him from behind, but how could it be so easy to hurt a man with Yu Kuang\u2019s abilities? But things would\u2019ve been different if he was carrying her in his arms. Could it be that she had caused him to be injured?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help her guilty conscience at the thought. Crawling to her feet, she looked around and discovered that they seemed to be at a neglected hunter\u2019s house. It wasn\u2019t even dark yet, but there were no people around. She exerted herself with a few light coughs, only to hear a thump.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang had been circulating his qi when he suddenly toppled to the ground. Despite this, he didn\u2019t seem to have spit up any blood, just his face had turned ashen white.</p><br/><p>No way. She was only trying to summon more energy, not drag along a full-grown man to escape! But if she left him here, what if his enemy showed up? Wouldn\u2019t he be dead for sure then? Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know who the would-be killer was, but this man had taken a blow for her. If he hadn\u2019t brought her along, he wouldn\u2019t have been so severely injured.</p><br/><p>But how was she supposed to help him? She didn\u2019t know any martial arts, so she couldn\u2019t help him circulate his energy. All she could do was bring him along in her escape. In any case, they couldn\u2019t just stay here, because it really was too dangerous. Bai Xiangxiu came to a decision and went to pull Yu Kuang up, but never thought his weight heavily belied his pretty looks. She\u2019d used all her strength to move him, but only budged him a few inches at most.</p><br/><p>This wouldn\u2019t do! Bai Xiangxiu sat resting on the ground for a long time, certain that she didn\u2019t have the power to move this man. Suddenly, she noticed a sleigh to the side. A lightbulb went off in her head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

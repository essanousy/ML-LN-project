The emperor was targeting her son because his reputation within the capital had risen to the point where his fame eclipsed the emperor\u2019s. The old madame had planned on having Long Heng retire and return command of the army to the emperor upon his return, but the emperor had been one step ahead of her.</p><br/><p>A mama that the old madame sent out to gather news returned while the old madame walked around the room with her grandson in her arms. The mama whispered. \u201cOld Madame, Miss Lin\u2026 I mean Noble Lady Lin seems to be facing some issues. A few imperial doctors have been summoned, but the problem seems to remain undiagnosed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you delivered the fragrance pouch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have. I\u2019ve gotten a maid to put it under Noble Lady Lin\u2019s bed. However, what does Concubine Xiu gain by doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call her madame. 1 That child has done so much for my son already. I owe her that much at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. What does Madame Xiu stand to gain by doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too sure either, but hopefully we can locate Heng\u2019er by following her plans and arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026 waaa\u2026\u201d Long Lin reached for the fragrance pouch in the old madame\u2019s hand. Bai Xiangxiu had made two, one of which would stay with the old madame. </p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Do you miss your mommy?\u201d The old madame stared at her grandson. After two months, hints of majesty were beginning to form between the child\u2019s brows, reminding her of Long Heng. Long Lin had looked so similar to Bai Xiangxiu when he was first born that the old madame already felt pity for young women in the future. But regardless, even if the old madame couldn\u2019t quite describe the similarities, she was sure that everyone would definitely be able to recognize Long Lin as a descendent of the Long family at first glance. This was the power of a bloodline! Otherwise, why would her heart melt whenever she took a look at him? She was going to protect Long Lin even at the cost of her own life. If she died\u2026 no matter, she\u2019d finally get to see that darned husband of hers again anyway.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had her fair share of worries too. She\u2019d been borrowing Huo\u2019er\u2019s powers to listen in on everyone the whole night and finally grasped a rough idea of what was truly going on. She was incredibly worried after she realized what was happening. This world was really far too chaotic, and the female lead was simultaneously worthy of her pity and a source of pure irritation. The reason? Lin Qianzi was pregnant again. But the kicker was that she was two months pregnant, yet it had only been one month since she\u2019d entered the palace. The emperor was furious when he found out and had personally fed her medicine for miscarriage to get rid of the child.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had found out about this because of the cactus spines in the fragrance pouch that had been snuck into Lin Qianzi\u2019s room. The emperor himself had visited her room that night. Back with Bai Xiangxiu, Huo\u2019er mimicked the emperor\u2019s tone of voice. \u201cLin Qianzi, five imperial doctors have already discerned the truth. Why are you still trying to hide? Are you planning on giving birth to the enemy\u2019s child and let him take over Our country?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! How could this concubine possibly dare to do such a thing? I just want to keep my child!\u201d Moreover, there\u2019s a possibility that this isn\u2019t Commander Lu\u2019s child. He only used me a few times and threw me to his subordinates. But these were not words meant for the emperor\u2019s ears. No man could possibly want a woman who had been sullied by so many men. The truth would have to remain a secret forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me be clear, I do not intend to raise another man\u2019s child. If you wish to keep it, you will be banished to Cold Palace for as long as you draw breath. However, if you choose to give up the child, you can remain as my beloved concubine. So tell me. What is your choice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Please, Your Majesty! Please have mercy on the child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServants, give me the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, why don\u2019t you try letting this servant persuade the noble lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was listening in on the conversation. \u201cWho\u2019s that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s wearing a veil over her face,\u201d Huo\u2019er explained.</p><br/><p>Wearing a veil? Could it be Su Yun?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d the emperor responded. The ruler of the nation is listening to the advice of a palace maid? Something is definitely amiss here. While Bai Xiangxiu was caught up in her thoughts, Huo\u2019er began to convey the two women\u2019s conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoble Lady. Why are you so afraid of lacking children when His Majesty dotes on you so? You should view things from his point of view as well. This is an enemy\u2019s bastard after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll always be wood to burn as long as the hills remain green. There will always be new opportunities. Have you perhaps forgotten how you\u2019ve suffered in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember. Fine! I\u2019ll take the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, then I will personally feed it to you.\u201d </p><br/><p>The last sentence was spoken by the emperor. Bai Xiangxiu had to analyze and guess who was the one speaking as Huo\u2019er was the one talking to her. Fortunately, the voices all had different tonalities, which made differentiating them much easier. Chaos soon followed. Complaints about stomach aches, about the doctors, and then something about killing every single one of the doctors. In the end however, there was only one clear sentence, filled with resentment and despair. \u201cLong Heng, I will never forgive the two of you. It hurts\u2026 my child\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Go to hell! Why are you blaming us when they were the ones who forced you to miscarry your child? Anyway, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more to learn tonight, but I\u2019ll try to scout a little in my sleep. Long Heng is definitely being held in a place without cacti. It\u2019ll be near impossible to scout out where he\u2019s being held captive. Nothing I can do about it I guess. This world simply has too few cacti!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her to fall asleep since she and Huo\u2019er were both exhausted. The next day, Bai Xiangxiu tried to listen in on Lin Qianzi to glean clues on Long Heng\u2019s whereabouts. However, Lin Qianzi was currently recuperating and wallowing in grief. She didn\u2019t really talk to anyone except her maid and the woman who was quite possibly Su Yun. She didn\u2019t have many topics to talk about either, other than how much she hated Long Heng and Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiangxiu could tell that Su Yun was almost constantly instigating Lin Qianzi\u2019s hate towards Long Heng. She fanned the flames of hate until Lin Qianzi hated him to her very bones. What an awful woman. Song Jiaoyue also found out from the Lin family that Lin Qianzi had been sent by Minister Lin to a temple for meditation. After a while, she came back with a woman who masked her face with a veil. Apparently, that veiled woman had been rescued from around the area. Her body was riddled with wounds and her face had been disfigured.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Su Yun after all! It really is the will of the heavens for these two to meet!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu knew that out of the two of them, one would never forgive Long Heng, while the other would never forgive herself. The amount of hatred harbored by these two women had driven them crazy, which was why they were using every conceivable method to seduce the emperor, the ultimate boss of this world. After that, they would come up with a plan to deal with Long Heng!</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t believe that the emperor actually listens to them. Is he really in love with Lin Qianzi? If this was true love, why did he force her to miscarry the child? Is he the type that shows his love with abuse? Bai Xiangxiu was depressed. There was always one rule that she\u2019d adhered to when choosing novels. She\u2019d rather have her teeth fall off from reading a super sweet plot than read something with plenty of drama and abuse, especially those with stories that abused both the heart and the body. The kind of story that she hated the most was currently being aired in the palace. She couldn\u2019t help but pity Lin Qianzi, even though the cause for all her suffering was no one but herself. Instead of falling of every lie told to her, she could\u2019ve been enjoying her status as a noble young lady of the capital.</p><br/><p>The Sketch Artist won an award this week!

The strike knocked down the unlucky emperor. Unfortunately, he regained consciousness after being stabbed, to which Ah Song quickly responded with another quick jab at his neck,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Xiangxiu nearly burst into laughter. However, it didn\u2019t seem quite appropriate to laugh at the moment. \u201cCold water,\u201d she whispered weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a lot of people around, so Ah Song was able to find some cold water relatively quickly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t even hesitate for a second before pouring the cold water all over herself. Cold water was enough to temporarily soothe the symptoms because the aphrodisiac wasn\u2019t as potent as those from the enemy nations. After that she pulled out the hairpin from the emperor\u2019s body. \u201cCarry the eunuch here,\u201d she ordered.</p><br/><p>Ah Song followed her orders and carried the eunuch over to where she pointed. After that, she ordered him to arrange the eunuch into a specific pose and stabbed herself in the shoulder. Blood began flowing down her arms. Now with pain and cold, she was completely relieved from the aphrodisiac\u2019s symptoms. It wasn\u2019t very potent, so it was quite an easy temporary solution. She then placed the hairpin in the eunuch\u2019s hands and sat on the bed with a cold look on her face. \u201cYou may go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Princess consort, what the hell are you up to?</p><br/><p>Ah Song had no choice but to leap out of the room. He\u2019d just done so when he heard the princess consort scream for help. \u201cGuards! Protect the emperor! Assassin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Ah Song nearly stumbled mid leap. Did she have to yell so intensely? However, after thinking about the situation just now, he quickly came to the conclusion that this was the best way to solve this problem. It was a pity about the eunuch though.</p><br/><p>A bunch of people came rushing in after they heard Bai Xiangxiu yell. Amongst the crowd was Noble Consort Su, who was likely waiting nearby to watch a good show unfold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201d Nevertheless, she was a little befuddled. Were things supposed to develop this way?</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that Princess Consort Li, previously curled up in a ball, suddenly ran towards the noble consort and jumped piteously into her arms. The force of the jump nearly knocked the wind out of Noble Consort Su. She was even more shocked by the sound of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s crying. \u201cElder sister, help me! This eunuch has gone insane and tried to kill me! Fortunately, the emperor suddenly appeared and came to my rescue!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emperor came to her rescue? Well, it wasn\u2019t impossible simply based on the scene in front of her. Noble Consort Su then furrowed her brows. \u201cWhat are all of you waiting for?! LIft the emperor onto the bed and summon the imperial doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, I was so afraid!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s white lotus charms immediately unfurled and made Noble Consort Su stiffen. Goosebumps had broken out all over her skin, but she couldn\u2019t push Bai Xiangxiu away. How did things end up this way? Isn\u2019t she supposed to be sleeping with the emperor? I was supposed to catch them in bed and punish her for seducing the emperor! After that, the emperor would pity her and take her into the harem, and then we would slowly torture the gunpowder formula out of her! She\u2019s just a woman from the olden times! She\u2019s nothing without her man!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could consider herself a corpse after giving out the formula, since Noble Consort Su despised white lotus flowers with a fiery passion. Unfortunately, the target of her scheme was currently sobbing into her bosom and rumpling her clothes hard with her fingers. Noble Consort Su was growing incredibly irritated.</p><br/><p>The eunuch awoke soon after the doctor was finished bandaging the emperor up. The first thing he noticed was the hairpin in his hands. He immediately threw it away after jumping up in horror. There was still blood on the hairpin dripping onto the floor.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi and Ah Song were now allowed to enter the room. Xiaoshi nearly fainted when she saw the bandaged wound on Bai Xiangxiu. Fortunately, Ah Song was there to support her. Clearly shaken, Xiaoshi immediately rushed to her side. \u201cPrincess Consort! What happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuu\u2026 His Highness may have offended someone in the palace. Somebody actually tried to assassinate me! Fortunately, His Majesty risked his own life to save me so I was able to escape from death\u2019s door.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu finally let go of Noble Consort Su and collapsed into Xiaoshi\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this would happen! You must\u2019ve suffered through so much, princess consort!\u201d Xiaoshi completely empathized with her mistress as she began crying as well.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong with these women from ancient times? Their tears keep flowing like it\u2019s complimentary! It doesn\u2019t even take much to cause them to cry. Their weeping sounds are so damn annoying!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. This seat will make sure that justice is served.\u201d Noble Consort Su raised her voice a little in a vain attempt to stopper the crying. It was at this moment that the emperor awoke. He seemed a little dazed and confused. He was just about to speak before he noticed the figure kneeling in front of him. Wait. Isn\u2019t she the N\u00e9e Bai who I was just about to sleep with? Why is she crying up a storm right now? And why does my abdomen hurt so much?</p><br/><p>He would\u2019ve lost his manhood if the wound had been a little lower! Cold sweat began pouring down his face. He immediately sat up on his bed as his anger rose. He would\u2019ve kicked N\u00e9e Bai already if he hadn\u2019t been wounded. He\u2019d never felt so depressed in his life before. No woman had ever tried to hurt him, but she had.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d never received such a serious injury before in his life. He was genuinely angry yet anxious at the same time. And yet, he couldn\u2019t openly reprimand her because there was simply too many people in the room. Most importantly, which woman in the palace wouldn\u2019t allow him to do as he pleased? The one who didn\u2019t just had to be Long Heng\u2019s woman.</p><br/><p>While he was coming up with plans to punish her, she suddenly began to speak. \u201cI thank Your Majesty for saving me. If it weren\u2019t because of Your Majesty, I\u2026 I would\u2019ve surely been assassinated by that wretched eunuch!\u201d</p><br/><p>What? The emperor was completely taken aback. What eunuch? As for the poor eunuch, his face had already turned the color of a tombstone. When did I try to assassinate the princess consort? The emperor was clearly the culprit trying to rape you! Is it really alright for you to tell lies like this without blinking?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! This humble servant\u2026\u201d How am I supposed to explain myself?</p><br/><p>The emperor didn\u2019t give him time to explain himself either. He waved his hand and yelled, \u201cDrag him away and execute him! How dare he try to harm the princess consort!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even the slightest chance to explain himself, the eunuch was executed. After his death, the emperor even said, \u201cSend his body to the Prince Li Manor and let Prince Li dispose of it as he pleases.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other than disposal, what else can you really do to a dead body? Bai Xiangxiu was tired of crying as well. She slumped her body to one side. \u201cThank you, Noble Consort Su, for speaking up for me. If it weren\u2019t for the emperor\u2026 Wuuuuu\u2026\u201d This time Bai Xiangxiu was only making crying sounds with no tears to be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Princess Consort Li must be tired. Why don\u2019t you go back to the Prince Li Manor? I don\u2019t want Prince Li to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Thank you, Your Majesty.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had been waiting for him to say this. She immediately had Xiaoshi help her up. . She made sure to follow every etiquette, even though she didn\u2019t delay her departure by one bit. She\u2019d only been here for a moment, but had managed to infuriate Noble Consort Su and the emperor beyond belief. They deeply felt that this woman was not one to be underestimated.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu immediately lay down, unmoving, after entering the horse carriage. After that, a figure jumped into the carriage, bringing the cold air with him. Bai Xiangxiu sneezed from the cold, but that person quickly warmed her up with a big hug. For some reason, Bai Xiangxiu really wanted to cry, but the lust within her was simply impossible to ignore. Fine, it seems like the aphrodisiac hasn\u2019t worn off yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Heng\u2026\u201d Her voice was a little husky and sounded quite sexy. Long Heng could feel his body tense up. \u201cWhat on earth happened in there?\u201d He quickly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us speak when we return to the manor. I\u2019m cold\u2026 and really hot at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeed up!\u201d Long Heng shifted the carriage curtains aside and gave the driver an order. The horse galloped all the way till they arrived at the manor. Long Heng quickly carried her out of the horse carriage and ran towards their residence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

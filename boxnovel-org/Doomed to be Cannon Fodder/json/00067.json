Long Heng hit the table, nearly scaring Hua Xue and the Song family pageboy into aphasia. Inside, an eavesdropping Bai Xiangxiu clenched her small fists and fervently thought, Agree to it, agree to it. At least it\u2019ll save me from being eaten for a few days. But hearing Long Heng slam the table make her feel like that forceful male lead was probably going to keep her here. After all, the fatty meat was almost at his lips, so he couldn\u2019t let it fly away.</p><br/><p>Yet after a long pause, he actually laughed and said, \u201cSince it\u2019s Madame Song\u2019s request, we\u2019ll naturally have to help out. But why did your master not appear at all and go look for Old Madame instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pageboy quietly released a breath as he replied, \u201cThe eldest young master did go to look for you, but since he couldn\u2019t find you he could only go to Old Madame\u2019s.\u201d One still had to discuss things with Old Madame for matters regarding the inner residence, right?</p><br/><p>Long Heng arched an eyebrow. This Song Jiaoyue had a habit of being sly, so he really couldn\u2019t pick out any faults. But it was obvious that he\u2019d known that Long Heng wouldn\u2019t agree, so he turned around to ask Old Madame instead. He had no say in regards to inner residence matters as long as Old Madame agreed. All he could do was grit his teeth and comply.</p><br/><p>But why did he so loathe parting with her? Why was he worried that she\u2019d suffer grievances over there?</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s expression turned heavy as he said, \u201cGo tell Madame Bai to pack her things before leaving!\u201d His heart felt a bit empty already, even though she hadn\u2019t left yet.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu inwardly posed in victory before dutifully packing her things and coming out. First, she paid her respects to Long Heng, then to Old Madame. After hearing a string of instructions from the old madame, she finally climbed into the Song family sedan chair and left Prince Li\u2019s estate.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s heart felt leaden as he watched the little sedan chair exit the back gates. Mirroring his heart, his face had turned exceedingly dark as well. His footsteps took him to Old Madame\u2019s place, where she asked what fit of temper brought him back home. Long Heng didn\u2019t hide anything, but told her of how Minister Lin saw his daughter\u2019s reputation becoming progressively worse in the capital city and so had Madame Lin appeal to the empress dowager to safeguard the marriage.</p><br/><p>Because the empress dowager and Madame Lin were kinsfolk to a certain degree, she had agreed. As a result, the emperor had summoned him with the intention of playing peacemaker so Long Heng could forget about rejecting the marriage. An unhappy, oppressed Long Heng had come home to unleash his temper.</p><br/><p>Old Madame creased her eyebrows at the news as well. \u201cThat Madame Lin\u2019s quite quick with her ploys. She actually called upon the empress dowager. Well, well, using the emperor to suppress our family. Is she planning to forcefully stuff her daughter our way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng said, \u201cSince rejection\u2019s impossible, then I\u2019ll have to marry her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeng\u2019er.\u201d Old Madame grasped Long Heng\u2019s hand. His days had been hard since childhood, and now that he\u2019d grown up, he couldn\u2019t even marry as he liked. She\u2019d originally thought that Miss Lin was educated and well-rounded, so the husband and wife could treat each other with courtesy, instead of that make-believe sham.</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t care. It was only the position of official wife, so if the emperor wouldn\u2019t let him back down, he\u2019d give the position to Miss Lin. Since he still had Madame Bai, it wasn\u2019t a complete loss. Except, she had currently run off to the Song family.</p><br/><p>His heart felt stifled at the thought, so he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, your son will take his leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already late, stay here and eat before you go!\u201d Old Madame was struck with a guilty conscience as well. She\u2019d just sent away her son\u2019s woman, so if she didn\u2019t have him eat here, was she going to let him eat alone by himself?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll ask Song Jiaoyue out for drinks.\u201d So speaking, he left with a smile.</p><br/><p>Old Madame waited until he was gone before hitting the table with a laugh. \u201cThis boy, he\u2019s never suffered a loss since he was young. He only sent over a concubine, but now he\u2019s planning to drink the eldest Sir Song unconscious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old female servant by her side laughed as well. \u201cEveryone knows that Sir Song will keel over with just one cup. This time, ah, our prince has likely gone to seek revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ought to. Just look, they ignored all the master chefs out there to invite Madame Bai over. Although her vegetarian dishes really are delicious, they didn\u2019t even inquire about her availability. She\u2019s that boy\u2019s darling. Aye, since we can\u2019t get rid of this unsatisfactory daughter-in-law, it\u2019s good to have a darling as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though outsiders laughed when a man spoiled the concubine and neglected his wife, it was still acceptable as long as one was impartial. Furthermore, this Miss Lin really was a mess. The rumors outside were getting nastier and nastier. The old madame feared that the wedding night would lead to nothing but clean white sheets. 1 Even if there is blood present, it\u2019d probably be faked so she could keep her face, the old madame mused with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>The more she thought, the angrier she grew. \u201cThat empress dowager is too partial to one side. It\u2019s true that Madame Lin is her relative, but why didn\u2019t she remember we were childhood friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old female servant coaxed her from the side, \u201cPerhaps she isn\u2019t clear about the situation outside, so she thought that a marriage alliance between two families shouldn\u2019t be so casually broken. Maybe that\u2019s why she played peacemaker to settle the issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe might be acting as a good person, but my son will suffer for it.\u201d Old Madame said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s this, Old Madame can plead with the empress dowager as well?\u201d the old female servant asked with furrowed brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor has a golden mouth and words of pearl\u2014his every utterance carries great weight. What\u2019s the use of going to plead again?\u201d Old Madame pressed her hand against her head and said, \u201cLet nature take its course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiangxiu was brought into the Song estate via a side door. Right now she harbored no more feelings towards Song Jiaoyue. For her, she had shelved it into her past. As a modern day girl, she could take things up and put them down as circumstances willed it, so all she did was adjust her feelings and prepared to live a few comfortable days without Prince Li.</p><br/><p>Actually, she didn\u2019t find him scary right now, but it was that she felt that a single man and woman together in a secluded setting would lead to trouble sooner or later. She was still in the role of a supporting female up to this point. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she\u2019d set off on her original ending.</p><br/><p>Even if she didn\u2019t reach that ending, if there was ever a day she returned to the present, then the Bai Xiangxiu of this time might die or recover her original soul. If her original soul returned, then things would definitely get wild. But she had no idea that another man had been paying attention to her the entire ride over.</p><br/><p>From the moment her sedan chair left Prince Li\u2019s estate until the moment it entered the Song estate\u2019s side door, his eyes hadn\u2019t left her for a second. His heart was supremely full because he never thought there\u2019d come a day when he\u2019d bring her home from the prince\u2019s estate.</p><br/><p>He caught a glimpse in the distance of a servant helping her out before the side door closed. That figure was still as slender and refined as before. Even if it was just her back, that form was far more pleasing to the eye than any other girls. Song Jiaoyue\u2019s lips drew up minutely; a single glance like this was already enough to satisfy him.</p><br/><p>Right as he turned back, his pageboy spoke up by his side. \u201cEldest young master, Prince Li has invited you out for drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue pursed his lips. Retribution had certainly come quickly. If he didn\u2019t go, the other would definitely find a different way to move against him. If he did go, he\u2019d definitely end up drunk to the world. Since it was unavoidable, he might as well go.</p><br/><p>In the end, he ended up being carried back by two people.Lying on the bed, drunk out of his mind, he grabbed the person closest to him and asked, \u201cIs she well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who served right by his side was naturally extremely familiar with him. She helped wiped off the sweat from his forehead and asked, \u201cWhich \u2018her?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiangxiu\u2026 Fourth Madame.\u201d He knew her name, but he\u2019d never said it out loud before.</p><br/><p>The person by his side gave a start, but was quick to reply with a grin. \u201cMadame Xiu? She was captured by the madame as soon as she entered the estate. First the madame had her look at the kitchens, then at the food. She\u2019s been tormented here and there and only recently went to rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to mother and tell her, don\u2019t tire her out. Her\u2026 her body\u2019s frail.\u201d His head hurt terribly, so all he could do was grab onto that person and say this much before he fell asleep in a drunken stupor.</p><br/><p>1. Meaning she wouldn\u2019t be a virgin on her wedding night.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

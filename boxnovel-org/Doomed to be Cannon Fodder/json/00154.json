The old madame wasn\u2019t blaming her for moving into Apricot Garden, but felt that she shouldn\u2019t have fought with Long Heng over this matter. She was a concubine after all, and had to remember her place.</p><br/><p>It was true, she had been all too aware of her place all along and so hadn\u2019t cared about anything. But things were different now. She actually felt quite irritated by the old madame\u2019s words. But as she thought about things, she felt that she was still beholden to her identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old madame is quite right. This concubine will take note of it in the future.\u201d This sucks. I want to yell at Long Heng when I see him next.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiangxiu started after the old madame had let her out of the room. What was with her willingness to enter a situation in which her husband was caught between her and her mother-in-law? Could it be that she had truly accepted Long Heng and was willing to be married to him? This thought was so frightening that she couldn\u2019t even eat dinner. Xiaoshi and the others thought that she was unable to eat because of the old madame\u2019s lecture. They silently berated the senior madame and second madame.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu fretted all night long and went about her business the next day with heavy circles beneath her eyes. She even had to go pay her respects to the old madame. When the old madame saw her injured face and her pallor, she also felt that too much had happened lately, taking quite a toll on this concubine. Thus, the old madame started talking about Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this was because of the female bandit. It must have been difficult for you to escape. Heng\u2019er has already called for the doctor, will your face heal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doctor has taken a look and says it will heal.\u201d Long Heng had told everyone that a female bandit because he didn\u2019t want outsiders to known what had happened, so that her reputation wouldn\u2019t be damaged.</p><br/><p>The old madame murmured a response and then rubbed her head, coughing in a muffled manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madame, you should summon a doctor as well!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu knew that the old madame didn\u2019t bear her ill will. She was only viewing things from the perspective of the mistress of the house handling a matter of the concubine overstepping her bounds.</p><br/><p>The old madame sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of summoning a doctor? That old man was so much healthier than me but still left suddenly, just like that. No one thought that would happen at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>She began crying again as she spoke, the mamas off on the side and Bai Xiangxiu spent a long while comforting her. The old madame actually fell asleep where she was after a while, her puffy face presenting a frightening sight.</p><br/><p>It looks like the old madame is quite ill. Bai Xiangxiu walked out with a furrowed brow and wondered if she should use Long Shuting\u2019s method. But she\u2019d only been with Long Heng for around ten days. If she put on an act at this moment, wouldn\u2019t that anger Long Heng?</p><br/><p>Long Heng returned at this moment. It could be seen that he was quite tired as there was even stubble on his chin. Bai Xiangxiu really was a bit worried about him and she performed her wifely duties to the maximum, helping him bathe and change clothes. He fell asleep quickly after stroking her face a few times, even saying, \u201cI\u2019ll get up later and have dinner with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d She really couldn\u2019t speak of her previous grievances after seeing him like this.</p><br/><p>He really did awake for dinner, but the old madame summoned him over to her residence. He frowned because he\u2019d promised Bai Xiangxiu that he would eat dinner with her, so responded, \u201cCome with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nodded. She naturally knew of Long Heng\u2019s intentions but knew that the old madame would worry about him in his current state. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you clean up a bit so that the old madame won\u2019t worry when she sees you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was when Long Heng realized how he must look at the moment and privately lauded Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s conscientiousness. He had Shu\u2019er come over, and the two of them helped Long Heng dress more nicely before heading over to the old madame\u2019s.</p><br/><p>None of them anticipated that the old madame would start sobbing as soon as she saw Long Heng, asking between gasps when the body would be placed into the coffin and when the procession would be. These were all very important matters and so had to be understood beforehand. Long Heng conveyed that the empress dowager had already been placed in the coffin, and the funeral procession would take place in two days. It would travel from the palace to the royal tombs, and would pass by the front of the manor.</p><br/><p>The old madame said to that, \u201cIt\u2019s the last chance to see her, I would really like to send her off.\u201d She began coughing again, worrying Long Heng greatly. The mama were also weeping off on the side. \u201cYour Highness, please speak some sense into the old madame. She didn\u2019t sleep all night. If this continues, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But how would Long Heng know how to persuade someone? He only knew to furrow his brow and say, \u201cDon\u2019t be overly sad, mother. You must take care of yourself well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also need to be careful as you\u2019re accompanying the emperor in the procession.\u201d The old madame was quite despondent, but she didn\u2019t want her son to worry. However, she couldn\u2019t help but be sad when she thought of the fact that a sister who she\u2019d grown up with was leaving.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu blinked off on the side. What to do when one was sad and the other worried? They likely wouldn\u2019t be able to eat dinner at all! She surreptitiously pinched her thigh, activating her acting mode. But I\u2019ve never seen anyone throw up after just getting pregnant! I guess I\u2019ll have to do as they do in dramas!</p><br/><p>She clutched her stomach lightly and turned her head to pretend to wipe at her tears when no one was looking. She was actually shoving her handkerchief partially down her throat so that it would make her cough lightly twice. But she hadn\u2019t thought that her throat would be a bit too dry after walking over, and that she\u2019d yet to have a drink thanks to the mother and son duo being emotional. The handkerchief actually caused her to start dry heaving to no end.</p><br/><p>\u201cEurp\u2026\u201d Tears were forcing themselves out of her eyes. Bai Xiangxiu walked out because she was afraid that she would actually vomit. However, the urge to heave was really too strong and she had to crouch on the ground to do so. She hacked and swiped at her teary eyes. It looked like one needed to pay the price for acting!</p><br/><p>Women who had given birth before were most sensitive to matters like these, particularly as the old madame was eagerly anticipating a grandchild. When she saw how Bai Xiangxiu was dry heaving to no end, the old madame immediately sprang up from the bed with shining eyes. She asked carefully, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>What else could be going on? She was making herself dry heave! But Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t dare say this and could only respond whilst wiping her tears, \u201cNothing much, burp\u2026 just that my appetite hasn\u2019t been well lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pretended to be weak after Xiaoshi helped her up, meeting Long Heng\u2019s concerned eyes. There seemed to be some concern in them? She had to explain herself later. What if he really misunderstood?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should summon the doctor if you don\u2019t feel well. Hurry and summon the doctor!\u201d How could the old madame sit still at a place like this? She had someone fetch the doctor immediately. The mamas had also reacted by now and were all smiling, calling out for a doctor with exaggerated motions. Everyone knew that their mistress was hoping so desperately for a grandchild!</p><br/><p>Long Heng had no idea what they were in a rush about. He\u2019d spent more time in the army than at home. The military folk cursed at and fought each other everyday, but perilously few ever got pregnant. He could only frown and ask, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you summoned a doctor if you don\u2019t feel well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s.. nothing. I just haven\u2019t felt that well the past two days.\u201d Please stop staring at me, I can\u2019t keep up the act much longer!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

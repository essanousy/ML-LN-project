What had she done with that man just now? She had almost become his woman. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Who are you? You\u2019re not Yunzheng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi tugged on her sheets tightly. However, the black shadowy figure was gone with a quick flicker. She trembled as she dressed herself, all the while wondering, why has something like this happen to me? Why?!</p><br/><p>Prince Li didn\u2019t even care whether she was alive or not. Even Madame Bai, who\u2019d always treated her as a friend, didn\u2019t seem to be concerned about her well being at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYunzheng, Yunzheng, Yunzheng. Please save me from this misery\u2026\u201d Lin Qianzi began to weep quietly. She hugged the blankets as she lay on the bed while calling out for Yunzheng.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice sounded out from above. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Have you finally realized what a good person I am?\u201d Who else would it be other than Luo Yunzheng, with that playful laughter and a roguish, yet warm tone?</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi lifted her head abruptly and was shocked to see someone in front of her bed. This time, she could clearly see that it was really was the person she spoke of. At that moment, she didn\u2019t care whether she looked like a sorry figure or not, all she wanted to do was to fling herself into his embrace.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng was startled by how proactive she was. He was internally elated that he had decided to risk danger tonight and come to pay her a visit. Only, he felt something was amiss when he embraced her. Why was a noble daughter of the minister\u2019s family sleeping naked without a care for modesty?</p><br/><p>He furrowed his brows and quickly pushed her away into the moonlight for a good look. And sure enough, due to his powerful eyesight from his martial arts background, he noted the traces left behind after merrymaking between a man and a woman.</p><br/><p>The sight of this made him heart-stricken with fury. Eyes bloodshot, he grabbed her by the shoulder and shook her fiercely, \u201cWho was it?! Who was the man that did this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This isn\u2019t as it appears\u2026\u201d Lin Qianzi guessed that he must\u2019ve noticed the state she was in. She hastily covered herself with her clothes and cowered away from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like?! Who did this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-No\u2026 Don\u2019t be like that. I\u2019m scared! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d Why was every man treating her like this? Even Luo Yunzheng wasn\u2019t an exception.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 I\u2019ve hurt you?! Hurt? Do you even feel pain? All this time, I\u2019ve doted on you, respected you, and even loved you. But you decided to just give yourself away to another man? Good. Good! I\u2019ll show you what pain truly feels like!\u201d Luo Yunzheng immediately pinned her down with the weight of his body. In an instant, he vented all of his pent up fury onto Lin Qianzi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi was just a sheltered girl from a rich family. How could she possibly have the strength to fight back? It didn\u2019t take long before she lost her virginity to him. She was gagged by a handkerchief and couldn\u2019t even move. She could only take the punishment. \u201cWhy?! Why?! Why\u2026\u201d Her heart kept repeating the same question, but she no one ever gave her an answer.</p><br/><p>Her body was now torn up and running out of blood. She could only helplessly allow the man that she trusted the most to ravage her. She couldn\u2019t even manage to put up the slightest resistance. Even her tears ran dry in the end. She felt that she would die soon, but still couldn\u2019t figure out why things had ended up this way.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng finally realized that something was amiss with the girl beneath him when he was finished venting his anger. He had been too furious a moment ago and had assaulted her without a second thought. Now, he finally realized that things really weren\u2019t what they seemed to be. Although he had used a handkerchief to gag her mouth to prevent her from screaming, she hadn\u2019t seemed to be faking her cries of pain. He immediately rose to confirm his suspicions and saw the smear of red on the bed sheets, despite the room being only faintly illuminated by the moonlight.</p><br/><p>He could feel the frost seize over his heart. She is clearly still a clean and pure virgin! What have I just done to her!? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have been so brash\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why aren\u2019t there any sounds beneath me? And why is her breath so weak? Luo Yunzheng drew in closer to investigate and realized that she had fainted dead away. Her complexion was pale and lacked all signs of life. He was stricken with horror when he saw the state she was currently in. The first thing that came to his mind was to carry her away to seek help.</p><br/><p>But whose help could he seek? Due to his injury, it was already an arduous task to sneak out by himself, let alone carry another person. Somebody would surely notice them. If that were to happen, he would surely implicate her and cause her harm. So, he had no choice but to think of another way.</p><br/><p>After he considered all possibilities, he set his targets upon a single person. Although he wasn\u2019t too familiar with her, he decided to seek her help because based on the simple Lin Qianzi\u2019s description, she seemed to be a good-natured person. He had to give it a try. If she refused to help, then he could just kill her on the spot.</p><br/><p>He helped Lin Qianzi dress after he made up his mind and even changed her bed sheets for her. Having decided that there was no longer any evidence left, he leapt out of the room. When he arrived at her quarters, he was caught by surprise. Prince Li must definitely fancy that plaything of a woman. The amount of guards surrounding her quarters is actually no less than that of Lin Qianzi\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, his martial arts level was high, and he struck the acupoint of a maid that was standing beneath the lights outside Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s quarters with the flick of a finger. He walked into her room afterwards.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng had never seen Bai Xiangxiu close up before. Although the lanterns in her room were all extinguished, he could tell that she was truly a beauty just by looking at her figure beneath the blankets. He walked closer towards her bedside and gave her a gentle nudge.</p><br/><p>The person on the bed seemed to be a light sleeper. Although she did seem a little befuddled, she woke up immediately after that nudge. \u201cXiao Shi, light the candles and go to the side room. I won\u2019t accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi was extremely timid. She didn\u2019t dare to go to the lavatory by herself at night when it was her turn to stand guard outside the room. She would even need someone to accompany her to the side room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Madame. You seem to be having a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d An unfamiliar man\u2019s voice suddenly rang out in the room. Bai Xiangxiu immediately sat upright in vigilance. After she noticed that the man was trying to get closer to her, she immediately used her arms to support herself and gave him a vicious flying kick.</p><br/><p>Although she was only a gardener in modern times, she still knew one thing or two about self defense, particularly since she was still practicing the techniques she had learned during her military service. Even though she had swapped her body for another, she had an even higher possibility of running into lechers now that she was a beauty. Although she always maintained her image, she would run through her self defense routine whenever she was alone.</p><br/><p>And now, she really had met a lecher! An unfamiliar man who\u2019d snuck into her room in the middle of the night was definitely up to no good! What is my practicing for if not to kick him??</p><br/><p>Although Luo Yunzheng was very skilled in martial arts, he was already nursing an injury. Add to that his anger running rampant through him internally, and then engaging in vigorous activity afterwards, he was feeling quite exhausted. Moreover, his impression of women from noble houses and estates was that they were weak beyond measure. A good example of this was the daughter of the Lin family. Now that was truly a weak girl he could bully at any time.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiangxiu, most of the rumors stated that she was gentle and charming, a fragile beauty. He\u2019d never have anticipated that she could retaliate, especially when her kick landed precisely amongst the tender family jewels he had just used, and still needed to put back in order. He couldn\u2019t help but bend over in pain with a grunt of pain.</p><br/><p>Who is this violent woman? Have I entered the wrong room? The woman wasn\u2019t being very cooperative. She immediately jumped off from the bed the moment she saw him bend over and was obviously planning to call for help.</p><br/><p>Luo Yunzheng quickly flourished his sleeve and struck her acupoints. If he hadn\u2019t done the same to the maid outside, she probably would\u2019ve heard all of the commotion going on in the room by now. If that were to happen, escape would be difficult. Seeing that she was no longer moving, he slowly straightened up and spun around twice on the floor with a stricken look on his face. It took a long moment before he finally felt a bit of relief from the pain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

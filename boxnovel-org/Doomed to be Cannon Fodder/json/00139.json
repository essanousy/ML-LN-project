Just what had she done to deserve this? \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll\u2026 go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qianzi leaned on the chair, pushing herself to her feet and trying her level best not to fall over. However, her thoughts were actually running along the lines of, I\u2019m not going to let this brute of a man succeed! I\u2019m going to run away when I can!</p><br/><p>Long Heng had his men take her away with a wave of his hand, and she actually considered making a break for it right then, but Long Heng had already informed his subordinates that they had to stay by her side no matter where she went. This was how the noble Miss Lin ended up being guarded day and night by men clothed in black. Someone even stood outside when she went to the latrines. To her, it felt like the deepest pits of humiliation, but she could do nothing about it. It was at times like these that she remembered how Luo Yunzheng respected her, and wished that he would appear to beat these men away and save her from this indignity.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know was that Luo Yunzheng had been secretly following them all along. However, he was already heavily injured, and the past few days had taken a toll on his energy. It wasn\u2019t the right time to take action, not to mention that those guards around her were Long Heng\u2019s hidden guards, so they wouldn\u2019t be easy characters to deal with. Therefore, he could only wait for her to return to the Lin Manor first. It\u2019d be a simple thing to abscond with a girl from a civil officer\u2019s home!</p><br/><p>And so, he followed Lin Qianzi back to the capital.</p><br/><p>Long Heng, on the other hand, was quite conflicted. His woman could finally get out of bed after a day, but he had begun to have issues controlling his thoughts when he stood next to her. He hadn\u2019t ever felt that way before! But it wasn\u2019t something that he could blame her for. Look at the depths she\u2019d gone to to save her chastity! His heart softened whenever he thought of her actions. This was another feeling he\u2019d never had before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is Madame Xiu?\u201d Song Jiaoyue finally couldn\u2019t help himself anymore. He\u2019d thought these two were more than husband and wife in name a long time ago. At the very least, his friend treated her well. It was obvious from his actions of trading his wife for her that she held a special place in his heart. But since she was, why weren\u2019t they together?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d Long Heng wasn\u2019t the sort to talk about family affairs in public, so his response was rather noncommittal.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue frowned. She\u2019d suffered through so much but still had been able to make it back safely. Why was he so unconcerned about this? In actuality, that wasn\u2019t the case, rather it was that Long Heng wasn\u2019t skilled at expressing himself. Song Jiaoyue knew of his temper, but somehow wasn\u2019t letting go of things today. \u201cIf you can\u2019t bother to find the person who harmed her, I can do it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue just couldn\u2019t bear to see anyone hurt her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. They\u2019ve already revealed themselves tonight. The information she brought back with her tonight was useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Song Jiaoyue\u2019s face drained of color. \u201cDid you purposefully use her to attract their attention, even knowing how dangerous this was?\u201d Was this why you brought her here? To prove how much you loved her so that those people would take action, which resulted in her disfigurement and almost being sullied by other men?</p><br/><p>Long Heng frowned. He hadn\u2019t intended that at all, since Duan Yunying had always appeared harmless. Who knew he\u2019d behave so differently this time? Or, rather, without the catalyst Bai Xiangxiu, they probably would\u2019ve remained in hiding for a while longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuch credit goes to her in this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, if it hadn\u2019t been for her, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to lure out the concealed enemy, even if this hadn\u2019t been his original intention.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t how it appeared in Song Jiaoyue\u2019s ears however, and he also happily made up the reason why she was still a virgin. How would he not know of his friend\u2019s aversion to women? He\u2019d thought that his friend would take a while to settle into life before he could put down his enmity towards women, but who knew that he\u2019d accept Bai Xiangxiu so quickly? Song Jiaoyue had originally thought that it was because Bai Xiangxiu was too perfect.</p><br/><p>But now it appeared that he really had been overthinking things. This man didn\u2019t feel anything for her at all, particularly as she was a beauty. He hated beauties, and that Song Jiaoyue was well aware of. If he\u2019d gone down this line of thought earlier, he would\u2019ve understood why Bai Xiangxiu had had feelings for him earlier. It was because Long Heng only felt something for her on the surface. Who knew how cold and distant he was in private?</p><br/><p>Therefore, she didn\u2019t love him, and that was why they still hadn\u2019t done anything. Long Heng had used her trust and tenderness to accomplish a great deal of things, such as pleasing the old madame and luring out enemies in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! I\u2019d never thought that you were so good at acting.\u201d Song Jiaoyue laughed softly, but the grip on his fan tightened imperceptibly. Had he known that Long Heng needed a shield upon his return and that she had seemed to be a prime target to him, he should\u2019ve accepted her and taken her out of the manor. But now she was hurt, and he had turned her down. He had to admit, ever since rejecting her, the girl with the extremely high sense of self esteem hadn\u2019t approached him even once. Perhaps there was no place in her heart for him anymore! Or perhaps she was resigned to being used by Prince Li.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu actually approached when Long Heng was mulling over Song Jiaoyue\u2019s words. Although she was safe on the bed, she still felt that there was too much at play around here, and Long Heng had yet to explain a few things to her. For instance, where was the doctor who\u2019d kidnapped her? Why had he sent the female lead away; had that been for her? The more she thought, the more questions she had. If that was the case, they might as well head back to the manor first!</p><br/><p>However, she\u2019d forgotten that it was the third day of having the Three Days of Inebriation poison inflicted on her. The poison had a three day cycle, reaching its highest potency on the third day. The effects would then dissipate slightly, building to a peak again on the next third day.</p><br/><p>Thus, the two men within felt their stomachs tighten as soon as she set foot inside their room. Heat rushed over them, particularly Song Jiaoyue, as he\u2019d been through something similar before. His mouth felt dry and his tongue too thick for its abode. He hastily gulped down a cup of tea to mask his discomfort, but grew thirstier the more he drank. There was even a scar on her face! Although it didn\u2019t affect her appearance, it shouldn\u2019t have made her this attractive.</p><br/><p>Yet regardless of what he tried to distract himself with, he couldn\u2019t calm his heart. He really, really wanted to have her.</p><br/><p>Sweat was already beading on Long Heng\u2019s forehead. Some things weren\u2019t meant to wait. He\u2019d wanted to wait for her to recover completely, but the desire exploding out of him was about to drown him. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly wanted to hide her and not let any man see her. For all his faults, Long Heng\u2019s skill in martial arts was unquestionable, and his intuition was as keen as a wild animal\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I wanted to ask when we were returning to the manor. This concubine can make preparations as soon as possible.\u201d She ducked her head sheepishly after speaking.</p><br/><p>What the two men with vastly different personalities noticed however, was her snow-white nape and soft, sweet voice. The next thought to follow was, is she scared?</p><br/><p>Long Heng swiftly drained his teacup. \u201cMake your preparations, we\u2019ll leave in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>This place was quite bizarre. It was probably better for them to leave as soon as possible. He would be able to have her as soon as they returned to the manor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, we leave tomorrow.\u201d Never mind, he couldn\u2019t wait another second!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Am I finally about to go home? Long Heng! Make sure to take good care of our son! Don\u2019t wallow in your grief or I\u2019ll never forgive you! She had the urge to close her eyes after she was done with her thoughts of farewell. But for some reason, she didn\u2019t want to show defeat in front of that face. So, she glared up at him without even blinking once. The edge of her lips slowly curved upwards to form a mocking smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. Aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><br/><p>The commander had never seen someone look so fearless when admitting their fear and was genuinely surprised. He laughed, \u201cAre you really afraid? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve inflicted enough fear into you. Why don\u2019t I\u2026 show you what it really means to be afraid?\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Why waste everyone\u2019s time? I don\u2019t have any secrets that you\u2019d like to know. Just kill me to avenge your strategist already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I want to avenge him? You\u2019re such a beauty. A beauty will always be more useful than a dead man. You would be useful as a seductress.\u201d He grabbed Bai Xiangxiu by the chin and lifted her face. Even though she looked bedraggled, her beauty was still astonishing. No man in his right mind would want to take their eyes off of her. Such a beautiful woman. Who in the world could bear having her do such a dangerous thing?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy kin has been murdered by you and your army! Why would anyone be seduced by a woman like me? General, spare me your jests.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t panic. She\u2019d made up her mind to not reveal her relationship with Long Heng no matter what. Otherwise, they might exploit her and use her to threaten Long Heng. How would he choose if that happened? It\u2019d be his beloved woman on one side, and his country and family in the capital on the other. He\u2019d probably die of heartbreak if he was faced with that choice!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The commander didn\u2019t trust this woman at all, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to ask.</p><br/><p>Just as both of them were racking their heads for ways to deal with the person in front of them, they suddenly heard a hoarse and shrill voice yell, \u201cCommander Lu! Commander-in-chief! Please return my child to me! He isn\u2019t\u2026 isn\u2019t Duan Yunying\u2019s child!</p><br/><p>You must be kidding me! Bai Xiangxiu could feel goosebumps appear all over her body when she heard that voice. Why is the female lead be here? Can someone please tell me what\u2019s wrong with her? Didn\u2019t she marry into the Ji family at the capital and living a very peaceful life? Why is she all of a sudden here at the enemy camp? And she said something about returning her child? Why would the enemy soldiers take her child? Because her child is Duan Yunying\u2019s?</p><br/><p>The female lead barged into the room a moment later. Even though she seemed to have suffered through some hardships, her white lotus looks hadn\u2019t been untarnished by age. As expected of a female lead. She\u2019s different alright! Bai Xiangxiu received quite a shock because the female lead might recognize her. She immediately let her head fall in hopes of reducing her sense of presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a place where the likes of you can enter. Leave.\u201d The commander glanced at Lin Qianzi out of the corner of eyes, a frown creasing his forehead. He would\u2019ve killed her already and taken her child a long time ago, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019d heard that she\u2019d tried to avenge his second brother after his death. She admitted in her husband\u2019s residence that the father of her child was Commander Ying, also known as Duan Yunying, but she\u2019d rescinded her words just as quickly as she\u2019d uttered them. Who else could the father be if it wasn\u2019t Duan Yunying? Was the jianghu man the true father?</p><br/><p>The commander was irritated and disgusted whenever he had to deal with this conundrum. He would never have retrieved her if it wasn\u2019t for the fact he wanted to leave a descendant for his younger brother. She\u2019d proven time and time again to be a troublemaker and extremely annoying. He would\u2019ve normally tolerated her antics, but today had already been a series of unpleasant events. His strategist had been assassinated and a mysterious person had climbed over the wall to enter the city. More to the point, no one knew whether these occurrences had anything to do with Prince Li. \u201cMen, drag the madame back to her residence. Don\u2019t let her out again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn my child back to me! My child\u2026 he\u2019s still so young\u2026 Why would you want to take him away from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best behave if you want your child to live. I am capable of unimaginable things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t hurt him! He\u2019s a very well-behaved child!\u201d Lin Qianzi was truly afraid now and immediately calmed herself down. However, she still uttered, \u201cCan\u2019t you let me take a look at him just for a short while? Just one peek.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cMen! Take the woman to the young prince and let her take a small look.\u201d Resignedly, the commander gave his permission to let Lin Qianzi have a look at her child. Lin Qianzi immediately left with the servant, but she seemed to glance at Bai Xiangxiu before she left. Panicking, Bai Xiangxiu immediately lowered her head further.</p><br/><p>The commander lifted up Bai Xiangxu\u2019s face when everyone else had left and caught a trace of her panicked expressions. The edge of his lips immediately moved upwards to form a smirk. \u201cYou know that woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she\u2019d calmed down, Bai Xiangxiu finally realized who the general bore resemblance to. No wonder she\u2019d disliked him the moment she\u2019d laid eyes on him. He bore a resemblance to that perverted little white rabbit Duan Yunying. The commander was actually an overbearing version of the little white rabbit. So that\u2019s why he kidnapped Lin Qianzi\u2019s child. He must view the child as someone who has inherited the bloodline of his family right?</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a pitiful mother. Why would you kidnap her child? Are you even human?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was provoking the commander on purpose in hopes that he would grant her a clean death.</p><br/><p>However, what she couldn\u2019t have possibly known was that the more unusual she acted, the more he wanted to understand her. If Bai Xiangxiu had known this, she surely would\u2019ve gone back to her white rabbit antics. Unfortunately, the other side had mistaken the meaning behind her provocations. She\u2019d failed at her attempt to seek death and now seemed ready to be tortured.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you worry about your own situation before you worry about others? Men, take her to the interrogation room.\u201d Commander Lu wanted to know where her breaking point was. Will she break under pain? Fear? Something else?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was genuinely frightened now. I\u2019d rather die than to be interrogated. But death wasn\u2019t possible even if she wished for it. They brought her to a little black house and tied her to a pillar. She tried struggling, but she couldn\u2019t break free. She was actually beginning to despair.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu entered the room as well, holding a whip in his hand. Darker than night, and made of leather, it looked like it would hurt a lot. Bai Xiangxiu wanted to cry, but for some reason, tears just wouldn\u2019t flow. She wanted to beg for mercy too, but no words came out. All she could do was smile at Commander Lu coldly, which he responded to by lashing her fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026!\u201d It hurt, but it was obvious that he\u2019d gone easy on her. Bai Xiangxiu gritted her teeth to endure the pain and gave him a hard glare without uttering a word.</p><br/><p>Commander Lu was taken aback when he saw her glare. Is she trying to flirt with me? There\u2019s no ferocity in her eyes at all! However, it made sense. A woman\u2019s beauty was their sharpest weapon after all. Was she trying to make him go soft on her and spare her? His heart was wavering. What to do?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu would\u2019ve gone hysterical if she knew what he was thinking. She was 100% glaring at him alright!? She wasn\u2019t giving him a flirty look! She didn\u2019t need him to go soft on her! No! She wanted the commander to kill her!</p><br/><p>But neither of them knew what the other person was thinking. So, after a moment of hesitation, Commander Lu decided to whip her again. It\u2019d be incredibly humiliating if he didn\u2019t whip her some more when so many eyes were watching. But Bai Xiangxiu was prepared this time around. She bit down hard and received the lash without making a sound. She even closed her eyes, as if she didn\u2019t care.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

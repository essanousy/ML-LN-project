Bai Xiangxiu felt that this kiss was even more ambiguous than one placed on her lips.</p><br/><p>Her face immediately turned red as she stopped moving. She lifted her head to look at him, but her body started swaying slightly! Actually, you couldn\u2019t blame her. This body was just like that, seemingly hypersensitive to such things. Who told her to be a beauty, and a supporting female at that!</p><br/><p>Supporting females didn\u2019t have high emotional IQ, so her reaction was considered normal. But Long Heng was ignorant of these facts and assumed that he\u2019d scared her again. Still, she was so cute that he couldn\u2019t resist lightly pinching her face. \u201cI\u2019ll stay over at your place tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu felt like lightning had struck her. Although she\u2019d already up her mind, how could any girl take it when that was brought up so bluntly? After all, she was still a young maiden who\u2019d never experienced this before. No matter how calm or composed she was, she couldn\u2019t stand still anymore. She covered her face with her hands, running off blushing crimson.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t her fault. What kind of man wooed a woman while looking at her with such a direct gaze? It felt like he was giving orders as an army commander! Bai Xiangxiu had never encountered such an intense situation. This was harder to deal with than someone embracing her outright. Didn\u2019t you go with the flow with such things? Wasn\u2019t it extremely awkward to be so straightforward? Prince, just what are you doing? It was hard for her to face such things, all right?!</p><br/><p>After she had run halfway to Winter Garden, Bai Xiangxiu felt like she\u2019d done something wrong. Perhaps her running away had offended the male lead. She rubbed her palm along the dried leaves of the trees, wondering if she should go back and apologize. But her heart couldn\u2019t help but feel abnormally speechless towards a man who courted her so seriously like that.</p><br/><p>If she went back, she wouldn\u2019t be able to bypass the obstacle in her heart. But if she didn\u2019t go back, would she be beaten to death?</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be that serious, right?</p><br/><p>Leaving aside her own troubles, the prince over there was currently entangled in troubles of his own, enough to turn the space between his eyebrows into vertical creases. Shouldn\u2019t she be delighted and shyly nodding her head when he brought up something like this? Why did she run away?</p><br/><p>Did she feel wronged?</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t done anything outrageous, had he?</p><br/><p>No, that wasn\u2019t right. He\u2019d kissed her twice just now. Did she think he was the frivolous, philandering type?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true, she was still a girl after all. It\u2019d be normal if she thought she was being taken advantage of. What kind of girl would act like that Miss Lin, who\u2019d still had the face to stand in front of him after being played around with?</p><br/><p>He\u2019d take care of her tonight, so tomorrow they could be as intimate as they liked. As his thoughts reached that point, he started to give chase. He still had to eat lunch!</p><br/><p>As it turned out, he hadn\u2019t gone far before he came across a girl tugging off tree leaves. The corners of Long Heng\u2019s lips rose up as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>So she hadn\u2019t ran far after all. But she should really take more care, tearing leaves like that without precautions could hurt her hands.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was very sullen the entire way back. She simply followed that familiar form into Winter Garden.</p><br/><p>Long Heng however, was in great spirits. He was going to eat meat tonight! In order to maintain his stamina, he even ate a lot at dinner. He devoured three whole bowls of rice before he went especially to clean out his mouth so he wouldn\u2019t gross out his girl. He should leave a good impression since it was the first time. Otherwise, what if she found his embrace repugnant in the future?</p><br/><p>After eating his meal, Long Heng went out to practice some boxing and warm up his body. When he came back, it was to see Bai Xiangxiu sitting by the window spacing out. She didn\u2019t even react when Xiao Shi called her. When she withdrew her gaze and happened to see him coming in, her face instantly turned bright red.</p><br/><p>She hastily ducked her head, looking very shy.</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt heat rise up just looking at her. Sweat broke out on his forehead as he tugged off his shirt and said, \u201cPrepare the water, this prince wants to take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room gave a start at these words. It wasn\u2019t even dark yet, but the prince wanted to\u2026 do that?</p><br/><p>Long Heng hadn\u2019t thought about that, but when he spotted everyone\u2019s strange expressions in the room, he immediately understood. He came close to turning crimson himself. Thankfully, men were rather more thick-skinned. \u201cGet going already!\u201d he yelled. The scene cleared instantly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wanted to leave as well, but Long Heng said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to busy yourself. Go rest in the room.\u201d The meaning behind these words were clear: you go in the room and wait, I\u2019ll find you after my bath.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu nearly fled again, but suddenly discovered that the man was blocking the door. He was probably doing it on purpose, right? Bai Xiangxiu wrestled with her handkerchief and shot him a glare when he turned around.</p><br/><p>But it just so happened that Long Heng caught her look when he turned back. He didn\u2019t think she was glaring at him, but that she was trying to seduce him. It almost sent his soul flying straight out his body. He thought he\u2019d get to eat his meat today, but right after his bath, Shu\u2019er entered and said, \u201cPrince, someone\u2019s come from the Song estate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone from the Song estate?</p><br/><p>Long Heng said, \u201cHave him wait outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, he felt that Winter Garden was too small. There wasn\u2019t even a place to receive guests. He was always over here, but what if another outsider male rushed in and ran into her? She was so timid; wouldn\u2019t she be scared witless?</p><br/><p>Long Heng had contemplated the idea of moving her to a different residence, but he was sure she\u2019d disagree. She liked the quiet and didn\u2019t compete with others, so she probably wouldn\u2019t want to leave.</p><br/><p>He ended up receiving the Song family\u2019s young pageboy, a boy who often accompanied Song Jiaoyue. As soon as he entered, the boy gave a very ceremonious bow to Long Heng and said, \u201cGreetings to Prince Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRise\u201d Long Heng waved his hand. He wasn\u2019t in a rush to find out why this servant boy had come.</p><br/><p>But that servant was quite blunt and said, \u201cPrince, it was our eldest young master who told me to come. It is our Old Master\u2019s 70th birthday tomorrow. He\u2019s always wanted to convert to Buddhism and considered this to be the perfect chance. Thus, he has invited a few Great Masters 1 from the mountains to preside over the ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is good news. Old Master has some predestined fate with Buddhism.\u201d Long Heng mused. Were they planning to hold a vegetarian banquet?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut although the family kitchens have some skill, they\u2019re quite helpless in the face of vegetarian dishes. Now that we\u2019ve invited these temple monks, our madame isn\u2019t pleased with what we have to offer. Fortunately, she remembered that the prince\u2019s Fourth Madame is adept at vegetarian dishes, so she\u2019d like to invite her over to give some pointers.\u201d The pageboy felt pressure crash down like a mountain on him after he finished speaking. He couldn\u2019t keep kneeling anymore, what to do?</p><br/><p>The cup in Long Heng\u2019s hand suffered a terrible torment from his grip. Was this trying to \u201csteal\u201d his person away from him? This won\u2019t do! \u201cShe\u2019s not feeling well, so I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to go against Madame Song\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right as he finished, he heard Shu\u2019er call from outside, \u201cMiss Hua\u2019er is here. Does Old Madame have any business?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua\u2019er was Old Madame\u2019s personal head servant girl and very much favored. Shu\u2019er went inside to ask Long Heng for his intentions. Long Heng waved his hand as his brows furrowed minutely.</p><br/><p>It was very likely that Old Madame\u2019s head servant girl had come for the vegetarian banquet. Hua\u2019er entered and paid her respects to Long Heng with perfect etiquette. Her slight smile was perfectly polite on her face. Itt was obvious at a glance that she\u2019d been personally trained by Old Madame.</p><br/><p>A smiling Hua\u2019er said, \u201cPrince, the old madame has a message to pass on. Eldest Sir Song has already informed her about the Song family\u2019s situation. This fasting business is a big affair, so their family can\u2019t lose face.\u201d They knew Madame Xiu\u2019s body wasn\u2019t well, so how could they cause her any difficulties? Even the eldest Sir Song said they only wanted a few pointers. They wouldn\u2019t make her cook for them personally. \u201cThus, Old Madame wishes Mistress Xiu to prepare to leave later with Eldest Sir Song to familiarize herself with the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>1.

Dowager Empress Critically Ill</p><br/><p>Moreover, why is he removing his clothes? Can it be that this man is actually a closet nymphomaniac? Is he trying to tempt me because I didn\u2019t go to him? I mustn\u2019t fall for his tricks. I will not be seduced by his manly charms. She gulped and decided to stop looking at him by turning her head to the side. But heavy and quick-sounding footsteps soon travelled to her ears.</p><br/><p>She was so startled by the sounds that she just had to take a look. Long Heng had decided to come to her instead of waiting for her to go to him! Isn\u2019t he supposed to crook his finger and use his alluring voice to call me over? Why did he decide to come to me instead? Just how e-eager i-is he\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh. You don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t have to be in such a hurry.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was panicking. When she saw him walk over to her with his overbearing stride, she subconsciously ducked behind a table.</p><br/><p>Long Heng\u2019s brow twitched. Seeing as how she had avoided him, he felt a sudden urge to capture and give her some well-needed \u201cpunishment\u201d. The corner of his lips floated upwards and formed a dangerous-looking smirk. It scared Bai Xiangxiu so much that she kept distancing herself from him. Whenever Long Heng took two steps forwards, she would take two steps backwards. They played a game of cat and mouse around the table. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t take long before Bai Xiangxiu had run out of breath. Exhausted, her body began to sway but Long Heng quickly pulled her into his arms. He threw her onto his shoulder and stood flushed with the headiness of victory. He quickly dashed towards the bed and gently laid her down on it.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to be gentle with her. After all, this girl was weak and delicate like paper. It might foil the matters to come if he was too rough on her. But to make him hold himself back now would be worse than killing him. Bai Xiangxiu had gone limp from exhaustion already after all that tossing around. All she could do was gasp for air while Long Heng had his way with her. However, she still did show some resistance by hitting Long Heng\u2019s shoulder with her tiny fists. She withdrew her fist a few punches later and blew on it. Ouch! Why am I the only one in pain when I punch him\u2026 </p><br/><p>Long Heng took her hand a gave it a little massage. After that, he grasped her hand and gently licked it a few times. The sensation pleasured Bai Xiangxiu so much that she began to moan\u2026 I give up. This man is getting better at setting up the mood.</p><br/><p>She\u2019d intended to resist Long Heng\u2019s advances at first, but Long Heng had already masterfully disrobed her. The situation was getting dangerous. Whilst Bai Xiangxiu was mulling over how she was going to get out of bed the next day, knocking sounds resounded through the room. The knocks weren\u2019t very loud, but they were incessant. It was obvious that the person knocking had every intention to disrupt them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Mmn\u2026 Highness\u2026 Knock\u2026 Someone\u2019s knocking at the door\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng was too caught up in the moment to hear the knocking sounds. He didn\u2019t even notice the sounds outside until Bai Xiangxiu had called attention to them. He gritted his teeth and spat out fiercely, \u201cWhat is it!?\u201d His voice was cold. If it wasn\u2019t something important, then he would surely slaughter the person outside.</p><br/><p>The person on the outside was actually Shu\u2019er. He didn\u2019t want to knock on the door at such a timing either! The sounds coming from inside the room would make anyone blush right up to the ears. \u201cYour Highness. It\u2019s news from the palace. The Dowager Empress is gravely ill and is in great peril.\u201d </p><br/><p>The Dowager Empress was considered one of the backers of the Long family. The old madame and the empress would often help each other out because they were bosom friends. If it weren\u2019t for that fact, the old madame would never have agreed upon the marriage with the Lin family\u2019s daughter. The fact that the dowager empress had fallen gravely ill was truly a pressing matter. Long Heng had no choice but to gnash his teeth and hold himself back. He covered Bai Xiangxiu with a blanket and struggled to his feet with great effort. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu stole a glance and couldn\u2019t resist gulping. What a scary amount of sweat! Even his eyes are turning red. Do you have to be so unsatisfied in your appetite? What do I do? I\u2019m feeling a little sorry for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest well. I will come find you later tonight.\u201d Long Heng still wanted to make an explanation and quickly threw some clothes on himself afterwards. Just as he was about to leave the room, a thought came to his mind. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that mother will be back soon. When she does\u2026 do take care of her a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old madame and the dowager empress were close, like sisters. She would be heartbroken when she received the news. Moreover, she would be returning from the south very soon. Bai Xiangxiu naturally knew about all of this. It was all written in the novel. The old madame would fall sick when she grieved over the dowager empress. Long Heng even accepted the female lead into the estate and left her in charge of household matters. The reasoning behind that was simple. She was the future matron of the house and would sooner or later take charge of the household.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, more and more problems would arise after her arrival, which lengthened the old madame\u2019s illness. Issues such as in-fighting between wife and concubine, conspiracy and scheming which followed, all caused the estate to fall into total disorder. But the biggest issue of all was the female lead\u2019s bevy of admirers. One after the other, they came in droves.</p><br/><p>The male lead was also madly in love with her then. They\u2019d tumbled in the sheets together before they\u2019d married, which caused their relationship to become scandalous. Despite all that, the male lead refused to cover up the scandal. After all, this was his woman! And so, there were many instances in which the female lead was unable to get out of bed for three days. This caused various other female supporting characters in his rear court to gnash their teeth in jealousy and the old madame to almost die in a fit of anger. </p><br/><p>Hopefully, such a situation won\u2019t occur this time.</p><br/><p>For some reason, she lost all energy in her body immediately after Long Heng had left. After the incredibly taxing task of putting her clothes back on, she immediately plopped back onto the bed. The dowager empress would not be able to escape her fate. There was nothing Bai Xiangxiu could do about her illness. She wasn\u2019t some kind of miracle doctor. Exhausted, she quickly fell asleep. By the time she woke up, the room was already pitch black. She called out. \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu. Xiaoshi is out here. Is something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Has the prince returned yet?\u201d She recalled from the novel that when the dowager empress was gravely ill, all of the emperor\u2019s trusted ministers had to accompany him in the palace. If the story progresses according to the novel, he won\u2019t be returning tonight. </p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince has yet to return ever since he left. There\u2019s still some time until dawn. Will you sleep for a while more?\u201d Xiaoshi was lying down on the outside because mistresses would frequently ask for their maids in the middle of the night. The maidservants were quite attentive because of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. That\u2019s all. You should sleep!\u201d Even though she knew that nothing would happen to Long Heng during this trip, she couldn\u2019t help but worry. The entire imperial court would become unstable after the dowager empress falls ill. The dowager empress\u2019 circle did not get along well with the empress\u2019 circle. Once the dowager empress had passed away, the empress\u2019 clique would find all sorts of ways to persecute the dowager empress\u2019 supporters.</p><br/><p>The emperor was more than happy to see them fight amongst themselves. After all, he was the one who would gain the most from their fights. She had been very busy ever since she returned to the estate. However, a good night\u2019s rest has recharged her batteries a little.</p><br/><p>She began to take charge of the household matters the next morning. Even though she had a lot of responsibilities, she didn\u2019t have to work all day long. She was only busy a few days in a month, and she only had to take care of some small daily tasks on a day to day basis.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Long Heng had put Long Shuting in charge of the Sung Hong\u2019er issue before he left. Long Shuting took it quite seriously and came to report to Bai Xiangxiu after he was done. Once Bai Xiangxiu was done listening to his report, he handed over the indictment list to her. </p><br/><p>Her mouth began to twitch incessantly after reading it. The novel really skimped on her dark history. No wonder she had so much confidence that she could replace me. She\u2019s never once been rejected by any men she\u2019d ever seduced!</p><br/><p>She\u2019d first seduced two young laborers, one of whom already had a wife and a concubine. After that, she went even further and went for even more men. Starting from the guard in her residence to the guard of the Song residence\u2026 \u201cWhat poor widow of an empty house? That term seriously doesn\u2019t suit her!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It would be difficult not to, since there was a selection held every three years to identify the most outstanding beauties in the city. But how could there suddenly be a new Noble Consort Su when there hadn\u2019t been any selections held recently? Can this person actually be Su Yun? But why did she send me an invite to the palace so openly? Is she going to take revenge by finally dealing with us head-on? Or maybe\u2026 she has some sort of scheme lying in wait that only a transmigrator could think of.</p><br/><p>Long Heng even sent someone to investigate that noble consort surnamed Su, and found out that she was a refugee from Shu County. The emperor had seen her beside the road and decided to bring her back to the palace. She was then given the title of noble consort due to the love and favoritism she received from the emperor.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this just like a Cinderella story from olden times? How could she have caught the experienced emperor\u2019s eye if not for her beauty or innate coquettishness? Apparently her name was Su Luo, not Su Yun, and she truly was as beautiful as a goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hole in this story!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Long Heng quirked an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust think about it. How could a lady as beautiful as a deity walk the distance from Shu County all the way back to the capital without being accosted by some man? Can she possibly be that lucky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d personally ruined her looks. Can it really be her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I have no choice but to go take a look for myself. I want to see what her face really looks like and see if it\u2019s fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo hiding from this, I suppose. Still, you must be extremely careful. Take an antidote before you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng was prepared for all sorts of contingencies. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu also felt that extra precautions were necessary, and entered the palace with heightened awareness. Men weren\u2019t allowed to attend this particular banquet because the host was a noble consort. The old madame wasn\u2019t in the list of attendees either, because Noble Consort Su had written clearly that only young wives and ladies were invited. However, Bai Xiangxiu had brought along another maid called Ah Song today. She might seem slender and beautiful, but she was actually a man.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiaoshi wasn\u2019t told about his true identity. She just knew that this new maid was sent by the prince. So, she kept staring at him curiously. Bai Xiangxiu soon realized that this well-respected hidden guard, a man amongst men, was feeling shy from the blatant staring. He seemed to be blushing and his eyes wouldn\u2019t stop darting around. Even though Bai Xiangxiu was supposed to be all tense and nervous before entering the palace, she couldn\u2019t resist the urge to laugh when she saw the poor bodyguard\u2019s discomfort.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Consort, why does your mouth keep twitching like that?\u201d Xiaoshi asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu touched her mouth and said, \u201cDid I? You must\u2019ve been mistaken.\u201d However, she was almost going crazy from all the laughter inside. Their interaction was incredibly funny to her.</p><br/><p>The palace. A place which could drive a person insane. Bai Xiangxiu felt very uncomfortable here, even if she\u2019d already gotten used to the life in the Prince Li Manor. As a very eye-catching beauty, she\u2019d received all sorts of odd stares from all sorts of people. It was almost like they all thought that she was here for the sole purpose of seducing the emperor.</p><br/><p>Truth be told, even if one ignored the fact that her own man was ten years younger than the emperor and much more capable than him, she would rather marry a scholar than go for a man like the emperor. He had too many concubines. Way too many to even begin counting. Which woman wasn\u2019t his in the palace? He probably couldn\u2019t keep count of how many or whom he\u2019d slept with. There was no way a man like him could possibly be faithful, and Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t the type of woman who could accept the separation of love and pleasures of the flesh. Women have their own needs too! We\u2019re not wooden dolls, alright?</p><br/><p>This was a modern person\u2019s way of thinking. Therefore, Bai Xiangxiu felt that if that Noble Consort Su really was Su Yun, she likely wasn\u2019t really in love with the emperor. The emperor was probably just another character for her to use as a tool for her ambitions, like what most female leads did in many palace harem novels. He probably wasn\u2019t even viewed as a person. After arriving at the palace, the guests were allowed some rest before being taken to Noble Consort Su\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, it seemed that Noble Consort Su was pampered by the emperor. In fact, her banquet looked even grander than those held by the empress. Moreover, nobody seemed to be talking about the empress from start to the end. The distribution of power in the palace harem seemed to be really askew!</p><br/><p>Everyone entered the hall, and was soon seated at their respective seats. Moments later, many types of food and fruits were served. It was exquisite! The guests weren\u2019t able to exchange many words before someone announced the arrival of the noble consort. The hall quieted as a lady slowly walked in. About twenty years of age, her looks seemed to be on par with Bai Xiangxiu. While twenty was still young, it was considered quite old when compared to the usual age of marriage in ancient times. However, this was definitely the age where a woman was at her peak. Younger women were all too immature in comparison.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked down at her own breasts. Even though they\u2019d grown quite a lot after she\u2019d given birth to Xiao Lin, she was still young, so it seemed like there was still some room for growth. And because of that, they weren\u2019t as big as the melons attached to the beautiful noble consort in front of her.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this woman didn\u2019t resemble Su Yun at all. Perhaps she\u2019d undergone plastic surgery? But what technology did they have in this day and age that was capable of turning someone into such a beauty? She almost seemed like a painting, painstakingly brushed onto a canvas by an artist. However, her beauty didn\u2019t seem to match with the beauty standards in this time period. Instead, her face seemed to match the beauty standards of modern days more with her sharp jawline and her tall nose and her eye-\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait. Why do her eyes seem so familiar? I seemed to have seen them before?</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank everyone for coming. I\u2019ve prepared some wine and some performances.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice seems a little familiar too, but I just can\u2019t seem to remember who.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Noble Consort Su.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dance performance began immediately after everyone thanked her. Her silhouette seemed a little familiar, but things seemed a little strange too.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Consort Li.\u201d Noble Consort Su suddenly spoke up.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu lifted her head and smiled, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Noble Consort Su laughed. \u201cRumors say that Princess Consort Li is a beauty loved by everyone. Now that I\u2019ve seen you with my own eyes, I can honestly say that you are so so beautiful that it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you jest, Noble Consort Su.\u201d What the hell is \u2018so so beautiful\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cNot one word is spoken as a jest. I felt like we were old friends the moment I laid my eyes on you. You genuinely seem so so likeable, just as you are so so approachable. Why don\u2019t we become sisters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m unqualified to be a sister for a person of your stature.\u201d Honestly, why does she keep on using \u2018so so\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense. The only person that\u2019s unqualified in our relationship is me. Doesn\u2019t everybody think so as well? With everyone else as witness, I hereby announce that this female Zhuge Liang will be my younger sister from henceforth!\u201d After that, she stood up in an excited manner. \u201cServe the wine! I wish to give my younger sister a toast!\u201d</p><br/><p>After being served wine, Noble Consort Su then personally approached Bai Xiangxiu. Bai Xiangxiu had no choice but to stand up. She \u2018so so\u2019 wanted to reject this Noble Consort Su, but she didn\u2019t have much of a choice anymore. Especially now that Noble Consort Su had already arrived in front of her. Bai Xiangxiu could only accept a cup of wine from her and say, \u201cThe noble consort is being too courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the two finished their wine, Noble Consort Su grabbed her hand and they began to talk intimately about some unimportant things. Bai Xiangxiu was even beginning to think that this woman had no association with Su Yun. However, Bai Xiangxiu still wanted to make sure. So, she began to knead her forehead like she\u2019d drunk a little too much. \u201cNoble Consort, I\u2019m terribly sorry. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m not too good at holding my liquor.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

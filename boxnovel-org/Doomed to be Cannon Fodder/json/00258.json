Sir Song Jiaoyue</p><br/><p>One could easily tell from Xiaoshi\u2019s expressions that she didn\u2019t have a good impression of this mother and daughter pair, even though she\u2019d been chosen by them to serve their daughter. However, the young maid was just too well-behaved. She didn\u2019t speak more than she was asked to and never once spoke badly about them to Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>Bai Rong\u2019er pouted and ultimately chose not to make a sound. Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t say much either, and seemed quite calm and composed. N\u00e9e Xiao noticed how composed her daughter was. As expected, she really has changed after becoming princess consort. She\u2019s become so much more level-headed now. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about our future instead. Our two families should get along together well and spend more time together from now onwards. I\u2019ve actually come today to discuss something with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, please speak your mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs Princess Consort Li and as Prince Rong\u2019s godsister, your social status is no longer what it was in the past. Your sister\u2019s marriage needs to be appropriately arranged as well. Lately, there\u2019s been many families visiting us to ask for her hand. Your father and I have no idea who to pick, so I\u2019ve come to seek your guidance. The eldest sister is like a second mother. Maybe you can help us decide and pick a good family for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. Unfortunately mother, I am not familiar with the noble families in the capital. I don\u2019t believe I can give you any useful opinions.\u201d The original Bai Xiangxiu was only a young lady. Even though she chosen to marry Long Heng and become his concubine, the person who made that ultimate decision was actually not her father, but her mother standing in front of her now.</p><br/><p>The fact that Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mother wanted her opinion for her younger sister\u2019s marriage might sound good on the surface, but in truth, Bai Xiangxiu was just being used as bait to attract good families for the little sister. However, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t know much about Bai Rong\u2019er. If her personality truly was similar to the previous Bai Xiangxiu, it probably wouldn\u2019t be too much of a good thing for family she was married to.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually taken fancy to a family which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very familiar with.\u201d N\u00e9e Xiao began to laugh. She was sure that the eldest daughter would help out if it was this family.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat family?\u201d The plot can\u2019t possibly proceed like one of those novels where the younger sister is asked to marry into the same family as a concubine, right?</p><br/><p>The elder sister would be the princess consort while the younger sister was a concubine. There\u2019s no way Bai Xiangxiu would even bother to entertain such absurd thoughts, even if others managed to conjure up such a thing. Fortunately, this wasn\u2019t what N\u00e9e Xiao had in mind. With a wide grin, she continued, \u201cI was thinking about the eldest son of the Song family. Sir Song Jiaoyue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu nearly smashed the cup of tea in her hands as she looked at N\u00e9e Xiao with a wide-eyed stare. The social status of their families alone would make them extremely incompatible despite her younger sister\u2019s exquisite looks. The Bai family was just a tiny household with five or six servants, while the Song family was one with a few hundred servants. Song Jiaoyue alone had three servants who served him in the bedchamber. There were numerous maids in the manor, and every single one of them were somewhat educated.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue probably wouldn\u2019t even have noticed Bai Xiangxiu, had she not been a transmigrator and had more knowledge than most others during this period. While looks were important, highly successful men normally salivated at women who had both brains and beauty. Bai Xiangxiu could easily tell that Bai Rong\u2019er wasn\u2019t an intelligent lady just from looking at the arrogant way she treated the servants in the Prince Li Manor. It\u2019d be Sir Song Jiaoyue\u2019s loss if he were to marry this girl.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu scratched her cheeks reflexively and smiled. \u201cMother, the difference in social status of our families alone is simply too big. I find it impossible to even mention such a thing to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased just on your rel-\u2026.Your Highness\u2019 closeness with Sir Song, this should be too big a demand right? Moreover, you are now a princess consort. The difference between our families can\u2019t possibly be that big right?\u201d N\u00e9e Xiao smiled. The social status gap between them was genuinely great, but her eldest daughter had a great reputation in the capital! Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s reputation was so good that N\u00e9e Xiao and her husband couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of pride when people talked about her. If it hadn\u2019t been for her good reputation, that old stubborn man at home would never have let them out of the house. Receiving endless waves of people asking for her daughter\u2019s hands probably made N\u00e9e Xiao think that she could now aim for the stars. Prestigious families and fourth or fifth rank officials had been asking for Bai Rong\u2019ers\u2019 hands ever since news traveled that Bai Rong\u2019er had rescinded the betrothal. There were quite a few men of the right age with very good looks.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they just paled in comparison to the eldest son-in-law. After much contemplation, they ultimately set their sights on Song Jiaoyue. Bai Rong\u2019er had even seen Song Jiaoyue in private and it\u2019d been but a second before she\u2019d fallen in love him. From then onwards, she\u2019d fixed her mind firmly on marrying this gentleman. N\u00e9e Xiao had begun aiming for the sky because of Bai Xiangxiu. Her daughter was a beauty, and the seeds of social climbing had sprouted in her mother\u2019s mind after those of the Prince Li Manor had wanted her daughter. Because of that, N\u00e9e Xiao decided to rescind the verbal engagement Bai Xiangxiu had set with another family before sending her daughter intot he manor. And now, reality had proven that N\u00e9e Xiao had made the right choice. Bai Xiangxiu was now a princess consort and was living the glory life, but she didn\u2019t even once contact home. Such a heartless child.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could feel the rage building up inside her chest. Who in the world wouldn\u2019t notice what her mother was trying to imply? Wasn\u2019t her mother trying to say that she had some sort of relationship with Song Jiaoyue? Why would they even of such a thing! Yes, there are a few rumors of their supposed relationship in the capital. It was impossible that they wouldn\u2019t know of these rumors, as some had noticed Song Jiaoyue\u2019s feelings towards Bai Xiangxiu even though they\u2019ve tried their best to hide this fact. However, was Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mother really the type of woman that really wanted the best for her daughter when she would come to Bai Xiangxiu and try to take advantage of this relationship?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s expressions instantly darkened. She stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your daughter is but a lowly wife who understands her place. I have no influence over His Highness\u2019 friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>N\u00e9e Xiao immediately realized that she must\u2019ve said the wrong thing when she saw Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s expressions change. \u201cYou are no longer the same now that you are a princess consort. You don\u2019t even have to mention anything to the prince and let mother\u2019s mouth do all the work. However, your younger sister has never seen the world as she\u2019d always been kept at home. Why don\u2019t you let her help you out in the manor for a while? It\u2019ll be a good opportunity for her to learn to be a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, It\u2019s been so long since we last met. I\u2019ve missed you a lot.\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er used a tiny handkerchief to wipe around her eyes, though not a single tear was shed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu disliked this young girl a lot. However, she also knew that she would never hear the end of it from N\u00e9e Xiao if she were to decline. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case then I shall let her stay for two days. However, our manor is very strict, so if younger sister causes any trouble, I will have no choice but to send her back home if the old madame orders it. Otherwise, my place as the princess consort will soon end up in someone else\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu sounded extremely unfriendly, which made N\u00e9e Xiao a little exasperated. However, N\u00e9e Xiao also knew quarreling with her daughter now would do no good. So, she left Bai Rong\u2019er behind and quickly made her way back home. Surprisingly, Bai Rong\u2019er became much more well-behaved after her mother had gone home. She scanned her elder sister from head to toe and noticed how noble she now looked now. Everything she wore and used were made from the finest material. Even her maids and old servants were wearing better clothes than what commoners wore. Even Xiaoshi, the once miserable looking maid, was becoming prettier by the day.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, It\u2019s been more than a year since we last met right? I heard you\u2019ve given birth to a very beautiful young boy. Where is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotten a cold lately, so he\u2019s recuperating in the old madame\u2019s quarters.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was slouching in her chair while perusing the account books. Bai Rong\u2019er sidled up to her and laughed. \u201cElder sister, you are now in charge of the entire manor right? Why not let someone else read these books to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Books?</p><br/><p>The edge of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cHow could I possibly have the time to read books? These are the accounts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe manor\u2019s accounts?\u201d Bai Rong\u2019er grabbed one of the many books on the table and exclaimed. \u201cOh my word! There\u2019s so much money flowing in and out! It would probably take our family at least three to five years to fill up one of these books!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

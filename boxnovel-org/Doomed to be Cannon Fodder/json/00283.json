The only person that truly grieved over her death was probably just her father. However, this man was quick to get over his grief because his new wife, twenty years younger than him, had just given birth to a son. Before long, he was too busy playing with his young son.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu placed her hand on her forehead when she woke up. Su Yun\u2019s entire life had rendered her quite speechless. Even though everyone had received news of her death, she had been very quickly forgotten by everyone, including her ex-boyfriends and the men chasing after her. Realizing that she was probably going to be forgotten when she died too, Bai Xiangxiu held her hands over her face and bawled her eyes out in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi had no idea what was going on. Frightened, she quickly ran to her side. \u201cPrincess Consort! What\u2019s wrong? Does it hurt somewhere? Should I summon the doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019m not feeling pain anywhere. I just felt like crying, that\u2019s all. Ignore me.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu waved her hands to chase Xiaoshi out, which caused Xiaoshi to worry even more. She doesn\u2019t seem to be injured anywhere though. Could she be crying because His Highness has angered her?</p><br/><p>A black silhouette slipped into the room while Xiaoshi was still caught up in her thoughts. Thankfully, she\u2019d gotten used to that by now. She knew that this man was none other than the prince himself. She lit the candles and looked at Long Heng, dressed entirely in black. \u201cYou\u2019ve returned, Your Highness. The princess consort has been crying a lot for some reason. Maybe you should go see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng had entered the bedroom before Xiaoshi was even finished talking. His young wife was sitting on the bed, bawling her eyes out while wiping her tears with a handkerchief. Her posture looked so beautiful that it almost seemed like she was doing it on purpose. She looked like a cherry blossom after the rain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Long Heng furrowed his brows and sat down beside her, comforting her patiently. Men could unleash their bad temper when they were outside, but there was no way Long Heng would scream and shout at his little wife. Due to Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s weak and fragile body, he likely believed that Bai Xiangxiu would die of shock if he even raised his voice at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I just felt like crying.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu continued to weep and sniffle, causing a helpless look to surface on Long Heng\u2019s face. He was actually quite skeptical of the saying that women could weep over anything, even over the passing of spring or the advent of autumn. However, he had no choice but to believe this as fact after his experience today. Why else would she cry so much right after waking up?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can stop crying now.\u201d Long Heng took off his coat and sat down on the bed without taking a bath. He didn\u2019t have the time to take a bath, since he\u2019d been out till late and had to set out early the next day. He decided that it\u2019d be better to spend whatever time he had left with his wife, so that she\u2019d stop crying. After all, she seemed incredibly heartbroken right now, and that was more painful than a couple of hours of missed sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 must be tired. Come, lie down and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng hesitated for a moment. He wanted to go to bed immediately after arriving home, but he\u2019d been walking for the entire day. The smell from his body was probably still bearable, but his feet must stink up to the high heavens! Seeing how frail Bai Xiangxiu was looking right now, he really didn\u2019t want to add to her misery with his stinking feet. So, he turned around and said, \u201cYou should go to sleep. I\u2019ll go take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could see the exhaustion in Long Heng\u2019s eyes, even though her eyes were swollen from all the crying. She quickly grabbed his hand. \u201cForget it. You still have to wake up early tomorrow even though you\u2019re so tired. You don\u2019t have to take a bath, just come to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt warm inside. \u201cI just hope the smell won\u2019t make you cry again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu replied, \u201cI\u2019m not that finicky, alright?\u201d She jumped out of bed and pushed Long Heng to a sitting position on the bed and took off his shoes for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. It\u2019s dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt does smell quite bad, but the smell isn\u2019t going to kill me. Lie down now\u201d Bai Xiangxiu got him to lie down and covered him with a blanket. She then laid down on the outer side of the bed and nestled her head against his body. It didn\u2019t take long before Long Heng fell asleep, his chest rising and falling gently as he breathed deeply.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu knew that Long Heng liked being clean, and that he would surely be uncomfortable if he slept in such a dirty state. So, she quietly ordered the servants to bring some hot water and dipped a towel in it. She then disrobed him and began to wipe his body, then his hands, and finally his feet. After she was done, she gently put him in his clothes again, and nestled up to him. She felt very content now that there was a man sleeping by her side. Surprisingly, she slept very well that night.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know was that after she fell asleep, Long Heng turned to look at her, drawing her close, and hugged her like she was a precious treasure. He even kissed her on her forehead with a very sweet looking smile on his face. What had he done in his previous life to warrant the luck to marry such a cute and gentle woman? Maybe Su Yun had been extremely likeable due to her many talents, and maybe Lin Qianzi was popular due to how much emotion she possessed. However, none of them were as understanding and compassionate as Bai Xiangxiu, nor were they as brave and decisive. Bai Xiangxiu had never once acted out of line, even though she might have seemed oblivious at times, and there were moments where she was a little too wilful. This only added to her charms and made her seem cute and gentle.</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt that she alone made his current life worth living. The husband and wife slept in each other\u2019s arms the entire night. Xiaoshi, standing outside the entire time, could finally breathe a sigh of relief. She exited the room while holding a lantern, but immediately realized that there was someone behind her when she was closing the doors.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u2026\u201d In a fit of panic, that man quickly covered her mouth with his hands and stuffed something into her hands. The man was gone before Xiaoshi even realized what was going on. Bewildered, she checked her hands and realized that someone had stuffed a hairpin into them. Isn\u2019t this considered illicit relations? She blushed hard.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi quickly hid the hairpin, but continued to stare blankly into the night sky. She continued to do so for about an hour before she finally returned to her room, only to find that she couldn\u2019t fall asleep no matter what.</p><br/><p>The next day, Bai Xiangxiu was greeted by a national treasure, the panda. She nearly spat out her tea when she saw the sight. What in the world happened to Xiaoshi? She\u2019s usually filled with so much energy that she could power three trains with her mind alone!</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi made all sorts of mistakes that morning. The amount of cups that she broke was near uncountable. Even Xiaohuan, who usually had a good temper, was beginning to feel agitated. \u201cWhat are you doing? Have you lost your mind? This is the princess consort\u2019s favourite teacup set, and you\u2019ve broken two of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. Come here, Xiaoshi. I have something to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The panic-stricken Xiaoshi went to Bai Xiangxiu as was asked. She blushed whenever her mind unwittingly wandered back to the events of last night.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu instantly realized what was going on. After all, she was someone who\u2019d gone through the same thing too! \u201cWhy does it seem like your soul has left your body?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked after ordering Xiaohuan to leave the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no. It hasn\u2019t!\u201d Xiaoshi kept glancing outside from time to time. She was thinking about Ah Song. This is all his fault! If the princess consort realizes that he\u2019d given me something last night, she might sell me off!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of Ah Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?!\u201d Instantly realizing that she\u2019d made a mistake, Xiaoshi clapped her hands to her mouth.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu pulled her hands down. \u201cStop covering your mouth. I saw through the two of you a long time ago. That lad treats you very differently than anyone else. Even his expression when he looks at you is\u2026 different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how did you know? N-no. I mean please forgive this servant, Princess Consort! This servant has no other intentions other than to serve you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up. I\u2019ve already told you to stop kneeling for no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Consort\u2026 This servant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. It\u2019s not a big deal. Isn\u2019t it just a young lad who has fallen in love with you! Speaking of, that lad is actually quite handsome. He\u2019s a good match with you. Tell him to come see me if he ever meets you again. If he\u2019s not daring enough to do so, then we\u2019ll forget about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Consort, this servant will not meet him ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you truly wish to not marry for the rest of your life? Silly girl. I\u2019m being happy for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi felt relieved when she noticed that Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t blame her for anything. However, she began to fret when she imagined herself telling Ah Song about her mistress\u2019 words. And yet, she felt incredibly disappointed when she thought about not telling him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

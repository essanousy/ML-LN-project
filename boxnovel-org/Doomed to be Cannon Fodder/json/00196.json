However, he still continued to warn her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s impossible for you to enter Tranquil City. Even if you somehow find a way in, there\u2019s no way for you to contact Long Heng. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot sit around and wait any longer. I want to see what\u2019s happening there with my own eyes, no matter what.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu looked Song Jiaoyue right in the eyes to demonstrate her determination.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue gritted his teeth. It seemed like he had indeed failed to talk Bai Xiangxiu out of this. He had no choice but to name his condition for letting her go. \u201cYou may head for Tranquil City, but I insist that I come with you. We must bring another woman with us as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t expect that he\u2019d be so considerate. She quickly nodded her head and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to leave so urgently either. We will use the old method of leaving tomorrow morning. I will wait for you outside.\u201d After speaking his mind, he stole a glance at Long Lin. The little baby boy looked simply too similar to Bai Xiangxiu. He almost couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of him. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu instantly understood his meaning. He wanted her to spend one more night with her son. Bai Xiangxiu could feel her heart soften as she looked down at her son\u2019s face, so she nodded. \u201cThen we shall leave tomorrow morning instead. Are you fine with that, Yu Kuang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave with him and wait for you tomorrow morning then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang wasn\u2019t the nosy type. Even though he liked Bai Xiangxiu, he wasn\u2019t as crazy for her like Song Jiaoyue. At the very most, it was just a lingering attachment. However, warm feelings similar to that of kinship were slowly sprouting in his body. It was a kind of feeling that would likely be more permanent than those of love. This was why he seemed to react a little more indifferently. This made their relationship seem a little more like that of an old friend or an old couple.</p><br/><p>After leading Yu Kuang out of the manor, Song Jiaoyue thought that the wulin head would find his own place to stay. However, Yu Kuang followed him all the way back to the Song Manor. Song Jiaoyue scrunched his brows together, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang replied in a straightforward manner. \u201cSince we\u2019re leaving together tomorrow, let me stay at your place for a night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue opened his mouth like he were about to say something, but ultimately decided that there was no need to chase Yu Kuang away. So, he had someone arrange a bedroom for Yu Kuang and had Yu Se help him pack his things.</p><br/><p>It was inappropriate for two grown men to go on a journey with a woman. Moreover, Bai Xiangxiu was sneaking out of the manor, so she couldn\u2019t bring anyone with her. Thus, he made the decision to bring Yu Se with him instead. She was smart, an astute woman who was a suitable candidate to take care of Bai Xiangxiu while on the road. Everyone spent the night making their own preparations for the journey ahead. Bai Xiangxiu packed many things, especially money, since she now had the time to prepare. After all, how could a person go on a journey without money?</p><br/><p>Moreover, due to the fact that Long Heng was such an unromantic person, she\u2019d often receive money instead of gifts when he wanted to give her something. Bai Xiangxiu was really unfamiliar with the types of things from the olden times as well. If someone were to say that their gift was expensive, and Bai Xiangxiu also liked how it looked, she\u2019d end up wearing it. There really weren\u2019t too many things that she wanted either. Thus, she had managed to save up quite a sum of money after a while. Bai Xiangxiu entrusted Long Lin to Xiaoshi and the wet nurse after they woke up. She also told Xiaoshi about her plan to sneak out of the manor.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi had been by her side ever since she\u2019d arrived in this world. Bai Xiangxiu probably trusted her more than anyone else. \u201cHow is that appropriate, Madame Xiu? A woman shouldn\u2019t journey to such a place alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Highness has a friend that owes him a favor. That person has agreed to escort me there. He worries about the safety of the prince as well and wants to find a way to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB-But your reputation will probably be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat use is my reputation if something happens to the prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu! Why don\u2019t you let Xiaoshi follow you as well?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do. I\u2019m worried about Xiao Lin. You should stay and take care of him in my absence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s the old madame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old madame is filled with worry for the prince lately, so she might not be able to take care for Xiao Lin to the best of her abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough buts. Xiaoshi, you\u2019re the one that I trust the most in this manor. Take good care of Xiao Lin for me alright? Oh, and also Huo\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu gently caressed Xiaoshi\u2019s head. She genuinely felt that Xiaoshi had matured a lot lately. Bai Xiangxiu spent the entire night packing her bag and rewrote her letter as well. She wrote it with the most heartfelt words she could think of. Hopefully, the old madame wouldn\u2019t chase her out of the house when she returned.</p><br/><p>She had put in a lot of thought about the chained horse formation as well. She eventually recalled something from a story called Water Margin, one of the four famous stories of China. There was a similar sounding formation in that book. She believed that it was called the Linked Horses Formation? It wasn\u2019t an easy formation to break, but she\u2019d have to see it with her own eyes to really know.</p><br/><p>The next morning, she tried to use the old method to sneak out of the manor. However, she soon realized that the vegetable merchant was no longer Sun Si\u2019er. The basket on the new merchant\u2019s carriage was so small she likely wouldn\u2019t fit inside. </p><br/><p>Is this Song Jiaoyue\u2019s doing? Impossible! I didn\u2019t tell him anything about Sun Si\u2019er. Besides, he was the one who told me to leave the manor by the old method. What should I do now? How am I supposed to sneak out from here? While vexing over her unforeseen obstacle, someone tapped Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s shoulder. She leapt up in fright. Afraid that others would notice, Bai Xiangxiu quickly covered her mouth with her own hands. When she turned around, she found Xiaohuan standing behind her. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d And why do you have that weird bag with you? </p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me where?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu feigned ignorance. </p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant overheard your conversation with Xiaoshi yesterday. Xiaohuan owes her life to you. I must follow you no matter where you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026 You say that, but there\u2019s no way for us to leave right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis humble servant knows a way out, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat way? Anything is fine as long as we can leave this place!\u201d I guess it\u2019s fine for Xiaohuan to tag along. After all, didn\u2019t they say that I needed to bring another woman with me?</p><br/><p>Xiaohuan seemed hesitant at first, but she still led the way through several small paths and alleyways until they finally arrived at a place devoid of people. She then pointed at a corner of the wall. Most of the walls were made of mud in the olden days, but not the Prince Li Manor. The walls here were made out of stone. The wall right in front of her seemed to a remnant from before the manor was built. The old mud wall had a small hole dug out beneath it.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was a little speechless when she saw the hole. She looked at Xiaohuan and said, \u201cCan we really leave from this hole?\u201d It looks really small.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hole is actually quite deep on the inside. My younger brother would often crawl through this hole to bring fruit to me.\u201d Xiaohuan regretted her words almost immediately. \u201cMadame Xiu, can you please not tell anyone about this? Otherwise, this humble servant will be heavily punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d Without much of a choice, Bai Xiangxiu could only ignore how dirty the hole was and crawl in on all fours. She didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d make it at first, but the hole eventually deepened, just as Xiaohuan had said. All she needed to do now was bend over a little until she got to the other side. While she was crawling her way out, Bai Xiangxiu noticed something amiss. Why is there a pair of shoes on the opposite side?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu slowly lifted her head and saw a pair of bright eyes staring back at her. She coughed lightly and said, \u201cS-Sir Song, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had always been a goddess in Song Jiaoyue\u2019s heart. He\u2019d decided to wait for her at the back entrance because he was a little worried. However, when he heard her voice coming from within the walls, he\u2019d stopped to take a look. As expected, she really did eventually pop out from the hole, and with a face that was stained by all sorts of grime and mud. He found it so hilarious that he couldn\u2019t resist the urge to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you stop laughing at me? Quick, give me a little pull.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu reached her dusty hand out to Song Jiaoyue. Resigned to his fate and muffling his laughter, Song Jiaoyue quickly pulled her out from the hole.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s Yu Kuang! Bai Xiangxiu waved to greet him. As expected from a man from the wulin. He\u2019s always in the lead. She could finally breathe a sigh of relief. She was definitely safe now that he\u2019d come to get her. However, her happiness had come a tad too early. Thump! Yu Kuang suddenly dived for the ground just when he came within ten steps from her. Crap! I forgot that I have the black devil\u2019s snare right beside me.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu quickly yelled upon seeing the arrival of Long Heng and Song Jiaoyue, \u201cDon\u2019t come near me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng frowned, \u201cDid they apply some kind of drug on you?\u201d Why else would Yu Kuang suddenly fall to the ground like that? Or maybe\u2026 she\u2019s in danger as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to worry, this is just a result of me trying to defend myself. You must not come within ten steps of me. By the way, can I sleep outside the city for tonight? I don\u2019t want people to pass out after I enter the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can there be such a potent drug?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything later. What shall we do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, take good care of that man. I\u2019ll be keeping my wife company on the outskirts of the city for a night.\u201d Long Heng commanded as he pointed at Yu Kuang. He looked towards Bai Xiangxiu and said, \u201cWalk half a mile forward. There\u2019s an abandoned farmhouse there.\u201d The entire family had already moved to the city due to the war.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu could not bear to part with the black devil\u2019s snare. She held the plant in her arms, walked around the horse carriage and began to walk according to Long Heng\u2019s directions.</p><br/><p>Long Heng followed a little behind Bai Xiangxiu. They held a long distance conversation. He first noticed that the plant was a little too heavy for Bai Xiangxiu to carry, \u201cLet me help you carry that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! This isn\u2019t something you can touch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you disappear all of a sudden? Who abducted you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chen Tao. He abducted me in order to obtain the formula for the fire powder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you give it to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only gave him a fake one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he pursue you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t pursue probably because he\u2019s still unconscious. Or maybe it\u2019s because he knows that I\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Truth was, Chen Tao\u2019s men had already caught up with her. Long Heng had sensed their presence for a while now, but he was secretly on guard. He wouldn\u2019t allow them to harm Bai Xiangxiu if they really did try to attack her. However, they left soon after they noticed Long Heng, as they were likely extremely afraid of him. Long Heng smiled coldly to himself. Chen Tao is such a base and shameless person. It seems that I\u2019ll have to pay him a visit tomorrow. But his utmost priority at the moment was Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s safety. He never thought that she would land into so much trouble just because she came to help him. However, why did he have to protect her from such a distance? He couldn\u2019t even hand over the chicken that he\u2019d painstakingly cooked for her. He had to leave it and stay ten steps away so that Bai Xiangxiu could walk up to t and start nibbling away. \u201cXiu\u2019er, that flower of yours seems really unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a black devil\u2019s snare. It grants one wish to a person if they water it with their blood. It granted me a wish after I watered it for four days, and I wished for everyone to faint immediately when they approached me for an entire day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood? Don\u2019t you\u2026 faint at the sight of blood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t faint anymore. I\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u2019er, you wouldn\u2019t have to suffer so much if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d He used to think that she was very weak and feeble when they were in the manor, but he now realized that she was actually very strong and resilient. She was like the black devil\u2019s snare. It seemed elegant and vacuous, but was actually incredibly useful when the time came. \u201cThe wound on your hand\u2026\u201d He finally noticed that there were many cuts and lacerations on her palms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe wounds are almost all healed.\u201d </p><br/><p>Long Heng tossed some wound ointment right next to her, \u201cHave a good night\u2019s rest after applying the medicine. I will watch over you through the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was very sleepy indeed. She felt very safe even though Long Heng was only keeping watch from afar. The next day, Bai Xiangxiu realized that she was lying in Long Heng\u2019s arms when she woke up. They\u2019d already returned to the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe flower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had one of the servants to help take it back. It\u2019s being potted just outside right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to report what Chen Tao did to you to Prince Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d Why does it feel like we\u2019re an old couple that\u2019s been married for a long time? When did this suddenly occur?</p><br/><p>Chen Tao had unexpectedly decided to defect to the enemy side in order to escape punishment for his previous actions. The enemy had begun to spread the news of his defection to try and terrorize the citizens. If the city guard captain had already surrendered to the enemy, wouldn\u2019t that mean that their side was about to lose the war? Long Heng laughed scornfully. The enemy seemed to have forgotten how he\u2019d chased them away every time. He\u2019d only come back this time to assemble the troops so that he could muster his strength for an all out assault and take over their capital.</p><br/><p>However, there was no way that Long Heng could\u2019ve predicted this turn of events. Chen Tao had brought his closest subordinates and defected to the enemy, but had left his family behind! His mother, wife, and two children were now imprisoned. Long Heng was incredibly furious, so much so that he actually slammed his hands on the table in public to release his anger. Chen Tao is such a coward! He actually abandoned his family so that he could live? What are we supposed to do with them?</p><br/><p>Kill them?</p><br/><p>\u201cSurely you jest. They\u2019re weak women and children. What good will it do if you killed them? They\u2019ve done nothing wrong, right?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu said while serving Long Heng some tea. Her brows were scrunched together.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re against killing them? But the rules state that everyone in a deserter\u2019s family must be executed without exceptions. Prince Rong also thinks that we should do this according to the court\u2019s laws. But\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it feels wrong to murder the innocent and the weak. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Long Heng discussed almost everything with Bai Xiangxiu now. While she might not be a genius, she was still someone with a wide range of knowledge. Even someone like Prince Rong sang her praises.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen change the children\u2019s surnames and have the woman remarry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Long Heng stared at her with surprise written all over his face. Wasn\u2019t a woman supposed to never have a second husband? However, this was a really good way for them to cut off all connections with Chen Tao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Isn\u2019t it a good idea? I understand that the woman might not agree, but is she really willing to watch her children die just so they can remain dedicated and wait for a traitor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really come up with all sorts of weird plans, but this might work well.\u201d Long Heng said as he pinched her cheeks, \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019ll discuss it with Prince Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Rong hadn\u2019t intended to let them live in the first place, but this was actually quite a good plan. Putting a massive green hat on top of Chen Tao\u2019s head would be incredibly humiliating.</p><br/><p>Soon after, back at the enemy camp, Commander Lu was having a conversation with a furious man as they retreated back to their country. \u201cHow can you possibly put up with such a humiliating thing? They\u2019ve sullied your wife by giving her to somebody else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I can\u2019t!\u201d Chen Tao yelled through gritted teeth. \u201cBut what I can\u2019t stand the most is that woman by his side. I would\u2019ve gotten the formula for the bombs already if she wasn\u2019t such a sly fox!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she give you a formula? Let me have a look.\u201d A soldier beside Commander Lu thrust a hand out to Chen Tao. He looked young, and seemed very elegant and refined. </p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Chen Tao hesitated. It wasn\u2019t something that should be handed over to a mere soldier, even if it was a fake.</p><br/><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Tao handed over the paper to the soldier after some hesitation. Something seemed a little off with that person, but Chen Tao just couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

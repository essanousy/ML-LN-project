Did Long Heng take the wrong medicine? Why does he have so much gusto after coming back? People might think that he was drugged if they saw him like this!</p><br/><p>Long Heng was already gone by the time Bai Xiangxiu woke up the next day. She instantly remembered that she had to go pay the old madame a visit upon opening her eyes. There were some matters in the manor that she had to oversee so that she would be prepared when Long Heng was busy with his matters.</p><br/><p>She had to struggle quite a bit before she could finally put on her clothes, but her legs gave way when she tried to get up. Fortunately, there were maids who helped her dress and wash up so she could finally sit at the dining table to have breakfast. However, she fell asleep on top of the dining table before she even began her meal.</p><br/><p>Everyone was surprised when they saw that. What were they supposed to do now? Ye-mama coughed gently. \u201cI will report to the old madame and tell her that\u2026 the princess consort will not be able to pay her a visit as she has fallen sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019ve already paid the old madame a visit.\u201d Long Heng was in a good mood when he saw Bai Xiangxiu fast asleep on the table after he was finished with morning court.</p><br/><p>He picked her up and laid her down on the bed and accompanied her as she slept. An hour later, Bai Xiangxiu suddenly woke up with a scream. \u201cOh no, This is bad! I\u2019ve yet to pay the old madame a visit! Why didn\u2019t anybody wake me up!\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAww. She\u2019ll hate me for this.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu let out a long sigh. Mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws don\u2019t normally get along ever since ancient times. Her situation was worse since the old madame was a very strict old lady.</p><br/><p>Long Heng smiled. \u201cWhy would she hate you when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong? I\u2019ve already paid her a visit in your stead. You don\u2019t have to bother paying her a visit in the morning anymore as mother will be busy taking care of Lin\u2019er. So, household matters will fall into your hands. Things will get a little hectic but it shouldn\u2019t be too exhausting as Long Shuting will be here to help you. Hurry up and have your lunch. There\u2019ll be a nice show to watch in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d What show could there possibly be so early in the morni-\u2026 I mean at noon?</p><br/><p>After taking their lunch, Long Heng brought Bai Xiangxiu to the receiving hall at a pace that was more like taking a stroll. She saw a few people kneeling in when she arrived at the courtyard. Bai Xiangxiu had a good memory, so she instantly recognized that they weren\u2019t people from the manor. \u201cWho are these people?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu asked while furrowing her eyebrows. There were three people in total. An old lady and two pageboys. Their faces were filled with sorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, bring a chair for the princess consort.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants quickly went and brought two chairs. After all, it wouldn\u2019t look good if others were to see the prince standing while the princess consort sat on a chair beside him. Thus, both husband and wife decided to take a seat. They seemed like unscrupulous people by doing so. There was nothing Bai Xiangxiu could do about it. She hadn\u2019t a clue what was going on so she could only mimic the attitude Long Heng was showing. This is probably why they say married couples look alike! </p><br/><p>Tears began to pour from the old lady\u2019s eyes as she kowtowed when she saw the two daunting figures. \u201cYour Highness, please be benevolent and forgive our mistress. Our master and madame are willing to pay any price to purchase her enslavement papers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Princess Consort, what do you think about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Oh god. Can you not push these sort of questions to me? I\u2019m not your sidekick. Isn\u2019t your opinion more important than mine in the end? Bai Xiangxiu rolled her eyes in secret and replied in an obedient manner. \u201cYour Highness should be the one making the decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t all men love being given face? I will give you the biggest face I can possibly muster. Long Heng was being more realistic now that all his urges were fulfilled. You\u2019d best wait, little lass. Her reply made him feel abnormally good. \u201cFine. It\u2019s not impossible if the Lin family wishes to purchase her enslavement papers.\u201d Long Heng replied, showing a little bit of mercy.</p><br/><p>No way! He\u2019s going to give them the paper so easily? That woman will surely be a scourge of all troubles when she goes back home!</p><br/><p>\u201cOur master will surely remember Your Highness\u2019 benevolence and big-heartedness. May I ask what do you wish in return\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy conditions are relatively simple as well. I want all of the Lin family\u2019s assets, including their property and their slaves. Also, I want Minister Lin to resign, return to his hometown and never step foot in the capital ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The old lady seemed incredibly taken aback while looking at Prince Li. She never imagined that he\u2019d give such a preposterous condition by asking for all of her master\u2019s assets.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prince does not intend to change his mind! Minister Lin will have to pay the full price if he wants his daughter back! Get out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, Your Highness! Please don\u2019t be like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe longest I can wait is until tomorrow night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, our master truly wishes to retrieve young mistress. She\u2019s young and ignorant so please don\u2019t hold her to her offences\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThrow them out.\u201d With just a wave of Long Heng\u2019s hands, the servants picked up the old lady and her cohorts and threw them out the doors.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really fine to be doing this? Minister Lin will never agree to those terms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not begging him to agree to them either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd. Why didn\u2019t he come personally to ask for his daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor has issued a decree for the Lin family to cut all ties with Lin Qianzi. They are never to meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d So that is the reason why Minister Lin didn\u2019t come himself. Even the old lady that was sent here had to come very secretly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Miss Lin? Didn\u2019t she cause a ruckus yesterday night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She will never be able to cause a ruckus ever again.\u201d Long Heng\u2019s smile sent chills down Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s spine. \u201cDo you want to know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 suddenly not anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t force the matter either. \u201cYou will know sooner or later anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu inquired about the current situation after they were done looking at the show in the front hall. \u201cWhat about Tranquil City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe soldiers have retreated back to Tranquil City. They have yet to return to the capital as they were worried that the enemy nation might be up to something. The emperor has given the permission, but at the same time he\u2019s taken away all of my duties in the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clearly wants Long Heng to stay idle in the capital!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the emperor only capable of these petty moves?\u201d Well, isn\u2019t he going at it a bit easy, actually?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu looked at Long Heng in an inquisitive manner until he finally explained. \u201cThe emperor has already sent two generals with \u2018military\u2019 backgrounds to Tranquil City. However, I have a hunch that none would ever welcome them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve already given them an order to make the lives of any of my replacements, hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Prince Rong is still there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will be returning to the capital soon. He might look honest and down to earth but there\u2019s actually more to what meets the eye. He\u2019s actually an expert at sizing up the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSituation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this current moment, the emperor is the one who has authority, while I am the one who has military power. Both of us are now at a stalemate. If I ever decide to revolt, he will only be able to resist for up to three years with all the troops he has at hand. After three years, this entire country will be ruled by my Long family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Heng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut during these three years, the enemy nation might take the opportunity and attack us while we are at our weakest. The country would be very vulnerable to outside attacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat much is true but sooner or later, the emperor will definitely dissolve your military power if you choose not to do anything about it. When that happens, I\u2019m afraid our family will be in mortal danger.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu began to frown. It seemed like every path they could take was riddled with danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019ve planned a way out. During our time in Tranquil City, I\u2019ve bribed almost every single general there. Their families have all been secretly moved to Shu County, except for our family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. This man is only in his twenties right? How can his thoughts be so complicated?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a man with a wife and a son, so I don\u2019t intend to remain passive. I\u2019ve already foreseen this when I realized I was the only person with majority control of the army.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Long Heng.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu could only hug him tightly as she was at a loss for words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She just felt helpless, and the thrilling events of the day had tired her out. As a result, she dozed off right there on the table, facing Huo\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he seemed to have entered a dream right as she fell asleep. In the dream, they had delivered Jiang Su\u2019er to the slaver according to Song Jiaoyue\u2019s plan. However, driven to despair, she used her hairpin to stab her throat in the carriage. Dying, her last words were, \u201cAh Quan, let us meet again in the next life!\u201d</p><br/><p>As for Ah Quan, in the dream he was handed over to the authorities and sentenced to be exiled. In prison, he suddenly snatched a spear from a nearby soldier and ran himself through the chest, leaving behind the words, \u201c Su\u2019er, I know what has happened to you. We\u2026 shall be husband and wife in our next lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu jolted awake in shock. What was that? Was it a nightmare? However, wasn\u2019t the nightmare a little too realistic? Especially since she even knew their thoughts and felt woozy when she saw their crimson red blood splash out.</p><br/><p>How can this be? Wasn\u2019t it just a dream? Was it actually possible to be hemophobic in a dream? Bai Xiangxiu gazed thoughtfully as the cactus as she pondered her dream. Somehow, a feeling of dread had grown in her heart. Although it was only a dream, the more she thought about their situation, the more she believed that they might actually do such a thing. They had been driven into the depths of despair and so would begin to wish for their next life.</p><br/><p>People from the olden days had always been more superstitious than modern people. In addition, one of them believed that she was about to be sold off to prostitute herself, while the other believed that he was about to get his head chopped off. Since they could never be together, the next logical step for them may well be to enter their next life.</p><br/><p>This won\u2019t do. This definitely won\u2019t do. Bai Xiangxiu began to panic in her room. What if something from her dream really came true? Wouldn\u2019t the plans that had been carefully put together be in vain then?</p><br/><p>She definitely had to notify that couple blind in love. There was clearly no use for all that planning if she ended up saving corpses?</p><br/><p>She paced from one end of her room to the other, but was suddenly struck by an epiphany when she caught sight of the pastries on her table. She snatched a silk ribbon from nearby and quickly wrote out a message. Then, she carefully stuffed the ribbon into a piece of pastry and told Xiao Shi to serve it to them along with some supper and wine.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi listened carefully, and dutifully delivered some supper and wine to Jiang Su\u2019er and Ah Quan\u2019s room. She placed the supper down and said, \u201cThis is a gift from the fourth madame, and can also be considered your last meal. She\u2019ll have the guards withdraw in a moment so you guys can have your meal at ease.\u201d Then, with a tone that may or may not have a hidden meaning, she continued, \u201cThis pastry was personally prepared by the madame. Both of you should be grateful and eat more of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing her words, Xiao Shi winked at Jiang Su\u2019er when the guards weren\u2019t paying attention and said, \u201cYou should thank the fourth madame for your current freedom and comfort, understood?\u201d Finishing her sentence, she snorted daintily and left.</p><br/><p>After she left, Jiang Su\u2019er stared at Ah Quan as he gripped her hand tightly. Is there still a chance for we can be saved?</p><br/><p>The people outside really did withdraw shortly, and Jiang Su\u2019er began to eat the pastries. Unexpectedly, she got the piece with the silk ribbon inside on her first bite. There were only a few words written on the ribbon. \u201cYour rescue is already arranged, be at ease. However, you will need to put on an appropriate performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu\u2026 We will forever remember your magnanimity in our hearts.\u201d Jiang Su\u2019er and Ah Quan were naturally delighted to hear that they would be rescued. They turned to face outside and kneeled down to kowtow, then burst into tears as they hugged each other. Word spread in the outside world that they should be grateful to Madame Xiu to be able to spend their last night together before their final separation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu could finally sleep peacefully after settling everything. She slept soundly all the way to high noon the next day before getting up. Ye-mama had already prepared everything on her side and asked if Bai Xiangxiu was going to run the two of them out.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Bai Xiangxiu agreed unreservedly, and said to Xiao Shi, \u201cXiao Shi, go outside to find a slaver and have him take Third Madame away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye-mama frowned and spoke up, \u201cXiao Shi isn\u2019t too familiar with those kinds of things. Why don\u2019t you let this old servant\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Shi is no longer young anymore. There\u2019s yet much for her to learn in the future. Mama, you shouldn\u2019t be indulging her like this.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was very obvious with her meaning here that she wanted to groom Xiao Shi into her trusted subordinate, so there was a few things that Xiao Shi needed to learn.</p><br/><p>Ye-mama didn\u2019t stop her anymore after realizing that she had such a motive. Who wouldn\u2019t want to have a competent subordinate that they could entrust sensitive matters with?</p><br/><p>And so, Xiao Shi went out to search for that person with a head full of confusion. Somehow, she actually managed to run into a carriage that was filled with girls. After inquiring, she realized that the carriage owner was actually a renowned slaver who had come to the estate to sell some of his wares!</p><br/><p>Naturally, Xiao Shi brought the slaver back into the estate. Ye-mama wasn\u2019t the slightest bit suspicious even after coming out to personally welcome him. Jiang Su\u2019er was sold to the slaver for fifty taels, and left readily with him.</p><br/><p>Ah Quan was handed over to the court officials at the same moment. After his trial in the afternoon, he was sentenced to be conscripted into the border guard in the Shu province. Normally, people faced quite a bit of hardship in exile. It was also unknown whether a noble\u2019s daughter like Jiang Su\u2019er would be able to adapt to her new life either. Moreover, Bai Xiangxiu had to face another difficult matter of informing the Jiang family of what had happened to their daughter.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think for a second that everything was concluded after one sold off another family\u2019s daughter. Evidence needed to be produced. Thankfully, she still Jiang Su\u2019er and Ah Quan\u2019s affidavit in hand and had someone invite Jiang Su\u2019er\u2019s mother to the estate.</p><br/><p>Jiang Su\u2019er\u2019s birth was quite good, since her father a fifth rank official. However, because she was the child of a concubine, the mother that came to the estate wasn\u2019t her birth mother. Even though it was their daughter that was in the wrong, the other party was still the wife of a fifth rank official. So, for a concubine like her to receive them, she would still have to give them some face. Moreover, Bai Xiangxiu had never been one to put on airs, so when she received Madame Jiang into the estate, she first exchanged a round of pleasantries with Madame Jiang.</p><br/><p>However, Madame Jiang was someone who clearly knew her place. She realized that a serious issue must\u2019ve come up for her to be invited to the estate so suddenly. Moreover, they even sent the person in charge to talk to her. Although Bai Xiangxiu was only a concubine, at the moment, she represented the Prince Li Manor. Therefore, Madame Jiang was very polite when she asked, \u201cI wonder, the reason you invited me here is\u2026\u201d It must have something to do with that base wench Su\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Bai Xiangxiu got the servants to hand over the two affidavits to her. After drinking some tea, she smiled and said, \u201cOur estate has already handled the matters regarding that person. However, if you wish to rescue her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She let her sentence trail off. Normally when a lady did something that scandalous in her husband\u2019s residence, her own family would treat her as an enormous shame and an insult to their good name. Very few would try to rescue them.</p><br/><p>Madame Jiang was extremely furious. That bitch with a lowly life really did have no sense of shame. She\u2019d actually gone and done something that tarnished the Jiang family name! Luckily, Prince Li wasn\u2019t around. Or else, she couldn\u2019t even fathom the extent of their punishment at his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s just handle the matter according to the madame\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t say anything in excess. Even if the prince\u2019s manor had sentenced Jiang Su\u2019er to death, the Jiang family could only keep their mouths shut. Particularly when it came to this Ah Quan. It wasn\u2019t as if the family didn\u2019t know about this past relationship. It\u2019s just that they hadn\u2019t expected that he would chase after her all the way into the prince\u2019s estate and humiliate the family.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we shall put this matter to rest, and everything will be handled by our estate. For both of our family\u2019s reputation, naturally, no third party shall know about anything about this. To appease your side of the family, you can just say that the third madame has passed away in a sudden bout of illness. How does that sound?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was actually inwardly speechless. No matter how good Jiang Xu\u2019er\u2019s birth was, she was still only a concubine in the end. She had been nothing but a tool for her family to curry some favor with those in a higher position in life. She\u2019d been immediately discarded mercilessly after making a mistake, without a single ounce of pity.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s family came to her mind. Would they act the same way as the Jiang family if she were to stand in Jiang Su\u2019er\u2019s shoes? That would really be rather depressing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

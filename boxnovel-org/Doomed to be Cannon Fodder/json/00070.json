What if word travelled back to Old Madame?</p><br/><p>Bai He tugged on her sleeve and said, \u201cLike I said, I felt you were familiar as soon as I saw you. Much more than the others I\u2019ve known for over a decade. It\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t stay here forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>A startled Yu Se broke out in cold sweat. This servant\u2019s careless words would cause trouble if someone with ill intentions overheard.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the other party didn\u2019t overthink it, but replied easily, \u201cThen I\u2019ll visit often. We\u2019ll be just like sisters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yu Se dare speak. \u201cThis girl is absolutely incomprehensible. We\u2019ve been together for 10 years, but she\u2019s given up our feelings in just an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He pulled her over and laughed out loud. \u201cHow could that be? It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t be with this\u2026 that\u2019s right, what\u2019s your name? Do you have a courtesy name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Women in this period usually had courtesy names given to them by their husbands or masters. Bai Xiangxiu thought that Long Heng wasn\u2019t the type to give her a courtesy name, so she simply shook her name and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have one. Just call me by my birth name, Xiangxiu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not polite,\u201d Yu Se hastened to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can call you two Yu Se and Bai He.\u201d In modern times, it was very normal to call one\u2019s friends by name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Only big sister Yu Se is a stickler for the rules. Let\u2019s all go by our birth names.\u201d Bai He started talking about their ages after that. Bai Xiangxiu was actually younger than them by two months, making her the youngest sister! And so, they kept chatting until dinnertime.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had them stay to eat and brought up the idea of drinking some wine. There was no helping it, young women would inevitably end up drinking and eating when they were together. Bai He was quick to agree, and Yu Se futilely pulled at her for a long time without success before being forced to stay as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo tell eldest young master. Just say big sister Yu Se and I talked with little sister Xiu until we stayed for dinner. We won\u2019t be back for a bit.\u201d Bai He instructed the little servant girl by her side to deliver a message before returning to her seat. Then the three of them really started drinking.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t drink white wine because she thought it was too spicy, so she could only take small sips. On the other hand, Bai He was the uninhibited type who downed the tiny cups in one gulp.</p><br/><p>The Song family didn\u2019t treat guests harshly. Once they knew that the women of Eldest Master Song were staying to eat, they sent over many good dishes and wine. As soon as Bai Xiangxiu finished off two cups, she began to feel a bit tipsy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo more, no more. If I drink any more I\u2019ll get drunk,\u201d she waved her hand. This body really had bad alcohol tolerance. Her head had already turned woozy from just two cups!.</p><br/><p>Bai He was still clear headed and said, \u201cLittle sister Xiu only drank a few sips, and now you\u2019re saying you\u2019re drunk? From what I know, those who say they\u2019re drunk are usually the ones who are still clear headed. Come, let\u2019s play a drinking game. It\u2019s so boring just drinking wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrinking game? But I don\u2019t know any.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had drunk too much, so her original foolish personality revealed itself. She clung and rubbed her head against Bai He\u2019s shoulder and spoke in an exceedingly pitiful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyoyo, big sister Yu Se, look! I can\u2019t take it already with little sister Xiu falling into my embrace like this, not to mention her prince back home. No wonder the rumors all say he dotes on you like his darling!\u201d Bai He had drunk too much too, and started joking about Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>But Bai Xiangxiu only shook her head. \u201cWrong, wrong, wrong. Big sis Bai He, you said two out of three things wrong.\u201d She pointed with her finger and said with a pout, causing Yu Se\u2019s face to flush at the sight.</p><br/><p>She was thinking, no wonder eldest young master keeps thinking about her. When she\u2019s acting cute and spoilt, she really is very cute. Even a female like her felt her ears reddening and heartbeat quickening at the sight, to say nothing of a man. And after her next string of words, Yu Se\u2019s perception of her changed yet again. It seemed like even an absolute beauty had difficult days.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu wagged her finger and said, \u201cNumber one, this prince isn\u2019t mine, but Miss Lin\u2019s. Number two, the rumors outside must be hearsay and can\u2019t be true. Moreover, how much favor could he show a mere concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Bai He sucked in a breath. \u201cCome, have a drink on behalf of us sisters.\u201d She would be a concubine in the future as well. It was even possible that once the new wife arrived, she might be sold away instead!</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers\u2026\u201d This time, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t mention anything about being drunk, but drank heartily. But as soon as she finished, her entire body fell backwards onto the bed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi was frightened and ran over to look. \u201cMy mistress fell asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He laughed. \u201cWake her up to drink some more. I haven\u2019t drunk to my heart\u2019s content just yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>But Yu Se wasn\u2019t about to let her go hollering like this. She dragged Bai He back with all her might. When she went back to her courtyard and entered the rooms, she discovered that Song Jiaoyue was still up. He almost seemed like an immortal with his loose hair beneath the moonlight as he peered at the moon. When he caught the scent of alcohol upon her arrival, he creased his forehead and asked, \u201cYou drank?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai He saw their family\u2019s master, she immediately sobered up and turned docile. Actually, she was still afraid of this young master, so she just nodded and said, \u201cYour servant and little sister Xiu were like old friends as soon as we met, so\u2026 we stayed behind and drank a bit of wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was well aware of Bai He\u2019s drinking capacity and said, \u201cDid you get her drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He nodded her head. \u201cMm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Se was quick to speak up. \u201cMadame Xiu had a good temper and insisted on having us servants stay. Thus, we started to drink. Unexpectedly, her alcohol tolerance was lower than ours so she\u2019s fallen asleep by now. But she doesn\u2019t seem to be tossing or turning in her sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue faced Bai He. \u201cYou can leave and rest. Drink less in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood\u201d Bai He hastily agreed before turning to leave.</p><br/><p>But Song Jiaoyue held Yu Se back and asked softly, \u201cIs she good-tempered? She\u2019s only met you two once, and started drinking with you?\u201d Though his tone was mild, it was clear that he was very curious about Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s behaviors.</p><br/><p>Yu Se didn\u2019t hide anything and told him about everything they\u2019d talked about while they drank. Song Jiaoyue listened raptly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019d be wonderful if he too could sit with her and chat leisurely while drinking.</p><br/><p>Yet once he heard her words about Long Heng being Miss Lin\u2019s, and that his fancy towards her was just rumors, he sighed. He thought her days in the prince\u2019s estate were pleasant, but perhaps that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadame Xiu definitely hasn\u2019t drunk with others before, because she doesn\u2019t even know any drinking games.\u201d Yu Se thought she was much too docile. It seemed like life in the prince\u2019s estate was very strict. Though the Song family had strict domestic discipline and family rules as well, servants like her were still allowed to drink or hold poetry meets when they had nothing else to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prince is reserved and sober, his methods cold and harsh. It\u2019s been\u2026\u201d Hard on her. If he had agreed to let her come back then, perhaps she would\u2019ve assimilated with these servants by now to live a free and easy life.</p><br/><p>Yu Se couldn\u2019t guess what the young master was thinking and only said, \u201cNow that she\u2019s helped the Song family, when Madame sends presents over, Old Madame will definitely look at her in a new light, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm!\u201d Song Jiaoyue nodded his head. \u201cWhat was your opinion on her education when you were all talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally good. She\u2019d sometimes randomly say things worth pondering over for a long time!\u201d Yu Se liked to read books, so these words demonstrated her high opinion of Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

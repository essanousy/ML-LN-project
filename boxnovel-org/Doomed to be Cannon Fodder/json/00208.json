She was fortunate that she had been born into a family of scholars and truly had a very large library. Thus, Long Heng didn\u2019t find her explanation suspicious when she did answer him. Truth be told, his suspicions towards Bai Xiangxiu had gradually changed over time into trust. It was a deep trust that came from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWear your clothes and rest. If you need anything, Shu\u2019er will be here to wait on you. I have a couple of things to take care of.\u201d Long Heng had quite the list of things he needed to deal with. And at the top of that list was a method to train his soldiers for breaking the chained horses formation, followed by forging that weapon Bai Xiangxiu had described in the letter.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu had to rest as well. Even though she felt that she should be helping Long Heng, it would have to wait until she was fully recovered. She wouldn\u2019t able to think straight if she kept her body in its current state.</p><br/><p>Long Heng had his hands full with his duties as Bai Xiangxiu slept the day away. He started with the weapon forging. The sickles he had collected from the city were too small for him to use in battle. They simply didn\u2019t have the reach to cut through the horses\u2019 legs. One of the biggest issues plaguing him was the shape of the sickle. Each attempt by the blacksmith only worsened his dissatisfaction with the weapon. It was while he was examining the blacksmith\u2019s most recent attempt when a voice piped up from behind him, \u201cIt\u2019s too short. The sickle needs to be longer, with an edge on each side of the blade as well. One side can be used to cut when stabbing forward, while the other side can shear off the legs in a single pull.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng instantly recognized Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s voice, though she\u2019d tried to disguise it.</p><br/><p>Long Heng turned back with a frown, \u201cWhy have you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came over to take a look since I\u2019ve gotten plenty of rest. I know a little bit about these sort of things,\u201d Bai Xiangxiu advised after taking a closer look at the sickle. She was still dressed in men\u2019s clothing, but that didn\u2019t seem to deter her as she described the shape and size of the sickle in detail to the blacksmiths. At that moment, she was very grateful for the realistic descriptions from that television drama Water Margin. It was very useful in her current predicament. </p><br/><p>Long Heng also felt that her words were useful, so he asked the blacksmiths to forge according to her advice. \u201cWe will have to wait for a while before it\u2019s finished. Come with me. We will go back to the room.\u201d A woman like her shouldn\u2019t be loitering around in an army camp. However, she didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by it. \u201cBut you still need to know how to train your troops right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 come with me then.\u201d Resigned to this newfound courage of his concubine, Long Heng brought Bai Xiangxiu to the training grounds with him. There, they found the soldiers drilling on how to properly fall and leap to their feet quickly.</p><br/><p>This is a good plan. As expected of Long Heng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should erect some wooden pillars here, and let them learn how to shear the pillars with the weapon. The training will be complete when they are able to shear a row of pillars in half with a single blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Once the cavalry leading the charge have fallen, the cavalry behind them will not be able to get out of the way in time. They will continue to charge to the front and trample everything in their path, no matter human or horse. The chaos that follows will render a complete defeat to the linked horses formation.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I really want to read that book.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since I\u2019ve read it. I no longer remember where I can find that particular book. Haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng didn\u2019t try to get to the bottom of this, instead changing the subject, \u201cIs your body able to cope?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xiangxiu went over some more details of the strategy with Long Heng. She even came up with the idea of ambushing the enemy from behind by using the underground tunnel. An unexpected attack from behind would force the enemy to battle on two fronts, causing them to panic.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment when Long Heng realized that his wife was actually a warfare maniac! She didn\u2019t even flinch when talking about gore and violence. In fact, she seemed extremely confident. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the strongest girl I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Long Heng quietly said while caressing her head. He gathered some of his troops and began to train them according to her instructions. Yu Kuang and Song Jiaoyue didn\u2019t remain idle either. Hot-blooded men like them would never hide on the side, especially when it came to a matter of life or death for their nation. Particularly not when even a woman was putting her life on the line for the country.</p><br/><p>Long Heng hadn\u2019t wanted her to help, but there was nothing he could do about it. So, he decided to let her help with the details, such choosing the type of spear handles and overseeing the training method for shearing the pillars in half. </p><br/><p>He was worried at first, but decided to let her be in the end because he just had too much work on his hands. Everyone only thought of her as a strategist that Long Heng had hired, so they didn\u2019t pay her too much heed. The only person who paid attention to her was Prince Rong. He recognized Bai Xiangxiu. In fact, he recognized her almost immediately when he saw her in the training fields.</p><br/><p>He had heard that the strategist was someone that Long Heng had saved from the battlefield, but never in his mind did he ever expect that the strategist would actually be Long Heng\u2019s concubine. He soon realized exactly how capable she was when he heard her explain herself in a reasoned and well argued manner. He decided not to stick his head into the matter. At the very least, she didn\u2019t seem to be here just for Long Heng\u2019s enjoyment, despite her identity as a concubine.</p><br/><p>Long Heng saw the expression on Prince Rong\u2019s face and realized that Prince Rong had realized her true identity as well. So, Long Heng decided to tell him why Bai Xiangxiu had come to Tranquil City and gave him the full story later that day. Prince Rong never expected that his general\u2019s concubine would be so intelligent and talented. Long Heng quickly added, \u201cPrince Rong, I implore you to help me with a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease convey to the emperor her achievements in this war when we return. I wish to use both our contributions in the war effort to ask that she be granted the position of princess consort.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t too difficult a task, but I\u2019m afraid that others might criticize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. It\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t already have a fair share of naysayers in the capital.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! It\u2019s good that you\u2019re not being hard on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Long Heng thanks Prince Rong for fulfilling his wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Rong wasn\u2019t allowed to become involved in the preparation, as he was only there to supervise the war effort. However, he was still willing to help Long Heng with this small favor. After all, this woman had indeed saved them from a precarious situation. They only had half a month\u2019s time to crack the formation before the food supply ran dry. Then their situation would go from precarious to dire.</p><br/><p>Long Heng heaved a sigh of relief and returned to his room after thanking Prince Rong. He noticed that his little woman was deeply engrossed in drawing something. Walking over to look over her shoulder, he immediately realized that she was drawing a topographic map of the surrounding area. She\u2019d placed extra attention to the details of the enemy\u2019s back lines. I can\u2019t believe that she remembers so much just from going there once. </p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to draw this. Almost every commanding officer here knows the terrain like the back of their hands.\u201d </p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2026 everyone has already memorized it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We have a map of this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 Then why did I waste my energy on this useless thing?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu tossed her drawings aside and walked the few steps to her bed to fall on it with a loud thump. Long Heng asked, \u201cHave your injuries improved a little bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. They have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t that be a little inappropriate?\u201d It was indeed be very inappropriate to do that here when they were inside the city. However, Long Heng was definitely not taking no for an answer as he tossed her deeper onto the bed. In his defense, they hadn\u2019t done anything in the past two days, even though they\u2019d slept on the same bed. That had been particularly difficult for him to accept. He would often think about her when he was alone during the night, but he hadn\u2019t really felt the urge to do anything. Now that she was here, he found it incredibly hard to stop himself from wanting to have her. He really, really wanted her.</p><br/><p>After a moment to think, Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t reject his advances either. After all, they hadn\u2019t been intimate ever since after she\u2019d given birth. He\u2019s kept himself in check for a long time now. So she didn\u2019t put up too much of a struggle. Just like that, the two began to tumble in the sheets. The next day, Bai Xiangxiu struggled for a long time before she was able to lift herself from the bed after an entire night of love and passion.</p><br/><p>Long Heng felt incredibly invigorated. His energy felt almost bottomless. He didn\u2019t even feel that much animosity when he saw his love rivals anymore. However, that definitely changed when Yu Kuang suddenly decided to barge into Long Heng\u2019s room. Or more accurately, Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s room. For better or worse, Long Heng was taking a bath when he barged in.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

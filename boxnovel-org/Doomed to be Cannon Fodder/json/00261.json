I will tell mother. All you need to do now is focus on being a good princess consort.\u201d Long Heng left for the old madame\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was rather straightforward with his mother. In short, he told her that he wanted to be loyal to Bai Xiangxiu, and explained just how important she was to him. After that, he began talking about the evil he\u2019d seen in women when he\u2019d met them on the battlefield and how Bai Xiangxiu was the only woman he\u2019d ever trust with his own life. He even told her that he believed Bai Xiangxiu was good at bearing children. There was no need to worry about a lack of children.</p><br/><p>The old madame was also quite surprised. This couple had always been different from others in the sense that they were always together. For all she knew, they might really give her a new grandchild soon. If she were to insist on a concubine now, wouldn\u2019t it be a pity if Bai Xiangxiu miscarried due to sadness? Fine, I\u2019ll let them do as they please. I already have a grandson anyways. If Heng\u2019er doesn\u2019t want to have a concubine, insisting on getting him one will just cause him to neglect the woman. Eventually she\u2019d be thrown out of the house. Come to think of it, he really didn\u2019t touch any of the other three concubines in the past either.</p><br/><p>The old madame waved her hand. \u201cYou can go. I\u2019ll let you two make the final decision on these matters in the future. Bai Xiangxiu might not have a good background, but I won\u2019t look down on her. She\u2019s helped you so much after all. However, you should really minimize contact with the Bai family. They do seem like troublemakers, even putting aside the fact that your cousin was also in the wrong today. I\u2019ll send her back after the ceremony and have her parents finalize her marriage to someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d Long Heng rose to his feet and was just about to leave when he was interrupted by the presence of his cousin, crying at the doorway. This girl had always been scared of Long Heng, but had also always liked him as well. She was fine with being his concubine, even though she\u2019d always dreamt of being his main wife. Unfortunately, he\u2019d rather allow a concubine to become his main wife than take her as one, and was now even refusing to marry her.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, why have you never even looked at me once, even though I\u2019ve waited so long for you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can an unwedded lady possibly know so little of shame\u2026\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t even hesitate a moment before leaving, thoroughly breaking the girl\u2019s heart. She reached out to try and grab onto his sleeves, but how could she possibly be quicker than a martial arts expert? Sadly, the old madame saw everything, and her brows drew together. She had known that this cousin was a little wilful, but she\u2019d never imagined that she\u2019d be this shameless too. While it was true that the old madame was trying to add the cousin to the family, seeing her trying to seduce her son was a whole \u2018nother thing.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu seducing her son was fine, since it coincided with the old madame\u2019s wishes anyway. The old madame was more than happy to see their relationship develop to what it was now. However, things were different when other women were trying to seduce her son. The old madame decided to reprimand Yu Xiaoshu a little, to which Yu Xiaoshu responded by running out in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld madame, this old servant will have someone chase after her and drag her back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Let her realize her misdeeds on her own. A lady such as her actually tried to grab a man by the sleeves? So disgraceful! It would be better if she forgets about all this after doing such a thing. Heng\u2019er hates women like that the most. Sigh\u2026\u201d I only wanted to cement ties between our families. It seems like that is no longer possible.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the old madame never imagined the depths of Yu Xiaoshu\u2019s boldness and shamelessness. She immediately ran over to Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s residence to cause trouble after she left the old madame\u2019s residence, all because she thought Bai Xiangxiu was the reason why Long Heng no longer wanted to be with her.</p><br/><p>Long Heng was settling some matters in the study, giving Bai Xiangxiu the opportunity to get ample rest. Unfortunately, this left the door open for Yu Xiaoshu to barge into her room. As for Bai Xiangxiu, she actually wasn\u2019t resting. After all, she hadn\u2019t really fainted. She was watering Huo\u2019er and the black devil\u2019s snare. These two plants were her babies, precious things that she would never throw away even at the cost of her life.</p><br/><p>Long Heng thought that one was too miraculous, while the other was far too dangerous. However, Bai Xiangxiu refused to place them anywhere else. They were placed in a specially prepared room that was very well ventilated. Theoretically, this would prevent others from getting poisoned or hallucinating. Because Huo\u2019er was getting bigger, Bai Xiangxiu was trying to convince it to agree to a pruning. There was now three branches on its stem and another starting to make an appearance on the side. After Huo\u2019er agreed, she began to assess which clipping to make, but was promptly disrupted by Yu Xiaoshu\u2019s appearance and the resulting slap to Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Slap! Yu Xiaoshu hadn\u2019t gone easy at all, likely because she was much too enraged.</p><br/><p>Has this girl gone mental? Why is she so impulsive today when she could keep her cool in the past? Bai Xiangxiu held a hand to her face while looking very confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bitch! It\u2019s all your fault that cousin made up his mind not to marry me! I\u2026 I will never get to see him again in the future! It\u2019s all your fault!\u201d Yu Xiaoshu dropped to the floor in a heap and began bawling her eyes out, as though she was the one who\u2019d just been slapped.</p><br/><p>The edge of Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s mouth began twitching. Thinking of the old madame and how she might dislike a strong backlash, Bai Xiangxiu decided not to confront her head on. She decided to give the old madame some face and also make her feel like she owed Bai Xiangxiu one. And thus, Bai Xiangxiu put on her own show by acting all surprised. When Xiaoshi rushed over to inquire about her injuries, tears began to flow down her cheeks as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-mama, go to the old madame\u2019s residence and inform her about what just happened here. Tell her to send someone to send the lady cousin home. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d If she likes to cry so much then let us all cry together! Bai Xiangxiu dramatically collapsed into a chair and began to bawl her eyes out as well.</p><br/><p>Long Heng immediately came when he heard about the commotion, but was caught off guard by the sudden explosion of crying. It\u2019d be more trouble than what it was worth to drag Yu Xiaoshu away now. He might as well wait for the old madame\u2019s men to arrive. However, it was at this moment that Yu Xiaoshu\u2019s expressions suddenly changed. In truth, she seemed a little inebriated and out of sorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin! You\u2019ve come! You\u2019ve finally come to welcome me! Let us get married! I can marry you right here and now!\u201d Yu Xiaoshu suddenly seemed incredibly happy, and was even being a little bashful.</p><br/><p>Long Heng took an involuntary step back. The situation seemed a little suspicious. Bai Xiangxiu wasn\u2019t crying anymore either. Yu Xiaoshu\u2019s previous reaction could still be considered normal and was probably due to extreme grief. However, this lady was now acting completely insane. Some wire had definitely shorted out in her brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Long Heng\u2019s blood began to boil when he saw Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s swollen face. He immediately yelled, \u201cYu Xiaoshu! Get out from my sight! Don\u2019t ever set foot in my manor again!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Yu Xiaoshu only reacted with a playful laugh. She began to tug on her clothes as she giggled. \u201cCousin! Let us head to the bridal chambers! I will give my body to you, and only to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfff! Bai Xiangxiu nearly vomited blood. Face turning ashen, she immediately turned around and left. Yu Xiaoshu was being too strange. She couldn\u2019t stand looking at her anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the lady cousin out,\u201d Long Heng ordered Xiaoshi.</p><br/><p>Xiaoshi nodded. She was also drenched in cold sweat. Has Yu Xiaoshu gone crazy over men?</p><br/><p>Yu Xiaoshu began to wobble on her feet as they all started to leave the room. She massaged her temples as she asked, \u201cWhat happened? Bai Xiangxiu! I will never forgive you!\u2026 C-cousin? W-what are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Heng now looked angrier than ever before and spoke to one of the old servants beside him. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen and heard everything Yu Xiaoshu did just now, right? You can describe everything to the old madame when she comes by. Don\u2019t miss a word.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

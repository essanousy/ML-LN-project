When had she become so weak that she couldn\u2019t even take a little hit? She\u2019d only been rejected. Couldn\u2019t she have just dealt with it by eating and drinking more? As a modern woman, she had obviously gone through a breakup before! </p><br/><p>After she calmed her emotional self, she took the bowl of medicine from Xiao Shi and gulped it down in sorrow. The moment she lifted her head, she noticed the male lead sitting on a chair in her room. His hair was undone and he only had an undercoat draped over his shoulders.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck? Is he trying to tease me? She ended up spitting out the medicine that hadn\u2019t been swallowed yet. Then, she coughed so vigorously that tears and medicine all came out. Long Heng crinkled his brows but didn\u2019t move. All he did was say, \u201cWhat are you doing? Get water.\u201d Xiao Shi rushed to bring water over after he gave his command.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu drank it all in one go. She felt like she had just came back to life. She took the handkerchief from Xiao Shi and wiped her mouth. Then, she struggled to straighten her clothes as she weakly said, \u201cY-your Highness\u2026\u201d She was about to get off the bed to greet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re excused. You\u2019ve just woken up. I don\u2019t want you to over exhaust yourself again.\u201d Long Heng didn\u2019t expect her to be so frightened by his presence. He didn\u2019t dare to move until after she had calmed down. Then, he went to her bedside and asked, \u201cAre you feeling a bit better?\u201d </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t really adapt to the situation. Long Heng\u2019s loose hair and clothes meant for lounging at home gave him an otherworldly beauty. His peach blossom eyes appeared less icy. Could this mean he had remained in Winter Garden all along while she was unconscious? How is that possible? Yet, the truth was in front of her. To her surprise, he said, \u201cSince you\u2019re awake, eat. Prepare the food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Shi anxiously rushed out to give orders. As for Bai Xiangxiu, she snapped out of her startled state and trembled a little, \u201cY-your Highness, you\u2026..you haven\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Mother was worried you were overly exhausted. She specifically told me to remain here to watch you. If anything happened, I would have called the imperial physician.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he implying that he\u2019d been here the entire night? Bai Xiangxiu knew Winter Garden wasn\u2019t very big. The only room that could host a guest was the room beside hers. But the bed was small. He was so big, how could he have slept in it?</p><br/><p>At the same time, she thought about how much the old madame cared about her. She should try to create a closer relationship with her. Perhaps then, she could last until next year and not die. Or maybe, she would be able to return back to the modern world by next year.</p><br/><p>But right now, she had to deal with the person who was in front of her. Honestly, the prince was a pretty decent man. He wasn\u2019t extremely cold towards her. Perhaps he was a good thigh to hug? However, her status was special. If she wanted to hug his leg, she would have to have sex with him or something. </p><br/><p>As a woman with a normal view of the world, values, and life, she believed sex should come after love and marriage. It was a bit unacceptable for her if she had sex before love and marriage. Plus, she had just gone through a heartbreak. There was no way she could immediately accept another man. </p><br/><p>It was true. Although she was just trying to seduce the second male lead, but who wouldn\u2019t fall for such a gentle and good looking man? She hadn\u2019t chosen him for no reason. Whether it was reading the novel or their first real life encounter, Bai Xiangxiu had had a good impression Song Jiaoyue. But the sad reality was that she had been rejected. </p><br/><p>He\u2019d made a clear statement when he returned the snacks without any filling on the inside. It meant that although she had the heart to start something with him, he didn\u2019t return her feelings. The two of them were impossible. Since he didn\u2019t want to be with her, there was no point of insisting. Yet, her heart couldn\u2019t help but ache. Originally, she would have commemorated this inconceivable relationship after she woke up. But since Prince Li was here, his presence didn\u2019t allow her to think about anything else.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t eat together. She ate while sitting on the bed while he ate at the table. The food was nicely set up in front of her from the main table onto the small table next to her. She wasn\u2019t far from Long Heng. They were close enough that they could see each other\u2019s facial expressions. Although they didn\u2019t talk, the atmosphere was extremely strange.</p><br/><p>For reasons unknown, Bai Xiangxiu kept feeling that she was being secretly watched. But whenever she looked up, she sees Prince Li eating very properly. Am I imagining things? No. My intuition is very good, ok? What kind of man was Prince Li? He wasn\u2019t into her type of beauty. His type was the female lead! She was gutsy, conscientious, and harmlessly cute as a white lotus flower. </p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sweating. The man is sweating. The air is no good\u2026.\u201d Huo\u2019er suddenly spoke up. It didn\u2019t seem to like the smell of sweat.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu almost choked and coughed out loud. The temperature of the room wasn\u2019t very high. Why was Prince Li sweating? She secretly took a peek at him and noticed his cheeks were a bit flushed. However, he didn\u2019t appear to be sweating. </p><br/><p>Assuming Huo\u2019er was making things up, she glared at it. But Huo\u2019er was persistent in its words, \u201cHe is sweating! And his heartbeat is very fast. Huo\u2019er can feel it!\u201d Since Long Heng wasn\u2019t sitting too far from Huo\u2019er, it was normal for him to be able to sense it. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Men tend to sweat a lot. It was normal. Perhaps he ate a spicy dish or something. There were spicy dishes on the table, but they didn\u2019t look that spicy. Maybe Long Heng wasn\u2019t used to it? Or he might be sensitive to spices? She noted this in her heart and decided she needed to know what she had to do in order to please this superior. After all, she didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for herself.</p><br/><p>Little did she know that Long Heng wasn\u2019t affected by the spices. He was sweating like crazy because he was nervous. His back was almost entirely soaked. </p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu was sitting on the opposite side from him. Her lapel was open and the string that was holding up her verdant undergarment was extremely evident. In addition, her skin was as pure and white as jade, and from time to time, her eyes would drift to him. All of this was enough to cause his heart to flare with emotion and made it impossible for him to calmly eat his meal. </p><br/><p>He\u2019d been quite calm originally when she was unconscious. But the moment she opened his eyes, he felt like he couldn\u2019t stay here anymore. There was no way he could peacefully sleep outside. So after dinner, he quickly changed his clothes and left. He was much calmer after taking a shower, but still concerned about Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s health. He ordered another physician to go check on her and only felt relieved after the physician told him she was fine. </p><br/><p>He went to see her again afterwards. But somehow, he couldn\u2019t remain calm around her. So after sitting for a little bit, he would leave again. Yet, he\u2019d want to see her again in less than an hour. This extraordinary feeling was tormenting him. So, he ended up asking Song Jiaoyue to go hunting with him earlier. Maybe being away for a few days would help. </p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiangxiu, she was feeling much better. So she brought Xiao Shi with her to call upon the old madame. After the old madame inquired about her health, she personally chose another three maids for her. The names were Biaoyue, Biaoqin, and Biaoyu.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t considered young anymore, and the old madame had personally trained them. In the future, they would be helping Bai Xiangxiu manage the affairs around the household. At the same time, she could tell her son was falling for Bai Xiangxiu. He seemed to be sleeping at her place these days. But from what she heard, he was probably concerned about her injuries. Therefore, he was holding back because he wasn\u2019t sure if she could handle him.</p><br/><p>As his mother, she knew her son well. Since he was into Bai Xiangxiu, it meant that he probably wouldn\u2019t be giving any of his other mistresses any attention. So now, she was placing all her hopes on Bai Xiangxiu.</p><br/><p>So today, the old madame asked her about her injuries and summoned a knowledgeable old female servant to look over her. The mama said Bai Xiangxiu was healing quite well, and although it would scar, it wouldn\u2019t be too hideous to look at.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

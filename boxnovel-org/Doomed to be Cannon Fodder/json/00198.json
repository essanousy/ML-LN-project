After all, she\u2019d seen how men fought in this world. She knew very well that the two men outside were not there just for show. The bandits were doomed from the start. However, Bai Xiangxiu couldn\u2019t resist furrowing her brows when she drew the curtains aside to take a small glance outside. Are they supposed to be bandits or refugees? They\u2019re just armed with farming tools like hoes and sickles. Moreover, their clothes are all tattered and in awful condition. They look so pitiful. </p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue, who like Bai Xiangxiu, was used to the wealth and prosperity of the capital doubtfully asked. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 bandits?\u201d</p><br/><p>These bandits simply looked too miserable. Had they been normal looking bandits, he would\u2019ve beaten them up already. But he just couldn\u2019t lay his hands on people who looked this pitiful. Yu Kuang however, understood the hardships faced by the citizens. He only said, \u201cRun along if you still want your lives. Don\u2019t throw your lives away for something as insignificant as money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandits didn\u2019t part ranks. It was quite rare for a carriage to head towards the border. Moreover, this particular carriage seemed to be filled with wealth. Without any more useless talking, they swarmed forward in an attack.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue and Yu Kuang were troubled by their actions. They wouldn\u2019t have felt so distressed if the attackers were martial arts experts, but many of the bandits were people without the slightest skill in martial arts. Fortunately, there were some that knew a thing or two about martial arts. So, Song Jiaoyue and Yu Kuang attacked them instead.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of the chaos or because of the weapons that were flying everywhere, the horses were badly spooked. They broke into a mad gallop out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Yu Se screamed shrilly. The cat was now out of the bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman! Stop the horses. Quickly! The bandits went crazy when they heard a woman\u2019s voice. They immediately set their sights on the women and ignored the money. Song Jiaoyue was drenched in cold sweat. Are these men that crazy for women? It will be bad if Bai Xiangxiu and the other two were to fall into their hands.</p><br/><p>Because they were deep in the jungle, the roads were bumpy and uneven which caused Bai Xiangxiu to be thrown off the carriage halfway during the mad gallop. Fortunately, she landed onto a patch of barren grassland, so she didn\u2019t sustain any heavy injuries. However, she hit the ground with enough force that she was stunned from the fall. Afraid that she might\u2019ve injured herself, she wriggled her hands and legs around in hopes that she didn\u2019t break anything. It was at this moment when she heard footsteps heading in her direction. She discarded any plans to move, let alone get up. She remained in a collapsed heap without moving an inch. </p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Do you think that it\u2019s a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s wearing male clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that waist! Only a woman could have a waist like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she die from her fall?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be bad. Such a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo take a look. For all we know, we might still be able to use her.\u201d</p><br/><p>You must be kidding me! I\u2019ll smash your head in if you dare come near me! Bai Xiangxiu hardened her heart. She stealthily wrapped her hand around a thick tree branch and prepared to hit anyone who would approach her.</p><br/><p>In a few moments, someone really did approach her, trying to turn her over. Bai Xiangxiu grabbed this chance to quickly leap up and strike the bandit with the stick. \u201cYou stupid hooligan! I\u2019m gonna beat you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang! She struck the man on his shoulder. It didn\u2019t injure him since he was used to manual labour, but it was enough to cause him a great deal of pain. So much so, in fact, that beads of cold sweat began to drip from his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment! Miss!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had already lifted her makeshift club to give him some more blows. He was so frightened by her that he curled up into a ball to protect himself. He was screaming on the inside. Women are so scary! I\u2019m never going to marry! </p><br/><p>Noticing that his friend was about to be beaten to death, the other man quickly intervened by moving two steps closer to say, \u201cMiss. Please stay your hand. We are not here with evil intentio\u2026 W-wait! Why are you beating me up too!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? You filthy, good-for-nothing bandits! I\u2019m gonna beat you all to death!\u201d Bai Xiangxiu had worked herself into a frenzy. She was giving a fierce beating to anyone and everyone who tried to approach her. </p><br/><p>The two bandits were badly frightened. They\u2019ve never seen such a fierce lady in their life. Weren\u2019t women from respectable families supposed to be weak? Weren\u2019t they so fragile that they could be defeated with just a finger? Why is this lady as fierce as a tiger? Even though she was extremely beautiful, there wasn\u2019t any hesitation when she picked up the stick. Had they not decided to run away, she just might\u2019ve beaten them to death. </p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue and Yu Kuang had quickly finished off their opponents and came to the rescue, but were presented with a particularly strange scene instead. They\u2019d stopped the carriage and brought the other two women in tow to search for Bai Xiangxiu. But upon finding her, they only saw Bai Xiangxiu chasing after the bandits and beating the hell out of them with a stick.</p><br/><p>The two bandits had lumps all over their heads and were cowering from her endless beatings. They screamed for mercy as they ran away. It was almost like a string had snapped in the back of Song Jiaoyue\u2019s mind. It was his first time seeing Bai Xiangxiu like that. This wasn\u2019t the gentle and feeble Bai Xiangxiu that he was familiar with. No. She was practically a female tiger at this point.</p><br/><p>It was one against two, but the two young men were the ones running with their tails between their legs instead. Even though the two young men didn\u2019t have any intention to harm her, they didn\u2019t have the ability to stop her from beating them or to wrest the stick from her hands.</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang was calm. After all, Bai Xiangxiu had never once acted all weak and feeble in front of him. The two women at the back were completely and utterly flabbergasted. They quietly hugged each other.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiangxiu\u2019s current form was incredibly frightening. Xiaohuan was first to snap back to reality and said something while trembling. \u201cMadame Xiu had the same expression on her face when she saved me from the fire.\u201d She began to reminisce about the past once she was done speaking. A look of great respect slowly emerged on her face. Her mistress had become a genuine heroine in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop staring! We have people to save!\u201d Yu Kuang had already taken his first step forward, but he hesitated when he heard what Xiaohuan had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave who? The bandits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Kuang turned his head and frowned. Did she think that he was stupid or something? Why would he save the bandits? But upon further thought, he realized that he really would be saving the bandits if he intervened.</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue was still entranced. Yu Se called out to him softly. \u201cYoung Master\u2026 Young Master\u2026Young Master!\u201d It seems like this was a rather big blow to him. She decided to keep silent. After all, it\u2019d be very good if Sir Song were to lose interest in Bai Xiangxiu because of this. But for some reason, Yu Se felt that the current Bai Xiangxiu was kind of cute in her own way too.</p><br/><p>Noticing that running did not seem to save them from their current predicament, the bandits suddenly dropped to the floor and knelt down to her. They begged for mercy while cowering. \u201cMiss\u2026 No. My queen! Please have mercy! We really didn\u2019t have any intentions to hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo intentions to hurt me? Then what were you trying to imply when you said that you could still use me even though I had fainted? Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Jiaoyue\u2019s mouth twitched. Her expressions. Her attitude. Isn\u2019t she mimicking Long Heng? However, she truly does look very attractive when she tries to mimic him in such a situation. Is this\u2026 an example of a married couple resembling each other? Such thoughts caused a painful twinge to run through Song Jiaoyue, which caused him to smile bitterly.</p><br/><p>The two bandits didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with their use of words. \u201cYeah! It\u2019s true that we needed a woman to\u2026 Ahh!\u201d Bandit A was struck hard by a stick. It hurt so much that he didn\u2019t dare to utter another word.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe actually wanted to beseech this lady\u2019s help with something.\u201d Bandit B had finally grown a brain for once.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp? With what?\u201d Bai Xiangxiu was exhausted as well. She clutched the stick tightly with her hands. Any sudden movements and she\u2019d give them another round of beatings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

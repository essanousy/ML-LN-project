I originally didn\u2019t dare be certain either, but resurrecting Xiao Wu has let me realize a lot of the mysteries of spirit cultivation, and even spirit beast cultivation. If I\u2019m not mistaken, dad, in the years you\u2019ve kept mom company, you\u2019ve definitely eaten a lot of medicinal ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cThose were all found for me by your mother, with the effect of banking up my fundamentals. Adding in that my physical condition was originally quite good, even the injuries from severing an arm and a leg have already completely healed, and my spirit power has returned to rank seventy nine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, in order to repay the sect, you severed to limbs, and released the sludge in your blood, and at the same time also returned those two spirit bones. Your spirit power was also forcibly reduced by twenty ranks due to losing the spirit bones. But in fact, you still have your ninth spirit ring, just that you can\u2019t use your last two spirit rings due to the lack of spirit power to support them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But, can severed limbs even be restored?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said confidently:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? The Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone ability mom gave me, Wildifre Burns Without End, The Spring Wind Breathes New Life, even though it can\u2019t bring the dead to life or grow flesh from just bone, it\u2019s still enough to regrow severed limbs. After my spirit power reached rank ninety, this spirit bone ability can be fully used. With my mental strength, it\u2019s completely possible to not just use this ability on myself, but also on others. As long as we bring back those two spirit bones you contracted with, I\u2019m at least eighty percent sure I can regrow your limbs. At that time, with an intact body, you can recover to your peak before long through cultivation. After all, even though a portion of your spirit power is lost, the painstaking cultivation back then wouldn\u2019t be wasted. After your limbs are restored and meridians whole, I think, within one year, you could still be the Clear Sky Douluo who made Spirit Hall lose their gall at the sound of the wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s words undoubtedly lit a flame of hope in Tang Hao\u2019s heart, but his shiny gaze very soon dulled. Shaking his head, he sighed:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, did you forget? I returned those two spirit bones to atone for my sins. Putting aside that it would be impossible for the sect to return them to me, even you can\u2019t gain their true approval right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San gave a cold snort,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, back then when you killed the Spirit Hall people to save mother, did you do anything wrong? That tragedy was because they coveted mother\u2019s spirit ring. Spirit Hall then took their anger out on you, but the sect not only didn\u2019t come to your aid, instead gutlessly choosing to retreat. Who was right and wrong? I\u2019m a junior, I can\u2019t criticize grandfather\u2019s decision. Only, can our Clear Sky School really escape calamity by blindly withdrawing? I\u2019ve never thought you did anything wrong back then. If those sect elders won\u2019t give us their approval, then I\u2019ll just beat it out of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Always in the past, due to his father\u2019s matters and his own encounter with the Clear Sky School, Tang San had never had any good impression of them. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have established the Tang Sect alone. When faced with difficulties, the Clear Sky School not only didn\u2019t protect their own, but on the contrary chose to retreat far away, separating from the spirit master world, leading to the tragedy of the four single attribute clans and the Clear Sky School being stricken from the list of the seven great sects, only able to stand on their lonely mountaintop.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t have enough strength before, and could only endure. But now he had already become a Title Douluo, and also grasped a divine tool like the Seagod Trident. He\u2019d already endured long enough. Those two spirit bones should belong to his father, and his father should at least be an elder within the sect. What his father had lost, he had to return for him.</p><br/><p>Seeing his son radiate aggressiveness, though Tang Hao\u2019s face was calm, the gratitude in his eyes was clear to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re becoming more and more like me back then. Only, back then I was just impulsive, while you\u2019ve been clever since you were a child. But, little San, whether me or you, we\u2019re both born of the Clear Sky School, our Clear Sky Hammers are inherited from the sect, no matter when, we absolutely can\u2019t betray the sect. This is the bottom line, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San watched his father with a burning gaze, his eyes expressing respect,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I understand your meaning. I\u2019m not talking about betraying the sect, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to see that. Therefore, I will accompany you to return justly and fairly, and have every person in the sect acknowledge your position. Look, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San\u2019s palm brushed the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, and in his palm appeared a small golden hammer, a black gem inlaid on either end.</p><br/><p>Seeing this hammer, Tang Hao couldn\u2019t keep his eyes from shining, suddenly growing excited, he suddenly grabbed the hammer from Tang San\u2019s hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, hurry up and tell me, where did you get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat grandfather gave it to me. Great grandfather not only gave me this token, but at the same time also the authority that comes with it. I told great grandfather about everything that\u2019s happened in detail, and great grandfather didn\u2019t blame you, even he said you were right. What did you do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather really didn\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao asked in a trembling voice. This kind of iron man\u2019s mood surged to rapidly, clearly showing how important he regarded the sect.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded firmly,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, great grandfather said it himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao tightly held that golden hammer, his eyes suddenly shining with unprecedented light. He roared towards the sky, the intensity making even Tang San take a step back. This roar seemed to contain all the resentment held in Tang Hao\u2019s heart. Tang San saw correctly. Ah Yin was undoubtedly number one in Tang Hao\u2019s heart, but, his loyalty to the sect that had raised him from childhood and given him the name Clear Sky had never waned. The previous sect master was his father, and whether his father had done right or wrong, Tang Hao had never returned to argue it. But at this moment, the strongest of the Clear Sky School, his grandfather had confirmed he didn\u2019t make a mistake. To Tang Hao, this approval was even more important than the return of his strength.</p><br/><p>Back then he had become dispirited, but now listening to Tang San, the flames of hope reignited within him. He seemed to again see those glories when he represented the Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, once I\u2019ve helped mom recover her human form, we\u2019ll return to the Clear Sky School. To get everything you deserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao returned to his senses, returning that golden little hammer back to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the authority your great grandfather gave you, you have to care for it well. Little San, you\u2019re really sure you can restore your mom\u2019s shape? There\u2019s absolutely no danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, even if I\u2019m not absolutely sure of success, my methods will be beneficial to mom. Even if I can\u2019t restore mom right now, I can definitely enormously cut down the time required.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole time listening silently to her husband and son, Ah Yin spoke up.</p><br/><p>Illusory light sparkled, her beautiful face filled with motherly tenderness,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can help me recover, but, mom has a request. When you help me recover, there absolutely can\u2019t be any harm to you. Otherwise, I\u2019d prefer to continue like this forever. While your father has kept me company here these years, he has told me everything about how you\u2019ve grown up. You are a good sensible child. Did you know, both your father and me feel that we deeply owe you. We brought you into this world, but we\u2019ve never fulfilled our duties as parents. You didn\u2019t even have a happy childhood. Mom is already very sorry. If you let yourself be harmed when helping me, mom would never be able to forgive myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. mom, don\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San fell to his knees in front of his mother,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, when I was small, I was envious when I saw the other children who had mothers. I thirsted for your love. But it\u2019s not your fault you couldn\u2019t be with me and dad! Parents never owe their children, no matter when or how. That you brought me into this world is already the biggest, biggest favor, one I\u2019ll never be able to repay in my life. Without you, there would be no me. My life was given by you. There are no other debts beside that. Mom, don\u2019t worry. Helping you recover won\u2019t harm me. I still have to properly show my filial respect to you both afterwards. And I still have Xiao Wu to take care of. How could I not treasure myself? Our family can finally be happy together. I don\u2019t want to put a time limit on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, Ah Yin really want to cry, but she couldn\u2019t produce tears yet. Tang Hao helped Tang San up,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, you\u2019ll make us hurt even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, raising his head to look at his mother,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll begin now. Mom, you just have to open your mind wide, sense the energy I transmit to you and blend it with all the energy around you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he spoke, blue golden light flashed. Tang San released his Blue Silver Emperor, and at the same time also released his Blue Silver Domain.</p><br/><p>The blood red seventh spirit ring flashed. To be precise, this was now the second of Tang San\u2019s currently four spirit rings. The golden blue color spread all over his body, and Tang San entered his spirit avatar state. In that instant, under the effect of the Blue Silver Avatar, the Blue Silver Domain expanded exponentially, quickly spreading out and enveloping his parents and Xiao Wu, enveloping the entire Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well basin, then crossing the mountain walls, spreading out into the Sunset Forest beyond.</p><br/><p>On his forehead, the Seagod trident brand flashed, his boundless mental strength completely blending into the Blue Silver Domain, strand after strand of golden blue Blue Silver Emperor issuing from Tang San and quietly twisting around Ah Yin\u2019s leaves. Each of Ah Yin\u2019s broad leaves was tightly wound around by one of Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor.</p><br/><p>Tang San flew up, hovering just above his mother, the strands of Blue Silver Emperor like a bridge connecting the two of them together.</p><br/><p>Ah Yin softly cried out:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, your Blue Silver Domain is already at the peak level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded lightly in the air,</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, pay attention to absorbing the energy I send you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blue Silver Domain suddenly changed, the previous golden blue suddenly turning completely ocean blue. In just this instant, the parts of the Sunset Forest enveloped by the Blue Silver Domain had turned into a blue ocean.</p><br/><p>Within the forest, each blue silver grass gently swayed along with a special rhythm, scattering faint traces of gentle golden light that merged into that blue world, and then gathered towards the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well at the heart of the forest. To be precise, it condensed towards the emperor of this blue silver world, Tang San.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Domain, final evolved ability, All River Run Into The Sea, launched.</p><br/><p>Along with his strength rising to the Title Douluo level, Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Domain had also evolved once again. If the spirit avatar was where a domain displayed its true strength, then, the strength of Title Douluo was the essential factor for a domain to reveal its highest level.</p><br/><p>Rich blue light gently poured into Ah Yin through where the Blue Silver Emperor connected her with Tang San. After passing Tang San\u2019s gathering and filtering, this energy had already become the purest Blue Silver Emperor energy. Their similar blood let mother and son share energy without any obstruction.</p><br/><p>The Blue Silver Domain\u2019s All Rivers Run Into The Sea, effects: anywhere with blue silver grass, the domain can change the vitality of the blue silver grass into any form of energy the Blue Silver Emperor requires, and add it to oneself. As long as there is still blue silver grass, the Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s energy will never wane. This energy can change into vitality, but also spirit power or mental power. This ultimate domain effect can undoubtedly place the Blue Silver Emperor in an invincible position when fighting opponents of equal level in a forest.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, Tang San was drawing support from this ability to transform the energy of all the blue silver grass in the forest into Blue Silver Emperor energy, then using himself as intermediary to transfer it to his mother, raising her cultivation.</p><br/><p>Such a method could also only be used between mother and son, and also required Tang San to take the leading position, unless Ah Yin\u2019s strength one day surpassed his.</p><br/><p>In the Sunset Forest, all the spirit beasts restlessly hid in their nests, the infinite energy waves making them not dare move. With the enormous energy spreading through the entire forest, the lowest level blue silver grass for the first time became the masters of the great forest. Summoned by the Blue Silver Emperor, they released the breath of their life without reservation.</p><br/><p>Nourished by that blue light, Ah Yin\u2019s body grew exponentially. Each leaf began to grow as transparent as sapphire, the golden veins on top also becoming increasingly large. She could clearly feel her cultivation grow at an unprecedented rate.</p><br/><p>Ah Yin originally had a hundred thousand years of experience with cultivating, and naturally knew what to do with this perfectly suitable energy, and could also do it appropriately. Only, her heart was somewhat restless.</p><br/><p>She of course understood the Blue Silver Domain\u2019s All Rivers Run Into The Sea ability, she had possessed it herself back before she decided to take human form. She absolutely didn\u2019t want to see her people consume too much of their vitality in order to resurrect her. But the leader was Tang San, she could only passively accept it, and she was even more unwilling to harm her son\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Tang San seemed to understand his mother\u2019s heart. What he did next let Ah Yin put her heart at rest.</p><br/><p>His right hand moved. That dark Seagod Trident stabbed into the earth fell into Tang San\u2019s palm, the Seagod\u2019s Light once again becoming the bridge between Tang San and this golden trident. Dazzling golden light rose towards the sky, the divine aura representing the Seagod\u2019s strength spreading out along with the Blue Silver Domain. Like a vast ocean restoring life to all living things spread to each corner of the Blue Silver Domain, enveloping the entire Sunset Forest. The vitality of the blue silver grass already withering from releasing too much of their life force was reignited within the Seagod\u2019s power assigned to the Seagod Trident. And Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Domain had now become completely golden. To be precise, what he used now should be called the Seagod Blue Silver Domain.</p><br/><p>A domain like this might not have any true use in battle, but it had enormous benefits to the blue silver grass that absorbed the energy.</p><br/><p>The Seagod\u2019s Light alone could swiftly recover Ah Yin\u2019s cultivation, let alone when it was conducted into the Blue Silver Emperor energy like this. This was also Tang San\u2019s trump card for resurrecting his mother. It was because of the existence of the Seagod Trident that he didn\u2019t need to worry about the Blue Silver Domain\u2019s All Rivers Run Into The Sea harming the blue silver grass here. It was also just because of the Seagod\u2019s divine power that he was even more certain of being able to help his mother recover her human form.</p><br/><p>Sensing the effect the Seagod\u2019s Light had on all the blue silver grass, Ah Yin was relieved, and put all her heart and all her mind into absorbing the pure energy her son passed to her.</p><br/><p>The Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well basin wa originally a place that gathered the spiritual influence of heaven and earth. Ah Yin had been nourished here for five years, and her root as Blue Silver Emperor had already reawakened. The major difference between plant type spirit beasts and animal spirit beasts was vitality. Even forest kings as strong as Da Ming and Er Ming couldn\u2019t compare to the Blue Silver Emperor in vitality. This was also how Ah Yin could leave behind a seed after sacrificing herself, while Xiao Wu, Da Ming and Er Ming had immediately faced death.</p><br/><p>Tang San using his own blood to draw out his mother\u2019s roots here back then and an important effect on Ah Yin\u2019s rebirth. Just because he had taken the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Delicate Apricot, his blood had brought Ah Yin the greatest benefits by the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, and she could absorb the spiritual influence of heaven and earth released by the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well without worrying. Even without Tang San\u2019s present help, she could have returned to her previous condition within a hundred years. Now with Tang San drawing in all the blue silver grass energy in the Sunset Forest enormously accelerated her recovery.</p><br/><p>In fact, what Tang San did now was equivalent to Tang San pouring the cultivation of all the blue silver grass in the Sunset Forest into his mother\u2019s body. And he didn\u2019t want to kill the chicken for the eggs either. His Blue Silver Domain cooperated with the Seagod\u2019s Light, enormously increasing the cultivation of each blue silver grass in the forest. And what Tang San absorbed from them was just a portion of their cultivation.</p><br/><p>The cultivation of a single blue silver grass of course didn\u2019t count as anything, but the cultivation of ten million blue silver grass added together was vast.</p><br/><p>Ah Yin grew with a speed distinguishable to the naked eye. Soon, the enormous leaves had grown to encompass every part of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well basin. Tang San also constantly released strand after strand of Blue Silver Emperor to connect with it.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao and Xiao Wu watched nervously from the side. They could both sense Ah Yin\u2019s energy swiftly rising, and Tang Hao now also understood why his son could say with certainty that, even if he didn\u2019t succeed in resurrecting Ah Yin, all this would definitely only be beneficial to his mother. He drew this kind of blue silver grass energy into her body, increasing her cultivation, even if Ah Yin couldn\u2019t recover her human form, the recovery time would still be enormously curtailed.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s Seagod\u2019s Light held up for a full two hours. After the strength flagged and the blue light vanished, Tang San fell from the sky, sitting crosslegged next to his mother, directly entering cultivation. His mental strength was almost completely exhausted, but not yet overdrawn.</p><br/><p>Ah Yin had undergone enormous changes in these two hours. The Blue Silver Emperor main stem had grown by several dozen times, and each leaf spread through the valley. Along with Tang San entering cultivation, her aura also grew silent. Even though the energy she received didn\u2019t require any melding to become hers, she still had to adjust to her new state.</p><br/><p>In just a couple of hours, Ah Yin\u2019s cultivation had increased by more than twenty thousand years. The blue silver grass made up for quality with quantity, and Tang San\u2019s unprecedented hub like transmission, relying on the Blue Silver Domain\u2019s ultimate ability with the with the Seagod\u2019s divine power to condense the golden light, it had completely reached the effect Tang San wanted.</p><br/><p>Tang San used a full two days to recover his mental strength. Over the next ten days, he repeatedly used the same method four times to condense Blue Silver Emperor energy for his mother. With the help of the Seagod\u2019s Light, the blue silver grass in the Sunset Forest offered up inexhaustible energy. Until the Blue Silver Emperor energy Ah Yin had was completely equal to Tang San\u2019s level, and couldn\u2019t be transmitted any longer.</p><br/><p>After finishing the last energy transmission, Tang San once again entered cultivation. Right now Ah Yin had already undergone heaven and earth revolving changes. The enormous leaves no longer spread out, but were instead completely gathered together, each leaf not only possessing enormous Blue Silver Emperor energy, but also a portion of the aura of the Seagod\u2019s Light. The leaves had now turned completely golden, forming a ten meter wide cocoon. Piercing golden light flared, Ah Yin\u2019s body containing enormous energy fluctuations.</p><br/><p>Having experienced similar circumstances, Xiao Wu told Tang Hao that these were signs of a spirit beast reaching a hundred thousand years. When Ah Yin broke out of her cocoon, she would again have returned to the hundred thousand year level. At the same time, while in this cocoon formed from her own body and energy, she also had the chance to make a choice. Either become human, or stay as a formidable hundred thousand year spirit beast. There was no doubt as to how Ah Yin would choose. She had already experienced cultivating as a human, and even Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t tell what she would be like after breaking out. After all, it was the first time she had seen anyone like Ah Yin, who had twice cultivated to hundred thousand years.</p><br/><p>Tang San awakened from cultivation after two days. In these dozen days, he had constantly used up and restored his mental strength, and it felt as if his mental strength had become even a bit more solid.</p><br/><p>The golden cocoon still flashed with faint light, nobody knew how long this evolution would take. Tang Hao sat waiting in front of the cocoon, his eyes from time to time glistening with anxiety. Even though he\u2019d already waited for so long, and by all reason his wife should have a chance to very soon recover to her former state, the more this was the case, the more intense his impatience grew. Watching that golden cocoon, he couldn\u2019t wait to see his beloved wife again.</p><br/><p>As soon as Tang San opened his yes, he saw Xiao Wu sitting close by. Her big black eyes blinked and looked at him, her long eyelashes curling, her long hair falling down her shoulders to the ground, like a black waterfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu.\u201d</p><br/><p>If his parents hadn\u2019t been here, Tang San would have wanted to directly show his affection.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu happily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been almost a month since they came here. In the gaps between where Tang San helped his mother recover, he and Xiao Wu had buried Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s bodies on the other side of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well. Even though she knew it was impossible, Xiao Wu secretly still hoped the spiritual influence here could give the two forest kings a slim chance for resurrection.</p><br/><p>After talking to Tang San and his parents, Xiao Wu\u2019s mood was already much better. Even though the pain in her heart still remained, she didn\u2019t want Tang San to see her unhappy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu cutely jumped into Tang San\u2019s arms, her long black hair hiding the two like a veil. Xiao Wu softly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, do you know when mom can wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven you don\u2019t know, and I know even less. But since there\u2019s enough energy and mom has already experienced breaking through a hundred thousand years, it shouldn\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, let\u2019s go for a walk, ok? There\u2019s a lot of spirit beasts in this Sunset Forest, maybe we can find some that suits you. Your Blue Silver Emperor really is bald and ugly with four spirit rings left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, I still haven\u2019t asked you. What level is your spirit power now? Even though your body and soul were separated these past years, you did still take two great immortal grade herbs. Especially that Yearning Heartbroken Red was enormously effective. Even if your cultivation isn\u2019t more than mine, relying on this immortal herb your physical toughness isn\u2019t less than mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what rank my spirit power is either, I\u2019m at a bottleneck right now, the seventieth rank bottleneck. When I went from hundred thousand year spirit beast cultivation to human, the first six spirit rings didn\u2019t require hunting spirit beasts, but by the seventieth rank I really am human. And with the effect of those two immortal grade herbs, I\u2019ve become human a bit early. Now I also need to hunt spirit beasts for spirit rings. I feel like my spirit power shouldn\u2019t stop at rank seventy, but I can\u2019t tell how much more either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San pulled Xiao Wu up, skilfully pulling out a sandalwood comb from his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, speaking to her while combing her jet black hair:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go strolling in the Sunset Forest. With your current physical condition, absorbing a hundred thousand year spirit ring might be a bit dangerous, and finding one isn\u2019t to likely either. But, fifty or sixty thousand year spirit beasts\u2019 spirit rings shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Once you have a spirit avatar, your defensive abilities will be even stronger. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any god bestowed spirit rings on hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince my soul and body were separated I only have one trial, and all the rewards are superimposed. I can get them once you\u2019ve completed the Seagod Nine Trials. Right now you still lack more than ten spirit rings and a spirit bone for the eighth trial. Mom is just evolving, let\u2019s go search here. If there are any suitable spirit rings, we can finish the eighth trial sooner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San rubbed Xiao Wu\u2019s head. He of course knew that Xiao Wu was saying this because he had lost five spirit rings to resurrect her. As a former spirit beast she least liked seeing spirit masters hunt spirit beasts.</p><br/><p>While combing Xiao Wu\u2019s hair, Tang San said to her:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, I promise you that all the spirit beasts I kill will be those especially wicked ones, the kind that take the initiative to attack me, and I absolutely won\u2019t kill more than needed, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu nodded slightly. Her back was to Tang San, but the rims of her eyes were already red. Da Ming and Er Ming were dead. In this world Tang San was her only family. Tang San\u2019s thoughts for her, his love for her, imperceptibly dissolved the grief in her heart.</p><br/><p>After a while, a neat scorpion braid was already completed. Even tied up in a braid, Xiao Wu\u2019s hair almost reached the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s eyes were no longer red. Turning around she smiled sweetly at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s tell dad and go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded. Leading along Xiao Wu\u2019s soft little hand they went up to Tang Hao. Tang Hao\u2019s gaze was always fixed on the giant golden cocoon,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you talking. Go, pay attention to your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San promised, and pulled out the nearby Seagod Trident. Saying goodbye to his father, they flew up and over the mountaintop, arriving in the Sunset Forest.</p><br/><p>Their feet planted firmly on the ground, the two held hands and walked into the forest. Tang San wasn\u2019t in any hurry to hunt spirit beasts, this was his first time walking with Xiao Wu in the woods after her resurrection, and he didn\u2019t want to break this pleasurable mood by killing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s heart was interlinked with Tang San, gently following him. Their figures slowly entered the dense forest.</p><br/><p>Before they had gone far, Xiao Wu suddenly halted and looked at Tang San, softly calling out:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San also halted, looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cKiss me, ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s face was red, but she still shyly spoke.</p><br/><p>Tang San only felt hot blood rush to the top of his head, his gaze so hot his eyes almost spit flames. There were no parents here, and the feelings held in his heart could no longer be restrained. Almost roughly pulling Xiao Wu into his embrace, his invading lips constantly fell on Xiao Wu\u2019s forehead, the hair by her temples, brushing her face like a soft breeze, and finally, stopped on her tender pink lips.</p><br/><p>A warm sensation as soft as silk, a fragrance like a quiet orchid, seemed to instantly swallow Tang San\u2019s soul. Xiao Wu\u2019s arms twisted around Tang San\u2019s neck responding somewhat unskillfully. This moment, tears rolled down both their faces practically simultaneously. They had experienced so many storms, separated by life and death, but they could finally be together.</p><br/><p>This kiss seemed like it would last until the end of time, until the seas ran dry and the rock went soft. Neither wanted to separate.</p><br/><p>This was still a pure kiss, without involving any lust, only a dense, almost substantial love.</p><br/><p>An unknown amount of time later, suddenly, a connection with his soul roused Tang San from the love, pulling Xiao Wu\u2019s soft body to swiftly move sideways. A smear of black light flitted past where he stood before, and at the same time that black light spread out, chasing after Tang San and Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Those were sharp black needles, with a rich dark aura. Tang San brought Xiao Wu to quickly change places in midair several times, but they still chased after without giving up. The tyrannical energy fluctuations made the air crackle, and where it passed, an acrid smell rose from the ground.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026\u2026 The Pit Demon Spider\u2019s Piercing Needle ability?</p><br/><p>Confronting this kind of attack, Tang San didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry, but at the same time also felt angry at him and Xiao Wu being interrupted.</p><br/><p>After he and Xiao Wu entered the forest, because they were lost in love, they hadn\u2019t showed their presence, their auras reserved, and had instead provoked a spirit beast attack. This eyeless fellow was still a Pit Demon Spider with quite the cultivation. There was no reason not to accept a gift delivered, and even Xiao Wu\u2019s face now flashed with anger. Provoking Xiao Wu\u2019s anger only had one result. Having just advanced to Thousand Hands Douluo, Tang San would directly transform into Thousand Hands Asura.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

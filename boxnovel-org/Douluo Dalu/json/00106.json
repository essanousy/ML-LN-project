Relying on his full spirit power output, Tang San\u2019s defense of his side was watertight. However, no matter how durable, Blue Silver Grass was still only vines and leaves.</p><br/><p>The power of the spirit fusion ability used by the combined strength of two fortieth ranked Spirit Masters wasn\u2019t inferior to the spirit ability of a sixtieth ranked Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>Drifting Snow didn\u2019t have as tyrannical force of impact as Hell White Tiger, but surpassed it in endurance.</p><br/><p>Amidst the tooth ache inducing and ear piercing grinding sound, the sticky and tough Spider Web Restraint was already starting to show signs of breaking.</p><br/><p>Countless snowflakes constantly cut at each corner of Tang San\u2019s defense like a meat grinder, and under those sharper than knives snowflakes, the outermost layer of defense was very quickly being cut, shattered.</p><br/><p>What Drifting Snow had to erode next, was Tang San\u2019s ten thousand year spirit ring ability, Blue Silver Prison.</p><br/><p>When Tang San had only just learned Blue Silver Prison, at most he could use seven at once. In resilience, Blue Silver Prison was inferior to Spiderweb Restraint, but it won out in being able to instantly appear at the opponent\u2019s position, and could moreover be used for group control.</p><br/><p>Along with Tang San\u2019s cultivation of Three Aperture Governing Heart gradually maturing, his skill in using this fourth spirit ability had also increased. This was after all a ten thousand year spirit ring ability, and there were a lot more ways to manipulate it than Spiderweb Restraint.</p><br/><p>The reason Tang San could fully use more than ten Blue Silver Prisons wasn\u2019t that his spirit power had increased a lot, but rather because his spirit power was released more accurately each time he used this spirit ability in real combat.</p><br/><p>In other words, Blue Silver Prisons that might appear exactly the same, could actually have entirely different effects. The more spirit power it used the more durable it was, using less spirit power made it weaker. Setting the strength of his own Blue Silver Prison according to the opponents\u2019 differences could greatly save on Tang San\u2019s spirit power.</p><br/><p>Consequently, when discovering the opponents had a spirit fusion ability, Tang San could still create multiple Blue Silver Prisons to protect everyone. This was already his full strength.</p><br/><p>The seemingly frail snowflakes came into contact with the outermost layer of Blue Silver Prison. Unexpectedly, the rigid Blue Silver Prison was a lot better at resisting the cutting effect of Drifting Snow than the flexible Spiderweb Restraint.</p><br/><p>Flexibility feared sharpness. Sharpness feared firmness. Perhaps this was the cause.</p><br/><p>If someone could see Shui Bing-Er\u2019s expression within the blue pillar of light right now, they would certainly discover that it had become very unsightly. Even though she had already estimated Tang San quite highly before this competition, Tang San\u2019s adaptability and reaction capability still left her shocked.</p><br/><p>The spirit fusion ability Drifting Snow was managed by Shui Bing-Er, therefore she could clearly sense the resistance when the snowflakes struck.</p><br/><p>She had seen Tang San create altogether seven layers of Blue Silver Prison. Even though the first layer was already broken through by now, Shui Bing-Er discovered that if it continued like this, by the time her and Xue Wu\u2019s spirit power was exhausted, they still might not have been able to break Tang San\u2019s defensive formation.</p><br/><p>Ten thousand year spirit abilities really weren\u2019t ordinary. Even though it was a control type, its defensive power could actually reach this degree. It seemed that even though Blue Silver Prison wasn\u2019t flashy, its practicality could leave people speechless.</p><br/><p>Having used the spirit fusion ability, if they still couldn\u2019t win this match, then how could Skywater Academy have any chance of winning when confronting an even stronger Shrek Academy in the future?</p><br/><p>A resonant phoenix cry resounded from within the blue pillar of light. Tang San only felt the pressure lighten, as the tornado of cutting snowflakes soared higher into the air.</p><br/><p>Feeling an even more formidable mental pressure after hearing that clear phoenix cry and feeling the pressure of the attack lighten, Tang San suddenly came to himself.</p><br/><p>Ice Phoenix, that Shui Bing-Er\u2019s spirit was actually a first rate spirit, Ice Phoenix.</p><br/><p>No wonder, no wonder her spirit ability control was so powerful, no wonder she could possess a spirit fusion ability. She actually possessed such a tyrannically powerful spirit.</p><br/><p>Both being phoenixes, the Ice Phoenix wasn\u2019t inferior in any respect to Huo Wu\u2019s Fire Phoenix. These spirits were two extremes, but both were first rate existences. In power, Shui Bing-Er was even a bit stronger than Huo Wu.</p><br/><p>But she also possessed a partner for spirit fusion ability, Xue Wu.</p><br/><p>In midair, the snowflakes gathered, gradually forming into a seven meter long enormous blue phoenix.</p><br/><p>Different from the fourth spirit ability Huo Wu used that day, this Ice Phoenix appeared extremely distinctly, as if substantial. Bright eyes, long tail feathers, its appearance touching.</p><br/><p>The dazzlingly beautiful blue phoenix fell from the air, and without fanfare, it became an ice blue light, floating down.</p><br/><p>Its movements weren\u2019t fast, but without advancing, the snowflakes drifting through the air made its body even more substantial.</p><br/><p>A muffled sigh echoed from within the Blue Silver Prisons, and a bizarre scene appeared. The remaining Blue Silver Prisons unexpectedly sunk back into the ground, layer after layer. Even the final protective Blue Silver Grass was quietly withdrawn by Tang San.</p><br/><p>Headed by Dai Mubai, besides Tang San, the remaining six swiftly dashed off the stage as the Ice Phoenix approached. Only Tang San remained on the stage.</p><br/><p>Compared to the seven meter long Ice Phoenix, Tang San seemed insignificant, as dazzling blue light completely illuminated the platform.</p><br/><p>Right now, not even the spectators who supported Shrek Academy, supported Tang San, still believed they could win this match.</p><br/><p>What the spectators understood even less was why Tang San would completely remove his own defensive setup when the opponent was on the verge of attacking. People with a bit of knowledge about spirits could also see that right now, even if Tang San still had spirit power remaining, it absolutely wasn\u2019t much.</p><br/><p>In his current condition, what could he still do?</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t want to concede the match. He could do it, it wouldn\u2019t influence the outcome of the qualifiers, after all. But he didn\u2019t want to. For no reason other than that he didn\u2019t want to accept defeat.</p><br/><p>The Ice Phoenix gliding through the air paused, and Shui Bing-Er\u2019s somewhat angry voice transmitted from the blue light,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die? Get away quickly, I won\u2019t be able to control it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was already going all out, and she was already unable to control the energy of the condensed Ice Phoenix.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s face revealed a trace of a slight smiling expression, inwardly saying, \u2018This girl really is kind-hearted. Only, I can\u2019t lose.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tearing sound came from behind Tang San\u2019s back, as eight vicious purple black long lances pushed out. Each lance glittered alternately with blue and red light, the lances thrusting out sharply to either side.</p><br/><p>Eight sharp points thrust sharply into the ground, raising Tang San\u2019s body. It was Eight Spider Lances.</p><br/><p>The Ice Phoenix was already out of control, falling from the sky, tremendous energy poured down.</p><br/><p>Cold streams burst out, long since locked completely on Tang San. The spirit fusion ability Drifting Snow was extremely powerful. When used, it would immediately lock onto the opponent. But at this moment, a bizarre scene appeared.</p><br/><p>Eight Spider Lances bent sharply, before shooting out again, sending Tang San soaring into the air like a cannon ball. He, unexpectedly ignoring the cold streams, broke through that Ice Phoenix and the locked on energy, rising more than twenty meters into the air.</p><br/><p>The stage was already icebound, instantly covered in a layer of blue luster. The next moment, with a loud rumble, it completely collapsed.</p><br/><p>Even the few remaining Skywater Academy members with water element capabilities rushed to leap off the moment it began to fall.</p><br/><p>This could be said to be the most destructive scene since the start of the qualifiers, and also the most dazzling one. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t successfully hit its intended target.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Eight Spider Lances made Tang San feel full of energy again, supported by the power of the external spirit bone. When he fell from the back, Eight Spider Lances had already quietly withdrawn into his back.</p><br/><p>The entire vast Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena was already covered in a thin layer of frost.</p><br/><p>Gust after gust of cold made the spectators expressions rigid.</p><br/><p>Standing in the ruins of the stage, Shui Bing-Er managed to stand with Xue Wu\u2019s support. Looking at Tang San falling from the sky, there was a burst of despondency in her eyes.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t understand how something like this would happen. How her and Xue Wu\u2019s spirit fusion ability, further adding her own spirit\u2019s power, was unable to defeat the gently landing opponent.</p><br/><p>Drifting Snow\u2019s cold was enough to make anyone slow down. In that split second before, the temperature on the stage had dropped to a frightening level, and further adding the control of the cold streams, she refused to believe that any Spirit Master under sixtieth rank could break through and escape its attack range.</p><br/><p>But, that man had accomplished it. His movements looked effortless, as if he didn\u2019t use any strength. But only Shui Bing-Er herself knew just how difficult it was to escape Drifting Snow.</p><br/><p>The two young womens\u2019 faces were now pale, spirit power overdraft making it very difficult for them to even stand.</p><br/><p>Tang San had already landed in the ruins, and step by step walked towards them. Even though his spirit power fluctuations were already weak, as long as she thought of the close combat fighting ability he displayed before, Shui Bing-Er knew it would be impossible for her and Xue Wu to defeat him.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>By now, only three people still remained on the stage. The outcome was already settled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell me how?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui Bing-Er said somewhat bitterly.</p><br/><p>Tang San stopped three meters in front of the two women. The alarming-looking Eight Spider Lances had been withdrawn even before people could see them clearly. But, he knew that in this match, he had still lost. Having been pushed by the opponents to use Eight Spider Lances that should only appear in the finals, he believed his people had already lost.</p><br/><p>Obtaining victory in this match wasn\u2019t the contribution of Eight Spider Lances, nor was it his contribution.</p><br/><p>It was the effect of taking those two immortal treasure herbs. The tempering of the Infernal Precious Apricot as well as the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass made him completely immune to all cold and hot energies. If Shui Bing-Er had used another attribute spirit fusion ability, then at that time, when Tang San was already out of spirit power, he would be unable to win even if he used Eight Spider Lances.</p><br/><p>Therefore, in his heart, he believed he had lost. He hadn\u2019t lost in strength, but rather in adaptability and foresight.</p><br/><p>The continuous victories had made it difficult for the Shrek Academy team members not to be proud, and even Tang San was no exception. After all, he was still human, and he was as susceptible to emotions as anyone else.</p><br/><p>Before today\u2019s match, he had drawn an equals sign between Skywater Academy and Blazing Academy. But who could have expected that Shui Bing-Er\u2019s control could actually restrain him like that, and even possessed such a formidable ability like the spirit fusion ability.</p><br/><p>Confronted by Shui Bing-Er\u2019s inquiry, Tang San didn\u2019t conceal it. He not only thought he had lost because of himself, but also because of Shui Bing-Er\u2019s kindness. That moment before the Ice Phoenix descended, he could clearly feel the concern in Shui Bing-Er\u2019s words. That wasn\u2019t concern for victory and defeat, but rather true worry that he would be hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m capable of ice immunity. Therefore, your ability was unable to restrain me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San used a voice only the three of them could hear.</p><br/><p>Two pairs of beautiful eyes watched him attentively, a trace of bitterness at the corner of Shui Bing-Er\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how were you restrained by me before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui Bing-Er couldn\u2019t help asking. If her first spirit ability, Icebind, was effective on Tang San, then how come the Ice Phoenix lock wasn\u2019t?</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed bitterly,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy ice and fire immunity is only effective on energies, substantial shapes and energy shocks will still injure me. Your ice binding had solid form, not an energy form, of course I would be restrained. Just that the chill within wouldn\u2019t injure me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>However willing to admit it, Shui Bing-Er still with difficulty spoke these words.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, It should be our loss. It was my mistake that led to this conclusion. My ice and fire resistance doesn\u2019t originate in cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, the referee had already cautiously approached. Even if he was an official with fifty something ranked strength, right now he was still somewhat apprehensive.</p><br/><p>The current young generation was really too ferocious. If by some chance they still had some skills they hadn\u2019t used, he himself might also be implicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinished?\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee looked at both sides.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Shui Bing-Er nodded simultaneously, speaking in unison:</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee baffled looked at the two,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San spoke first:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis match is a tie. Both our sides have already exhausted our spirit power. We can\u2019t continue the match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee then suddenly understood. Even if a tied match was rare, it still wasn\u2019t unheard of. Immediately, he declared that the fight between Shrek Academy and Skywater Academy ended in a tie.</p><br/><p>He could win and not, this was Tang San\u2019s stern warning to himself. The qualifiers were only the beginning, there was still the ranking competition, as well as the qualifiers where powers would stand like trees in the forest. Discovering his flaws now was always better than discovering them even later in the tournament. After all, the finals were a knock-out competition, no mistakes could be tolerated there.</p><br/><p>The spectators were no doubt disappointed, the majority of the spectators supporting Shrek Academy but being unable to see them take the victory in the final match made a lot of people rather critical. Especially voices that doubted whether Shrek Academy had sent their full strength echoed from all corners.</p><br/><p>Returning to the rest area, Tang San ate a recovery sausage Oscar handed over,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was my mistake. I underestimated the opponent from the start of the match, and couldn\u2019t deliver relevant tactics, leading to our later passivity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai clapped Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what are you doing saying this? It\u2019s more important we find the root of defeat. Don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re still young, and right now we can still stand to be defeated. You\u2019ve already done very well, nobody will blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun took the opportunity to move closer, grinning:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, don\u2019t be depressed. This is because you brothers didn\u2019t have me there. If I was there, how could those beauties be arrogant. Next time let them get to know my phoenix flame. Just what is called \u2018failure is the mother of success\u2019. Moreover, we still didn\u2019t lose! You also didn\u2019t go all out. No? Actually, not just you, even Dai Mubai, Xiao Wu and the others also didn\u2019t use their full strength. We still need you to lead everyone to become ultimate champions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai raised his hand and swatted Fatty\u2019s head,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so capable? Fine, then next time you go up by yourself, we\u2019ll watch how you alone roast seven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun rubbed his head, wronged saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for comforting third brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFailure is the mother of success, these words are quite right. There\u2019s one month to the ranking competition. This is plenty of time for you all to find your own deficiencies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster had already come over before anyone noticed, his gaze falling on Tang San, looking at him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Confronted by Grandmaster\u2019s gaze, Tang San lowered his head.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster walked up to his side, one hand resting on his shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the result of your match today is even better than your victories. I\u2019ve always said that real combat is the best way to inspect your own abilities. Only by constant combat, confronting different opponents, will you grow even faster. The Spirit Master vocation comes in all kinds of bizarre variations, nobody knows what kind of enemy you will face in your next battle. All you can do is increase your experience by facing different Spirit Masters. None of you lack talent as Spirit Masters, and the opponents you meet in the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament are also all well-known figures of the young generation. This match is only a fragment of your lives, you still have a long road to walk, as long as you gain something, victory or defeat is of little consequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the students answered as one. Their previously somewhat different expressions once again became unanimous. For some reason, the otherwise always mild mannered Tang San now had an extreme thirst for victory in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Heaven Dou City qualifiers had now ended, and according to the sequence, it was time for the reward ceremony, awarding the top five teams the qualification proof for the ranking competition.</p><br/><p>But due to the damage to the central stage in the previous match, this process was also simplified. The other academies that didn\u2019t advance wouldn\u2019t participate in the awards ceremony, only the top five teams would go up to accept their rewards on the VIP seating platform.</p><br/><p>The ceremony wasn\u2019t complex. At the announcer\u2019s declaration, the captain and vice captain of the top ranking teams stepped onto the platform.</p><br/><p>Due to Godwind Academy and Thunderclap Academy having the same result, both with twenty six wins and one loss, and Godwind Academy once having prevailed over Thunderclap Academy, the ranking was settled as: Godwind Academy ranked first, Thunderclap Academy second, Shrek Academy ranked third with twenty four wins, one tie and two losses, Blazing Academy ranked fourth with half a victory more than Skywater Academy, and Skywater Academy still fifth.</p><br/><p>Representing Shrek Academy to go up on the platform was Dai Mubai and Tang San. As the two stepped onto the platform, they immediately sensed several malicious gazes. The most burning among them was Blazing Academy\u2019s Huo Wu.</p><br/><p>She had never accepted being defeated by Tang San, and didn\u2019t reflect on her own strength, but rather blamed Tang San\u2019s fire immunity. Even though Blazing Academy successfully advanced, being pushed down by Shrek Academy with half a victory stirred up the fury in her heart even stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, His Majesty and Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda master as well as platinum bishop Salas will personally award the proof of qualifications to enter the ranking competition as well as the award money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The proof of qualifications was actually a personal letter. There was no worry anyone would forge it, after all, Spirit Hall and Heaven Dou Empire both knew which academies had advanced. But Tang San and Dai Mubai didn\u2019t know about the award money before.</p><br/><p>The award money the top five academies received was the same, after all, this was only the qualifiers. Each team received ten thousand gold spirit coins issued by Heaven Dou Empire. But in the finals, the prize for the final three was awarded by Spirit hall.</p><br/><p>The awards presented, the announcer gave the word to emperor Xue Ye in the seat of honor.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye\u2019s gaze swept across the members of the teams standing in front of him, his eyes especially paused on Tang San for a few seconds, then smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all, children, I want to congratulate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve successfully obtained the qualifications to advance in this Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament. As the most senior ruler of Heaven Dou Empire, I am proud of you. You are all the future hope of the Empire. And as the leaders of each team, your strength has also showed its most important effect in the competition. Therefore, I\u2019ve decided to confer upon the ten of you the title of viscount[1], and to the other competing members of your five academies the title of baron. After you have graduated, the gates of the royal household will stand open to you at any time. Your fiefdoms will all be allocated after your graduation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, that won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Salas suddenly interjected harshly from the side. Daring to interrupt an emperor\u2019s words, this clearly showed the tremendous influence of Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye looked indifferently at Salas,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something inappropriate? Your eminence bishop Salas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Salas said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn past competitions, there\u2019s no precedent of awarding titled of nobility. Even more, aren\u2019t the titles given too high?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was Heaven Dou Empire or Star Luo Empire, the titles of nobility were ranked from the highest as Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, Baron. Handing out ten noble titles of viscount just for the qualifiers, Emperor Xue Ye\u2019s generosity was enough to shock anyone in attendance.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye only used one sentence to shut Salas up,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eminence, conferring titles of nobility is an internal matter of the Empire, unrelated to Spirit Hall. Unrelated to the current tournament. I only admire these children and accorded them some rewards, that\u2019s all. They represent our Heaven Dou Empire in this time\u2019s Advanced Spirit Master Academy Tournament. I will also give you a pledge here. If there is any team among you that can obtain final victory in the tournament, the noble titles of everyone in the team will be promoted one level, and at the same time the academy will be given the \u2018Imperial\u2019 prefix, receiving the financial backing of the Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the leaders of their teams, even if these youths had all seen some of the world, as Emperor Xue Ye\u2019s great string of rewards smashed down, they were still left somewhat stupid. What did titles of nobility represent? A viscount could already possess their own territory and attendants, and still draw a certain stipend from the Empire. This sum alone was enough to live on.</p><br/><p>Even though a lot of Spirit Masters had titles of nobility, obtaining them from kingdoms and duchies was easy. Obtaining an imperial title wasn\u2019t so simple, especially being directly conferred the title of viscount. The territory a viscount could possess was already a small town.</p><br/><p>Even more valuable, emperor Xue Ye had already guaranteed to these ten that after the end of this tournament, they would directly be conferred fiefdoms.</p><br/><p>In other words, their titles absolutely weren\u2019t just empty words, but rather truly nobles with territory.</p><br/><p>Salas\u2019 expression appeared very unsightly. He didn\u2019t say anything else, but in his eyes was a cold and cruel expression.</p><br/><p>As the captains and vice captains of the five qualified teams, they were all elite young Spirit Masters, one more intelligent than the other, and from emperor Xue Ye\u2019s promise and Salas\u2019 protest, they could all sense the smell of gunpowder contained within.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi only sat smiling and silent to the side, apparently all this was unrelated to him.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye basically didn\u2019t seem to notice platinum bishop Salas\u2019 ugly expression, and smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNext is the ranking competition, also held by the Empire. But the location will change from Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena to the imperial household hunting grounds. At that time, the ten teams from the five kingdoms and duchies will come to jointly conduct the ranking competition with you. I hope that your five academies will rank among the best, holding the best opportunity in the finals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ranking competition is the best stage to show your own strength. When the time comes, for the three students that obtain the highest number of victories in the ranking competition, the Empire will furnish the spirit beast for your next title promotion. You can chose what type you want, and the Empire will guarantee a spirit beast under thirty thousand years cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether Shrek Academy or the four elemental academies, emperor Xue Ye\u2019s current pledge made their hearts beat even faster than the previous noble titles. Even Tang San couldn\u2019t help feeling his pulse quicken.</p><br/><p>In fact, these ten academy team leaders all had fortieth ranked ranked or so strength, their next title advancement would be at fiftieth ranked. Even though the fiftieth ranked spirit ring wasn\u2019t as important as the thirtieth, fiftieth rank was still the first level where a ten thousand year spirit ring could be obtained.</p><br/><p>How strong the first ten thousand year spirit ring was would have enormous influence on all of their futures. If they could freely choose the spirit beast they required, it would no doubt hold enormous benefit, not only wouldn\u2019t they need to take risks or waste time, but they could also display their own spirit to the greatest degree.</p><br/><p>From fiftieth rank and on, a Spirit Master\u2019s cultivation speed would drop substantially. Having a guarantee for their first ten thousand year spirit ring could undoubtedly let them keep a strong advantage from fiftieth to sixtieth rank. The benefits to their future growth would be boundless.</p><br/><p>Seeing the gradually rising flames in the eyes of the ten elites, emperor Xue Ye smiled calmly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ranking competition will be held in one month, I hope you can make even further breakthroughs in this month. Good. I won\u2019t say more. You are all intelligent children, I think you will make the most intelligent choices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, emperor Xue Ye\u2019s gaze deviated a moment, sweeping across platinum bishop Salas\u2019 face. Then, under the protection of his imperial high officials, he turned and left.</p><br/><p>Salas expression twitched slightly, but his expression had already completely calmed, nothing to be seen of the ugliness from before.</p><br/><p>Just as emperor Xue Ye said, even though he didn\u2019t state it clearly, the academy team leaders all understood his meaning. The Empire and Spirit Hall, pick the first.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched slightly. What emperor Xue Ye said today didn\u2019t seem to be something a monarch should say. Spirit Hall was so powerful, could it be emperor Xue Ye wanted to make a show of force?</p><br/><p>In other words, had the conflict between Heaven Dou Empire and Spirit Hall already reached a condition that couldn\u2019t be reconciled?</p><br/><p>It was better not to participate in these political matters. He didn\u2019t know about others, but his own road was already very clear cut, and could easily be summarised in one word: Freedom.</p><br/><p>Tang San had set very clear-cut goals for himself, the limit of his spirit, the limit of Tang Sect.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Dai Mubai walked out of Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena together. The others waited for them outside. At this moment, an abrupt voice suddenly called out for Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San turned his head to look, only to see something red growing larger in his vision, recognizable to him as Huo Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled asked.</p><br/><p>Huo Wu reached him in several steps, directly walking until she stood less than a meter from Tang San.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that confronting Huo Wu held quite a bit of pressure. Because her height was quite outstanding among girls, right now she was even a bit taller than Tang San. In fact, along with absorbing the ten thousand year level Pit Demon Spider as his fourth spirit ring, Tang San\u2019s body was already more developed than his contemporaries. Right now his height was close to one meter eighty, and Huo Wu was precisely one meter eighty.</p><br/><p>Huo Wu gazed at this, not particularly outstanding appearance, always seeming even tempered, Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you got the courage to fight me without spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment, the Shrek Academy group next to him all smiling. They were all very clear on Tang San\u2019s physical combat ability, and Tai Long had once raised this request to him, the result leaving his head and face in the dirt.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the spare time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The pupils of Huo Wu\u2019s eyes suddenly contracted,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your close combat ability very strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brows wrinkling, Tang San fixed his eyes on Huo Wu. Looking at this just like a flame woman, he once again repeated:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have the spare time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he turned and walked toward the Shrek Academy party, without wanting to get further involved with Huo Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go to hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Temper stretched to the limit, the fury Huo Wu had restrained for several days finally erupted. Her right leg snapped out, going straight for the back of Tang San\u2019s head. With her height, her legs were long, and she moved like lightning.</p><br/><p>Distinguishing sounds was the most basic capability at Tan Sect, how would Tang San let her easily do as she wished? Taking a quick step forward, half turning, left hand shooting out, he directly grabbed Huo Wu\u2019s ankle.</p><br/><p>Huo Wu only felt the momentum of her kick disappear like a clay ox entering the sea, instantly vanishing like smoke with a slight quiver of Tang San\u2019s arm. Tang San\u2019s hand gripped her leg like a vise, and no matter how she exerted herself, she was unable to withdraw it.</p><br/><p>That left hand had already turned the color and luster of sheep fat jade.</p><br/><p>Raising the right hand, pushing up Huo Wu\u2019s long leg, taking a step towards Huo Wu, right foot naturally stepping behind Huo Wu\u2019s supporting right leg, simultaneously bending forward, directly striking Huo Wu\u2019s raised thigh.</p><br/><p>Movements as natural as moving clouds and flowing water, smoothly finding the weak point, left Huo Wu without any opportunity to react before she had already been sent flying by Tang San, falling into the embrace of the just arrived Huo Wushuang. Tang San didn\u2019t use much strength, amply displaying Controlling Crane Catching Dragon\u2019s method to use strength against itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San swept the Shrek Academy group who were all looking at Huo Wu getting pushed around with schadenfreude, then left with large strides.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Wu wanted to rush out again after being caught by her big brother, but was forcefully restrained by Huo Wushuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath, you aren\u2019t his match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing, Huo Wushuang firmly pulled back his little sister. He could of course see that Tang San had already started off leniently.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rims of Huo Wu\u2019s eyes reddened. She really was somewhat unable to bear having her competitive nature once again being given a blow by the same person.</p><br/><p>[1] The five orders of nobility are from the most senior to least: Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, Baron.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

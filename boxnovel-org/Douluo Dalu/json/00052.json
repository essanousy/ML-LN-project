What Tang San did proved that to Spirit Masters on the battlefield, victory didn\u2019t necessarily require relying on strength, but could be accomplished with wisdom and planning.</p><br/><p>In an instant a figure appeared before Tang San like a moth drawn to a flame, directly hiding Tang San\u2019s shape, practically protecting all of Tang San behind him, if the tortoiseshell shields were to hit Tang San, then they first had to pass through this person.</p><br/><p>The one suddenly appearing in front of Tang San wasn\u2019t a stranger, but Emperor Team\u2019s captain, Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master Yu Tian-Heng.</p><br/><p>How was it possible? This was the first thought that appeared in the minds of all members of the Emperor Team, immediately afterward, they clearly saw Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s current circumstances.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng naturally wouldn\u2019t help Tang San block his teammates\u2019 attack, and even if he would, with his current condition, it wouldn\u2019t be possible for him to reach Tang San\u2019s side. But all this had already been planned in advance by Tang San, the foreshadowing was buried in the first opening moments of the spirit fight.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng was completely entangled in Blue Silver Grass, forcefully pulled in front of Tang San to act as his meat shield.</p><br/><p>Earlier when the two sides first clashed, Yu Tian-Heng had fallen into Tang San\u2019s schemes, when he suffered injuries under the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 siege, at the start of that siege, when Tang San used Blue Silver Grass to bind him. Blue Silver Grass currently had three spirit rings, it also had three spirit abilities. Binding was no doubt the most practical, Spider Web Restraint naturally was the most potent. But, that unassuming second spirit ring ability shouldn\u2019t be neglected. The current scene was a direct result of Tang San\u2019s second spirit ring ability: Parasite.</p><br/><p>Although Yu Tian-Heng had recovered his fighting strength under the assistance of Nine Heart Flowering Apple Xie Lingling\u2019s assistance, Blue Silver Grass\u2019 seeds had quietly been lodged on his body under the use of Binding, when the second spirit ability was launched, the parasitic seeds would follow Tang San\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>When Tang San turned to launch his Spider Web Restraint at the Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master, he simultaneously secretly activated the Parasites on Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s body, using his Blue Silver Grass to forcefully pull him over in front of him.</p><br/><p>Currently Yu Tian-Heng was really too weak, if he was in peak condition, he could struggle free of the Blue Silver Grass restraints without the need for Thunder Fury, but right now it was basically impossible for him to accomplish this.</p><br/><p>Tang San grasped not only the situation on the battlefield, but at the same time the hearts of the opponents. With two lifetimes, he possessed not just the wisdom of thirteen years, rather the experience of almost forty. Even though Xiao Wu\u2019s injuries made him furious, with the disaster he encountered in Star Dou Great Forest he understood that anger basically couldn\u2019t settle the issue, only by maintaining a cool head for the moment would he be able to clearly see every change the narrow target of the battle.</p><br/><p>If the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 tortoiseshell shields could only be thrown and not withdrawn, Tang San wouldn\u2019t have done something like this, when weakened Yu Tian-Heng only had the body of a normal person, basically insufficient to stop the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 tortoiseshell shield attack, it would only be adding a life. But in the previous fight Tang San already clearly saw that their tortoiseshell shields could be withdrawn, and thus this scene appeared.</p><br/><p>When the two brothers Shi M\u00f2 and Shi M\u00f3 were about to defeat Tang San, Yu Tian-Heng suddenly appeared, immediately turning the two pale with fright. Confronted by the body of their captain, they didn\u2019t even think about it. Exerting all their spirit power the forcefully pull the tortoiseshell shields to change direction.</p><br/><p>But, in order to defeat Tang San they had attacked with full strength, the tortoiseshell shields were not only extremely heavy but even more infused with their enormous spirit power, how could they be withdrawn? The Black Tortoise Spirit Masters were admittedly powerful, but this pair of brothers were still far from the level where they could easily withdraw.</p><br/><p>In the end the pair succeeded in breaking off the tortoiseshell shield attack, the four tortoiseshell shields brushing by a hair\u2019s breadth from Yu Tian-Heng, flying to either side. But using such strength made these two brothers\u2019 stomachs cramp, simultaneously spitting blood. And at this moment, a silhouette shot out from behind Yu Tian-Heng like a shooting star, in practically only a moment it was already in front of them. That was precisely the bloody-eyed Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s movements were extremely fluent, throwing Spider Web Restraint, dragging Yu Tian-Heng, immediately afterward, the Eight Spider Lances on his back simultaneously pierced the ground, supporting his body, the middle joints of the Eight Spider Lances bending simultaneously, again stretching out with full strength, their formidable flexibility sending out Tang San like a bolt of lightning.</p><br/><p>Standing on the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 side a satisfied expression flashed through Grandmaster\u2019s eyes, muttering to himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cControl the battlefield, control the team, control the enemy, control the heart. Little San, you have finally grasped the full meaning of the control system Spirit Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Tang San used Eight Spider Lances to leap, he knew that this spirit battle was already finished. Losing the crucial protection of the tortoiseshells, even though the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters were two, how could they block Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances?</p><br/><p>The lustrous purple Eight Spider Lances extended in midair, sharp points like eight cold stars simultaneously thrusting at the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Out of the tortoiseshells, their own spirit power lashing back, speed not being their expertise. The Black Tortoise Spirit Masters only had one method left to them, blocking.</p><br/><p>The two roared loudly, fists swinging at Tang San in the air, spirit power bursting out, earthen yellow light soaring up.</p><br/><p>The Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 spirit power was as heavy as their tortoiseshells, unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have the strength to truly concentrate their spirit power. Using spirit abilities, how could they still be in peak condition after consuming their spirit power.</p><br/><p>Eight Spider Lances as an external spirit bone, once used, in itself had a fifty percent amplification effect on Tang San\u2019s attack power, it was also sharp like a spear. If they still had the tortoiseshells the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters might still have been able to block it, but right now there basically wasn\u2019t enough time to recover their tortoiseshells.</p><br/><p>Bright purple light pierced into the yellow concentrated spirit power and erupting in a chain of explosive sounds, the lustrous purple spider lance points basically didn\u2019t give the opponents a chance. Eight Spider Lances under Tang San\u2019s control, separately passed through the opponents\u2019 spirit power, piercing the Two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 shoulders and arms. In the flickering purple light, Tang San didn\u2019t pause, his body flipping in the air, once again using Eight Spider Lances to shoot up, directly pouncing at the Jade phosphor Serpent Spirit Master Dugu Yan.</p><br/><p>With a humming sound, the tortoiseshells each returned to the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters, in a flash becoming yellow light and merging into their bodies, but the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters were no longer able to stand, purple qi welling out of their arms, the two simultaneously toppled, bodies spasming violently.</p><br/><p>Eight Spider Lances possessed the extreme toxicity of the Man Faced Demon Spider that couldn\u2019t be compared to the supplemental poison on the Blue Silver Grass. Under the toxin of the Eight Spider Lances, even if the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 had even more powerful spirit power it would still be impossible for them to resist it.</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t stabbed in the vitals, right now their injuries were the most critical of the Emperor Team.</p><br/><p>Watching the lustrous purple Eight Spider Lances descend from the air, Dugu Yan\u2019s eyes were filled with a fearful light, before the start of this spirit fight she had never thought her side could lose, but at this moment, facing Tang San, she already didn\u2019t have any desire for fighting.</p><br/><p>Her most powerful third spirit ability had easily been broken by this man before her, she with poison for fighting strength, still had what qualifications to go on fighting Tang San? What she was capable of right now was only spitting out another cloud of poison mist, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>The strange purple lustre on the Eight Spider Lances glittered, like all rivers running into the sea[1] the violet poison mist Dugu Yan was doing her utmost to once again spit out unexpectedly frantically rushed towards the Eight Spider Lances, and in an eyeblink it was already swallowed up.</p><br/><p>Four of Tang San\u2019s eight Eight Spider Lances stretched down to the ground, propping up his body, two of the other four easily piercing Dugu Yan\u2019s serpent tail, with an effort unexpectedly raising her into the air.</p><br/><p>By now, all the Emperor Team members that could fight had already lost the capability to continue the battle.</p><br/><p>Nine Heart Flowering Apple Spirit Master Xie Lingling\u2019s eyes equally revealed a panicked expression, although her Nine Heart Flowering Apple once again used its power, healing the injured Spirit Masters on their side, it was unable to recover the Battle Spirit Masters\u2019 expended spirit power, and even more unable to remove the terrifying toxin of the Eight Spider Lances.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut her down, we concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng watched Dugu Yan raised up by Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances, his heart abruptly contracting.</p><br/><p>He clearly saw that not far from him lay the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters whose arms had been hit, their arms having swollen up to twice their normal size, their faces covered with purple qi, seemingly on the point of dying.</p><br/><p>The Spider Lances swung easily, throwing Dugu yan to the side. Tang San didn\u2019t pay any attention to Yu Tian-Heng, the four upper Spider Lances pointing in front of him, sharp points closing in on Nine Heart Flowering Apple Spirit Master Xie Lingling,</p><br/><p>\u201cTreat our people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, first detoxify them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this time, Grandmaster\u2019s timely voice reached the baleful Tang San\u2019s ears, making him slightly distracted.</p><br/><p>Eight Spider Lances would give Tang San strong evil tendencies, making his attacks become even more severe, unable to control his awareness. Hearing Grandmaster\u2019s words, the raging fury in Tang San\u2019s heart gradually calmed. Blue Silver Grass dispersed in all directions, simultaneously pulling the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters and Dugu Yan towards him.</p><br/><p>The reason Grandmaster reminded him this time was that he well knew the severity of Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances\u2019 toxin, and that in such a tense battle Tang San clearly wasn\u2019t able to hold back.</p><br/><p>If it had been just a little later, perhaps those three would have directly withered away from the poison, just like that tree the time they tested Eight Spider Lances in the grove.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan was a poison Spirit Master herself and still somewhat able to resist the Eight Spider Lances poison, but the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 circumstances were extremely dangerous, if not for Grandmaster\u2019s warning, a moment later even Tang San would have been unable to bring them back to life. When Tang San withdrew the Eight Spider Lances poison, inwardly he was shocked, because the Eight Spider Lances supplemental poison had already closed in on their hearts.</p><br/><p>However, while Tang San treated the opponents he also didn\u2019t forget his original intention, besides the three people pierced by Eight Spider Lances at his side, an additional Blue Silver Grass strand wound around the waist of Xie Lingling, pulling her before him as well. Since Tang San was still propped up by Eight Spider Lances, Xie Lingling was naturally lifted off the floor and brought over.</p><br/><p>Xie Lingling\u2019s mask was black muslin, being very close, Tang San discovered that this mysterious auxiliary system Spirit Master possessed a pair of extremely beautiful big eyes, the expression in her eyes could be clearly seen, without any impurity, slender eyelashes slightly curved, between soft winks like they could speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAssist my companions, otherwise, they will still die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s voice was very serene, without a trace of cold intent or mood within. But it was this kind of serene way of speaking that left an extremely deep mark in Xie Lingling\u2019s heart, how was this still a man? His voice sounded somewhat young and tender, but his actions were so ferocious. Control, attack, poison, in today\u2019s fight, rather than saying Emperor Team was beaten by Shrek Seven Devils, it would be better to say it was done by him alone.</p><br/><p>Xie Lingling didn\u2019t utter a word, shaking in fear barely managing to gather her spirit power, Nine Heart Flowering Apple light flew out, lightly covering Xiao Wu\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>With the poison removed from the bodies of the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters and Dugu Yan, Tang San raised his head to look towards the for a long time mute White Dove female Spirit Master and announcer Doudou,</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be announcing the results of this spirit fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Doudou at this awoke like from a dream, basically not daring to look Tang San in the eye, hastily announcing:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeam spirit fight, Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any cheers, Oscar and Ma Hongjun stepped forward, feeding small sausages to Xiao Wu, Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing. The poison mist on the spirit fight ring gradually cleared, both sides\u2019 Spirit Masters all somewhat silent. Although the battle was over, they still attentively gazed at the opponents.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t withdraw Eight Spider Lances, his gaze fixed on Xiao Wu, as he saw her wounds swiftly close under the aid of Nine Heart Flowering Apple, he inwardly breathed out in relief.</p><br/><p>As Ning Rongrong helped Xiao Wu off the ground, she appeared to be a bit pale but otherwise unhindered.</p><br/><p>Tang San at this withdrew his Blue Silver Grass and Spider Web Restraint from the Emperor Team, leaping with Eight Spider Lances he returned to his companions\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai looked at Tang San with a somewhat complicated expression in his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, apparently it\u2019s really only when Xiao Wu is in danger that you\u2019ll become an Asura incarnate, huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes were already softening, the red light in his eyes quietly dispelling, Xiao Wu softly nodded to him, indicating she was already fine.</p><br/><p>It was only at this moment the Shrek Seven Devils became conscious that they had truly prevailed over the formidable enemy in front of them. The faces hidden under the masks all by chance wore smiling expressions. To them, this spirit fight\u2019s difficulty had been unprecedented, also pressuring them to use their full strength - Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances, Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s Spirit Fusion Ability - to reverse the flow of victory and defeat. Of course, Tang San\u2019s control as the team\u2019s soul had also been displayed vividly and thoroughly. Without that clever control, this spirit fight victory still wouldn\u2019t have been theirs.</p><br/><p>But on the other side, the Emperor Team\u2019s members were also supporting each other to gather. Everyones\u2019 complexions were all very unsightly, especially Yu Tian-Heng and the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters. Their current expressions were so rigid that it seemed water would be squeezed out.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng stared towards the Shrek Seven Devils, just in time to meet the gaze Dai Mubai gave them. Who knows how many times these two had looked face to face, but this time the circumstances were already very different.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very powerful. But, we weren\u2019t completely outdone by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng said.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Your own teamwork has flaws, otherwise, it couldn\u2019t be said who would have come out on top in this spirit fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s strength had gained Dai Mubai\u2019s respect, it was still his first time meeting such a tyrannical opponent on the same level as him. As Emperor Team\u2019s captain, Yu Tian-Heng had practically endured the overwhelming majority of the combined firepower of the Shrek Seven Devils, but he still persisted in fighting to the very last moment. Although Emperor Team had lost this spirit fight, Dai Mubai understood that the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon hadn\u2019t at all lost to his Evil Eye White Tiger.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng sighed inwardly, nodding to Dai Mubai,</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope we\u2019ll still have the opportunity to fight again later. Then we won\u2019t have any more flaws.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai smiled faintly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe victory will still be ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s gazes once again collided in a shower of sparks, Yu Tian-Heng drew a deep breath, then to the Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler supporting him and the others saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>The party of seven slowly walked towards the Spirit Master entrance with somewhat staggering steps. Defeat made their departing figures seem somewhat frail.</p><br/><p>Jade Phosphor Serpent Spirit Master Dugu Yan suddenly paused, turning her head to look at Tang San who was slowly withdrawing his Eight Spider Lances,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour poison is very ferocious, even capable of breaking my serpent venom. I\u2019ll always remember my disgrace today. One day, I\u2019ll let you fall before my serpent venom as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San serenely looked at the opponent, calmly replying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning her head along with Dugu Yan was still Nine Heart Flowering Apple Spirit Master Xie Lingling, her gaze was different from Dugu Yan\u2019s resentment, rather a shaking in fear kind of lustrous brilliance, looking deeply at Tang San, wanting to say something but in the end without speaking up. Turning around and leaving along with her companions.</p><br/><p>Watching the opponents\u2019 backs, Dai Mubai suddenly smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, handing over a recovery sausage to everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we won.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seven people looked at each other, each extending their right hand. Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 seven hands piled up in the air, chewing Oscar\u2019s big sausage, in this moment the joy of victory and camaraderie bursting out.</p><br/><p>Applause suddenly echoed, amplified by special equipment from within the VIP lounges. Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 display won the hearts of the audience, and even though the quantity of spectators wasn\u2019t as high as on the outside, to a victory like this, this judicious applause was a perfect end to such a powerful collision of a team spirit battle.</p><br/><p>Qin Ming from beginning to end stood at the entrance of the passage, waiting for his disciples to walk over one by one. On his face wasn\u2019t any displeased expression, instead wearing a faint smile. It seemed that to him, this might be a very good result.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, teacher Qin, we lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng stopped before Qin Ming, lowering his always arrogant head.</p><br/><p>Qin Ming didn\u2019t speak, only calmly looked at him, Yu Tian-Heng could be said to be the disciple he was most proud of, but he was also prideful.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-heng continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe responsibility for today\u2019s defeat is all mine. I didn\u2019t lead well enough, acting like a lone warrior, falling into the opponents\u2019 trap. If you wish it, punish me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming was in no way a gentle person, just the opposite, when he taught his disciples he was extremely strict, readily using severe punishments.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, captain, this can\u2019t be blamed at you. Who could have expected the opponents would be so treacherous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler hastily covered for Yu Tian-Heng.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng sighed lightly, shaking his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Osler, treachery is all the same a strength, losing is losing, in circumstances where we outclassed the opponents in spirit power and spirit rings we still lost, this can only prove we made too many too large mistakes in this fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTian-Heng, even if there were mistakes, the mistakes still weren\u2019t yours. It was me, as control system Spirit Master, the team\u2019s soul, I\u2019m the commander in the field, it was me who didn\u2019t lead everyone well enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>From childhood, Dugu Yan had very rarely wept, in her twenty years of life she had practically always sailed with favorable winds. A rare poison type control capability, a profound background, formidable spirit power among her peers, always placing her at the summit of the pyramid. Today\u2019s defeat was a larger blow than to anyone else, at this moment, humiliated tears subconsciously flowed from her eyes.</p><br/><p>The two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters didn\u2019t speak, Yu Feng wanted to say something but was stopped by Qin Ming\u2019s raised hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo you, although this is a defeat, it\u2019s still a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming spoke with a smile. His tone not the slightest strict to the Emperor Team members.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng looked blankly at Qin Ming, in his heart immediately understanding something.</p><br/><p>Osler couldn\u2019t help but say:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Qin, we lost this badly, how is it still a good thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause, until now your experiences have all really been too smooth. Now you have admittedly met with a setback, but this setback after all hasn\u2019t let anyone among you suffer irrevocable harm. If this setback had occurred in the future, then perhaps you would understand all this at the price of your life. Being defeated isn\u2019t frightening, what\u2019s frightening is being unable to learn from defeat. I think you should already have found some of your mistakes. Then, when you meet this kind of opponent next time, you will become even more formidable. Shrek Seven Devils defeated you, but at the same time they woke you up. Each of you have profound talent. I only present you with these words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Here he paused, gaze sweeping across the Emperor Team\u2019s members,</p><br/><p>\u201cGrowth in defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrowth in defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor Team members all repeated Qin Ming\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Qin Ming waved his hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all return to rest. Recover as quickly as possible. I still have to go see some people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Qin Ming turned around and left with large strides.</p><br/><p>Completely opposite to the gloom of the Emperor Team, as Shrek Seven Devils walked through the applause to Grandmaster, Flender and Zhao Wuji, their eyes were filled with excitement that couldn\u2019t be suppressed.</p><br/><p>The two master and disciple Grandmaster and Tang San looked face to face, in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes Tang San saw satisfaction. Obtaining his Teacher\u2019s approval, to Tang San was even more significant than the audience\u2019s applause.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster wasn\u2019t stingy with his very satisfied words,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, you won, you not only prevailed over the opponents, at the same time you also defeated yourselves. This team spirit fight today, even if it was the second stage training exam, you all passed my test with exceptional grades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, then after we return, shouldn\u2019t we have a vacation?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side Flender frowned:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brats still can\u2019t be too complacent. Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t see how lucky today\u2019s victory was? In a genuine contest of strength you wouldn\u2019t be the match of Emperor Team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, dean, I remember you once taught us that luck is also a kind of strength. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve already forgotten?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026, you stinking brat. Humph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Flender\u2019s mouth was reprimanding Oscar, in fact, inwardly he was even more excited than Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Shrek Academy could be said to be firmly managed by him until now. But right now, the most outstanding Shrek Academy students in its history had arrived.</p><br/><p>He believed that in less than twenty years these children before him would bring a storm to the entire Douluo Continent\u2019s Spirit Master world. A true storm.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, Flender, you don\u2019t have to appear strict when you\u2019re soft inside, this time the children have also worked hard. Grandmaster, you say whether they can rest for a time once we\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster slowly nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should let them rest a while. When we return, we\u2019ll give them half a month of vacation. They can do whatever they wish. Afterwards I will consider when to begin the third stage training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? There\u2019s still a third stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides Tang San, the other six couldn\u2019t help but simultaneously cry out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster only swept his flat gaze over them, his face also recovering to its traditional rigidity,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? You have any complaints?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not. Grandmaster, you are the wisest. Let alone the third stage, even if it\u2019s the fourth or fifth, we will certainly be able to persevere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar rushed to reply. The others were all inwardly wiping sweatdrops.</p><br/><p>They all had to admit that Grandmaster\u2019s training methods undoubtedly had superb results, but nobody wanted to think back to the suffering they had experienced. The first and second stages were already so difficult, what could that third stage training be?</p><br/><p>At that moment, a person was strolling over. Before he reached them, his voice preceded him,</p><br/><p>\u201cDean Flender, vice dean Zhao Wuji, are you well? Disciple Qin Ming pays his respects.\u201d</p><br/><p>The arrival was precisely Emperor Team\u2019s coach teacher Qin Ming, with just a few rapid steps, he kneeled before Flender and Zhao Wuji. Right now, he was already completely without the controlled calm he had before the Emperor Team, his eyes shone with emotion.</p><br/><p>Flender used his hand to prop up the glasses on his nose,</p><br/><p>\u201cI still thought you\u2019d forgotten us long ago, you stinking brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji pulled up Qin Ming from the ground, sizing him up, then laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood brat, you\u2019re more and more ferocious. It seems that it won\u2019t be much longer before you catch up to us old codgers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming deferentially put his hands down and stood up,</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of how long, the two dean\u2019s are always Qin Ming\u2019s teachers, Qin Ming will also forever be a disciple of Shrek Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene in front, the Shrek Seven Devils couldn\u2019t help but be dumbstruck. Although they didn\u2019t know what Qin Ming was actually doing, they had clearly seen Qin Ming at the entrance on the other side of the spirit fighting ring.</p><br/><p>This person clearly was very closely related to Emperor Team, but hearing the meaning in his words, wouldn\u2019t he be\u2026...</p><br/><p>Flender raised his hand, clapping hard at Qin Ming\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been so many years since you left the Academy, but you still are as awkward as before. Come, I\u2019ll give you introductions, this is Grandmaster, these other seven little monsters you just now had a look at in the spirit fighting ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming first deferentially saluted Grandmaster, furthermore with the courtesy of a disciple,</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster leaned to the side, without accepting his courtesy calmly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming looked at Grandmaster not accepting his courtesy and couldn\u2019t help be a bit cold, to the side Flender smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are his nephew\u2019s teacher, in this respect you and he are of the same generation, of course he won\u2019t accept your courtesy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming puzzled looked at Flender, in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes was a resentful light, apparently rebuking Flender for revealing his background.</p><br/><p>Flender grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone here\u2019s on our side, you don\u2019t have to hide it. Don\u2019t tell me you insist on me not telling everyone that Yu Tian-Heng is your nephew[2]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils practically simultaneously cried out in shock, how could they have expected that Grandmaster would actually be born from the seven great clans, and even the one possessing the most attack power, Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s expression immediately became gloomy,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already told them. Flender, I told you repeatedly that me and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan haven\u2019t had any relationship for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind these words, Grandmaster turned around and left for the outside.</p><br/><p>Tang San stepped forward wanting to catch up to his Teacher, but Grandmaster raised his hand to stop him,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have to go calculate the points from this month\u2019s spirit fights, you will later return with Flender. I have some business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Grandmaster with his eyes, Tang San somewhat puzzled looked at Flender. In his heart he already gradually came to understand the reason. No wonder when Grandmaster mentioned the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan that time his expression was a bit peculiar.</p><br/><p>Originally he was from such a formidable Spirit Master clan, in that kind of clan, possessing such a feeble variant spirit as San Pao, if it was him, perhaps he also\u2026...</p><br/><p>Flender somewhat remorsefully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my shooting my mouth off. Never mind it, Xiao Gang is already long since used to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming drew a long breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that Grandmaster unexpectedly was Tian-Heng\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender\u2019s expression very quickly recovered to normal, saying to the Shrek Seven Devils:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly very baffled about why Qin Ming would come here. It\u2019s actually very simple, he was also once like you, a person of the Shrek Academy. Furthermore he was still once our most outstanding student. Shrek Academy\u2019s first graduate. Mubai, little San, Xiao Wu, not long ago you reduced the thirtieth rank speed record that was set by just Qin Ming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming smiled faintly to the Shrek Seven Devils, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHello all juniors. Teacher Flender, it seems our Shrek Academy\u2019s growth is even better than before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji to the side somewhat helplessly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat \u2018better\u2019, these children are the Academy\u2019s last batch of students.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming was inwardly alarmed, subconsciously saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the Academy\u2019s financial problems still haven\u2019t been settled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the words were out he became conscious of his mistake, looking toward Flender with a somewhat embarrassed expression.</p><br/><p>Flender sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fact, we\u2019re not hiding it. Furthermore, we\u2019re also tired. Along with the advancement of age, we no longer have the impulses of youth. After waiting for these children to graduate, I think, we can also go to something classified as our own lives. Qin Ming, you teach those students well, they can all be regarded as elites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I teach well, rather that those children possess superb talent and background on their own. I also don\u2019t have the attraction capable of teaching them, rather our Academy has enough things to attract them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Saying this, you\u2019re an Academy teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender somewhat astonished looked at him.</p><br/><p>Qin Ming nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Flender, right now I\u2019m teaching at the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy[3]. These seven children of Emperor Team are all the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy\u2019s most outstanding disciples.</p><br/><p>Flender chuckled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWith one look at you, I was reassured about this spirit fight. Fine, here is no place to be talking, come with us to a wine shop. So many years without seeing each other, we\u2019ll chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming delightedly nodded agreement, his gaze sweeping over the Shrek Seven Devils one by one, his thoughts secretly moving.</p><br/><p>He had clearly heard what Flender said, he also very clearly knew what kind of record he had held at the Shrek Academy, and unexpectedly three of these seven children had already broken his record, it was obvious their present age shouldn\u2019t be high.</p><br/><p>[1] Idiom: Obtaining the same results by different means.</p><br/><p>[2] () The son of a brother.</p><br/><p>[3] ()</p><br/>\n</div>"}

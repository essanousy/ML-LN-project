Sea God Island?</p><br/><p>(TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Hall calls that place Devil Island[1], but I know it\u2019s true name, Sea God Island[2]. The Spirit Masters living there call themselves Children of the Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since returning in defeat that time, Spirit Hall has never dared have designs on that place. If I\u2019m not mistaken, on that island should be at least one most powerful Spirit Master, just the peak Title Douluo Sword Douluo spoke of, powers above the ninety fifth rank. Even ninety ninth ranked Title Douluo. Otherwise, how could Spirit Hall not retaliate after suffering such a large loss? Another reason is that the people living on Sea God Island won\u2019t leave the island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San curious said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s actually such a bizarre place in the Spirit Master world, how come I\u2019ve never heard of it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf possible, I wouldn\u2019t want you to ever come into contact with the Spirit Masters there. Previously I never thought you would, so naturally I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen have you gone to Sea God Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cI went once. The time Spirit Hall attacked Sea God Island. At that time I was together with Bibi Dong, heard about such a mysterious place and went with them. There I learned that the Spirit Master world still has such a group of mysterious Spirit Masters nobody has heard about. Not only are they mysterious, but extremely powerful. Spirit Masters like us are extremely unsuited to dealing with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why Sea God Island is known as Devil Island to Spirit Hall is because of the battle that time. But in fact, even though Sea God Island\u2019s Spirit Masters are very difficult to deal with, they really aren\u2019t people addicted to killing. They have all stayed there for generations, calling themselves the Children of the Sea, also known as Sea Spirit Masters. The spirits they possess are also quite bizarre, for the most part related to aquatic creatures. Therefore, their spirit abilities also have substantial differences from ours. Sea God Island is located in the great ocean to the west of the Continent. There, these Spirit Masters with water creature type spirits can undoubtedly display their greatest degree of strength. There are also numerous bizarre spirit beasts on the Sea God Island. Consequently, I think that place can be considered a special spirit beast forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many Sea Spirit Masters are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery human living on Sea God Island is a Spirit Master. By a conservative estimate, there are at least two thousand, or even more. The reason I estimate there is a peak ranked Title Douluo there, is because the few Title Douluo that Spirit Hall killed mentioned a lord Sea God. Judging by their expressions and tones, they really weren\u2019t praying to some god, but rather addressing a person, a person with paramount power on Sea God Island. And those Sea Spirit Masters already had Title Douluo level strength. To be able to make them so respectful, it would naturally be someone with peak Douluo strength, maybe even a unique ninety ninth rank Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard Grandmaster\u2019s account, in Tang San\u2019s mind was already drawn a simple outline of the Sea God Island,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you mean to let me go to Sea God Island for experience?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cSea God Island. It\u2019s undoubtedly a place brimming with all kinds of danger. However, it\u2019s also full of opportunities. Sea Spirit Masters aren\u2019t fond of killing, as long as outsiders who go there can pass their test, they can live there and become Sea Spirit Masters. Just one thing, after becoming Sea Spirit Masters, they can\u2019t leave. This is a rule of Sea God Island. That time Spirit Hall climbed Sea God Island in a hostile manner, and even killed some Sea Spirit Masters, provoked a strong reaction from the Sea Spirit Masters, and in the end only a hundred people returned from that all out attack. You can see how powerful those Sea Spirit Masters are. With your talent and ability, I\u2019m not worried about you leaving for Sea God Island, I would assume the trial wouldn\u2019t be any problem. But most important is that you return from there. All this will rely on you getting a feel for things on your own. For you to return to the Continent from the great sea you will have to face the pursuit of Sea God Island. I have to remind you that all the Spirit Masters on Sea God Island are suited to marine combat. Even just a Spirit Douluo level Sea Spirit Master can destroy Title Douluo level landbound Spirit Masters in the sea. You absolutely cannot think you can easily leave that place because you can fly. On Sea God Island there\u2019s a kind of Spirit Master whose spirits are Seagulls, and there\u2019s a Title Douluo level among them. Its speed can\u2019t compare to your Tang Sect\u2019s elder Bai He, but there\u2019s no chance for you to escape by relying on spirit bone flight. If you can successfully return from Sea God Island, then your strength will have advanced in all aspects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hesitated slightly, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the seven sect reselection assembly will begin in half a year\u2019s time. If I go now, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to participate. If everything proceeds as Spirit Hall wants, then it will be even more difficult to confront them later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe that we can stop Spirit Hall from accomplishing their goals in the seven sect reselection assembly by relying on our current strength? That\u2019s basically impossible. Spirit Hall will enter a flourishing stage for at least the next five years. However, they still won\u2019t lightly attack the two great empires. Spirit Hall destroying our Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan and Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School is actually a bit hasty. Spirit Hall admittedly holds an absolute advantage in terms of Spirit Masters, but the strength of those kingdoms and duchies they control is still unable to compete with the two great empires. If Heaven Dou Empire and Star Luo Empire watch out for each other, even Spirit Hall won\u2019t dare act without thinking. Otherwise, if a war breaks out, I\u2019m afraid the population of the Continent will fall by an order of magnitude. If it falls to the chaos of war, not only won\u2019t Spirit Hall obtain any substantial benefits, but will instead incur the hatred of the populace. So, by my estimate, after Spirit Hall has established their supremacy in the Spirit Master world one step further through the seven sect reselection assembly, they will accelerate the development of those kingdoms and duchies to increase their strength, progressively nibbling away at the two great empires, and not focusing on destructive attacks. The two great empires have been deep rooted on the Continent for a long time, completely nibbling them away isn\u2019t something done in an afternoon. At the same time, the two great empires will focus their governance under the pressure. Even though Spirit hall holds the overall advantage, to eat two great empires is still an endless process. This time we\u2019ve already stopped all pretense of cordiality with Spirit Hall, and your defeating Qian Renxue should also be something they will attach importance to. For you to leave to increase your strength for a time, is the best choice. An attack with accumulated strength, will be most effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Grandmaster\u2019s analysis, Tang San couldn\u2019t help nodding repeatedly. Even though he was intelligent, how could his insight into continental politics be as incisive as Grandmaster? While secretly admiring Grandmaster, he revealed an expression of sudden understanding. Grandmaster\u2019s words gave him a feeling of a wide panorama suddenly opening up.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m most worried about is whether you can safely return from Sea God Island. Before truly facing them, you won\u2019t understand just how dreadful the Spirit Masters there are. Their sea spirits are for the most part water attributed, with innumerable bizarre abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San by now had a reasoning in his mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let me go. If I can\u2019t pass the test of this experience, how can I confront Spirit Hall? I will definitely turn the pressure to momentum, to increase my strength even faster. Once I return, it will be time for us to start moving. Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapon manufacturing requires time, and I\u2019m not much help by myself. I believe I will definitely be able to return from Sea God Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled, he had already guessed Tang San\u2019s decision,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s you all. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019d be willing to leave Xiao Wu behind? Bring her. It\u2019s not just you who needs experience, there\u2019s also the rest of you Shrek Seven Devils. They all face similar bottlenecks as you, all of you will have to pay some to advance your strength. Moreover, with all of you together, you will be able to look out for each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven Devils?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment, puzzled looking at Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already discussed with Flender. Ma Hongjun is no problem. As for school master Ning, I talked to him yesterday. Even if he\u2019s somewhat hesitant, I believe I can move him. When you left for Gengxin City last time, I sent out a letter. I believe it should already have reached Mubai and Zhuqing. This is a difficult experience, or you might call it an opportunity. If it\u2019s not you Seven Devils moving together, how could I be at ease?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing at Grandmaster\u2019s gentle gaze, Tang San\u2019s eyes gradually grew hazy. He knew that his teacher had long ago considered his future way for advancement, and that he had always silently done a lot for him. A few years had passed, and the hair at Grandmaster\u2019s temples was already somewhat gray. In Tang San\u2019s heart, Grandmaster\u2019s place was no lower than that of Tang Hao, he had even paid much, much more than Tang Hao had for him\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. Aren\u2019t you going to return to the Clear Sky School as well? Once you\u2019re back from the Clear Sky School, Mubai and the others should also be about ready. I still have some work to do on school master Ning\u2019s side. You seven are our future trump card for contending against Spirit hall. I believe you will definitely return from a rewarding journey to Sea God Island this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bringing Xiao Wu out of the imperial palace, Tang San was unable to control his heart for a long time. Everything that Grandmaster had silently done for him filled his heart. He naturally wouldn\u2019t say anything, but he always recorded these feelings. In his heart, he had always had two fathers.</p><br/><p>On the whole way from the imperial palace, all the imperial guards that saw Tang San would kneel with one knee and salute. Because at Tang San\u2019s waist hung an only infant\u2019s fist sized jade pendant. That jade pendant was also a seal, and it\u2019s previous owner was Heaven Dou emperor Xue Ye.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye had already retaken control over the government, and simultaneously announced fourth prince Xue Beng as crown prince successor. Prince Xue Xing was chief overseer over the imperial armed forces.</p><br/><p>That day when emperor Xue Ye had awoken, Tang San had naturally guessed what was going on. The reason Ning Fengzhi asked him to leave the room that time was to protect him. Even if Tang San didn\u2019t know just what Ning Fengzhi had done, he could completely imagine that this Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master had definitely used some special means to arouse emperor Xue Ye\u2019s hidden life potential. Doing so could admittedly let this regent wake up as soon as possible to take control over the situation, but with his organs already failing, it would undoubtedly also shorten his lifespan even more. Emperor Xue Ye wouldn\u2019t be unaware of this when he woke up, even if a regent like him didn\u2019t realize it as soon as he woke up, he would definitely figure it out with time. Even if he currently needed the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, who could speak for the future? This matter would definitely turn into a thorn between the imperial family and the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.</p><br/><p>Tang San quite admired Ning Fengzhi\u2019s prompt decision making, and that he would ask him to step outside first showed his good will towards the Tang Sect. What he said that day about him looking after Ning Rongrong, was actually about looking after the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Whether Ning Fengzhi wanted to admit it or not, ever since the attack by Spirit Hall, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School had begun to decline, just like the Clear Sky School back then. It seemed this would happen to every great sect.</p><br/><p>But the Tang Sect was different. Also a Spirit Master sect, the Tang Sect not only had an extremely close relationship with the Shrek Academy, and the events this time also had a decisive effect. One might say they saved emperor Xue Ye and the Heaven Dou imperial family. Even though emperor Xue Ye didn\u2019t pass on any excessive rewards, he naturally wouldn\u2019t forget this favor. Viewing it from another angle, compared to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, such a young sect was easier to control for the Heaven Dou imperial family. As long as the Tang Sect made enough contributions to the empire, their position in Heaven Dou would be sure to be unshakeable.</p><br/><p>With these deep thoughts, Tang San grew even thirstier for improving his own strength. No matter the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s bearing towards him in the future, without the foundation of formidable strength, all this was an illusion. And in order to deal with Spirit Hall, he equally needed to draw on the vast manpower and resources of the Heaven Dou empire. Since the Tang Sect had chosen to attach itself to the Heaven Dou empire, their future relationship would require sharing both peace and hardship.</p><br/><p>As for the incumbent crown prince Xue Beng, Tang San was on the contrary not worried. Even after he took the throne after emperor Xue Ye passed away in the future, as long as he wasn\u2019t an idiot, the structure wouldn\u2019t change. Always suppressed by Qian Renxue posing as Xue Qinghe, but always able to stay alive, one could imagine how deep he had hidden. Even though such a person wasn\u2019t easy to deal with, at least he would be a qualified ruler. Even if the Heaven Dou Empire didn\u2019t continue ten thousand steps down the road, secretly relocating the Tang Sect wasn\u2019t anything difficult. Don\u2019t forget that the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 boss, Evil Eye White Tiger Dai Mubai, was the crown prince of Star Luo empire.</p><br/><p>On the way back to the sect, Tang San thought about many things. After one by one arranging all kinds of things in his heart, he felt even more deeply that Grandmaster stood tall and saw far. Him leaving for a while could not only ease the tensions between Heaven Dou Empire and Spirti Hall, but moreover also avert him becoming the target of numerous arrows if he stayed. Who could say whether Spirit Hall would send experts to assassinate him?</p><br/><p>And right now Spirit Hall at least weren\u2019t too clear about the Tang Sect he had established. As long as he left, it would be even easier for the Tang Sect to enter a phase of smooth development. With the backing of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the imperial family, him not being present was basically not a problem.</p><br/><p>Having thought all this through, Tang San had also resolved to go on a journey for a while. Improving his strength and steadily developing the Tang Sect was the best choice. Extremism would only lead to ruin.</p><br/><p>Even if the current Clear Sky School already possessed six Title Douluo level powers, after listening to what Sword Douluo Chen Xin said that day, Tang San truly understood why his grandfather would choose to retreat back then. At present the Clear Sky School might be said to possess the greatest strength in a hundred years, with six Title Douluo. But in fact, besides sect master Tang Xiao, the other five elders were only just Title Douluo. With their age it was basically impossible to attack the heights above the ninety fifth rank. Even Tang Xiao might not reach the ninety ninth rank within fifty years. How could this contend against Spirit Hall? Who knew how many exceptional powers hid within Spirit hall?</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, Tang San had already led Xiao Wu back to the Tang Sect. Just as he entered the great gates, he heard someone screaming,</p><br/><p>\u201cAaa\u2014\u2014 Sister Chenxiang, you can\u2019t do this to me! Even if you don\u2019t agree, you still can\u2019t beat me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei, who\u2019s youre sister Chenxiang? Why don\u2019t you drop dead, you damned fatty, you have the impertinence to go talk drivel with grandpa, I won\u2019t play with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing a round massive shadow thrown in his direction, Tang San couldn\u2019t help but display a slight smile. Right hand waving and warding, he shifted the impulse of the object to the side. Before he had finished his movement, an incomparably swift white silhouette had already reached him, one foot kicking at that massive shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you singing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat helplessly pulled Ma Hongjun aside, that plump figure was naturally this fatty. Ma Hongjun was intelligent and hastily dodged, hiding behind Tang San and Xiao Wu, furtively glancing at that white silhouette already standing in front of Tang San, Speed Hall master Bai He\u2019s granddaughter Bai Chenxiang.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang crossed her arms at her waist with a seething appearance. Because of anger, her charming face had two smears of captivating red, like rouge, making her even more beautiful.</p><br/><p>Seeing Fatty hide behind Tang San and Xiao Wu, she still didn\u2019t agree to drop it,</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned fatty, get out here. If you have the skill, don\u2019t hide behind the sect master. Cousin, you have to be the judge for me. This damned fatty wants to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed out loud, hastily saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll judge. Cool your temper first, then tell me what bloody atrocity Fatty has committed to make you so furious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun swiftly stuck his head out, and was just about to speak up, but was forced back by Bai Chenxiang\u2019s fierce glare. It was strange, really. Even though Ma Hongjun was ordinarily cheerful and easygoing, his heart was actually as hard as iron. Among the Shrek Seven Devils, he only feared Dai Mubai and Tang San. To outsiders, he wouldn\u2019t agree to be at a disadvantage. But confronted with Bai Chenxiang\u2019s pouting glare he was actually speechless, with an appearance of grabbing his ears and scratching his chin.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang pouted angrily:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damned fatty actually went to my grandfather to propose marriage. And my grandfather actually agreed. And even wanted me to be nicer to him. Cousin, you have to judge on my behalf. This damned fatty clearly doesn\u2019t have good intentions. I\u2019d rather marry pigs or dogs than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Bai Chenxiang, Tang San also couldn\u2019t help staring blankly. Fatty going to Bai He to propose marriage was something he could understand, even if Fatty\u2019s methods were a bit direct, but if he could have Bai He\u2019s approval he could naturally do half the work for twice the effect. But what puzzled Tang San was why Bai He would agree. And agree without even consulting Bai Chenxiang. This was a bit strange.</p><br/><p>In fact, even if Bai Chenxiang couldn\u2019t compare to Xiao Wu, she was still an outstanding beauty, and her scope was naturally extremely high. Fatty\u2019s figure wasn\u2019t particularly pleasing either. Could it be because Fatty was a Tang Sect hall master? Impossible. Bai He was even previously the Speed Clan chief, and also his granduncle.</p><br/><p>Seeing Bai Chenxiang close to tears, Tang San hastily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cChenxiang. Did granduncle really agree to you two marrying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang nodded sharply,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what potion this damned fatty poured into grandfather, but he actually really agreed. I went to argue with grandfather, and grandfather even said that he is a good person, and that getting along would become habit, and to think about his good points. What good points does this damned fatty have? Pork?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun couldn\u2019t quite hold back,</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Chenxiang, you can\u2019t say that! I have a lot of good points. Everyone praises me as a young gentleman untainted by even a speck of dust, an honest and reliable elegant youth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei\u2014\u2014 I think your cheek is three times thicker than the city walls. Absolutely shameless. I\u2019ve never seen anyone as shameless as you. Humph, anyway, I\u2019m not marrying you. Not even if grandfather agreed. At worst I\u2019ll just run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat helplessly shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, sister Chenxiang, don\u2019t be upset. I\u2019ll go chat with granduncle. As long as you don\u2019t want it, nobody will force you. Not Fatty either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked at Tang San with wide eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, isn\u2019t your elbows turned the wrong way, I\u2019ve finally managed to get elder Bai\u2019s approval.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shot Fatty a meaningful glance,</p><br/><p>\u201cFeelings go two ways, don\u2019t tell me you really want to force Chenxiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun stared blankly a moment. He and Tang San had been together for a long time, and seeing Tang San\u2019s expression, he had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang clearly relaxed a lot, looking at Tang San and Xiao Wu next to him, then again fiercely glaring at Fatty, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I\u2019ll ask for your help with this. No matter what, if you judge on my behalf, we can agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as I said, as long as you don\u2019t want it, nobody will force you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang left happily. Tang San was the sect master of Tang Sect, his words naturally weighed very heavily.</p><br/><p>Once Bai Chenxiang had bounced off, Ma Hongjun couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San glanced at him, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cForcefully twisted melons aren\u2019t sweet. Even though your methods are direct, you can\u2019t act be overeager, otherwise you\u2019ll have the opposite result. Didn\u2019t granduncle agree to you two? Thus, the only resistance to wooing Chenxiang is herself. I will help you, but whether you can gain her affection is still up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty nodded forcefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, I\u2019m sincere this time. I guarantee I\u2019ll be good to her. I\u2019ll listen to you, I will definitely move her with my sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he said so, his expression was clearly a bit disappointed. Evidently, even he himself wasn\u2019t too optimistic. In terms of appearance, he really didn\u2019t match Bai Chenxiang.</p><br/><p>Tang San lowered his voice, speaking a few sentences next to Ma Hongjun\u2019s ears. Ma Hongjun was stunned at first, but in a moment turned from grief to happiness,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cAmong us Shrek Seven Devils, just you still don\u2019t have a place to return to. If I can help you I will. However, as I said, success still depends on you yourself. Keep in mind that true friends are revealed through trials and tribulations. Remember how little Ao got Rongrong\u2019s affection? Take out your sincere feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the excitedly pondering Ma Hongjun, Tang San brought Xiao Wu back the the sect master\u2019s mansion, and ordered sect disciples to call over the hall masters.</p><br/><p>Before long, Speed Hall master bai He, Medicine Hall master yang Wudi, Defense Hall master Niu Gai, Strength Hall master Tai Tan, as well as Martial hall master Ma Hongjun and the equally ranked Ning Rongrong and Oscar all arrived in the sect master mansion\u2019s discussion hall.</p><br/><p>Tang San sat in the main seat, everyone else sitting after saluting him one by one. The sect had the rules of a sect, and this etiquette was something the four single attribute clan chiefs had demanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHall master Tai, what is elder Lou Gao busy with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San saw that Lou Gao didn\u2019t come with Tai Tan, and asked him.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Gao, that old fellow, he\u2019s even more obsessed with forging than I am. These days he really doesn\u2019t pay any attention to outside matters, supervising the Strength Hall disciples in forging all day. However, with his directions, I can also relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, then turned towards everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cAt present our Tang Sect can be considered having stepped onto the right track. Before long, the first patch of hidden weapons will be complete. For the moment we have no plans to recruit disciples. Calling everyone over this time is mainly to discuss something with you. I talked to Grandmaster today. At present us Shrek Seven Devils have all reached bottlenecks to some degree, and in order to keep progressing, we need to take alternative routes. I\u2019m planning to temporarily leave the Tang Sect business to you elders, and go on a journey somewhere that suits cultivation for a while. Not only i will go. Rongrong, Oscar, and ma Hongjun will all go with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Defense hall master Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cPutting effort into cultivating is a good thing. However, sect master, how long will you be gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. There are certain dangers where we\u2019re going. It\u2019s places that can give us pressure that are more advantageous to the advancement of our strength. As for how long before we can return, I can\u2019t say. As for logistics, with both Rongrong and Oscar away with me, I\u2019ll ask school master Ning and his Majesty to look after the Tang Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San say he didn\u2019t know how long he would be gone, the four elders were all a bit quiet. After a long time, Yang Wudi took the lead to speak up:</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, you all go. Leave the Tang Sect to us. Where the Tang Sect is, we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke like he did about his Soulbreaking Spear. Where the person was, the spear was, if the spear broke, the person died. Even if Yang Wudi wasn\u2019t talkative, his words carried a great deal of weight.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, we understand. You\u2019re going to cultivate to grow stronger, to contend against Spirit Hall in the future. However, you can\u2019t forget that, as the master of the Tang Sect, great responsibility lies with you. The Tang Sect can\u2019t be a headless dragon for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, paraphrasing what Grandmaster said about the current situation on the Continent,</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand all of your concern. Elder Yang once confronted the enemies from Spirit Hall with me. I believe all of you understand the immense power that Spirit hall possesses. No matter what point of view, we are at an absolute disadvantage. The Tang Sect needs powers, and if we, the young generation, can\u2019t grow quickly, we will be in an even more passive situation in the future. I\u2019ve already thought it over clearly, and I believe that no matter what dangers we face, we will definitely return safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking deeply for a moment, Tai Tan resolutely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen good. Sect master, leave without worries. Leave the Tang Sect to us. We\u2019ll combine the Medicine Hall\u2019s medicaments and our Strength Hall\u2019s hidden weapons like we discussed, making a batch of excellent hidden weapons. We\u2019ll first equip the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, then ourselves. What we manufacture beyond that we\u2019ll sell to the Heaven Dou imperial family. We\u2019ll need a very long time to manufacture large quantities of hidden weapons. I believe that, once you return, our Tang Sect will truly be established.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI talked it over with Teacher. In the future our Tang Sect will only recruit disciples tested through the Shrek Academy, and with Teacher\u2019s recommendation. Like this we can maintain the quality of our disciples. With Ma Hongjun away with me, Martial Hall will temporarily be left to uncle Niu Ben\u2019s charge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the second generation of the four single attribute clans, Niu Ben was the most outstanding one.</p><br/><p>The next discussion revolved around the future development direction of the Tang Sect and the surrounding details. Tang San wasn\u2019t preparing to leave for just a short time, and before he left he had to clearly talk over his thoughts with the four elders, and guarantee that the Tang Sect would be healthy in this time.</p><br/><p>Just as Grandmaster said, the Tang Sect had already stepped onto the right track. Whether the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School or the Heaven Dou imperial family, they would both unconditionally support the Tang Sect. How far the Tang Sect would go in the future, still depended on what accomplishments Tang San and the others could produce. A sect with a Title Douluo was entirely different from one without, and a sect with an exceptional Title Douluo was even more so. The Shrek Seven Devils all possessed enormous potential, and how to transform that potential into strength enough to contend with Spirit Hall was the biggest problem Tang San faced.</p><br/><p>At nightfall, Tang San had already return to his house with a sleeping Xiao Wu in his arms, and was just about to start cultivating when he heard the sound of footsteps outside. A low voice asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, are you resting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San left the bedroom, reaching the drawing room outside,</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yang, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had long ago guessed that Yang Wudi would come find him, he just didn\u2019t know when.</p><br/><p>Yang Wudi pushed open the door and entered. His nature was always very direct, just like his Soulbreaking Spear,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San gestured him to sit,</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, please speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Wudi didn\u2019t sit, standing there muttering to himself for a moment, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you found it very strange how I could cure emperor Xue Ye\u2019s poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumably the poison is related to Medicine Hall. Or perhaps I should say to elder\u2019s Breaking Clan. It doesn\u2019t matter. If elder doesn\u2019t want to speak, then don\u2019t. I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Wudi shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I have to tell you about this. I don\u2019t want the Tang Sect\u2019s future relationship with the Heaven Dou empire to be affected because of a Breaking Clan traitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraitor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched, already making a rough guess.</p><br/><p>Yang Wudi\u2019s eyes revealed a trace of frustration, the first time Tang San had seen such an expression from this staunch old man,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, emperor Xue Ye\u2019s poison was made by our Medicine Hall. Or perhaps I should say it\u2019s a taboo poison of the Breaking Clan, called Gorgeous Seven Colors[3]. Such a poison is made from seven originally harmless medicines mixed together. Its greatest feature is how it hides. Because the seven materials used to make it are harmless themselves, they can be successively introduced according to a certain prescription. Even the most cautious person will end up infected. Moreover, if the food is filled with the seven kinds of materials, it will be immediately poisonous. Just at the beginning it\u2019s not violent, but the poisoned will be in constant pain, Gorgeous Seven Colors will constantly erode the vitality of the victim, until their life ends.</p><br/><p>[1] Devil Island - () \u201cDevil Ghost Island\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Sea God Island - ()</p><br/><p>[3] Gorgeous Seven Colors - () \u201cSeven Colored Gorgeous\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Relying purely on physical momentum, it was impossible to break the Blue Silver Prisons. And that control system Spirit Master and the support system woman behind them were even more firmly restrained. Through clever control, Tang San used Blue Silver Prisons to directly cut off their line of sight. Even though this spirit ability couldn\u2019t prevent them from using their spirit abilities, with their vision obstructed, how could they assist their teammates?</p><br/><p>The Heaven Dou Imperial Academy\u2019s five assault members ran into Blue Silver Prisons and their forward momentum naturally stopped. But right now was when the attack of Dai Mubai\u2019s trio reached its peak.</p><br/><p>Those five Blue Silver Prisons only appeared for an instant, blocking the five power attack system Spirit Masters\u2019 charge then instantly fading away. But black Blue Silver Grass already engulfed their legs from below, in the blink of an eye completing Binding. By combining and switching abilities, Tang San didn\u2019t give the opponents any chance to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Tiger Meteor Shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai shouted and all the tiger stripes on his overbearing body became golden, with a roaring sound, golden light burst out, countless fist sized golden balls of light appeared with him as the center, and instantly locked on and blasted the opponents head on.</p><br/><p>Tai Long also took advantage of the opportunity to grab his opponent who was struggling in the Blue Silver Grass, heaving him up high and heavily smashing him down on the ground. And Huang Yuan was like a sandstorm in front of his opponent, his attacks pouring down like howling wind and torrential rain.</p><br/><p>Was Blue Silver Grass so easy to throw off? After the nourishment of the fourth spirit ring, and a ten thousand year spirit ring at that, the current Blue Silver Grass had already reached a terrifying degree of toughness. Through the thorns its poison flowed into these universally thirty fifth ranked Spirit Masters. Being bound by Tang San\u2019s initial move, struggling free was no doubt a pipe dream to them.</p><br/><p>Control system Spirit Masters restrained the majority of other Spirit Master systems, and Tang San\u2019s spirit power and spirit abilities were even more beyond these opponents. Further adding their distraction at the start, the moment Blue Silver Grass twisted around them, the outcome of this battle was already set.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu and Jing Ling had now also reached their chosen opponents. Jing Ling\u2019s target was that petite control system Spirit Master. He wasn\u2019t as fast as Zhu Zhuqing, but as an agility attack system Spirit Master it was already astonishing. While moving like the wind, his whole body had transformed into a bulky skeleton, appearing exceptionally terrifying. His large hands had turned into two bone knives, and as he arrived in front of that control system Spirit Master he already directly unleashed his third spirit ability, Mad Battle.</p><br/><p>Attack speed and attack power simultaneously rose by fifty percent. Just as the Blue Silver Prison disappeared, the two bone knives chopped directly at the opponent like a whirlwind.</p><br/><p>That petite man\u2019s spirit was a Ring, categorized as a Tool Spirit, his control relied mainly on this ring, but needed time to use high level spirit abilities. If he had power attack system Spirit Masters to block the enemy offensive for him, that bit of time wasn\u2019t much. However, as he himself was restrained by that Blue Silver Prison, his heart was already in disorder. Right now, where would there still be time to launch spirit abilities? Helplessly, he could only use his first and second spirit ability to strengthen the Ring\u2019s attributes and block.</p><br/><p>Hundred year spirit abilities clashing with a thousand year spirit ability, it was no contest.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu and Tang San no doubt had the deepest mutual understanding. When Xiao Wu was still five meters away from that auxiliary system Spirit Master, Tang San already withdrew the Blue Silver Prison. He didn\u2019t even use Blue Silver Grass to bind the opponent. After all, that was only an auxiliary system Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>Teleportation, Soft Skill, Waist Bow. Xiao Wu\u2019s motions were like moving clouds and flowing water, being derided and insulted before, her Waist Bow was ruthless. Slender thighs coiled around the opponent\u2019s neck, throwing her up into the air.</p><br/><p>A loud miserable shriek rose practically simultaneously over the stage, and as the female Support Spirit Master was caught by Xiao Wu\u2019s graceful backwards somersault, the blood curdling shriek cut in half as she already fainted. As for just how many bones she broke, that was something only Xiao Wu knew.</p><br/><p>Skeleton Spirit Master Jing Ling was ordinarily cold, but this attack was extremely fierce. With Tang San\u2019s cooperation, the agility attack system Spirit Master could exhibit his full attack power, and the opponent\u2019s Ring was basically unable to keep up with his attack speed. A moment later, blood blossomed in all directions, and a miserable shriek rose. If it hadn\u2019t been for the tournament banning killing, his attack would have been even fiercer, striking directly at the vitals.</p><br/><p>As for the five power attack system Spirit Masters, their physique was no doubt valiant, but they confronted three who were even more powerful.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai took on three opponents alone, and as his White Tiger Meteor Shower fell on the opponents, the outcome was already completely without suspense, let alone when the three were already caught in Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Grass Binding. Tiger paws swung in succession, and miserable shrieks, sounds of snapping bones, and blood blossomed in all directions.</p><br/><p>Blitz, this word was very simple, but to the Shrek Academy team it was a secret signal, representing precisely a burst assault. Without holding back anything. Relying on accurate control, Tang San didn\u2019t participate in the attack, but he successfully fulfilled the proper responsibilities of a control system Spirit Master. Controlling the battlefield, controlling the enemy, and also controlling his own side so his team members could reveal their full strength.</p><br/><p>Originally there was a gap between the two sides, but this gap was only in that Tang San and Dai Mubai were Spirit Ancestors, and not decisive. If it had been a head on confrontation, while the Shrek Academy side would still have won, the battle would also have lasted a while. But Tang San\u2019s moves didn\u2019t give the other side the chance to catch their breath, letting his side open up with an assault of their most powerful spirit abilities, the instantly arising burst power basically didn\u2019t give the opponents time to react before they were already drowned in attacks like howling wind and torrential rain.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, we concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy second team\u2019s coach saw that their circumstances were far from reassuring, he hastily threw in a white towel. In addition he quickly went on stage, preventing the Shrek Academy team from continuing.</p><br/><p>The referee had already been stunned since as early as when the White Tiger Meteor Shower\u2019s dazzling light appeared. Let alone a match between academies, even if it was a spirit battle in the Great Spirit Arena, it would still be rare for such a miserable scene to appear. Heavens, were these really students?</p><br/><p>Right now, all the eighty thousand spectators in the Great Spirit Arena were completely silent. If previously the Shrek Academy team members\u2019 clothes had been the target of their ridicule, then by now those snot green uniforms seemed dazzling.</p><br/><p>Without the least suspense. This really was a match without the least suspense. Or it might be described as a unilateral massacre. But the target of extermination wasn\u2019t the Shrek Academy as they\u2019d thought, but rather the target of their hopes, the symbol of Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s imperial family, Heaven Dou Imperial Academy\u2019s second team.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze coldly swept across the audience, seemingly using his expression to tell them who the strong was. Shrek\u2019s seven, using their own tyrannical strength, had choked all insults to them. Contempt or disdain, these expressions had disappeared long ago. What remained was only shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cReferee, I must file a complaint. They basically weren\u2019t competing, but murdering. They\u2019ve violated the rules of the competition. I demand they be judged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing each and every one of his team members covered in blood, bones broken and tendons snapped, the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy coach snarled at the referee.</p><br/><p>The referee had already come back to himself, and immediately gazed strictly at the Shrek Academy team members.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cRespected referee, I only want to ask you one thing: Are they dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee looked distracted a moment, turning his head to look at the seven members of the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy second team on the ground. Indeed, even though these seven were all severely injured, they still breathed and shouldn\u2019t be in danger of dying.</p><br/><p>Tang San indicated Jiang Zhu behind him,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ability of our auxiliary system Spirit Master is healing. She deployed her spirit at the beginning, releasing the healing capability. This healing ability is enough to cover the whole stage. That wasn\u2019t in order to heal us, but rather for them. If we really wanted to kill them, would we heal the opponents? But it seems they don\u2019t need our healing. Senior Jiang Zu, stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s voice was very loud, and he carefully amplified his voice with spirit power to spread across the whole arena, letting everyone hear.</p><br/><p>Letting their side\u2019s Spirit Master heal the opponents from the beginning, what kind of contempt was that? But the Shrek Academy really revealed enough strength to justify such contempt.</p><br/><p>The referee looked at this side, then again at that side, and for a moment he also didn\u2019t seem to know just how to call it. At this moment, another two referees ran up, and after the three bowed their heads to talk it over, the first referee loudly declared,</p><br/><p>\u201cPreselection competition first round, first match, Shrek Academy\u2019s victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a one minute victory.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014, the audience instantly erupted in an enormous discussion. For a moment there were doubtful voices, praising voices, even more were still just shocked. The grand Heaven Dou Imperial Academy\u2019s second team was actually smashed in under a minute by some unknown Spirit Master team. The shock it produced was really too large.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye stood up with an ashen complexion, his gaze falling on the despondent prince Xue Xing. With a cold snort, he brushed with his sleeves and left.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi followed emperor Xue Ye from the VIP section with a smile on his face, but platinum bishop Salas still sat pondering in his seat, reflecting on something.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>In the seats specially furnished for competing academy spectators, Flender stood up with a smile across his face, saying to Grandmaster and Liu Erlong:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong distrustfully asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Fu, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little monsters have made such an outstanding display, and the advertisement on our clothing has been revealed. I think that some people with a little bit of insight should have seen the power of our Shrek Academy. I still need to properly consider the advertisement, opening at a high price, to earn a bit of money for the Academy. This time I think it\u2019ll be impossible for our Academy\u2019s reputation not to spread.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pulling on the lapels of his clothes, he meticulously arranged the Academy symbol to reveal it clearly. Flender didn\u2019t know how long it had been since he vented his anger like now. He had never forgotten the humiliation from that time at Heaven Dou Imperial Academy, and this moment the stifling haze in his heart had been swept away. He clearly understood that Tang San and Dai Mubai leading the students to defeat the opponents in such a thunderous manner, even to the extent that they used their fourth spirit abilities to pursue complete victory, wasn\u2019t because they were angry with the opponents, but rather for him, to rinse the resentment of Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heaven Dou Imperial Academy, that dog fart prince Xue Xing, want to chase us off? Fine, then we won\u2019t let you pass the qualifying rounds.\u2019</p><br/><p>Practically each of the seven members from the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy second team before had broken bones, those weren\u2019t injuries that could heal in a few days. Lacking this seven member main force, how could the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy second team still reveal their talent in the preselection competition?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t been as joyous as he was today for quite a while. At this moment, the always avaricious Flender even considered whether to give all the advertising income to the little monsters.</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, you\u2019re too ferocious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty greeted Tang San with a bear hug,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if that Heaven Dou Imperial Academy still dares look down on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we also revealed strength. The later teams will certainly draw up tactics to counter us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn front of absolute strength, even better tactics might not be useful. If it really won\u2019t do, we might as well put the whole Shrek Seven Devils on stage and let them have a good look.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he pulled at the uniform he wore,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s snot green? As long as we can win, color is no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll return to the Academy first. I don\u2019t want to have people standing around in a circle watching us later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai called out to everyone, quickly bringing the Shrek Academy team into the competitor passage, quietly departing the stadium.</p><br/><p>In order to keep from being the focal point, after returning to the rest area, everyone without the slightest hesitation changed out of their snot green uniforms, putting on their own clothes to leave the Great Spirit Arena. Since they left very quickly, when they left the Great Spirit Arena the spectator seats had only just started emptying. Today was after all only the beginning, tomorrow was when the preselection competition would truly begin. And when the round robin tournament went into motion, it would take up a full month of matches.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils now finally understood more and more clearly the benefit of Grandmaster\u2019s special training. With the previous experience of a month of continuous matches at Suotuo Great Spirit Arena, the competition now about to unfold was even a bit relaxed compared to then.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek party was just moving away from the Great Spirit Arena and preparing to directly return to the Academy, when they were stopped by a familiar voice.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi, changed into ordinary clothing, stood in a corner not far from the entrance, waving a hand in their direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong excitedly ran over, throwing herself into her father\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Meeting this Seven Treasure Glazed Tile school master, Oscar couldn\u2019t help appearing somewhat artificial.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi pulled Ning Rongrong\u2019s hand and walked over,</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Shrek Academy\u2019s little friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had been far away, the Shrek Seven Devils and the four substitute team members had all recognized this school master, and hastily saluted.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be formal, right now I\u2019m only Rongrong\u2019s father, don\u2019t consider me a school master. I\u2019m only your senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi\u2019s amicability doubtlessly gave a favorable impression to the Shrek Academy team members. Ning Fengzhi\u2019s gaze fell on Tang San, and he smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, little San. I didn\u2019t expect you would actually already possess a ten thousand year spirit ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ning\u2019s praise is too much. Rongrong has also already obtained her fourth spirit ring. Only to conserve strength we didn\u2019t let her appear today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi nodded with a smile, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about you all. Perhaps you will only meet a true opponent in the finals. However, even though you have strength, you still need to guard against pride and impatience. I understand the reason you injured your opponents today, but the less such circumstances appear later, the better. After all, Shrek Academy is also one of the advanced Spirit Master academies. Antagonizing too many others is no good. You don\u2019t need to worry about the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy. I\u2019ve already informed his majesty. His majesty is extremely displeased with prince Xue Xing\u2019s way of handling things back then. If it wasn\u2019t because signups can\u2019t be altered after the fact, his majesty would still be of a mind to invite you to Heaven Dou Imperial Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very happy at Shrek Academy. Thank you, uncle Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be the one to thank you. The quality of your hidden weapons is excellent, if there\u2019s any new research later, make sure to come find uncle first. You set the conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Ning Fengzhi released his daughter\u2019s hand, rubbing her head and saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back to your Academy comrades. You\u2019re a member of Shrek Academy, while dad is a member of the organizational committee. I can\u2019t be together with you much, or people will say I\u2019m biased.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong pouted resentfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet them talk, we\u2019ll speak with strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cAt fourteen you\u2019re also considered a young lady, you can\u2019t be so mischievous. Well, before leaving, won\u2019t you introduce me to your comrades?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Fengzhi\u2019s expectant expression, besides the Shrek Seven Devils, of the four substitutes only Tai Long could keep calm. The light in the eyes of the other three was somewhat fiery.</p><br/><p>Who was this in front of them? The school master of one of the three upper sects, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School could be called a paradise that countless Spirit Masters yearned for. Not only was its reputation in the Spirit Master world extremely good, and its strength robust, at the same time it was reputed as the richest school in the Spirit Master world. If a Spirit Master could attach himself to this school, there would be nothing to worry about for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s gaze swept across her companions, and as her gaze met Oscar\u2019s, she couldn\u2019t keep her heart from beating a bit faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, this sister Jiang Zhu is our senior, thirty fifth ranked healing system Tool Spirit Elder. Just now she was also on the stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhu hastily bowed to Ning Fengzhi,</p><br/><p>\u201cIn front of school master Ning, how dare junior call herself an auxiliary system Spirit Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly. Even though he was already past fifty, he only appeared to be perhaps thirty, and that mature charm made Jiang Zhu bow her head, not daring to look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Jiang Zhu\u2019s spirit is extremely peculiar, as long as you focus on expanding in the healing system, your future will certainly be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for your directions, school master Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words, Jiang Zhu\u2019s downturned face turned a bit scarlet. She was already nineteen, and truly a grown young lady. To a girl like this, formidable strength and mature charm held the greatest attraction. When she raised her head to look at Ning Fengzhi again, she couldn\u2019t help blushing even more.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong continued with the introductions:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis senior Huang Yuan\u2019s spirit is Lone Wolf, thirty fifth ranked power attack system Battle Spirit Elder. Senior Jing Ling, spirit is Skeleton, agility attack system Battle Spirit Master. You\u2019ve met big brother Tai Long, a direct descendant of the Strength Clan, thirty eighth ranked pure strength type Battle Spirit Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with Ning Rongrong\u2019s introductions, Ning Fengzhi nodded to each one and gave a few words of encouragement.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong now reached the introductions of their Shrek Seven Devils, and pointed to Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Dai, the eldest brother of our Shrek Seven Devils, and also the team captain. His nickname is Evil Eye White Tiger. Even though Dai Mubai is only seventeen this year, he\u2019s already a forty fourth ranked Battle Spirit Ancestor. Power attack system. His strength is the greatest among us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s mood didn\u2019t show any change because of Ning Fengzhi\u2019s appearance, his evil eyes looking straight at the school master as he spoke:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dare call myself the strongest. In a duel, I couldn\u2019t beat little San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventeen years old and forty fourth rank? Really a little monster. Ning Fengzhi didn\u2019t conceal his admiration,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now I saw your whole battle. Young man, your spirit and spirit abilities are all outstanding. At seventeen you already have such achievements, it truly makes me gasp in admiration. I don\u2019t know whether you are willing to come take a place at our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School after this tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Fengzhi toss out an invitation to Dai Mubai, the other Huang Yuan, Jing Ling and Jiang Zhu couldn\u2019t help having somewhat envious expressions.</p><br/><p>But to their surprise, Dai Mubai shook his head with a calm expression, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior appreciates school master Ning\u2019s kind intentions. If there\u2019s an opportunity in the future I will certainly visit the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t outright refuse going to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, his first sentence was no doubt a rebuff of Ning Fengzhi\u2019s invitation.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi seemed to recall something as he looked at Dai Mubai\u2019s double pupils, and somewhat pondering said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil Eye White Tiger, eh, so it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai understood that Ning Fengzhi had already seen through his background. Fortunately, Ning Fengzhi was observed his words, and didn\u2019t reveal it, only smiling at him somewhat mysteriously,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all Rongrong\u2019s companions. If there\u2019s anything the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School can do for you, just come find me at the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong next pointed at Oscar,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s called Oscar, second oldest of the Shrek Seven Devils, forty first ranked food system Tool Spirit Ancestor, his spirit is Sausage.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason her voice was somewhat weak when she introduced Oscar, her flickering gaze didn\u2019t dare meet Oscar\u2019s eyes, and her heartbeat constantly sped up.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi looked at Oscar, inwardly praising such a handsome youth,</p><br/><p>\u201cFood system? May I know how old you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar suppressed his nervousness with difficulty, and replied deferentially:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixteen this year, one year younger than boss Dai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi was gobsmacked, even more than when he found out Dai Mubai was forty fourth rank. As a great scholar level figure in the auxiliary system, how could he be unaware of the difficulties in cultivating as a food system Spirit Master? If an outstanding auxiliary system Spirit Master could be said to bring out the best in a team, then an outstanding food system Spirit Master was enough to substantially increase an entire army\u2019s battle sustainability. Let alone meeting, he had never even heard about a sixteen year old forty first ranked food system Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Fengzhi\u2019s shocked gaze, Oscar was inwardly a little bit satisfied, calming somewhat. He rushed to speak before Ning Fengzhi could,</p><br/><p>\u201cSchool master Ning, I\u2019ve always admired you. As another auxiliary system, could I have the privilege of joining the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School after graduation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter escaped from Ma Hongjun to the side, thinking, \u2018Do you admire school master Ning, or adore his daughter!\u2019</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi secretly exulted. Knowing Dai Mubai\u2019s identity, he naturally understood he wouldn\u2019t join his school. But from his daughter\u2019s introduction of these Shrek Seven Devils, they didn\u2019t seem to have any less terrifying talent. If he could recruit any one of them would be ideal, let alone such an outstanding food system Spirit Master. At such a moment he wouldn\u2019t put on any airs of the three upper sects, and hastily nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly what we\u2019ve been looking for. What the school needs the most are talented little brothers like you. The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s door will stand wide open for you at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong somewhat resentfully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, why do you call him little brother? Call him little Ao, otherwise the hierarchy will be mixed up, and how would I address him then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi laughed out loud, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, aren\u2019t I confused from excitement? Little Ao\u2019s future as food system Spirit Master is boundless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re already familiar with third brother, so I won\u2019t introduce him to you. He just has a spirit ring more than before, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi tapped his daughter\u2019s head,</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all\u2019? He already left me and his majesty unable to hide our shock. The fourth spirit ring being of the ten thousand year level doesn\u2019t seem like something that\u2019s been ever accomplished before. Even his father didn\u2019t have this kind of achievement. Ah, it\u2019s a pity, little San, it would\u2019ve been much better if you\u2019d been my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stuck out her tongue at her father,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do I make you lose face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would you? You are my little treasure. My point was that it would have been perfect to have a son like Tang San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, among these children, Tang San was the one Ning Fengzhi paid the most attention to and was most optimistic about. Even though he couldn\u2019t recruit Tang San because of his background, he would still maintain a good relationship with Tang San no matter what.</p><br/><p>Tang San scratched his head, but didn\u2019t speak up. In his heart appeared his father\u2019s mien, \u2018Dad, would you praise me like uncle Ning?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my fourth brother, we all call him Fatty. Is real name is Ma Hongjun. Forty first ranked power attack system Spirit Ancestor, his spirit is Fire Phoenix. Ning Rongrong continued with the next introductions.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Phoenix?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi\u2019s eyes brightened as he saw Ma Hongjun nod repeatedly. Among spirits, dragon and phoenix were both considered first rate. This little Fatty appeared a bit young, but still had forty first ranked strength. Ning Fengzhi couldn\u2019t help saying to his daughter:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, you wouldn\u2019t be telling me that all of your Shrek Seven Devils have already reached the fortieth rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong giggled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t, Xiao Wu still hasn\u2019t reached it. However, she didn\u2019t eat the immortal treasure herb third brother gave her, otherwise her rank would no doubt be higher than mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHello uncle Ning, don\u2019t you have another daughter as beautiful as Rongrong? If you do, I\u2019ll join the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School as long as you marry her to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His nature was always very straightforward, and what he said immediately had everyone roaring with laughter.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi helplessly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I only have my darling daughter Rongrong. If she wanted to marry you herself, I wouldn\u2019t have any objections.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was joking around, Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words weren\u2019t unconsidered. A power attack system Spirit Master with the Phoenix Spirit who broke through the fortieth rank as a teenager, in strength he really was entitled to his daughter\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just go find a beautiful wife first. Anyway, didn\u2019t you already say the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s doors would always stand wide open for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi nodded earnestly, his gaze sweeping across these children,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, each of you will be welcome at Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yuan couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cI as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School never refuses talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yuan, Jing Ling, and Jiang Zhu were ecstatic. They had found a good place to go before even graduating, what could be more exciting than this?</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu is little San\u2019s little sister. I think that wherever third brother goes, Xiao Wu will follow. Thirty seventh ranked close combat power attack system Battle Spirit Master. Big sister Xiao Wu\u2019s close combat strength is very powerful. Without using spirits, perhaps we would all be unable to defeat her. Even third brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu slightly bowed to Ning Fengzhi, but didn\u2019t say anything. Just like Ning Rongrong said, she was only interested in being together with Tang San.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong last introduced Zhu Zhuqing,</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuqing is a forty first ranked agility attack system Battle Spirit Master. She\u2019s together with boss Dai. I\u2019m afraid she wouldn\u2019t join our school. Only, Zhuqing, you definitely have to come with boss Dai to play at the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School later.\u201d</p><br/><p>When meeting other people, Zhu Zhuqing wasn\u2019t as cold as she was to Dai Mubai. Just like Xiao Wu, she slightly bowed to Ning Fengzhi.</p><br/><p>By now there were more and more spectators leaving the Great Spirit Arena. Ning Fengzhi said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad I could meet talented youths like you here today. Alright, you return to the Academy. Little San, can I speak to you alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Fengzhi ask to talk to him alone, Tang San was at first distracted a moment, but immediately agreed. No matter what else, in his eyes Ning Fengzhi was a venerable elder, and also Ning Rongrong\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong resentfully stuck out her tongue, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad really is biased, more concerned with third brother than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi laughed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI need your third brother for serious matters. Be a bit calm at the Academy, go quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Shrek Academy people all left, leaving only Tang San. Ning Fengzhi brought Tang San to the most bustling street of Heaven Dou City, Heavenly Emperor Street.</p><br/><p>While walking, Tang San asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ning, what did you need me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing you to see someone. After I learned of your background back at Shrek Academy, I made some inquiries into why your father originally vanished without a trace. This person knows some of it. Even though it\u2019s not the complete story, at least it\u2019s some news. Ai, even now I still feel sorry for your father. At that time he left the Spirit Master world just after reaching the Title Douluo stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>On hearing it was related to his father, Tang San\u2019s heart immediately tightened. Originally he hadn\u2019t wanted to have too much contact with Ning Fengzhi; after all, Ning Fengzhi was the master of a school, and also good to him. If he was determined to recruit him it wouldn\u2019t be too easy to refuse. But was he heard these words now, Tang San couldn\u2019t help feeling gratitude. This uncle Ning had apparently asked around for his sake, this concern wasn\u2019t only to win him over.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi brought Tang San straight to an antique tea house. The size of the teahouse didn\u2019t seem to be very large, only three stories with ancient decorations. At this hour there were only two or three customers inside, seeming very peaceful.</p><br/><p>The two reached an elegant room on the second floor, and pushing open a folding screen, Ning Fengzhi drew Tang San inside.</p><br/><p>There was only one person inside the room, and having heard the voices of the two arriving he had already stood up. This person appeared to be around seventeen or eighteen, and even though he wasn\u2019t as handsome as Oscar, he still had a straight nose and square mouth. He wore clean blue robes, giving people a very fresh and cool impression. A head of long black hair was tied up with blue cloth, and hung neatly behind his head.</p><br/><p>Even though his clothes were extremely ordinary, he still had a kind of extraordinary charisma. Looking at this person, Tang San couldn\u2019t help having a somewhat familiar feeling. But he was certain this was the first time he had met this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ning, you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth deferentially bowed to Ning Fengzhi.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cQinghe, I\u2019ve told you so many times, no need for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that do? You\u2019re a senior, and also Qinghe\u2019s teacher. If father learned I\u2019d been disrespectful to you, he might break my legs.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

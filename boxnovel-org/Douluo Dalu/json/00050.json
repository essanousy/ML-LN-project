At this point, a strand loosely wrapped around his waist gently pulled him back,</p><br/><p>allowing him to land, causing the Thunder Dragon Claw to barely miss Dai Mubai and pass overhead.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s Thunder Dragon Claw flashed across an additional 20 meters in the air before finally dissipating. As it passed through empty air, it would violently twist the air, giving menacing crackles.</p><br/><p>The fight really started with this crackling. As Dai Mubai landed, he didn\u2019t even pause for a moment, with Tang San in the middle of the formation[1], Shrek Seven Devil had already become used to fighting in this formation, combining their powers and fighting as one in order to narrow the gap that is their spirit levels.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai stuck his foot out, in an attempt to sweep kick the legs of both the currently advancing Shi brothers.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing and Xiao Wu at the same time, dodged to the sides, bypassing the Shi brothers and rushed toward the rear of the Emperior Team.</p><br/><p>The Shi brothers\u2019 shells noisily fell as both legs retracted into their shells within a hair\u2019s breadth of Dai Mubai\u2019s attack. Seeing that Dai Mubai would only kick the shells, the blue silver Grass wrapped around his waist again acted, pulling him back one meter, making his kick sweep the air instead.</p><br/><p>If Tang San only had the spirit Blue Silver Grass, he would not have been able to control every strand of blue-silver grass as skillfully as one controlled one\u2019s arms, after all, it is never easy to correctly control everything and produce good results. However, with the Tang Sect\u2019s Controlling Crane Catching Dragon skill, Tang San had complete control over everything going on on the stage.</p><br/><p>Before, when Dai Mubai\u2019s tiger claws hit the enemies\u2019 tortoise shells, Tang San saw everything clearly. He knew that the twin Black tortoise Spirit master\u2019s defensive abilities was not something that anyone on their team,with their current spirit power, could break through. If Dai Mubai had connected that kick on the shells, he would\u2019ve ended up hurting himself first.</p><br/><p>And as the only one with a spirit level anywhere close to the opponent\u2019s main force, Dai Mubai must not be so easily injured.</p><br/><p>When Yu Tian-Heng, who was in the air, saw his Thunder Dragon Claw failed to hit anything, he was momentarily shocked. Quickly recovering, with one foot stepping on the shells of the black tortoises\u2019 shells, he catapulted himself forward, rushing straight for Tang San behind Dai Mubai. the Blue Lightning Dragon\u2019s arm moved again and another Thunder Dragon Claw appeared, this time its target changing to Tang San.</p><br/><p>As the captain of the Emperor team, Yu Tian-Heng saw that the opponent\u2019s most important member was not Dai Mubai with the greatest Spirit level, but instead the one using Blue silver grass to wrap around every member\u2019s waist, the Control System Spirit Master, Thousand Hand Asura.</p><br/><p>As long as they destroy this weakness, then the Shrek Seven Devil's formation would crumble by itself.</p><br/><p>When Yu Tian-Heng shot out his Thunder Dragon Claw attack again, he was already facing Tang San on the battlefield. Yet he was surprised to find that the opponent\u2019s control system Spirit Master\u2019s eyes had completely turned purple. In addition to his quick footwork, his entire person seemed unreal.</p><br/><p>But in that mysterious footwork, his upper body was still, His entire person had already shifted 8 feet away, causing the Thunder Dragon Claw to noisily land on the ground.</p><br/><p>As Tang San was using his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Steps to shift away, his first spirit ring flashed and countless blue silver grass rose from the ground, wrapping around the airborne Yu Tian-Heng. At the same time, the blue-silver grass around Tang San\u2019s Teammates\u2019 waist suddenly taut. In a flash, a strange scene appeared on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>On the Emperor team\u2019s side, Osler, the black panther Spirit Master, jumped forward to receive Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s rush.</p><br/><p>Up in the air, the Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master\u2019s first spirit ring flashed, the wind whistling as he flew towards Xiao Wu, with arms which had transformed into wings[2], suddenly became razor sharp. Which was his first Spirit Ring Ability, \u201cWing Edge\u201d.</p><br/><p>And as these two Emperor Team\u2019s main offensive Spirit Masters were just about to close in on their opponents, without warning their opponents disappeared. Just before disappearing, Xiao Wu could still smile and wave at the wind Chimes Bird Spirit Master Yu Feng, obviously, this was all part of the plan.</p><br/><p>Two graceful figure was thrown into the air, not rushing forward, but flying backwards. Together with them was the Evil Eye Tiger Spirit Master Dai Mubai, who also retreated before the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 very faces. Shrek Seven Devil\u2019s three frontline attackers withdrew at the same time. All, with a common objective.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. We fell into their trap. Quickly, attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan\u2019s expression quickly changed. The Jade Phosphor Serpent\u2019s body quickly rushing forward. The other Emperor Team teammates also recognized a bad situation, but their reactions were slower by a moment.</p><br/><p>Purple flames surging from Ma Hongjun\u2019s body suddenly soared, this was closely followed by the two spirit rings around his body flashing. A stream of purple flame as thick as a man\u2019s thigh shot out straight towards the Blue Electric Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master Yu Tian-Heng.</p><br/><p>All that was happening was all in Tang San\u2019s calculations. Dai Mubai\u2019s attack was only to act as a bait and attract the opponent\u2019s attention. Knowing that the Shi brothers specialised in defense, their team had never expected Dai Mubai to be able to defeat the stone brothers quickly.</p><br/><p>Yet, when Tang San used the Blue Silver Grass to help Dai Mubai to evade the Thunder Dragon Claw, he wasn\u2019t afraid Dai Mubai wouldn\u2019t be able to take the attack, but most importantly, it was to let Yu Tian-Heng notice him.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng was fooled till the end. In other words, deep in his heart, he had underestimated these seemingly much weaker opponents and thus was careless. In addition to being misled by Xiao Wu and Zhu Zhuqings\u2019 rush attack, resulting in him making a fatal error, to wade in deep behind enemies\u2019 lines alone.</p><br/><p>Under his feet, the madly binding Blue Silver Grass was inescapable. In front of him, with an extreme heat, bringing his outrageously brilliant Phoenix Fire was the Phoenix Spirit Master lunging. Behind him, was the the Evil Eye White Tiger, the Soft Boned Demon Rabbit and the hell civet cat as the three main attackers who cut off any escape routes.</p><br/><p>The Yu Tian-Heng was already in a completely hopeless scenario.</p><br/><p>Before the battle, the Shrek Seven Devils came together and talked about their opponents in detail, but no matter how they analyzed it, they all understood that the opponents this time were much stronger than themselves. Based on competing in pure spirit power, it was physically impossible to win. Thus they had to rely on the strength of the team as a whole.</p><br/><p>The strongest in the Emperor team would be their strength attacker, the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon, Yu Tian-Heng. Not only was his spirit power the highest, he was also the Emperor team\u2019s captain. There was no doubt that his offensive strength was the sharpest point in their spear, and was even their team\u2019s morale. If the tip of this spear is broken, then there wouldn\u2019t be such a big gap in this Spirit Battle anymore.</p><br/><p>With his body in the air, Yu Tian-Heng couldn\u2019t escape Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Grass. Within moments, he was completely covered. Without caring about the Blue Silver Grass wrapping around him, he moved his right arm, shooting another Thunder Dragon Claw, which clashed with the Phoenix Fire Wire shot by Ma Hong-Jun.</p><br/><p>The resulting detonation sounded off a rolling thunder, scattering numerous purple sparks in all directions, just like a dazzling fireworks blooming.</p><br/><p>Although it was only Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s first spirit ability, his spirit power was much larger than that of Ma Hong-jun\u2019s. Thus, it only required his Thunder Dragon Claw to tear apart Ma Hongjun\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire attack.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng, naturally knew that he was in an extreme state of peril. Under the pressure of such danger, he released all his stored energy, both his third and second spirit ring flashed. At this moment, he didn\u2019t have any reservations, as long as he could break through this absolute kill plan, then this group spirit battle\u2019s victory would belong to Emperor Team.</p><br/><p>The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon raged into action with it\u2019s Thousand Year spirit ring ability. All of a sudden, a storm of blinding blue lightning burst forth from all around Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s body. Accompanied by the tremendous sound of an explosion, the Blue Silver Grass wrapped around his body instantly turned into ashes as it scattered in all directions..</p><br/><p>Thunder Fury[3], effect: within a certain period of time, the Blue Lightning tyrant Dragon Spirit Master would run wild. His lightning abilities were increased by a hundred percent and his spirit power was increased by fifty percent.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t take the initiative to stop the ability, it would continue until he exhausted his spirit power.</p><br/><p>But, everytime he used Thunder Fury, he would have to sacrifice a large amount of spirit power, also, it placed no small amount of burden on the body. It was a sink-or-swim situation, if it wasn\u2019t for this dangerous trap, Yu Tian-Heng would never so easily use his third spirit ability.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Grass itself was originally not conductive, but because the inherent power of Thunder Fury was too great, the Blue-Silver grass could not stop it\u2019s explosive energy.</p><br/><p>But as Thunder Fury was explosively released, a streak of purple flame suddenly bombarded Yu Tian-Heng in the chest. His Thunder Dragon Claw was, after all, only a first spirit ring ability. Although the Phoenix Fire Wire was blown apart, how could Fatty\u2019s Spirit variation\u2019s abilities be so easily dealt with. Here, the Phoenix Fire Wire showed its superiority with it\u2019s apparent endlessness. Taking advantage of opponent\u2019s momentary pause when the Blue silver grass was blasted away, the heavy bombardment had already landed on Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng howled loudly, but he ignored the Phoenix Fire Wire\u2019s bombardment and forcefully turned his body in mid air, turning around to face Dai Mubai and the other two who were charging at him from behind, shouting,</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Crash[4]!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the countless Snakes ot lightning coiling around his body expanded and exploded outwards into countless streaks of lightning flashing in all directions.</p><br/><p>This, was the real strength of Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s fully charged attack, under Lightning Fury\u2019s hundred percent increase, his second ability, Thunder Crash exploded out with unmatched strength.</p><br/><p>Initially as it exploded, it clashed with Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire breaking it and diverting majority of Thunder Crash towards Dai Mubai, Xiao Wu and Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng believed that as long as it was able to block them, maybe even injure them, then under the influence Thunder Fury, he would be able bring the opponents a large amount of destruction.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>But then, he basically didn\u2019t need to retreat, his companions would also reach this side of the battlefield, attacking and dispersing the opponents.</p><br/><p>Shrek Seven Devils were able to obtain a twenty seven bouts, twenty seven win record in Suotuo Great Spirit Arena, how could they be so easily beaten. Although Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit was immensely strong, right now he was a single soldier behind enemy lines, all alone.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing and Xiao Wu\u2019s silhouettes quietly vanished, disappearing behind Dai Mubai\u2019s back. The starting point of the Blue Silver Grass twisting around their waists was Tang San, when approaching Tang San, the three clearly would again close together, and this first priority was naturally due to Tang San\u2019s control with Blue Silver Grass.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai confronted Yu Tian-Heng from the front, Zhu Zhuqing and Xiao Wu taking the second and third places behind his back.</p><br/><p>And at the same time as Yu Tian-Heng released his third spirit ability Thunder Fury, Dai Mubai also equally released his thousand year spirit ring ability, White Tiger Vajra Transformation.</p><br/><p>His body, already made imposing from Spirit Body Enhancement, now swelled again, muscles swelling exaggeratedly, his clothes bursting completely, exposing a terrifying muscle outline, most bizarre were the black horizontal stripes that appeared on his skin.</p><br/><p>A pair of tiger paws again growing a size, the sharp blades ejecting on top becoming silver, and most peculiarly was his body becoming enveloped in an intense golden light, as if gilded. Blood red double pupils expressing a bloodthirsty light, all over wearing that kind of king among beasts aggressiveness.</p><br/><p>Dragon and Tiger, equal powers among spirits, even if Tiger was slightly inferior to Dragon, the gap was only a fine line, and Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit power when compared to Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s was also only one rank below, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>Accompanying a berserk tiger roar, the double pupils of Dai Mubai\u2019s evil eyes instantly united, a ball of dazzling white light released from under the golden light of White Tiger Vajra Transformation, the white light swelling in the air, reaching a diameter of two meters, just like a shooting star launching towards Yu Tian-Heng.</p><br/><p>Equally power attack system Spirit Masters, equally powerful spirits. Dai Mubai and Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s spirit abilities were somewhat similar, as White Tiger Light Wave under the effect of White Tiger Vajra Transformation met Thunder Crash under the effect of Thunder Fury, what would happen?</p><br/><p>Thunder arrow and intense light wave collided in the air with a loud bang. The entire spirit ring trembled violently a moment, the terrifying explosive force became an intense blast wave that flew out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Doudou hovered high in the air observing what went on down below, a burst of dazzling blue white light blossoming before her eyes, stupidly thought out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs, is this really a spirit fight between Spirit Elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Thunder Crash launched, Yu Tian-Heng was already falling to the floor. Dai Mubai equally dropped, the all out collision of spirit power and spirit abilities making the two practically simultaneously withdraw, Yu Tian Heng retreated three steps, but Dai Mubai only withdrew two steps. At the corner of the mouth both had a line of blood, clearly, in the confrontation just now Dai Mubai held the advantage.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t to say that Dai Mubai was capable of overpowering Yu Tian-Heng. Rather because Yu Tian-Heng had previously already suffered Fatty\u2019s flame attack, although Thunder Fury had counteracted the flame, Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire wasn\u2019t only more blazing than an equivalent flame, at the same time it had the adhering effect, right now Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s chest was already burnt pitch black.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, although Thunder Crash\u2019s attack power was terrifying, nevertheless it was intended to kill or injure, while Dai Mubai\u2019s attack was a shock blow. In spirit power density, clearly it was Dai Mubai\u2019s White Tiger Light Wave that held the advantage. Despite this, Yu Tian-Heng only retreated one more step than Dai Mubai, it could clearly be seen what kind of tyrannical existence the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon was.</p><br/><p>It was a pity Ning Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda presently didn\u2019t have any amplifying effect on spirit abilities, only amplifying strength and speed. Otherwise, with Dai Mubai\u2019s one attack, they could have given the opponent a great setback.</p><br/><p>Although on the surface it seemed like Dai Mubai had suffered a somewhat smaller attack, right now his body was already completely paralysed, White Tiger Barrier and White Tiger Vajra Transformation couldn\u2019t completely offset the lightning strength supplemented in the Thunder Crash.</p><br/><p>But, it wasn\u2019t just Dai Mubai launching an attack towards the opponent alone, rather all the Shrek Seven Devils. Dai Mubai\u2019s attack had ended, the Thunder Crash had also dissipated to the front. It was also at this time, a quick silhouette quietly flickered, appearing from behind his back.</p><br/><p>Hell Rush Stab increased Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s speed to the limit, even to the extent that her body left behind remnant shadows in the air, the two spirit rings over her simultaneously flashing suddenly. Yu Tian-Heng still hadn\u2019t found his footing when Zhu Zhuqing already appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Hell Civet second spirit ring ability, Hell Hundred Claws, launched.</p><br/><p>Countless claw shadows struck out, weaving a frightful net of sharp blades, Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s internal energies still hadn\u2019t settled, also having released too much lightning power with the previous Thunder Crash, right now his old strength had just been used up, and new strength still hadn\u2019t been generated.</p><br/><p>In the crucial moment, Yu Tian-Heng showed remarkable psychological quality, without the slightest hint of being flustered by the opponent\u2019s attack. The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon arm rose vertically, as much as possible defusing Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>However, Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s attack was really too fast, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda strength and speed boost completely coming to their right in her Hell Hundred Claws. Sparks constantly burst from Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s dragon arm, splashing out simultaneously was still a bloody light.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng was only able to defend his vitals, but at his other arm, shoulder, both legs, all paid a not inconsiderable price under the Hell Hundred Claws attack.</p><br/><p>One must know that Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s primary capability was reflected in speed and attack power, the attacks she launched all had supplementary puncturing effects, while the wounds wouldn\u2019t appear very deep, spirit power already permeated within, frantically destroying Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s energy channels.</p><br/><p>With the assistance of Thunder Fury Yu Tian-Heng finally recovered his breath, intense thunder power once again erupting, but Zhu Zhuqing in the instant before that thunder moved several meters to the side, just evading Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s attack. Without a doubt, again it was Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Grass battle control rhythm.</p><br/><p>Tightly following on Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s horizontal shift, a slender lovable human body appeared in front of Yu Tian-Heng, precisely Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Violent aches transmitted from the hundred bones of the four limbs, a heat at his back, clearly it was that blazing Phoenix Fire Wire already attacking his back, but there still appeared an enemy in front. Yu Tian-Heng knew that with further passivity, before help could arrive from his side, he would fall here.</p><br/><p>Strongly raising spirit power, from Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s mouth issued an indignant howl, coming forward to meat Xiao Wu\u2019s delicate body was a Thunder Dragon Claw.</p><br/><p>Under the boost of Thunder Fury, Thunder Dragon Claw\u2019s range and power were more than doubled, with Xiao Wu\u2019s current speed forward, she was clearly unable to dodge.</p><br/><p>Also at this moment, the Shrek Seven Devils team\u2019s fighting strength erupted completely, facing the Thunder Dragon Claw Xiao Wu didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of breaking off, the stimulation of the lightning already made her body spasm slightly, the purple third spirit ring flared like it was declaring the end of Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s spirit battle for this time.</p><br/><p>Soft Bones Demon Rabbit\u2019s third spirit ring ability, Teleport, launched.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng only caught a flash in front of him as Xiao Wu\u2019s silhouette had already disappeared, the next moment, that slender lovable body suddenly magnified before him, a long braid directly coiling around his neck, Xiao Wu leapt up, both hands with the help of the braid pulling within the hook of Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s dragon arm, resisting the supplemental thunder strength, both feet simultaneously stepping on Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>Soft Bones Demon Rabbit\u2019s first spirit ring ability, Waist Bow, launched. Yu Tian-Heng was unable to resist the enormous force used and was suddenly thrown up, despite his spirit power being eight ranks higher than Xiao Wu, despite Thunder Fury amplifying his spirit power by fifty percent, right now his body\u2019s condition had already dropped to the bottom of the valley, adding Xiao Wu possessing the thirty percent strength boost from Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pavilion, he was left basically without the chance to resist Xiao Wu\u2019s Soft Skill.</p><br/><p>As Yu Tian-Heng swept past Dai Mubai, Dai Mubai\u2019s tiger paws simultaneously swatted down at his ribs.</p><br/><p>It has to be said, despite Yu Tian-Heng right now already having received enormous injuries, his experience with facing enemies was abundant, managing to use the dragon arm to block his chest, relying on this solid arm to endure Dai Mubai\u2019s attack, with the clear sound of shattering bone. These two paws still had a thirty percent strength boost, an attack with the strength Dai Mubai stored up since coming out of paralysis, even if it was the outstanding defensive power of Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s dragon arm, it still fractured the bone. With the \u201cassistance\u201d of Dai Mubai, his entire body accelerated to even higher speed, flying toward the Emperor Team\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>From Yu Tian-Heng crossing over the Black Tortoise Spirit Masters to launch his attack, to being surrounded by the Shrek Seven Devils, to them inflicting serious injuries on Yu Tian-Heng, the complete process had only taken a very short amount of time, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014, Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s body heavily struck the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters\u2019 tortoiseshells and came to a stop, his whole body cut bloody and ragged, from his mouth also madly spurting blood. Under the successive attacks, he already suffered serious injuries, even his Thunder Fury almost broken apart by the Shrek Seven Devils. This wasn\u2019t at all the Shrek Seven Devils wanting to casually kill someone, but the result of showing some leniency. Otherwise, if Tang San also had attacked, it wouldn\u2019t have been as simple as Yu Tian-Heng spitting blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s serious injuries undoubtedly infuriated the Emperor Team, especially the vice captain Dugu Yan, as Yu Tuan-Heng\u2019s intimate friend, watching her man suffering serious damage by the opponents from all directions, but herself without the time to assist him, how painful was this kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>At this moment, she had already completely forgotten what Qin Ming said, and with a sharp hiss, her third spirit ring abruptly shone.</p><br/><p>The originally dark green eyes completely became violet, even the scales of the snake tail were covered by a faint layer of violet light, opening her mouth wide, a dense violet mist burst out, rapidly spreading in the air, surging in the direction of the Shrek Seven Devils.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone return!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shouted loudly, pulling back Dai Mubai, Zhu Zhuqing and Xiao Wu who wanted to dash forward for a follow up attack behind him, right now, he stood furthest ahead of the Shrek Seven Devils.</p><br/><p>But the opponents\u2019 Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master and Black Leopard Spirit Master taking advantage of their speed to launch attacks, seeing the violet mist panicked broke off their approach, from how the two recoiled to the sides it could clearly be seen they were terrified of Dugu Yan\u2019s violet mist.</p><br/><p>Tang San with a serious face attentively watched that violet mist floating over, right now, the violet mist already resembled a protective screen separating the two sides, moreover slowly advancing in the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 direction. Apart from flying up or perhaps stepping down from the spirit ring, they would inevitably be enveloped by the violet mist.</p><br/><p>Before the violet mist had arrived, already a fishy smell assailed the nostrils, making people feel nauseous and faint. The Shrek Seven Devils without hesitation swallowed down one of Oscar\u2019s sausages, and Oscar himself swiftly began to make detoxifying small sausages in preparation for future need.</p><br/><p>Both hands pressing on Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges at his waist, Tang San pondered for a moment, calmly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cA Jade Phosphor Serpent of the Jade Phosphor Five Poisons, that\u2019s all, I\u2019ll break your snake venom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San raised both hands, each with a very large water skin, each water skin large enough to hold ten jin[5] of drinking water, generally speaking, for use when travelling long distances.</p><br/><p>Tang San exerted himself to whip out both hands, the two leather bags thrown into the air, at the same time shouting loudly,</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, White Tiger Light Wave. Fatty, Phoenix Fire Wire. Launch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils hadn\u2019t been cooperating for just one or two days, Ma Hongjun and Dai Mubai understood intuitively. Dai Mubai right now still in White Tiger Vajra Transformation without hesitating spit out a White Tiger Light Wave, going straight for the water skins Tang San threw out, Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire following close behind.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The two water skins hit by White Tiger Light Wave were without a doubt instantly smashed to pieces, the \u201cwater\u201d within spreading upward in a huge cloud of dispersing water under the intense spirit power attack, and at this moment, Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire also arrived, instantly, the former water cloud unexpectedly completely turned into a cloud of fire, bringing a special fragrance to fill the air and pervade everyone present. Furthermore, it completely enveloped the violet mist.</p><br/><p>The dense violet mist unexpectedly also ignited under this sudden blaze, making a series of popping noises, disappearing in a moment. In the air, under the shining stage lighting, only those two smashed water skins slowly fell to the ground. The protective screen between the two teams had already completely faded away.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t possible. How could you break my Jade Phosphor Violet Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan stupidly stared across at Tang San, her eyes brimming with a disbelieving expression. Not just her, but each member of the Emperor Team stared dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They all clearly understood Dugu Yan\u2019s Jade Phosphor Violet Poison. Even if it was the powerful Yu Tian-Heng, he still wouldn\u2019t dare lightly come into contact with it. This third spirit ring ability was even more Dugu Yan\u2019s most poisonous attack, the poison acting extremely quickly, with just a little bit of contact with the violet mist, in a short time one would issue pus and die.</p><br/><p>Distantly at the entrance of the passage, Qin Ming\u2019s heart became greatly anxious as he saw the violet mist, wanting to call out to stop it, but before he could speak up, Dugu Yan\u2019s violet mist had already been dispersed. He as well hadn\u2019t expected it.</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cJade Phosphor Serpent poison is no more than an insignificant talent, if it was the Jade Phosphor Five Poisons together, perhaps I would have taken some notice of it. Your Jade Phosphor Serpent Poison still has insufficient heat control.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poison was what Tang Sect relied on for its fame. What genuinely made people fearful was how Tang San toyed with the poison before him, like he was Lord Guan toying with a broadsword[6].</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s method for unravelling it was actually very simple. In those two water skins wasn\u2019t actually water, but extremely high strength alcohol. Furthermore in this alcohol was also realgar powder. Wine fortified with realgar, generally speaking, was used when entering an area with a lot of snakes, to guard against snake and insect bites.</p><br/><p>Tang San threw out the water skins, using Dai Mubai\u2019s White Tiger Light Wave to scatter it as mist in the air, further using Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Fire Wire to ignite it, thoroughly cooking the poison. Although Jade Phosphor Serpent Poison was extremely toxic, it was still unable to be preserved when faced with ruthless flame. Earlier when Tang San learned Dugu Yan\u2019s spirit was Jade Phosphor Serpent, he already made preparations to deal with her. Of course, this realgar wine was something he always carried. Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges space was so large, how could it be wasted?</p><br/><p>In fact, although Tang San was calm on the surface, in his heart he was secretly shocked, Dugu Yan\u2019s Jade Phosphor Serpent poison was still more potent than he had imagined. And since coming to this world, he still had never had the time to search for poisonous substances and drugs that could be used for Tang Sect poisons and antidotes. Right now he inwardly resolved to learn from his experience this time, and certainly soon mix antidotes and poisons, then, he could truly display the strength of the Tang Sect.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a clear calm voice suddenly came through from the rear of the Emperor Team,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for, is a tiny setback enough to make you fear the opponent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately following, accompanying a faint aroma, a white light fell from the sky, that white light appeared extremely peculiar, unexpectedly in the form of petals, gently drifting down, falling directly on Yu Tian-Heng, lightly merging into his body.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng trembled against Dugu Yan\u2019s chest, his open wounds miraculously closed rapidly, his entire body\u2019s complexion seeming to already become much better, unexpectedly getting up on his feet.</p><br/><p>In a stern voice he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLingling\u2019s right, what are we waiting for? Get to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light of thunder again appearing, though just now still beaten bloody by the Shrek Seven Devils he unexpectedly took the lead to charge ahead, lightning snakes surging around him, even raising that fractured arm again.</p><br/><p>That petal-like white light came from Emperor Team\u2019s only auxiliary system Spirit Master Xie Lingling\u2019s hands. Right now, Emperor Team\u2019s formation was no longer as neat as at the start, and the Shrek Seven Devils could finally see Xie Lingling\u2019s spirit, Nine Heart Flowering Apple.</p><br/><p>Resting in Xie Lingling\u2019s hands was a pink flowering apple[7], formed by white and pink petals, the flowering apple was gorgeous, flowering with beauty and elegance.</p><br/><p>The flower leaves and branches welled from either side of Xie Lingling\u2019s hands, softly spreading in the wind, drooping and fluttering, as if beautiful hair covering a virtuous woman\u2019s face, affectionate deep love, charm pitying people.[8]</p><br/><p>Right now a purple light was fading from her body, clearly those white light petals just now was her thousand year spirit ring ability.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu Tian-Heng completely recovered once again, on the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 side, everyone\u2019s complexions couldn\u2019t help but change.</p><br/><p>One must know, their attack at Yu Tian-Heng just now could be said to have been planned since long ago, it was also their method for pulling close the gap to the opponents. After all, Yu Tian-Heng wasn\u2019t the only formidable person on the other side, if they could first take away Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s fighting strength, then with one person less their side would have a much larger chance.</p><br/><p>But right now Yu Tian-Heng charging once again meant that not only did the Emperor Team still possess all its intact strength, it was even more of a blow to the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 morale that the opponents\u2019 Nine Heart Flowering Apple Spirit Master could heal the wounded at any time, how would they still conduct this battle?</p><br/><p>Right now everyone truly understood why Ning Rongrong thought so highly of the Nine Heart Flowering Apple. This peculiar auxiliary system spirit was indeed one of a kind.</p><br/><p>With the previous lesson, Emperor Team clearly wouldn\u2019t be as careless as before.</p><br/><p>The two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters followed closely behind Yu Tian-Heng, Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master Yu Feng dashing directly at the rearmost Shrek Seven Devil Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Ning Rongrong, and the Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler charged at Zhu Zhuqing from the side.</p><br/><p>And Dugu Yan blew out a green mist into the air, from all around enveloping everyone present, right now, the Emperor Team members each put something in their mouths, not suffering the slightest effect within the green mist.</p><br/><p>The true battle would begin right now, but the advantageous position carefully set up under Tang San\u2019s control had already been obliterated completely.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be flustered, this was the first problem Tang San realized.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai roared deeply, meeting Yu Tian-Heng from the front, his White Tiger Vajra Transformation had a time restriction, right now he couldn\u2019t delay. But Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s Thunder Fury also hadn\u2019t been revoked. These two Dragon and Tiger great Spirit Masters once again clashed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s figure flickered, fighting the Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler, her attack and spirit power were inferior to the opponent, but her speed was a lot higher, for the moment unlikely to fall into a too great of a disadvantageous position. Of course, this required the assistance of Ning Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, otherwise, lacking one spirit ring, she wouldn\u2019t be a match for the Black Leopard Spirit Master. Right now, only Xiao Wu remained at Tang San\u2019s side, behind them Fatty using Phoenix Fire Wire to tangle with the Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master, blocking him from attacking Ning Rongrong and Oscar, basically unable to assist.</p><br/><p>And right now what Tang San and Xiao Wu confronted wasn\u2019t just the green mist alone, but still the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters and the constantly using abilities Jade Phosphor Serpent Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>[1]Power Ranger Megazord! boooom\u2026 *rainbow explosions*</p><br/><p>[2] Go lugia! use Steel wing!</p><br/><p>[3] () Directly translated into Thunder Fury</p><br/><p>[4] () \u201cThunder\u2019s force of 150 tons\u201d</p><br/><p>[5] 10 = 5 kg</p><br/><p>[6] A reference to the warrior Guan Yu of Three Kingdoms fame.</p><br/><p>[7] Chinese flowering crabapple, Malus spectabilis</p><br/><p>[8] Can\u2019t quite find an attribution for this poem.

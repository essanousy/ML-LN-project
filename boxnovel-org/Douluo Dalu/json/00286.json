This immediately made Xue Beng\u2019s eyes shine, impatiently asking more.</p><br/><p>As Xue Beng saw it, this time they were throwing in all the national strength of the Heaven Dou Empire, and cooperating with the Star Luo army, to smash the Spirit Empire before they had stabilized. Otherwise, if they let the Spirit Empire truly flourish, with their numbers of spirit masters it would be a disaster to the two empires. Seeing the army blocked by Jialing Pass, how could he not be anxious? As long as they broke through Jialing Pass, the Spirit Empire wouldn\u2019t have any way to defend. In terms of full strength, it was impossible to compete with the two great empires!</p><br/><p>Tang San glanced at the black Seagod Trident in his hand, then looked at Xue Beng,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, this method must be kept confidential. I can only tell you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng looked distracted, but nodded at once, speaking to everyone in the tent:</p><br/><p>\u201cAll officials go take your rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the crowd was a bit suspicious, and even more curious over what method Tang San had, his strength had already given rise to a somewhat blind faith. Listening to him was already a confidence boost. Nobody had anything to say, and they immediately withdrew. Marshal Ge Long also looked deeply at Tang San before leaving the big tent.</p><br/><p>Just as Tang Hao and Tang Xiao was about to leave, they were stopped by Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, father, teacher, my method requires your cooperation. You should all know it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked at Tang San with burning eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you should be talking about rank one hundred godhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Grandmaster, Tang San never had to hide anything. He\u2019d long since told this fatherlike teacher all about his encounters on Seagod Island.</p><br/><p>Listening to Grandmaster, Tang Hao and Tang Xiao\u2019s eyes revealed sudden understanding. Only Xue Beng still looked perplexed.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you\u2019re also a spirit master. You of course know that with every ten ranks, a spirit masters strength will leap up by obtaining a spirit ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng nodded, his puzzled eyes gradually growing clear. His eyes opened wide with shock,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you mean, rank one hundred\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo spirit masters, breaking through rank ninety is already a lifelong dream, becoming Title Douluo. When the Spirit Empire was still Spirit Hall, all Title Douluo could leave their name in Douluo Palace. But, Title Douluo really isn\u2019t the limit of spirit master cultivation. The true limit is divinity. It\u2019s also breaking through rank one hundred spirit power. Rank one hundred is the biggest barrier. If you can break through it, even facing several dozen Title Douluo at once isn\u2019t a problem. You should also know that I was far from as strong as now when I left a few years ago. Actually, it\u2019s because I found the inheritance once left behind by a god. Becoming his successor is also a chance to attack rank one hundred. This trident is the weapon he bestowed me. And his divine name, was Seagod. Today I formally relied on the Seagod\u2019s power to turn the moat water into my attack. But, I still have the last two trials left before becoming Seagod. The method I spoke of is to go complete these last two trials. If I really do become Seagod, then breaking through Jialing Pass wouldn\u2019t be a problem, the entire Spirit Empire might not have the power to stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San explained his thinking in the simplest way, but what he said really was too strong a blow to Xue Beng. As an emperor, he had already reached the apex of humanity. Now he suddenlt heard that there really were gods, he was completely paralyzed with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cTe-, teacher\u2026\u2026 Gods really exist? Omnipotent gods? Immortal gods?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng\u2019s voice shook a bit, his eyes scorching hot as he looked at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed inwardly. In the end Xue Beng was still an ordinary person!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it, Your Majesty. Actually, gods are like Douluo, it\u2019s all just a title. The meaning of gods indicate powerful humans, humans that far exceed ordinary people. It\u2019s not really omnipotence. As far as I know, at least three gods have already appeared on the Douluo Continent. If they really were immortal and omnipotent, then by now the Douluo Continent should be under their rule. How could there be a Star Luo Empore, or a Heaven Dou Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San\u2019s explanation, Xue Beng gradually calmed down. But the light in his eyes was still continuously flashing,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can\u2019t you tell me just how strong gods are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. There might not be anyone who could explain it to you. Because our world no longer has any gods. But, after breaking through the rank one hundred bottleneck, one\u2019s strength will definitely increase. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that, if I can become Seagod, I\u2019m sure I can help Your Majesty break through Jialing Pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng pondered:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen teacher, how long will you be gone, and how large is the chance of success? I don\u2019t want you to take chances for the sake of the empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was still shocked by what Tang San said, he could still fully imagine what a challenge it would take to break through rank one hundred and become a god, it absolutely wouldn\u2019t be so easy.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xue Beng, Tang San couldn\u2019t help secretly sighing. Even though he was concerned for him, that red hot gaze still betrayed what he truly thought. But it was difficult to blame him. If the Heaven Dou Empire had a god level power, unifying the continent would no longer be a dream. Besides, he was still his titular disciple, it was impossible for him not to thirst for the god level.</p><br/><p>He immediately smiled calmly:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry, Your Majesty. I\u2019m at least seventy percent sure I can succeed. I\u2019ll be gone at least a month, no more than three. I will definitely return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng\u2019s expression recovered somewhat, speaking hastily:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, the empire\u2019s future will rely on teacher. Teacher, whatever you need, don\u2019t hesitate to speak. We will agree without exception. Only, with you away, our army might\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao said calmly:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Majesty. With us here, if we aim to avoid making mistakes rather than getting the best results, it will be difficult for the Spirit Empire to have their way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng looked at Tang Hao, and breathed out as he thought of the terrifying might he showed on the walls earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then We will trouble teacher. Teacher, when are you preparing to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI will set off with my comrades once my condition has improved a bit. Inheriting the Seagod\u2019s position still requires the help of my six companions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao, Tang Xiao as well as Grandmaster all followed Tang San back to his tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, are you really planning to go inherit the Seagod\u2019s position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster asked somewhat worriedly.</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed softly:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you know I have no other choice. Not only because of this war. The Seagod Nine Trials was something I had to finish from the start. Only I didn\u2019t think it would be this soon. The Spirit Empire is formidable. Our present strength is far from enough to confront them. If Qian Daoliu comes, even defending would be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao frowned:</p><br/><p>\u201cReaching rank one hundred and becoming god is so difficult even your great grandfather didn\u2019t manage it after so many years, even changing into that appearance in Slaughter City. Little San, you\u2019re still young. I don\u2019t want you to advance prematurely. Didn\u2019t you say this eighth trial had five years? You still need more resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes showed a resolute expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I understand that you\u2019re all worried for me, but I\u2019ll still face what I should face. I can imagine that god level power is definitely terrifying, even if my spirit power rises a bit it might not make too much difference. It would be better to just break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and take advantage of my current need for strength to forge ahead. My circumstances are different from great grandfather\u2019s, I\u2019ve already passed seven Seagod Trials, and I have the help of the Seagod Trident and my comrades. I didn\u2019t exaggerate when I told Xue Beng I had seventy percent chance of success. Also, don\u2019t forget that I have twin spirits. Before inheriting the Seagod\u2019s title, I\u2019ll first finish adding spirit rings to the Clear Sky Hammer. The Seagod\u2019s Light allows me to completely absorb the attributes added from upgrading the twin spirits. In terms of my physique, I\u2019ve already surpassed the human category like this. Therefore, I believe I can definitely succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao slowly nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then you have to succeed. This isn\u2019t only about you, there\u2019s no relation between the Heaven Dou Empire and us, and I can\u2019t take revenge on the Spirit Empire. But you must keep in mind you are the son of me and your mother. You\u2019re also Grandmaster\u2019s only disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San felt his heart warm. His father\u2019s big hands grabbed his shoulders. Surging heat slowly flowing into him, nourishing his energy channels. Roused by Tang Hao\u2019s spirit power, Tang San\u2019s recovery speed instantly rose a bit more.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded repeatedly as he listened to Tang Hao:</p><br/><p>\u201cClear Sky Douluo is right. In our minds, your life is number one. The rest is all empty. I still have one thing to remind you about. Little San, today you also saw Clear Sky Douluo break that rank ninety eight spirit power Spirit Empire priest with the Clear Sky Hammer, do you know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was distracted, looking at his father. Tang Hao had now already sensed Tang San\u2019s physical condition, and stopped infusing spirit power. After all, his spirit power really wasn\u2019t of the same origin as Tang San\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Skill, and Tang San\u2019s condition was moreover much better now. Tang Hao couldn\u2019t help secretly sighing, his son\u2019s body really wasn\u2019t completely human anymore.</p><br/><p>Tang San pondered:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, back then you didn\u2019t use any spirit abilities, only spirit avatar later, but still broke Golden Crocodile Douluo\u2019s defense. I was behind you and could feel that, after you used spirit avatar, the force was terrifying. Not just the weight, that explosive strength too. With each swing, combined with your imposing manner, it felt as if the opponent had no way to resist. If it was me, I might not have been able to block either. There might have been some chance by relying on the Seagod Trident\u2019s weight.\u201d</p><br/><p>This moment Tang Hao looked towards Tang Xiao to the side, his gaze questioning.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeach him. Besides little San, who else would be authorised to inherit the Clear Sky Douluo\u2019s secret skill. Besides, even grandfather gave little San the Clear Sky Warrant. This means he approves of it. Little San will face even more in the future, teach him and he\u2019ll have another way to defend himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao nodded, and Grandmaster smiled slightly from the side, apparently having already anticipated this scene,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao chuckled, patting Grandmaster\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you have gone to a lot of trouble for little San! Don\u2019t go calling us Douluo later. Without you, there would be no little San today. Hereafter you\u2019ll be our brother, let\u2019s get along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen deference is definitely no substitution for obedience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San was curious what his father would teach him, he still addressed Grandmaster first:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll trouble you to arrange other accommodations for the Clear Sky School disciples, not close to my Tang Sect\u2019s disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster naturally understood what he meant. Even though they had fought side by side today, the old grudges the four single attribute clans had towards the Clear Sky School were too deep. They absolutely weren\u2019t that easily solved. Tang San didn\u2019t have the time to deal with this right now, and could only separate them to avoid conflict. Also, in the recent battles the Tang Sect disciples had become even more convinced by Tang San, and as long as there were no special circumstances, the four clan chiefs would definitely hold back the disciples.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster and Tang Xiao left the tent, at the same time also blocking Ah Yin and Xiao Wu who had gotten the news, keeping them from entering. Inside the tent, only Tang San and Tang Hao, father and son, remained.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao sat down cross legged in front of Tang San, regarding his son with a burning gaze,</p><br/><p>\u201cFor as long as our Clear Sky School has existed, a kind of special cultivation technique has been passed down. This cultivation technique has been passed down with each generation of disciples, and the day they broke through rank ninety, they would possess the Clear Sky title. This is also the origin of the Clear Sky Douluo. And practically all the sect disciples that possessed this title have become sect masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Tang Hao\u2019s eyes dulled a bit,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of, this stopped with me, it\u2019s just with my generation that this tradition didn\u2019t continue. Back then my grandfather, the last generation Clear Sky Douluo Tang Chen, even though he passed the sect master position to my father, your grandfather, he didn\u2019t teach him the Clear Sky Douluo\u2019s exclusive cultivation technique, instead skipping a generation to pass it to me. Whether grandfather or father, at that moment they both chose me as the Clear Sky School\u2019s next successor. I didn\u2019t disappoint them either, constantly breaking the Clear Sky School\u2019s spirit power leveling records, becoming the Clear Sky School\u2019s, and even the entire continent\u2019s youngest power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u2019s eyes suddenly grew a bit gentler here. Looking at his son, he revealed a proud expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019ve already broken the records I once made. I\u2019m very gratified, and also very ashamed. I was never a good father in the past. What Grandfather did for you is all better than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what are you saying this for, if not for you, there would be no me. Didn\u2019t I say that the favor of one\u2019s parents\u2019 raising is something children can\u2019t repay in a lifetime. Besides, it wasn\u2019t by your choice. If it was me, I might not have done any better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao sighed deeply, gratified:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, let\u2019s not mention it. Our Clear Sky School\u2019s special cultivation technique can only be inherited by one person in a generation. It\u2019s not out of jealousy, but rather because the demands on the cultivator are extremely high, there\u2019s absolutely no way to cultivate it without superlative talent, on the contrary it\u2019s fatal danger. This cultivation technique, is known as Great Sumery Hammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked distracted. He knew that Sumeru[1] and mustard seed were antonyms, Sumeru represented the meaning of infinitely large, and mustard seed infinitely small. Just like his Purple Demon Eye\u2019s third level Mustard Seed indicated it could see infinitesimally small objects. And the meaning of this Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s Great Sumeru Hammer clearly indicated a kind of hammer technique that could show infinitely large force.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao didn\u2019t rush to explain, only quietly waiting for his son to digest the words Great Sumeru Hammer. After a long time, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, your original cultivation route, plus that Seagod Trident of yours, is already sufficient. But I\u2019ve thought carefully about it, and the Great Sumeru Hammer is still very effective for you. Your already have enough abilities, whether spirit rings or spirit bone abilities. And your Clear Sky Hammer has just started getting spirit rings, before going to inherit the Seagod you still need to even the spirit rings. Then, your Clear Sky Hammer will have several more spirit abilities. Even if you\u2019re a control type spirit master, it\u2019s impossible to instantly perfect all your abilities, and the Great Sumeru Hammer can help you simplify it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed in Tang San\u2019s mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t tell me your strength and imposing manner is all from spirit rings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao smiled with satisfaction,</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthy of my son, you saw through it at once. That\u2019s right, in some sense, my strength is taken from spirit rings. Let alone that Golden Crocodile Douluo today, after my strength recovered, even if Qian Daoliu came in person, he still might not defeat me. Back when I had just broken through rank ninety, I relied on Great Sumeru Hammer to break through the encirclement of numerous Spirit Hall powers, and even seriously injured that generation\u2019s Spirit Hall Supreme Pontiff. You can imagine how formidable our Clear Sky School\u2019s absolute skill is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great Sumeru Hammer, in theory, is to condense all your spirit rings together and completely infuse them in the Clear Sky Hammer, becoming pure force and offence, geometrically multiplying its force, forcefully breaking through the limits and displaying strength surpassing your spirit power, walking the road of suppressing the skill of ten with force alone. No matter how many spirit abilities the opponent has, no matter how many skills, none can compete with the purest force and offence of my Clear Sky Hammer. In theory, the force of the Clear Sky Douluo\u2019s Great Sumeru Hammer is infinitely large. Moreover, the Great Sumeru Hammer also has a formidable ability. Relying on this ability, even Qian Daoliu would have to give way. Back then I used just this Great Sumeru Hammer\u2019s special ability to injure the last generation Supreme Pontiff Qian Xunji. Only, this ability causes enormous harm to the user, it can\u2019t be used other than in a crisis. Only, your physical strength surpasses that of ordinary people, you should be able to bear it. If you can become Seagod, then you should be able to perfect this skill. Your great grandfather once said that our Clear Sky School\u2019s Great Sumeru Hammer should be a divine ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was stunned. Looking at his father, he felt shocked.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao sternly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cA formal divine ability, your great grandfather said that, only by breaking through rank one hundred is there a chance of perfecting the Great Sumeru Hammer. With your present strength, you don\u2019t need to train painstakingly. I\u2019ll teach you the cultivation technique, and after you\u2019ve memorized it, it won\u2019t be too late to cultivate it once you\u2019ve recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the tent, the voices abruptly disappeared. Tang Hao relied on his superlative spirit power to compress his voice, slowly teaching Tang San the Clear Sky School\u2019s divine ability. With Tang San\u2019s mental strength cultivation, he only had to hear it once to memorize it. After he read the mnemonic chants once, he couldn\u2019t help turning pale with fright, almost losing control.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, isn\u2019t this suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San cried out involuntarily.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u2019s expression was serious, shouting:</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, guard your heart, think carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression changed. His mental strength was too exhausted, causing this crack to appear. His father\u2019s dignity made him shiver, and he focused again. As he carefully sensed that Great Sumeru Hammer cultivation technique, he immediately had a different impression. But the shock he felt didn\u2019t decrease in the slightest, instead growing stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Jialing Pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong resisted the weak feeling, slapping the table as she glared furiously at Golden Crocodile Douluo and the others of the six great priests.</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe high priest orders you to return to Spirit City, do I need to repeat myself a third time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong\u2019s ample chest heaved violently, her eyes flooded with fury. But she couldn\u2019t flare up again when facing these six priests.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond priest, don\u2019t forget that I am the highest authority in the Spirit Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo gave a cold smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent. Bibi Dong, don\u2019t forget that the Spirit Empire belongs to our Spirit Hall. By the rules of Spirit Hall, Elder Palace has the authority to remove the Supreme Pontiff. As priests of Elder Palace, we have decisive authority. Do you dare oppose the high priest\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course Bibi Dong dared, she\u2019d never put Elder Palace in her eyes. Always in the past, she had been secretly eroding the authority of Elder Palace, and those Title Douluo who weren\u2019t priests were basically all gathered under her. The priests also didn\u2019t get involved in affairs. It might be said that she had long since truly taken control of Spirit Hall. She had eliminated the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan, injured the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, selected a new seven great clans, established the Spirit Empire. She had never expected the priests led by Qian Daoliu to actually get involved now, to wrest away her control when she was weakest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong\u2019s breathing didn\u2019t obey her, her eyes darkened, almost fainting. Fortunately Hu Liena was just next to her and helped support her.</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo spoke coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at how large a crisis you\u2019ve brought the Empire into. If we hadn\u2019t arrived in time today, Jialing Pass might have been broken by the Heaven Dou Empire. If they did, our Spirit Hall would be ruined by your hands. Such a big blunder is enough for us to depose you. That the high priest only has you return to Supreme Pontiff Palace to reflect is already holding back. For now we will take command here, until the high priest arrives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe high priest is coming too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong forced herself to calm down. Years at the top had made her disregard the voices of others, but she absolutely wasn\u2019t impetuous. The present circumstances were unfavorable for her. Forcing herself to calm, clashing head on with the priests was extremely unwise. Hearing that Qian Daoliu was also coming to Jialing Pass, Bibi Dong\u2019s expression really did change. If there was anyone she still feared in Spirit Hall, then that was only Qian Daoliu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second priest Golden Crocodile Douluo sneered,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have anything else to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold light flashed through Bibi Dong\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m returning to Supreme Pontiff Palace. Nana, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Supported by Hu Liena, Bibi Dong left intensely unwilling. The six priests weren\u2019t worried about her playing any tricks either, with the absolute strength of the six of them, they basically didn\u2019t fear anything Bibi Dong could do. Without strength, everything was useless. Even if Bibi Dong recovered her full strength, it was still impossible to deal with the six of them.</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong and Hu Liena gradually left the range of perception of the six. The fourth priest turned to Golden Crocodile Douluo:</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother. Why would the high priest not have us deal with this woman once and for all? She isn\u2019t just extremely ambitious, she\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo raised an eyebrow, waving a hand to block the priest from continuing,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe high priest has the high priest\u2019s reasons. Don\u2019t ask too much. What we have to do now is help the young miss control the Spirit Empire, waiting for her to gain full control. I\u2019m not particularly fond of that woman Bibi Dong either, but since the High Priest won\u2019t have us kill her, we can only listen and obey. There\u2019s no need to doubt that woman\u2019s talent. Twin spirits, even I can\u2019t match her at her peak. But, as long as the young miss can complete the last trial and become God of Angels, Bibi Dong will no longer matter. When that time comes our Spirit Empire will definitely sweep the Continent, completing the unification. Alright, let\u2019s get busy. Integrating the army and spirit master legions, restoring the defenses. Before the young miss arrives, we have to guard Jialing Pass well. That Tang San and Tang Hao aren\u2019t easy to deal with. We have to be careful at all times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifteen Ton Douluo\u2019s expression was serious:</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, won\u2019t we go raid the Heaven Dou camp and make a bit of trouble for them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo waved his hand:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cause any more problems. Did you forget the high priest\u2019s warnings? To us, what\u2019s most important is to preserve the foundation of the Spirit Empire. Save enough strength and wait for the young miss\u2019 dispatch. We can\u2019t affect the larger situation for trifles. Sixth, seventh, you go take a look at the elders. It may be assumed that they won\u2019t dare do anything unwise, but if they don\u2019t show understanding of the times, kill the chicken to warn the monkey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The priests quietly left, and Golden Crocodile also slowly got up and exited the tent, raising his head to gaze at the night sky. His heart really wasn\u2019t calm at all. He could never forget the scene from the day of Tang Hao\u2019s giant Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Clear Sky Douluo, what a Clear Sky Douluo. Not eradicating the Clear Sky School back then really left behind danger. No wonder the high priest says the Clear Sky School is our Spirit Hall\u2019s true enemy. There\u2019s just no telling if the last generation Clear Sky Douluo remains or not. Young miss, you have to complete the final trial! As long as you become God of Angels, none will be able to stand against us.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>Three days later, Heaven Dou Empire camp.</p><br/><p>Slow breathing like deep dragon cries or tiger roars resounded, dense white mist gathering above Tang San\u2019s head, forming three giant white flowers. It was the Three Flowers Gathering Above level.</p><br/><p>Even though he had exhausted himself that day, relying on his formidable physique, Tang San had only used one day to recover. At the same time he had also discovered that, after the extreme exhaustion, his cultivation had risen again. Pressure was like the best forging hammer, forging his body. That\u2019s why he was in no hurry to leave the Heaven Dou Empire camp, and rather kept cultivating.</p><br/><p>The insides of his body was already colored golden, and even the white of the external protective energy of the Mysterious Heaven Skill was rendered faintly golden. That peculiarly tenacious feeling made Tang San feel full of strength. So soon after he\u2019d reached rank ninety three, thinking about another breakthrough was impossible, but the feeling of his body improving was still extremely clear.</p><br/><p>The battlefield was originally a place that very easily aroused a person\u2019s potential. Enormous conflict, formidable enemies, that kind of pressure was different from what he faced on Seagod Island. Especially that Great Sumeru Hammer cultivation technique Tang San learned from his father. He hadn\u2019t started truly practicing it, but in his constant cultivation state he had constantly been mastering its surrounding areas. Only by deep understanding could it be truly used without mistakes.</p><br/><p>The faint exhalation finally ended. Tang San abruptly inhaled through his mouth and nose, swallowing all the white mist around him like a whale inhaling. The powerful suction made the air constantly echo with a series of sharp whistles.</p><br/><p>Spirit power returned to his body, Tang San\u2019s skin showed a faint luster, light roaming over his handsome face. Just sitting there, his noble temperament gave people a feeling as if unable to look straight at him.</p><br/><p>Outside the tent, Xiao Wu just raised a drapery and looked inside, alarmed by the noise. Seeing Tang San sitting crosslegged there, his whole body lustrous like gems, she couldn\u2019t help her gaze turning dull. She of course saw that Tang San\u2019s strength had advanced yet again. Tang San\u2019s cultivation growing stronger made her even happier than her own cultivation advancing.</p><br/><p>Recently, all kinds of benefits had begun to appear from Xiao Wu\u2019s tempering on the Seagod Island. After her spirit power directly shot up to rank seventy six, her cultivation speed had become even faster. In fact, she was once a hundred thousand year spirit beast, and her cultivation speed was much faster than ordinary human spirit masters. Adding Tang San\u2019s help and all kinds of benefits from Seagod Island that now appeared, she\u2019d instantly broken through again, and her spirit power had already reached rank seventy seven. At the same time, after completely assimilating the power of the Crystal Blood Dragon Ginseng and Yearning Heartbroken Red, her body had reached another level.</p><br/><p>It might be said that, in the entire Heaven Dou Empire camp, in terms of physical strength, if Tang San was number one, then Xiao Wu was definitely number two. Even Tang San didn\u2019t know that Xiao Wu\u2019s body had also gradually separated from the range of humanity under the effect of the Yearning Heartbroken Red, entering the god level. After completely uniting her body and soul, this immortal grade among immortal grade herbs effect had fully developed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly opened his eyes, waking up from cultivation. His eyes seemed very calm, giving people a feeling like the spring wind. There was none of the intensity from before, besides seeming gentle, there actually wasn\u2019t any difference from an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San\u2019s gaze, Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t help her heart trembling. Natural State, he had actually already reached this level. No wonder Bibi Dong had lost to him in their last two battles.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, your condition is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu walked into the tent, stepping over to Tang San in a few steps.</p><br/><p>Tang San reached out and pulled her into his arms, kissing her tender face again and again,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already fine. I\u2019ve made you worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu held on to Tang San\u2019s waist, sticking her face to his chest,</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, I feel so happy I can always be together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San held her tighter, whispering:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to become Seagod as soon as possible, I we might have to separate a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu sharply raised her head, looking at Tang San in shock.</p><br/><p>[1] Sumeru - Or Mt.

With a dark smile, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun had previously undergone a similar course, although their hearts remained somewhat shadowed, to some extent they could still repress it. As the two prepared to step forward, thinking it better to just get it over with and complete today\u2019s class, one person rushed first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Accompanying the sharp and clear voice, Ning Rongrong walked in front of Oscar with big strides, both hands reaching out, separately grabbing his big sausage and little sausage.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought Ning Rongrong unexpectedly would take the lead. Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun halted on the verge of stepping out. They both wanted to see whether Ning Rongrong would eat Oscar\u2019s spirit transformed sausage.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s expression was very serene, only her eyes brimming with reluctance betraying her heart. After all she was still only a little miss, how could she possibly completely cover up her mood.</p><br/><p>Yes, going through that one night, she still decided to stay. Without any compromise, she wanted to prove she could give it all for the people at Shrek Academy to see. Prove it how? That was by surpassing all the students, and gain even stronger spirit power than them.</p><br/><p>Oscar promoting to thirtieth rank, was equivalent to one step further aggravating Ning Rongrong\u2019s heart, that\u2019s why she was the first to walk out.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ning Rongrong\u2019s expression face to face, Oscar suddenly felt a chill.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong grabbing the big sausage and fiercely biting off a mouthful, that appearance, truly was rather ferocious. Seeing her expression, Oscar clearly felt his body tingle, subconsciously retreating a step.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong completely gulped down Oscars big sausage and little sausage.</p><br/><p>When just starting, she was still holding an idea of facing death with equanimity, but after swallowing the fresh sausage and cured sausage, she discovered that the flavour of these two kinds of Oscar\u2019s materialized food spirit unexpectedly were exceptionally good.</p><br/><p>Especially that big fresh sausage, after it entered the belly it immediately spread a warm feeling throughout the whole body, after one night without sleep, she who was originally already very tired clearly felt her spirits rouse, a feeling as if the body was brimming with strength.</p><br/><p>What dean Flender said was right, this fellow\u2019s food system spirit indeed was remarkable.</p><br/><p>Being born to Seven Treasures Glazed Tile School, Ning Rongrong naturally was familiar with food system spirits, and had also eaten them. But the food system spirits she previously ate did could not have such a rapid effect as Oscar\u2019s big fresh sausage. Even if it was a more than fortieth ranked food system Spirit Master, they would still be unable to do even a bit of this. This was completely a question of innate talent.</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s big fresh sausage incidentally also was his first spirit ring effect, Recovery[1]. This kind of recovery had a comprehensive effect, apart from giving a satiated feeling, it still had effects on both treatment and restoration. The effect of Recovery was directly proportional to Oscar\u2019s spirit power.</p><br/><p>Oscar probing asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong licked her pink lips, her face revealing a gentle smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sausage, a bite felt pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar once again felt a tingle, Ning Rongrong\u2019s smile felt a bit like a devil\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong turned around, gaze sweeping across each student, finally stopping on Flender, she used action to prove she had remained by her own power.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun one after another ate Oscar\u2019s fresh and dried sausage, Tang San walked forward fourth, somewhat helplessly picking up Oscar\u2019s for the fourth time transformed spirit.</p><br/><p>A girl like Ning Rongrong could do it, so why would it be impossible for him? With this kind of attitude, Tang San gulped down Oscar\u2019s fresh and dried sausage.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, he also had the same feeling as Ning Rongrong, perhaps even more clearly, the sausage entering the stomach created a feeling of warmth circulating in the entire body, the ache in his internal organs unexpectedly fading away, his whole body feeling as if full of strength.</p><br/><p>Somewhat amazed he looked at Oscar, Tang San\u2019s perception of him clearly had changed a bit.</p><br/><p>Right now, only Xiao Wu and Zhu Zhuqing still had not completed today\u2019s class assignment.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu somewhat pleading looked at Tang San, seemingly saying, \u2018can\u2019t I not eat?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, the flavor is pretty good. Think of it as food you buy on the street.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu extremely reluctantly stepped out fifth, practically with closed eyes eating the two things, afterwards covering her mouth, resisting the nausea and swallowing. Fortunately, after Oscar\u2019s fresh sausage immediately transformed into that warmth spreading in the body, it didn\u2019t leave any aftertaste. Despite this, Xiao Wu\u2019s expression still appeared somewhat unsightly.</p><br/><p>Right now, of all the students, only Zhu Zhuqing hadn\u2019t completed the day\u2019s assignment, everyone\u2019s gazes also couldn\u2019t help but gather on her.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s little face changed between green and white, biting her lower lip, yet somehow could not make her feet step forward.</p><br/><p>Dean Flender suddenly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cZhu Zhuqing, if you want to one day be able to defeat Dai Mubai, and trample him underfoot, then you mustn\u2019t hesitate now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing stared blankly a moment, looking towards Flender. Flender\u2019s face displayed a rare smile, nodding with eyes containing deep meaning.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was first stunned, immediately following had a helpless face, at his side Fatty and Oscar already snickered.</p><br/><p>What nobody had anticipated was, the expression in Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s eyes suddenly firmed, with big strides walking up to Oscar, lightning quick grabbing the sausages in Oscar\u2019s hands and in spite of everything eating them like that, her speed even a bit faster than Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s look at her was a bit despondent,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou truly want to beat me so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing firmly glared at him, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Flender nodded satisfied, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, you have all passed today\u2019s lesson, you all must remember, when you are together in the future, Oscar is your logistics supply. Forget those nonsense spirit incantations, to save your lives and let yourselves become even more powerful, to display your entire strength, even surpassing your usual display, is the most important. Now, all of you return to prepare, you have one day\u2019s time to adjust and rest. Early tomorrow you will all set out on a journey. Teacher Zhao Wuji will lead you to Star Dou Great Forest to help Oscar obtain his third spirit ring. This is not only a matter for Oscar alone, it is also experience for all of you before encountering thousand year spirit beasts. Zhao Wuji will not lightly step in, everything depends on yourselves. Good, dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>After two days of classes, Tang San had found Shrek Academy\u2019s teaching methods were exceptionally peculiar, without any of the orderly regulations of the previous Nuoding Academy, every day restricted to going to class and so on, rather using a bit special methods to improve their spirit use from even more significant real combat and learning through experience. This undoubtedly had much better effect than always being lectured on theoretical knowledge. And also, he could feel that dean Flender was not only teaching in line with the students\u2019 abilities, instructing them on how to become outstanding Spirit Masters, but at the same time also teaching them the principles for conducting themselves.</p><br/><p>Oscar clearly became very excited from reaching thirtieth rank, each full level a Spirit Masters\u2019 spirit power advanced, this one rank\u2019s spirit power did not need to depend on their cultivation further. On obtaining the spirit ring, the spirit ring\u2019s additional energy would make up for what was lacking in this one rank and furthermore break through to the next stage. Circumstances like when Tang San obtained his first spirit ring and directly advanced to the thirteenth rank were extremely rare, that was because of his innate full spirit power, or perhaps to say it was because his Mysterious Heaven Skill had already cultivated up to the bottleneck.</p><br/><p>Everyone returned to their dorms, even if they were all considered geniuses of their generation, including Ning Rongrong this arrogant woman, each of them knew the importance of their cultivation. Wanting to become formidable, apart from one percent talent, it still required ninety nine percent effort. Even if that one percent had been even more significant, how could they cut down on those ninety nine percent?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, tomorrow when we\u2019ll leave for Star Dou Great Forest, say, what spirit ring should I get that\u2019s even more suitable to upgrade my sausage auxiliary effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar did not need to cultivate again, currently he only had to wait for tomorrow to arrive, and on returning to the dorm couldn\u2019t help but excitedly ask Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis also depends on opportunity, spirit beasts come in fantastic oddities of every description, who can say how bad a spirit beast one may encounter. Your first two spirit rings are one for recovery, one for detoxification, this third spirit ring only has to again raise another kind of auxiliary effect, or strengthen the first two auxiliary effects, both are possible. Oscar, you should have gone to Star Dou Great Forest before, tell me something about what it\u2019s like there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>Oscar nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Dou Great Forest is a good place, of course, it\u2019s also an extremely dangerous place. It\u2019s a spirit beast cradle, the most favourite place of powerful Spirit Masters. Of course, it\u2019s also a place for Spirit Masters\u2019 biggest injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a captive spirit beast forest of our Heaven Dou Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Those captive spirit beast forests count as farts, even thousand year spirit beasts are very difficult to encounter. Only Spirit Scholars and Spirit Masters kinds of levels would go there. Star Dou Great Forest one of our Douluo Continent\u2019s most famous three great spirit beast habitats. The area is huge, practically equal to Balak Kingdom\u2019s territory, spanning the border of Heaven Dou Empire and Star Luo Empire, within it, two fifth\u2019s of the area are in our Heaven Dou Empire, the other three fifths are in Star Luo Empire. It\u2019s an immense primeval forest, the forest\u2019s interior terrain is complicated, with wetlands, swamps and so on. The spirit beasts there are also extremely terrifying, the closer to the center of the forest, the more powerful the spirit beasts. It is said, inside are even hundred thousand year spirit beasts. Any Spirit Master, as long as he is powerful enough, with good luck, can find a most suitable spirit ring inside. My second spirit ring was obtained in Star Dou Great Forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes shone,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s actually like this. I hope this time you can find an even better gain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it truly is like that, then afterwards there will be sufficient sausage for everyone to eat as they wish, what do you say my younger brother. Haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone did not have too many things they could prepare in one day, and early the second day, after eating breakfast, as everyone gathered on the grounds, Zhao Wuji was already there waiting for them.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhao Wuji, the students were all somewhat stunned, wanting to laugh but not daring to smile.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji indeed looked in a sorry state, on his face at least three bluish black bruises had not yet faded, especially his left eye looked like a panda, making people unable to help laughing.</p><br/><p>Of course, while ridiculous even Tang San\u2019s seven students still couldn\u2019t help but be shocked, how would Zhao Wuji become like this? Tang San remembered very clearly, although he that day somewhat inconvenienced Zhao Wuji, he had not managed to leave behind any bruises on his face. But Zhao Wuji\u2019s face looked like it had been hit with something blunt, with his seventy sixth ranked strength, in addition to Vigorous Vajra Bear\u2019s defensive power, who could injure him? Could it have been dean Flender? But, with the Owl Spirit Flender was an agility attack system Battle Spirit Master, wanting to hit Zhao Wuji like this still seemed impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at, you little brats. Do you need a spanking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words \u2018little brats\u2019, Xiao Wu was clearly somewhat reluctant, in a low voice saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not say little blind bear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji\u2019s eyes widened,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San moved a step sideways, waving his hand behind his back at Xiao Wu, while hiding her behind him, to restrain the passion in her speech.</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang San, Zhao Wuji\u2019s expression clearly expressed some awkwardness, and did not investigate Xiao Wu\u2019s words, with a snort, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, everyone set out. Mubai, you lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai nodded once, his expression immediately becoming serious, saying to the others:</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Dou Great Forest can\u2019t be a place for noisily playing around, there are numerous spirit beasts inside, and also extremely aggressive, towards us humans they don\u2019t have any good impression. Everyone certainly must be careful, all right. Tang San, you go first, Oscar, Ning Rongrong, you two follow behind Tang San, Fatty, Xiao Wu, you two are on the left and right sides. I and Zhu Zhuqing are in the back. After entering the forest, we must even more maintain good order like this, staying alert at all times. Everyone set out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Dai Mubai\u2019s arrangement, Tang San secretly admired it in his heart, worthy of the oldest and strongest of the students, his plan was perfect, with the two auxiliary system Spirit Masters protected in the center, in strength his own second only to his placed first in line, the strongest Dai Mubai himself following in the back, the rearguard was always even more important than the vanguard, after all, he still had the two Fatty and Xiao Wu on the left and right wings for reinforcement at any time, in the back Dai Mubai must be vigilant in even more directions.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji was only an indifferent bystander to the side, without joining their formation, walking out from the Academy together with the seven students. Here of course was not any carriage, once out of the Academy, everyone set off at a run.</p><br/><p>Not long after starting running, the students began to comprehend the importance of dean Flender\u2019s second class.</p><br/><p>Thanks to having yesterday\u2019s experience and Flender\u2019s criticism, everyone regarding Oscar\u2019s sausage were already no longer so repelled.</p><br/><p>Running continuously, even if it was the strongest Dai Mubai and Tang San, their physical strength was continuously depleted.</p><br/><p>But supplied with Oscar\u2019s sausage, they astonished discover, the strain from this bit of running basically could not be considered anything.</p><br/><p>Every hour eating one of Oscar\u2019s spirit transformed sausages, everyone could directly maintain abundant energy, even Ning Rongrong could with difficulty keep up with everyone\u2019s pace.</p><br/><p>Without true application, one would never understand the importance of Auxiliary Spirits, and because of Oscar\u2019s sausage\u2019s fantastic effect, everyone had a whole new level of respect for him. He received the best treatment, because they still had not entered the forest, the strongest Dai Mubai and Tang San took turns supporting Oscar\u2019s arm, supporting part of his burden forward, letting him even easier recover spirit energy to continue the supporting work.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong naturally did not have this treatment, she appeared very taciturn, all the way also didn\u2019t use her Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda to assist everyone, entirely became very uncommunicative, since she didn\u2019t refuse Oscar\u2019s sausage, but also did not use her spirit, vaguely within, appeared to isolate herself outside the group.</p><br/><p>Star Dou Great Forest was located southeast of Balak Kingdom, sharing a very short border with Balak Kingdom, but Suotuo City itself was also in the southeast of the Kingdom, not far from Star Dou Great Forest, less than five hundred kilometres.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this was naturally the optimal choice for Shrek Academy students to obtain spirit rings.</p><br/><p>With the aid of Oscar\u2019s sausages, barely using one days time, at nightfall, the Shrek Academy party had already run more than four hundred kilometres,</p><br/><p>Seeing that they would be unable to reach the destination today, Zhao Wuji issued orders to rest. Since they had just reached a small town, if they continued further, whether there would be supply was hard to say.</p><br/><p>Entering the small town, it was much more bustling than Tang San had imagined, the little town\u2019s size was roughly three times that of the village where Shrek Academy was, apart from not having any walls, this unexpectedly seemed like a small market town, streets with a great number of shops, various stores with everything one could think of.</p><br/><p>Tang San carefully observed once, the main business of the shops in this place unexpectedly seemed related to Spirit Masters, for example some shops specialized in selling weapons, selling armor, selling detoxifying or restorative medicine, even the clothes being sold all had a dozen pockets where it was possible to fit all sorts of junk, clothes suitable for use in Spirit Masters\u2019 adventures.</p><br/><p>Oscar sighing said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is called \u2018the mountain dweller lives off the mountain, the shore dweller lives off the sea,\u2019[2] I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s for this reason. This little town clearly relies on Star Dou Great Forest to survive. Around Star Dou Forest, towns like this probably aren\u2019t few.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat astonished said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the distance from here to Star Dou Great Forest is still more than a hundred kilometres, isn\u2019t it a bit far?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly used to going to the national captive spirit beast forest. Those captive spirit beasts are comparatively mild, not too eager to attack humanity. The kind of wild spirit beasts inhabiting Star Dou Great Forest are different. The spirit beasts are not only more ferocious, but some spirit beasts also go out of the forest into the surrounding area, if a town was too close to Star Dou Great Forest, it might be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled and nodded, in his heart secretly saying, \u2018reading ten thousand books is not equal to travelling ten thousand li, indeed spoken true, when travelling one is able to learn more and more.\u2019</p><br/><p>By now, Zhao Wuji had indicated a very ordinary looking hotel ahead, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will stay there. Rest one night and set out early tomorrow. You bear your own lodging and food costs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shrek Academy was not prosperous in the first place, like Zhao Wuji and Flender they all had no income, their economic situation truly without anything to recommend it. But Tang San\u2019s group still received their Spirit Hall stipends, naturally enough for paying every day.</p><br/><p>The hotel was a small two storey building, the first floor was a simple dining hall, on the second floor were accommodations. Zhao Wuji rented a single room and went directly upstairs. Dai Mubai and everyone after simply talking it over, rented a four person room for the four boys and another three person room for the three girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst eat then go up. Having eaten sausage for one day, I am nauseous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said what everyone thought, and including Zhu Zhuqing all nodded agreement. The seven found a table in a corner and sat down.</p><br/><p>Tang San asked Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we call teacher Zhao to eat together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, even if Teacher comes out he will not like us pay any money, he also would not accept any bit of charity from us, these are dean Flender\u2019s regulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this just fine? Everything distinct and neat, I am most fond of that kind of not in the least artificial feeling Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned Fatty, less nonsense, you order. You\u2019ll eat the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun very cooperatively said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen today isn\u2019t by your invitation? Your stipend is the highest, you\u2019re wealthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEntertaining guests is no problem, everyone studying at Shrek together is also destiny, I am the oldest,so this meal today is a welcome for Tang San\u2019s group.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty laughed, the fatty little round face immediately jiggling,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good. Rest at ease, boss Dai, I will not leave anything out for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Fatty displayed to everyone Dai Mubai\u2019s \u201cwill eat\u201d assessment of him. Calling the waiter, quick as lightning he ordered more than ten dishes, very many dishes with names Tang San had never even heard of, but Fatty had a happy and excited appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty good, pretty good, although this place isn\u2019t big, things are wholly outstanding, I hope the flavor can also have an even better level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai helplessly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Fatty, besides the part of his stipend that is spent on women, the remainder is all food. I truly believe that if you were not a Spirit Master, you certainly would go become a cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the seven people sat around a table, the mood could not at all be considered harmonious, with Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s cold face and Ning Rongrong\u2019s lowered head thinking of some worry. Fortunately they had Fatty here for comic relief, so the mood could not be considered too rigid.</p><br/><p>In the dining hall right now already sat six or seven customers, at this moment, a party of eight suddenly walked in from outside, somewhat similar to Tang San\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The leader was a looking like more than forty years old middle aged man. In appearance he was also considered handsome, with combed hair exceedingly bright, all over wearing a moon white Spirit Master gown even more exceptionally exquisite, embroidered with a silver colored design, twinkling radiantly as he moved.</p><br/><p>Following behind the middle aged man were six male and one female youth, seemingly about twenty years old. Similarly clothed in moon white Spirit Master gowns, only without the preceding middle aged man\u2019s silver thread embroidery. But whether it was the middle aged man or the youths following behind, on the left shoulder was a blue-green circular symbol, within the circle was embroidered similarly colored characters, Blue Sunshine[3].</p><br/><p>From their attire one could clearly see that these people were Spirit Masters, Tang San\u2019s party all wore what they wanted, looking no different from ordinary people, while these people showed off much more.</p><br/><p>As the dining hall\u2019s proprietor saw them enter, he hurriedly went to welcome them, nodding and bowing unable to be courteous enough, just as what Oscar had said, this little town relied on Star Dou Great Forest to make a living, or to put it briefly, relied on Spirit Masters to make a living. Spirit Master was not only a noble vocation, it was also a wealthy vocation, the proprietor naturally dared not be careless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat chick\u2019s height is pretty good, ah. Boss Dai, Those fellows should be from Blue Sunshine Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s eyes stared unwavering at the girl among those eight people. It couldn\u2019t be refuted that the girl indeed had somewhat good looks, also considered being over middle higher level. Although Xiao Wu, Zhao Zhuqing and Ningrongrong were beautiful, they were after all only about twelve years old, and compared to the already completely developed young lady, seemed younger and more immature. But to Fatty this juvenile, a bit maturer girl clearly held even more attraction, adding to his Evil Fire, naturally both eyes shone, resolutely watching the others constantly.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai curled his lip,</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the minor Blue Sunshine Academy, nothing more. Showing off their farts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was Fatty or Dai Mubai, neither deliberately lowered their voice. A Spirit Master\u2019s hearing power naturally was a bit better than ordinary peoples, and even though within the dining hall was somewhat noisy, among those eight the middle aged man still cast his gaze their way, brows wrinkling minutely. As he saw at the Shrek Academy table merely was a group of children, his expression immediately became even more unsightly.</p><br/><p>Oscar sitting next to Tang San, with a low laugh said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good show to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat puzzled gave him a look,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat good show?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also part of our cultivation. Dean Flender said, Spirit Masters who dare not cause trouble are not good Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help but smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Dean\u2019s quoats added together can form a monstrous saying. Looking at their age, this Blue Sunshine Academy should be an advanced Spirit Master academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>By now the Blue Sunshine eight over there had already sat down, separated from the Shrek by two tables, from the corner of his eye Tang San saw that clearly a Spirit Master middle aged man muttered by the ear of a youth, very quickly, that youth rose from his seat, and facing Tang San\u2019s group walked towards their table, according to his walking route, precisely coming towards Dai Mubai.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s evil eyes expressed a trace of disdain, Tang San saw, he naturally wouldn\u2019t not know, but even facing him directly he did not look at the counterpart.</p><br/><p>By now, the waiter just happened to serve their table\u2019s first dish.</p><br/><p>The Blue Sunshine Academy youth suddenly sped up his steps, amidst the waiter\u2019s cry of alarm, just enough to bump into that waiter\u2019s body, in a moment that dish came down towards Dai Mubai from overhead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San spoke indifferently, left hand stretching out like lightning, steadying the waiter\u2019s body, right hand extending, just right to catch the plate, using Controlling Crane Catching Dragon energy, distractedly absorbing the dish without sprinkling a bit, light as a feather releasing the plate on the table. At the same time, his left hand had already pulled the waiter aside.</p><br/><p>The Blue Sunshine Academy youth stared blankly a moment, because of the waiter obstructing his view he did not clearly see Tang San\u2019s movements, however, his face very quickly exposed a cunning smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly am embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he still walked forward, looking like he must pass Dai Mubai\u2019s side, but one foot quietly swept across, directly kicking at a leg of Dai Mubai\u2019s chair.</p><br/><p>That was only a common wooden chair, that\u2019s all, when kicked the chair leg would break, and Dai Mubai naturally could not sit steady. But the youth\u2019s foot motion was also extremely covert, his upper body motionless, if not specially paying attention, one basically would be unable to see his movement.</p><br/><p>At the same time as the youth kicked, Dai Mubai acted.</p><br/><p>Did a tiger have a good temperament? The answer was of course not. These last few days enduring not a little anger from Zhu Zhuqing, Dai Mubai\u2019s heart had long held in the rage. Confronted with the other party\u2019s provocation, how would he let this kind of opportunity slip by.</p><br/><p>With a muffled peng sound, the Blue Sunshine youth only felt as if his foot kicked an iron panel, the entire calf shaking and numb, immediately following, Dai Mubai already slapped out.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s complexion dropped greatly, raising both hands wanting to hold back Dai Mubai\u2019s hand, but who could have expected that his hands would be shocked open by the added spirit power in Dai Mubai\u2019s palm, and that one palm still solidly slapped his stomach.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s counted as having a large stature, but from Dai Mubai\u2019s palm strike his entire body bent backwards, thrown flying like a completely weightless scarecrow, in succession knocking down two tables, flying towards the Blue Sunshine Academy group.</p><br/><p>The Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s middle aged man hastily stood up, raising both hands, grabbing the youth\u2019s shoulders and catching him. The youth\u2019s complexion was pale, with retching sounds, spewing out a mouthful of blood, his entire body becoming completely listless.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai straightened, by means of previous palm\u2019s motion stretching his waist,</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly am embarrassed, it was an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Evil Eye White Tiger\u2019s true colors showed, on his face was disdain and contempt, wearing intense aggressiveness. Let alone strangers, even if it was his people seeing him all felt somewhat at risk of a beating.</p><br/><p>At the commotion within the dining hall, the diners near the two tables of Shrek Academy and Blue Sunshine Academy hastily got out of the way, so as to avoid disaster to the pond fish[4], but the majority of the people did not immediately leave the dining hall, rather looking at the scene with excitement. One must know, ordinarily wanting to see a confrontation between Spirit Masters one would have to go to a Great Spirit Arena, but that was considerably expensive, right now they could watch freely, ordinary people naturally would be excited at spirits. Let alone in this place, where Spirit Masters constantly appeared.</p><br/><p>How could the Blue Sunshine Academy group still endure it, the remaining six Academy uniformed people stood up, glaring towards the Shrek Academy\u2019s table. Wanting to rush over, they were stopped by that middle aged man.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man continued helping the youth to sit on a chair, with a calm face shouting to Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Academy do you children belong to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flickered in Dai Mubai\u2019s double pupil evil eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cInterrogating[5]? You don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, he again sat back down on his seat.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s movements were very quick, especially when eating things, right now he had already started, while eating still said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, the taste is okay, only lacking some heat. Passable food.\u201d</p><br/><p>That Blue Sunshine Academy teacher\u2019s face was already ashen from anger,</p><br/><p>\u201cFine you arrogant brats, instruct them for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Blue Sunshine Academy students moved at once after his words, besides the one injured by Dai Mubai and the female student, the other five immediately rushed towards Tang San\u2019s group\u2019s table.</p><br/><p>\u201cA fight? I like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu excitedly hopped up from her seat, without the slightest hesitation going to meet them.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu had acted, so naturally Tang San would not stay idle, also standing up, both eyes already covered by a faint purple layer.</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cto recover\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Idiom: Make the best of local resources.</p><br/><p>[3] Cang Hui () \u201cDeep Blue/Green Sunshine\u201d</p><br/><p>[4] Half of the idiom \u201cA fire at the city gates, is also a disaster to the fish in the pond\u201d, which means that innocent bystanders will get hurt.

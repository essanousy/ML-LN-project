Even Xiao Baibai? The \u2018bai\u2019 as in \u2018idiot\u2019[1]. It really is an appropriate name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar couldn\u2019t help saying in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai saw Xiao Wu with an ill expression, her eyes still with an ice cold light. Coughing slightly, he pulled Zhu Zhuqing over to one side. Fatty and Oscar also immediately retreated, Oscar pulling Ning Rongrong, Fatty calling out to Bai Chenxiang in the sky. In Tang San\u2019s eyes, this group of treasonous fellows had swiftly retreated to the side, only leaving behind Tang San and Xiao Wu standing there.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu currently didn\u2019t seem like a beauty, but rather like a volcano that could explode at any time. Tang San\u2019s spiritual force was formidable, and he could clearly sense Xiao Wu on the verge of erupting. Heart twitching, he imitated the Devil Spirit Great White Shark King Xiao Bai\u2019s previous tone:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mistake, I apologize. I\u2019m sorry, Xiao Wu. You know, I\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu suddenly returned to her senses. Seeing Tang San\u2019s apologetically smiling appearance, she couldn\u2019t keep her expression tight, and burst into giggles.</p><br/><p>Seeing her laughing, Tang San\u2019s heart immediately relaxed. Laughing was good. He hurriedly stepped forward to hold her hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu took a step back, avoiding his hand. Her smile vanished, once again transforming into an ice cold expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Did you forget what I said to you last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, don\u2019t be like that, don\u2019t I know I did wrong? It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to let you bear it together with me, it\u2019s just that in those circumstances, I was nervous! Nervous, so I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, even he himself couldn\u2019t keep explaining. The facts were there, and Tang San was never good at sweet words. He could only look awkwardly at Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu suddenly stepped forward, grabbing Tang San\u2019s right adm and bringing it to her mouth, then bit down hard on his forearm.</p><br/><p>Tang San grimaced from the pain, but didn\u2019t dare make sound, obediently letting Xiao Wu bite and also controlling his spirit power to not react.</p><br/><p>Just like Tang San didn\u2019t know how to explain it to Xiao Wu, even though Xiao Wu was angry, she didn\u2019t know how to punish Tang San. Tang San didn\u2019t let her appear in the midst of danger in order to protect her. Therefore, she also could only use a method like this to show her displeasure with him.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Wu let go, Tang San hastily put away his grimace, looking at Xiao Wu as if it was nothing, asking with concern,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, are your teeth alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu stared blankly. Seeing Tang San\u2019s fawning appearance, she finally couldn\u2019t help laughing again, throwing herself into his arms and forcefully beating his chest,</p><br/><p>\u201cBig idiot, damn you. I\u2019m ignoring you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San dim-wittedly let Xiao Wu beat him, his heart relaxing. Each time he faced Xiao Wu, no matter how intelligent he was in a fight, his mind turned to porridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu seemed tired of beating him, and bit Tang San\u2019s chest again. In a flash of red light, hse returned within him. Xiao Wu\u2019s body naturally also returned to its previous vacant appearance.</p><br/><p>Tang San held Xiao Wu\u2019s body, secretly heaving a sigh of relief and rubbing his chest. Looking at the vacant Xiao Wu in his arms, his heart ached. He\u2019d prefer to be bitten by Xiao Wu every day, to see her angry, than to see the emptiness in her eyes now.</p><br/><p>Softly kissing her forehead, holding her tightly, he secretly swore that, once they were finished with the trials on the Seagod\u2019s Island, no matter what, he would resurrect Xiao Wu first. Seventy sixth rank. There were still another fourteen ranks to restoring Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoaxed her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun stuck his head out from behind.</p><br/><p>Tang San turned around to look. The five devils and Bai Chenxiang were already gathered, each and every one with looking like they were holding back laughter, apparently in need of a spanking. He snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou treasonous fellows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai coughed once:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you can\u2019t blame us for this. Yes. Xiao Wu has managed to return to her body to be affectionate with you, we can\u2019t go interrupting you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar immediately displayed his formidable ability to change the topic,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, that little idiot just now said you were the lord Seagod\u2019s chosen person, what did that mean? Have you thought about it?\"</p><br/><p>His subject change was extremely successful, Tang San\u2019s expression immediately brightened, lowering his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t be sure of the true answer, but from the name of my trials, as well as what that Xiao Bai said, I believe the trials we face should be even more difficult than originally. As for that Seagod, whether it exists or not, even though I can\u2019t guess why it would treat me so, it shouldn\u2019t be maliciously. That can be proven by that golden light protecting me just now. Since he has no ill intention, and the enormous help these trials are to increase our strength, we don\u2019t need to think too much about it right now. It\u2019s enough as long as we do our best to increase our strength. Once we leave this place, our goal is the eightieth rank. When we return to the mainland then, we\u2019ll at least have the strength to defend ourselves, and won\u2019t have to worry about fighting Spirit Hall powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said without the slightest hesitation:</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides Fatty continuing to work hard to attack the seventieth rank, the rest of us will constantly go into the water, and try to fight there. The drag of the seawater is quite large, and further adding the strange energy, it\u2019s also a kind of pressure to us. Moreover, constantly trying to break through the blockade led by the Devil Spirit Great White Shark King, fighting it, our fighting strength in the ocean will constantly rise. Even Xiao Bai herself said that she won\u2019t attack us directly. Under such circumstances, don\u2019t you think she\u2019s the best sparring partner for us? Let\u2019s not think about how to pass the test, first practice how to fight under water while she blocks, that\u2019s equal to learning how to fight in an environment like a domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, if we can all cooperate in the sea, then wouldn\u2019t that make our teamwork on land even faster, and even more invulnerable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, how about I go train together with you. Anyway, there\u2019s no suitable spirit beast here to become my spirit ring, I won\u2019t be able to break through even if I cultivate to the seventieth rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said there\u2019s no suitable spirit beast so you can\u2019t have a seventh spirit ring? Don\u2019t mind anything else right now. Cultivate assiduously and break through the bottleneck, at that time I\u2019ll have ways for you to obtain a seventh spirit ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked distracted, but he didn\u2019t ask anything else, directly choosing to trust in Tang San. Actually, not just him, the other six of the Shrek Seven Devils all had a close to blind faith in Tang San. Tang San would never speak without thinking, and his character was absolutely completely trustworthy.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, when do we start?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai laughed out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy ask that? Time is tight and the mission urgent. Something like finding a hundred thousand year spirit beast isn\u2019t easy. Further one that won\u2019t attack directly. Naturally we\u2019ll recover our spirit power, and start right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone smiled at each other, agreeing by chance to sit down crosslegged and start cultivating, recovering the spirit power they expended before. Oscar even more put his energy into starting to remake his clone mirror sausages.</p><br/><p>Tang San still didn\u2019t teach his internal respiration method to the others, because the spirit power cultivation techniques of this world had major differences with his Mysterious Heaven Skill. He had studied with Grandmaster for so many years, and naturally knew this bit. It was very difficult for everyone\u2019s spirit power to conduct internal respiration like him. But each person\u2019s spirit was different, and they also had different methods.</p><br/><p>Starting from this day, the ring sea that had surrounded and protected Seagod mountain for countless years grew lively. Every day there were violent fluctuations like great waves and stormy seas, from time to time came bursts of intense light, and whirlpools constantly appeared in the seawater.</p><br/><p>Something like swimming ability had very many techniques, but just like cultivating spirit power, there weren\u2019t any big shortcuts, only practice making perfect. Even though the Shrek Seven Devils party were all non swimmers, along with playing in the water every day, as well as their formidable strength, they very soon grew accustomed. Their swimming ability grew stronger almost every day. Even though they still couldn\u2019t be described as fish in water, at least they wouldn\u2019t be too hindered in the sea.</p><br/><p>Even Xiao Wu returned to her body for a time every day to go into the water with everyone. Making everyone else envious was that the Devil Spirit Great White Shark Xiao Bai would never attack Xiao Wu, so much so that she would even take care to avoid Xiao Wu when launching attacks.</p><br/><p>What Xiao Bai said after that battle really wasn\u2019t empty words. The true significance of its strength could be displayed in the ocean. A hundred thousand year sea spirit beast in the sea was a terrifying existence. Tang San could be sure that even four or five Title Douluo might not be her opponent in the sea. Fortunately, she really did start off leniently. Even though everyone were frequently beaten until they were covered with cuts and bruises, Xiao Bai would only drive them out of the ring sea and then stop attacking. Moreover, she never harmed them in any true sense.</p><br/><p>Through constant battle in the sea, everyone clearly understood that their opponent was not only the sea spirit beasts. It was also the ring sea. Under Xiao Bai\u2019s control, each drop of seawater became their enemy, rejecting them. Besides Xiao Wu, Xiao Bai\u2019s attacks to Tang San were the gentlest, perhaps because she was apologetic over the mistake that day. But she absolutely wouldn\u2019t throw the game. To her, she was the everyone\u2019s second trial examiner, and this authority and duty was assigned by the Seagod. No matter how powerful she was, she absolutely didn\u2019t dare show private considerations.</p><br/><p>However, as the days went by, as everyone were trampled by Xiao Bai in the ring sea each day, they gradually also started to feel trampled. Everyone admired Xiao Bai\u2019s strength, but Xiao Bai was also very curious about them. In her eyes, after these land spirit masters gradually adapted to fighting in the ocean, they also gradually revealed how extraordinary they were. Even though they were still far from her opponents, if she wanted to rout these people on dry land, she would also have to pay a considerable price, possible even her life. Of course, that was under circumstances where Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor spirit abilities could be used. As examiner, she of course knew how Tang San was restrained. He couldn\u2019t use two hundred thousand year spirit abilities, and two great domains were unable to show their full strength, such restrictions were quite severe.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed. Half a year since the start of the second trial.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaah\u2014\u2014, Xiao Bai, be a bit gentle! Girls should be gentle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was sent out of the ring sea by a deep current, falling firmly on the beach. The sudden ache all over his body almost made him unconscious, and he couldn\u2019t help grumbling loudly.</p><br/><p>However, immediately after him, Tang San, Dai Mubai, Zhu Zhuqing, Ning Rongrong and Xiao Wu were also sent out of the ring sea one after another. Any one as bad as the next, all cutting sorry figures.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai\u2019s shark head stretched out of the water, spitting out human words at Oscar:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, big sister here is already very gentle. If I wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d already have beaten your butt into eight pieces. Ah, Rongrong! I really don\u2019t know what part about this fellow you like. He\u2019s so vulgar. And what Erect Golden Fly, are all males among you humans this obscene[2]? I\u2019d best introduce you to a handsome sea Spirit Master. A lot purer than him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked speechlessly at Oscar, her eyes brimming with smiles. Due to her being a support Spirit Master, Xiao Bai was quite considerate to her. Even when incarnating as a human woman, Xiao Bai still didn\u2019t have the the property of human women to be jealous of others\u2019 beautiful features, and on the contrary was quite close to the three girls of the seven devils. Of the three women, only Xiao Wu refused her affection, due to her almost killing Tang San. Even though Zhu Zhuqing was cold and detached, she would still occasionally exchange a few words with her in the gaps between battles. Instead it was Ning Rongrong who had the best relationship with Xiao Bai, and they became good friends when not fighting.</p><br/><p>Oscar flew into rage from embarrassment and crawled up from the sand,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, you can\u2019t slander me. A pure and honest good man like me, and you actually call me obscene? Call me vulgar? Can I decide something like spirit abilities? This is innate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pure and clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai\u2019s big eyes revealed intense contempt,</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on. The spirit is born from the heart, you\u2019re obscene to the bone, otherwise how would your spirit be so obscene? I see your eyes aren\u2019t any good things. The next time I\u2019ll beat you a bit harder. How can the gap between you and Dai Mubai be so large even with the same spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you beat people, don\u2019t slap their face. Xiao Bai, you\u2019re slapping face here, the two of us can\u2019t coexist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar jumped up and down on the beach. However, his current spirit power was already close to exhausted, and charging out wouldn\u2019t be any use. The others all looked at him with laughing expressions. They didn\u2019t know what was going on either, but Oscar seemed like he and Xiao Bai were natural enemies. Each time everyone were blasted out, Xiao Bai couldn\u2019t help taunting him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai gave Oscar a provoking look,</p><br/><p>\u201cCome! Come on! This old woman will was clean and wait for you. Scared of you, ah! Just being scared of you is no good. However, little Ao, let me warn you, men can\u2019t be no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Ao was so speechless with anger, but no matter how he hit, the always resourceful him was still helpless after meeting Xiao Bai.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring you. This old woman will wait for you all in the sea. Hurry up and recover. You can\u2019t let me wait for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Xiao Bai turned, returning to the depths of the ring sea. When she left, she still didn\u2019t forget to raise her giant tail to splash Oscar tumbling.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, this daddy\u2019ll fight it you with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was unbearably deflated. He wanted to charge into the sea, but Ning Rongrong hurriedly grabbed his waist, stopping him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, what\u2019s up with you and Xiao Bai? How come she targets you like that? You didn\u2019t peep at her bathing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said with schadenfreude from the side.</p><br/><p>Oscar was livid:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know? Every time that fellow attacks it seems to be targeting me, and every time I\u2019m the first to be beaten out, the one who falls the heaviest. Don\u2019t tell me handsome guys aren\u2019t popular now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, don\u2019t be that narcissistic, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, you\u2019ve gotta be careful. As they say, the fiercer the hatred, the deeper the love. Maybe Xiao Bai fancies your little Ao, and deliberately targets him for that reason. Girls do quite like his peach blossom eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong snorted, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd your dual pupil eyes haven\u2019t attracted girls? I trust our little Ao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Ning Rongrong, Oscar\u2019s previous anger was completely swept away, and he looked immensely self satisfied at Dai Mubai. However, Ning Rongrong\u2019s next words almost made him fall over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could Xiao Bai fancy him, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong giggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was extremely depressed, but as he with evil shape and evil form was about to settle accounts with Ning Rongrong, she\u2019d already taken a step away.</p><br/><p>Just as Oscar said, Xiao Bai really did target him, showing him some extra \u2018consideration\u2019 with each attack. However, it was also just because of this that the original food system Spirit Master\u2019s combat ability was soaring. Even though he still couldn\u2019t compare with a true power attack type Spirit Master like Dai Mubai, he still had some ways to employ Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit abilities with considerable force. If it wasn\u2019t for his physical strength being a lot weaker than Dai Mubai, as well as having lower cultivation, he might truly have been able to catch up.</p><br/><p>However, without the assistance of the Seagod\u2019s Light, even though everyone fought assiduously day after day, their spirit power promotion speed had clearly slowed down. Half a year had passed, but they all stilled kept their previous ranks, only approaching the rank breakthrough. It showed just how difficult cultivation was after spirit power reached the seventieth rank. Spirit Masters above the Spirit Sage realm normally advanced one rank every few years. They all confronted such pressure every day, so they would advance comparatively quickly.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone prepared to start recovering their spirit power through cultivating, suddenly, a resonant phoenix howl rose from behind them without the slightest warning. The atmosphere near the sea instantly heated up, warm invasive currents rising to fill the air, even bringing a somewhat smoky scent.</p><br/><p>Pleasant surprise appeared on everyone\u2019s faces simultaneously. They all turned to look, only to find an orange flame brimming with aggressiveness soar up, transforming into a giant phoenix that flew towards the horizon. Set off by that enormous phoenix flame, a chubby silhouette slowly walked out.</p><br/><p>His pace was steady and forceful, the aggressiveness of a leader manifesting without doubt. That really wasn\u2019t the aura of an emperor, but rather the aggressiveness of being placed above all living things. The terrifying aura of the king of a hundred birds.</p><br/><p>When the equally flight type Spirit Master Bai Chenxiang saw that slowly walking silhouette, she couldn\u2019t keep her knees from shaking, a difficult to suppress trembling feeling filling her whole body. That was the fear of higher level spirits of the same type. Even if the Needle-Tailed Swift was also quite a good spirit, it was still far off when compared to the king of a hundred birds.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Ma Hongjun\u2019s face appeared in everyone\u2019s view. His eyes were already completely replaced with the radiance of flame, and orange flames rose and fell all over his body, just like the god of fire descended on the world. Nowhere was a trace of his ordinarily vulgar appearance. Contrasted by the flame he looked quite tall, so much that even the other of the seven devils could feel the pressure he brought.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that, undergoing tireless cultivation, Fatty had also finally reached that important pass, successfully breaking through the seventieth rank bottleneck, entering an all new realm.</p><br/><p>The flames gradually faded, but it felt like Fatty\u2019s temperament had undergone considerable changes after breaking through. The grandeur of the Phoenix was expressed in all his gestures.</p><br/><p>Walking straight up to everyone, Fatty halted and looked at them;</p><br/><p>\u201cI succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a faint smile on his face. That noble aura of a leader gave Bai Chenxiang a feeling of her pulse speeding up. She suddenly felt that her grandfather\u2019s choice on her behalf was a bit reasonable.</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s recent depression still hadn\u2019t completely disappeared. Looking at Fatty\u2019s appearance he snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn Fatty, will you die if you don\u2019t act cool?\u201d</p><br/><p>The noble smile on Ma Hongjun\u2019s face went rigid, the next moment his former nobility vanished completely as if smashed,</p><br/><p>\u201cFack me, little Ao, you noticed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar looked distracted a moment, but immediately reacted,</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck me, you really were acting! Boss Dai, I\u2019m not one to be belligerent! However, this Fatty is acting cool like this in front of all of us, can we tolerate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai grinned sinisterly,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we can\u2019t. Beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, two rotten youths lunged practically simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty cried miserably, crouching on the ground with both hands behind his head. He didn\u2019t resist, letting the lunging Dai Mubai and Oscar thump him. Tang San only smiled, without participating. Someone always had to stay calm, and Tang San played the role of official.</p><br/><p>Actually, Dai Mubai and Oscar didn\u2019t wallow Ma Hongjun more than a few times, then helped him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Fatty, you\u2019ve caught up this quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s self-satisfaction reappeared,</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course. Ah\u2019m the descendant of the Phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong burst into giggles:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Phoenix saw how fat you are, it might even spontaneously combust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty snorted, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYour little Ao is the most handsome, got it. Third brother, I broke through. How can I get the seventh spirit ring?\u201d</p><br/><p>As a Spirit Master, who didn\u2019t want to possess their own transformative seventh spirit ring? Fatty was no exception either, his small eyes brimming with the light of hope.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do without you. Catch.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a flick of his wrist, a fiery light floated out, directly towards Fatty.</p><br/><p>Fatty reached out, and grabbed it. As that fiery light entered his hand, immediately, a strange feeling filled his whole body. He couldn\u2019t help being somewhat astounded,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, isn\u2019t this that Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent\u2019s neidan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s it. The Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent is a snake type chief. Even though it\u2019s not a bird, it also isn\u2019t a spirit beast, but rather an ancient mythical beast. But it also has the fire attribute, and moreover a yang fire attribute, the same as your phoenix flame. I once talked it over with Teacher. It\u2019s certain that this Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan contains the overwhelming majority of the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent\u2019s capability, and also possesses an effect similar to a spirit ring. Consume it and use the phoenix flame to digest it, and it will naturally become your seventh spirit ring. The Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent is a tyrant among snakes, but the phoenix is its nemesis. Even if its flame is overbearing, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for your phoenix flame to digest it. The Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent I killed absolutely wouldn\u2019t be inferior to any ten thousand year spirit beast. It\u2019s quite suitable for your seventh spirit ring. Moreover, with its identity as an ancient mythical beast, there should also be some special benefits to it becoming your seventh spirit ring. I can\u2019t tell what the concrete details are, we\u2019ll have to wait and see until after you\u2019ve absorbed it. Begin now, all of us will guard you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked over the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan in his hand, then looked at Tang San again, unable to keep his eyes from reddening a bit,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Third brother, I can\u2019t take this, it\u2019s too precious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know what creature the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent was, as the holder of the phoenix flame, he could sense the immense fire attribute energy the neidan in his hand contained, as well as an aura that made his heart thump. He understood that it would be extremely difficult for him to find anything better than this as his seventh spirit ring. With the quality of this Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan, it wouldn\u2019t even be an injustice to use it for his eighth spirit ring.</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, what did you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked distracted a moment:</p><br/><p>\u201cI called you third brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San angrily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you still blabbering about? This thing is something I kept to give to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked foolishly at Tang San, without uttering a word for a long time. Suddenly, he fiercely clapped his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, what am I blabbering for? Third brother. Hereafter this Fatty\u2019s pork is yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, he swallowed the neidan in his hand.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression eased,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pork, I only want my fourth little brother. Quickly sit down and absorb it. Even if the phoenix flame can restrain the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent\u2019s flame, this snake\u2019s flame is extremely potent, you must be careful, you can\u2019t be careless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun rubbed his face, flicking off something moist, then really didn\u2019t say anything further, immediately sitting down and starting to cultivate. But from how tightly his fists were clenched as he sat could be seen how his emotions surged right now.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai walked up next to Tang San, grabbing his shoulder. Oscar walked over from the other side, hooking his other shoulder. Even though neither of them said anything, the girls to the side could feel the four men in front of them being pervaded with that kind of affection between men.</p><br/><p>The orange red flame that had just stopped burning soared up again, and even Fatty\u2019s skin turned orange in an instant, his fleshy face showing an extremely painful expression, even his seated body became a bit unsteady.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart chilled, immediately realizing that he had still underestimated the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan\u2019s potency. That time he killed the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent there was a certain element of luck involved. Hurriedly shrugging off Dai Mubai and Oscar\u2019s hands, in a flash, he appeared behind Ma Hongjun, speaking in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything. Your spirit power all have characteristics and aren\u2019t suited to helping Fatty. Me alone is sufficient. Little Ao, give me one limit surpassing dark green sausage, one stimulating pink sausage, one big recovery sausage. Rongrong, boost my spirit power and Fatty\u2019s attributes. Quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s words were as rapid as popping beans. This time they revealed their true teamwork. When Tang San finished speaking, three sausages were already flying towards him from Oscar, and Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was already released.</p><br/><p>Sitting down crosslegged behind Fatty, Tang San drew a deep breath, eating the three sausages without the slightest hesitation, and also not minding the limit surpassing dark green sausage\u2019s side effects. Both hands instantly turned jade white, pressing on Fatty\u2019s back simultaneously.</p><br/><p>They had just battled Xiao Bai, and their spirit power was close to exhausted. Otherwise Tang San wouldn\u2019t have needed the help of little Ao\u2019s three sausages. There could be no hesitation at this moment. Tang San clearly understood that the very start of absorbing the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan was the most dangerous. If problems appeared, Fatty would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>The fair and gentle Mysterious Heaven Skill inner strength directly poured into Fatty\u2019s body. After infusing the spirit power, Tang San didn\u2019t fuse it with Fatty\u2019s phoenix spirit power to help him guide it, but rather stuck close to the spirit power to lay down defenses in his meridians.</p><br/><p>He had no understanding of Fatty\u2019s spirit power circulation path. If rashly helped Fatty lose control, he would instead easily cause the opposite reaction. His current method was instead the best defense for Fatty.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost also made a timely arrival, bestowing Tang San with spirit power boost, and Fatty with attribute boost. At the same time, the phoenix flame blazed, forcefully withstanding the frightening erupting force of the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan.</p><br/><p>Tang San could clearly sense that, even though the color of the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan\u2019s erupting fire attribute energy was the same as the phoenix flame, it was even more explosive. Only its attribute was innately suppressed by the phoenix flame, and thus didn\u2019t fully erupt. But even so, it was still extremely dangerous. However, Fatty\u2019s ability to endure exceeded Tang San\u2019s imagination. Although the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan\u2019s energy barged through his body, Fatty\u2019s phoenix flame constantly transformed into a shield and resisted without cowering back.</p><br/><p>Tang San secretly praised him, saying in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to mind your meridians, melt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Tang San as support, Fatty no longer needed to use a portion of his spirit power to guard his defenses. All the phoenix flame focused together in an instant, launching a counterattack towards the Ten Headed Fierce Yang Serpent neidan energy. In an instant, the overbearing energy of two auras brimming with equal masculinity underwent a death struggle within Fatty\u2019s body. The intense collisions made Fatty\u2019s body constantly erupt with balls of blazing flame.</p><br/><p>The hearts of everyone watching alongside were now in their throats. Tang San\u2019s clothes were already burnt black, and the hair that had grown out again since absorbing his seventh spirit ring was again turned to coke by the flame erupting from within Fatty. But Tang San\u2019s body still didn\u2019t seem to have suffered any damage. Both his hands were still lustrous white as jade, constantly pouring the his spirit power amplified by the three sausages and Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost into Fatty.</p><br/><p>In fact, Tang San had undergone the refinement of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well. His body was originally immune to both water and fire, only his water immunity referred to cold, and so it should more accurately be called immunity to both cold and heat. Even though his clothes and hair had suffered calamitously right now, his body hadn\u2019t received any true damage. After all, no matter how powerful the phoenix flame, it was still only a human force, while the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well\u2019s cold and heat were forces of heaven and earth. There was still a gap between them. Only, right now Tang San\u2019s appearance seemed quite scary, like he had turned completely to charcoal.</p><br/><p>Now the others truly understood Tang San\u2019s meaning. Not only weren\u2019t they suited to helping Fatty, Tang San hadn\u2019t even mentioned the even more important part, because none of them could resist the sustained broiling of the phoenix flame!</p><br/><p>Each of their hearts was touched. From selflessly providing immortal herbs, to now not sparing himself to help Ma Hongjun absorb the seventh spirit ring, they had all seen everything Tang San had done. Even the seven devils\u2019 boss Dai Mubai had no feelings of jealousy towards Tang San. In his heart, the words \u2018Tang San\u2019 had only one meaning. Brother. True brother, eternal brother. Brother for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>[1] White in idiot - Xiaobai () means idiot, and () \u201cWhite\u201d is also part of () \u201cidiot\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Obscene - Little White is using internet slang here, calling him \u201cYD\u201d, short for (yin dang ).</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But the seventh elder was instead blasted away, violently spinning several turns in midair before landing far away. Once his feet were on the ground, he still retreated several steps before forcefully catching his balance. His arms were clearly trembling.</p><br/><p>The mountaintop was completely silent, save for the echoes of that explosion in the mountains.</p><br/><p>Who could have imagined this result? Tang San stood tall on the mountaintop, the Seagod Trident in his hands, looking disdainfully at the world below.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the four elders led by the second elder all opened wide. They were basically unable to believe this was real. Even if the seventh elder didn\u2019t use any spirit abilities in that attack just now, as a Title Douluo, the weight of the Clear Sky Hammer already surpassed five thousand jin. Swung with such momentum, the power it held could be well imagined. By swinging it downwards he also held another major advantage. But Tang San still blocked his attack like that, and still forcibly blasted back the seventh elder. Of course, what was most incomprehensible was still Tang San\u2019s physique without even releasing his spirit.</p><br/><p>Tang San raised the Seagod Trident, heavily stamping the ground. Instantly, an explosive sound reverberated once again, and the entire Clear Sky School\u2019s fortress shook under this one strike, one enormous crack after another spreading out from below Tang San\u2019s feet. Even a power like Tang Xiao felt his footing was a bit unstable.</p><br/><p>The reason Tang San could block the seventh elder\u2019s attack without releasing his spirit like this, was admittedly because of the Seagod Trident\u2019s might, but it was equally also because his current body was already strong to an extremely terrifying degree. After obtaining the spirit rings and spirit bones of the Titan Giant Ape and the Sky Blue Bull Python, whether strength or physical toughness, Tang San could be said to have improved to a frightening level. Starting from when his skin turned gold, his body was no longer completely on a human level. As a result, even the seventh elder\u2019s formidable strength couldn\u2019t harm Tang San without actually using spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I qualified to discuss with the elders now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said flatly.</p><br/><p>The second elder said sternly:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, have you returned to the sect in order to provoke it? Even if you have a bit of strength, what crime is it to disrespect the elders and protest the sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t disrespected the elders, nor protested to you. I only want justice for my father. You were the first to attack, I only defended myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Tang San, I want to see just to what level you have cultivated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being beaten back once again, the seventh elder couldn\u2019t keep the anger from attacking his heart. Only, after this collision, he had also sufficiently understood how difficult Tang San was to deal with, especially that trident he held. Black light surged, and the Clear Sky Hammer suddenly grew larger, separating both hands, he was already using his two spirit abilities, holding one spirit avatar state Clear Sky Hammer in each hand. He was about to launch his second attack.</p><br/><p>Finally at this moment, even Tang Xiao was powerless to stop the elders. Tang San\u2019s display was too arrogant. By now, the sound of the violent collision as well as Tang San shaking the ground had already alarmed the entire sect, and large numbers of Clear Sky School disciples were rushing out from the sect, standing behind the elders and looking astonished at Tang San holding the polearm horizontally on the mountaintop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shouted, halting the seventh elder\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>The second elder spoke in a deep voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said calmly:</p><br/><p>\u201cAll elders presumable already treat me as a rebel to the sect. If, in this battle, I win, I hope all elders and clansmen can hear my explanation for my father\u2019s actions back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second elders said angrily:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you beat seventh, you\u2019re still not qualified. Seventh, grab him. Or do you want a third repetition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The seventh elder\u2019s heart was now already aflame, his face couldn\u2019t stand being beaten back by a twenty something third generation disciple twice in succession. With an angry roar, the Clear Sky Hammer Avatar in his left hand already flew towards Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San still didn\u2019t consider releasing his spirit. Holding the Seagod Trident in his left hand, he suddenly took a step forward. His left hand formed a fist, directly punching at that Clear Sky Avatar head on. A ball of yellow light condensed on his left fist, and around that yellow light, space seemed to form an enormous distorted whirlpool, as if the atmosphere was instantly compressed by this frightening light. Everyone felt the air around them grow heavy. The next moment, Tang San\u2019s left fist already stiffly met the sevneth elder\u2019s Clear Sky Avatar.</p><br/><p>An enormous yellow pillar of light exploded from within Tang San\u2019s left fist, suddenly colliding with the Clear Sky Avatar. An even more intense explosion than when hammer struck polearm before reverberated. The seventh elder\u2019s expression changed, and the other Clear Sky Avatar in his hand also flew out.</p><br/><p>The two hammers united, spitting out two strands of frightening black light, and then managed to just resist the pressure the weight of Mt Tai. Only, that dust yellow light still advanced step by step, forcing the seventh elder to retreat repeatedly. Whether because of shame or anger, or because of the enormous pressure he faced, his face was already gradually turning purple.</p><br/><p>The other four elders\u2019 expressions immediately grew even uglier. The Clear Sky School\u2019s people also watched dumbstruck. Very clearly, Tang San didn\u2019t use the capabilities of his spirits. This should probably be a spirit bone ability. But, what kind of terrifying strength could force back the seventh elder\u2019s twin spirit avatar with just a spirit bone ability?</p><br/><p>Oppressed the whole way, the seventh elder retreated more than thirty meters. Tang San sharply raised his left hand, and those two Clear Sky Avatars soared up along with the yellow light shooting from Tang San\u2019s hand. A violent explosion resounded in midair, and the two spirit avatars actually lost the black light they were emanating and fell downwards. The seventh elder hastily recalled them, saving his Clear Sky Hammer from being broken.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the Clear Sky Hammer was fragile, but rather that the attack Tang San issued was too strong. His left arm spirit bone was given by the Titan Giant Ape, called the Titan Giant Ape left arm bone. This spirit bone assigned him two great abilities, one of which was Gravity Control, and the other was the one he used now, Titan Firmament Cannon.</p><br/><p>The Titan Firmament Cannon exploited the gravitational control to instantly compress the air into a terrifying energy, bestowing an attack launched with the full strength of the Titan Giant Ape. Its power was enough to match the ninth spirit ability of ordinary Title Douluo. Tang San was already holding back here, when his left hand launched this cannon, it finally erupted in midair. Otherwise, the seventh elder wouldn\u2019t just have retreated thirty meters.</p><br/><p>Being beaten back three times, without even using his spirit. This time, besides anger, the seventh elder couldn\u2019t help feeling fear. This Tang San\u2019s strength was already something he couldn\u2019t comprehend. How?</p><br/><p>Tang San gazed at Tang Xiao and the second elder, speaking flatly:</p><br/><p>\u201cDefeating the seventh elder really can\u2019t prove anything. Therefore, I wish to challenge all the five elders. If I defeat you, then, I should be entitled to speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Tang Xiao, hearing Tang San say so couldn\u2019t help being alarmed. Alone challenging the Clear Sky School\u2019s five great elders, even as the strongest in the sect, he didn\u2019t have absolute certainty to succeed. Even though the five elders had all reached Title Douluo strength late in life, and their spirit rings also weren\u2019t extremely formidable, they were still Title Douluo, even more when they all had the Clear Sky Hammer. Tang San\u2019s words really were too arrogant, it was simply a naked provocation to the five elders. The elders\u2019 faces quickly turned white.</p><br/><p>Tang San of course had his own reasons for doing this. He\u2019d never been an impetuous person. The reason why he didn\u2019t bring out his great grandfather\u2019s token was because he knew that even with it in hand, without enough strength, would these elders listen to him? Would they return his father\u2019s two spirit bones? That was of course impossible. Even though his uncle protected him, he could hear from his previous words that he also believed his father was wrong back then. Under such circumstances, Tang San had no choice but to use this kind of method.</p><br/><p>In the spirit master world, strength was always king. Tang San would rely on his own strength to subdue all the disciples of the sect. Including his uncle Tang Xiao. Only this way could he make people believe what he said, and truly have a chance to give his father justice. Even if this was all accomplished with violence, it was also the method that saved the most time. Tang San had never planned on letting his father stay in the Clear Sky School, nor did he hope the Clear Sky School would help him in the future battle with the Spirit Empire. Consequently, he would reach his goals with the weight of thunder.</p><br/><p>The second elder slowly walked forward, the other three elders following behind him. Each step he took seemed especially heavy, and as he walked forward, one spirit ring after another was released. Tang San challenged their authority, even though it was five against one absolutely wasn\u2019t honorable, judging by the methods with which Tang San answered the seventh elder\u2019s attacks, they really might not be the opponents if they fought alone. At this moment, these elders\u2019 feelings were extremely complex. Not only had Tang San provoked their anger, they were even more astonished. Five years had passed, and even though they didn\u2019t know what Tang San had experienced, they could still clearly sense that Tang Hao\u2019s son had transformed.</p><br/><p>The seventh elder also returned to the elders\u2019 formation, taking up the rear. Even though his complexion was ugly, his eyes were exceptionally dignified.</p><br/><p>This battle was extremely important to the five elders. Even though they never thought they could lose, even winning was absolutely disgraceful. Tang San had the courage to challenge their authority, and dealing with Tang San was also a major headache. After all, as a disciple of the sect, the level of strength he possessed was of utmost importance to the entire Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>Facing the enormous pressure from the five elders simultaneously approaching, Tang San\u2019s face also grew serious. Even though this time he only faced five Title Douluo, he understood that this battle absolutely wasn\u2019t any easier than facing Bibi Dong\u2019s six Title Douluo back then. Relying on the sect\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer, these five elders were absolutely stronger than Bibi Dong\u2019s six Title Douluo that day. Moreover, that day his goal was just to save the two forest kings, as long as he escaped he won. But what he had to do today was defeat the five elders.</p><br/><p>Eyes radiant, Tang San finally released his spirit, the Blue Silver Emperor.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a halo of golden blue light burst out from him, countless rays of golden blue light making the air twist. The Seagod Trident held in his right hand was completely bathed in that golden blue light. Even though he faced a torrent of pressure, he still didn\u2019t have the slightest fear. One spirit ring after another rose from below, and with each spirit ring that appeared, his presence grew a bit thicker. Vaguely, he actually competed as an equal with the pressure of the five elders.</p><br/><p>The five elders stopped practically simultaneously. Seeing Tang San\u2019s spirit rings appear one after another, they were basically unable to hide the shock they felt.</p><br/><p>Black, black, black, black, red, black, red, red, red. Nine spirit rings silently floated around Tang San.</p><br/><p>At this moment, even though there were several hundred people in front of the Clear Sky School gate, the mountaintop was still completely silent.</p><br/><p>Of the three requirements the five elders raised back then, the coloration of Tang San\u2019s current spirit rings already answered at least two.</p><br/><p>A full four hundred thousand year spirit rings sparkled with dazzling red light. Nine spirit rings meant Tang San had Title Douluo level strength just like them. Those all over ten thousand year level spirit rings told them how Tang San had become so strong. Even though Tang San still hadn\u2019t taken out proof that he had killed a Spirit Hall Title Douluo, at this moment, whether Tang Xiao or the five elders, nobody here doubted that he had completed the three requirements from back then. And moreover absolutely completed them above quota.</p><br/><p>The second elder looked shocked at Tang San, the anger in his eyes clearly reduced a lot,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San answered very simply,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith difficulty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it was just two words, it made the hearts of all the Clear Sky School disciples on the mountain shiver simultaneously. How old was he? Just twenty. These nine spirit rings all over ten thousand years, didn\u2019t just represent formidable strength, but at the same time also represented untold suffering.</p><br/><p>The anxiety in Tang Xiao\u2019s eyes was already completely obliterated, all that remained was intense excitement. In Tang San he seemed to see the unequalled sect master who led the Clear Sky School to move unhindered in the world back then, his grandfather Tang Chen. In Tang San, he also saw hope for the future of the Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly raised the Seagod Trident in his hand, the brand on his forehead was already bright. The red seventh spirit ring flashed, and instantly, his whole body turned completely golden blue.</p><br/><p>The second elder suddenly grew calm, speaking in a deep voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, with your present strength, you really are qualified to speak to the sect. I withdraw my previous remarks. But, your provocation to the authority of us five elders must still be punished. As long as you admit you were wrong now, we won\u2019t be too harsh, and treat you leniently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly held up the trident, speaking flatly,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father did nothing wrong back then. Nor did I do anything wrong. I really wasn\u2019t challenging your authority as elders, but telling you, and every clansman, that everything our Clear Sky School has done for twenty years was really wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, a line of golden bright splendor shone from Tang San\u2019s forehead on that Seagod\u2019s Heart on the Seagod Trident. Instantly, the entire mountaintop brightened with ten thousand rays of golden light. The Seagod Trident finally blossomed with its proper radiance. The golden patterns seemed to come alive, golden light rippling like waves on the three large blades, glossy like mirrors. A terrifying aura abruptly exploded from Tang San, and a divine dignity suddenly pressed the imposing manner radiating from the five elders back into their bodies. At this moment, Tang San had already become the dazzling center of the mountaintop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seagod Trident, a hundred eight thousand jin heavy. Be careful, elders.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, abruptly, all the surroundings turned golden blue. The eyes of the five elders had also lost sight of Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cA domain. Be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second elder yelled. The five weren\u2019t flustered, and formed a pentagonal formation back to back, their auras practically instantly melting together.</p><br/><p>They all had Title Douluo level strength, they all possessed the same spirit, they had cultivated together for many years, and had long since already forged a combined attack technique. Even if they faced the strongest enemy in the world, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHammer shakes the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second elder shouted, and the five simultaneously raised their Clear Sky Hammers high. Instantly, five black lines of light converged, shooting at the sky, unexpectedly instantly breaking through Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Domain and rising high in the air.</p><br/><p>A multitude of golden threads appeared within the Blue Silver Domain, but they were unable to invade the five elders\u2019 pentagonal formation. As that draining gold approached, it was peeled off by the shock of the black light. The Blue Silver Domain\u2019s weakening effect also showed no results.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the pulse pulse of the five elders accelerated. The originally blue world suddenly turned red, and Tang San also showed himself thirty meters away from them. The atmosphere was first sticky, and the next moment, the space around them froze. The air seemed to have become a faintly red crystal. And below Tang San\u2019s feet, red magic patterns rippled one after another.</p><br/><p>This was Tang San\u2019s eighth spirit ability, Blue Silver Orca Mirror\u2019s Annihilation.</p><br/><p>Just as their bodies were about to be frozen, the five elders roared simultaneously. That black light shooting at the sky instantly reversed into a barrier, enveloping all of them completely. A resounding crack reverberated as the red color surrounding the barrier shattered, fine cracks seeming to spread far through the air.</p><br/><p>Influenced by the energy, Tang San gave a low muffled grunt, retreating a step. Only, even though he suffered the spirit ability backlash, for the most part he was still unharmed. Having been transformed by so many spirit rings, spirit rings and the Seagod\u2019s Light, his body really was too resilient, to the point that even the backlash from his eighth spirit ability could only slow his breath.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s attack still wasn\u2019t over. Yet another red ring of light rippled out, still with his eighth spirit ring flashing.</p><br/><p>The second elder\u2019s eyes focused:</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, the hundred thousand year spirit ring\u2019s second spirit ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, his eight spirit ring grew dazzlingly bright, and the Clear Sky Hammer in his hand swung brazenly towards Tang San. Instantly, the just broken air turned completely black, and immediately after, the second elder\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer disappeared. That black color in the air condensed, completely turning into an energy form, but the Clear Sky Hammer the size of a small mountain smashed directly towards Tang San.</p><br/><p>This ability was called Approaching Heaven Strike. Its attack power was even stronger than the second elder\u2019s ninth spirit ability. Among all the five elders, this attack was also the strongest.</p><br/><p>Approaching Heaven Strike\u2019s most overbearing point lay in the fact that this ability couldn\u2019t be dodged, only blocked. You would be targeted even with teleportation abilities.</p><br/><p>But, the instant the Approaching Heaven Strike formed, the second elder suddenly saw two points of blue light. Two points of light shooting out from Tang San\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Even though the giant hammer in the sky was large, at this moment, the second elder clearly felt as if his brain was smashed by an even bigger hammer. With a miserable scream, his body fell back uncontrollably, blood shooting out of his eyes, nose, mouth and ears. Not only did it break the five elders\u2019 formation, even that completed Approaching Heaven Strike in the air was forcefully interrupted. And at this moment, the ripple originating from below Tang San\u2019s feet had already reached the five elders.</p><br/><p>With position second only to the second elder, the third elder instantly took over command, shouting,</p><br/><p>\u201cClear Sky Barrier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Four Clear Sky Hammers flew out simultaneously, the intense black light abruptly turning deep golden. The positions of the spirit rings that brightened on these four Clear Sky Hammers were different, the strongest was an eighth spirit ability, the weakest only a second spirit ability, but their effects were all the same. The already deep golden light covered the five elders practically instantly, giving people a feeling as if their bodies had melted together with the Clear Sky Hammers. Attacking them was equivalent to attacking their Clear Sky Hammers.</p><br/><p>The red light spread, the Blue Silver Orca Devil\u2019s Assimilation finally enveloping the five Clear Sky School elders, and they all without exception grew rigid, at the same time forcefully stunned for three seconds. But even though they were stunned, the feeling they gave off was like a steel rampart, basically not showing any gap. Any attack would be directly answered by their Clear Sky Hammers.</p><br/><p>This was the power of the Clear Sky Hammer, how could the name of world\u2019s number one spirit be undeserved?</p><br/><p>Because of Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Domain, the five elders chose a tactic of defending and counterattacking. The Blue Silver Domain couldn\u2019t affect them, and even though Tang San\u2019s attacks came one after the other, and even relied on the Purple Demon Eye to interrupt the second elder\u2019s attack, if this three second stun ran out, one could completely imagine how these five elders\u2019 next counterattack would be like raging waves and storms, swallowing Tang San.</p><br/><p>In terms of true strength, even though Tang San possessed numerous abilities, and even the Seagod Trident, in a contest of strength, he alone still couldn\u2019t compare to the five Title Douluo, especially when these five were all Clear Sky School elders, possessing the world\u2019s number one sect\u2019s inherited spirit, the Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Tang San moved. He didn\u2019t launch any attacks on the five elders, since he could clearly sense that no matter which spirit ability he attacked the five elders with, it would confront the unified defense of all five.</p><br/><p>Three seconds passed very quickly, but besides attacking, there was still a lot Tang San could do.</p><br/><p>The Seagod Trident quietly swept out, circles of golden light rippling out from the trident\u2019s main blade. The rings were large and small, seemingly in disorder, but yet seeming as if they rippled into the air following some natural law. They pierced through the air, surrounding the five elders.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, behind Tang San appeared a giant golden figure. The intense light washed his body as if in gold. It was a divine and dignified presence, even more filled with mystery and depth.</p><br/><p>One by one, those golden rings of light cut through the air, then quietly fell, neatly enveloping the bodies of the five elders. Shocking the Clear Sky School people was that the five elders\u2019 combined defense, Clear Sky Unity, didn\u2019t do anything to stop it, and could only let the golden rings fall on them one after another.</p><br/><p>Indeed, this was the first of the Seagod\u2019s absolute skill, Golden Thirteen Halberds, Tang San had inherited, Unfixed Storm.</p><br/><p>Once those rings of light, sparkling with golden ripples, had enveloped the five elders, the previous Blue Silver Orca Devil\u2019s Assimilation effect disappeared. Even though the five elders came to their senses, in the next moment, they instantly felt that they were unable to budge a hair. Even though they still maintained the power of the Clear Sky Unity, this time, they clearly felt an intense sense of danger.</p><br/><p>As a control type spirit master, Tang San would never be careful about battlefield control. The reason why he didn\u2019t directly used Unfixed Storm was mainly because the Seagod\u2019s memories told him back then that the success rate of Unfixed Storm was lower the stronger the opponent was. But at worst it would be fifty percent. Right now, confronting five Title Douluo with Clear Sky Hammers, even if Tang San had a seventy percent or more chance of completely locking them down, he still first used the Blue Silver Orca Devil\u2019s Assimilation. Thus, how could the five stunned elders block the unified offense and defense of Unfixed Storm?</p><br/><p>Eight seconds. This time, Tang San\u2019s Unfixed Storm had an eight second duration on the elders.</p><br/><p>Three seconds and eight seconds, that was two completely different concepts. In three seconds, a spirit master could at most complete one formidable attack. But eight seconds could let a spirit master easily complete two, even three abilities. In a fight with Title Douluo, the eight second Unfixed Storm basically already settled the outcome of the battle. How many people could have Bibi Dong\u2019s Undying Body?</p><br/><p>Right now, Tang San\u2019s expression had also become serious. This was his first time using the three great divine abilities the Seagod bestowed him in battle. At the same time it was also his only chance of defeating the five elders.</p><br/><p>The golden figure leapt up, turning into countless golden lights, overflowing the sky with polearm shadows, like dazzling clouds of golden light that directly enveloped the golden elders. This was the golden thirteen halberds\u2019 third move, Millennial Space.</p><br/><p>Back when the Seagod\u2019s brand used this move, it couldn\u2019t show it\u2019s true effect due to lacking energy. When Tang San used it now, he immediately experienced how terrifying it was.</p><br/><p>In practically an instant, more than half of his spirit power and mental strength drained away. Urged by the Seagod\u2019s Light, it all flowed into the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>On the mountaintop, everything then turned golden. Even the mist on the mountain seemed to become part of Tang San\u2019s attack, turning into a large swath of golden light mist, rippling.</p><br/><p>The Seagod Trident in Tang San\u2019s hand then disappeared. That large swath of light mist flowed up to the five elders like mercury. All the golden clouds practically instantly exploded, violently colliding with the five elders\u2019 Clear Sky Union.</p><br/><p>The deadly explosion made the sky and earth tremble, all the Clear Sky School disciples quickly retreated under Tang Xiao\u2019s command, but the Seagod\u2019s power didn\u2019t scatter, instead remaining completely focused on the five elders. The united defense formed by their Clear Sky Hammers tottered in the attack like assaulted by a storm.</p><br/><p>The first crack appeared, and it was like an infection. Immediately, one crack after another quickly showed in that formidable defense in the violent golden cloud explosion, like an eggshell breaking.</p><br/><p>Boom\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>With a final explosive crack, the five elders were thrown out simultaneously. Their combined defense was finally broken. In the end, the power of the Seagod Trident\u2019s Millennial Space wasn\u2019t something their passive defense could take. But that they could block for so long already marked them as a lot stronger than the Spirit Hall Title Douluo from back then. In fact, what Tang San now used was the complete edition Millennial Space. He just didn\u2019t truly have the Seagod\u2019s divine force right now. There was still a gap from when the Seagod used it.</p><br/><p>The Seagod Trident reappeared in Tang San\u2019s grasp. Only, he still didn\u2019t continue using the Golden Thirteen Halberds\u2019 third move, One Goes Without Return, and rather moved the trident to his left hand, his right hand storing strength and grabbing in the air towards the five elders.</p><br/><p>After a full four seconds of storing power, an enormous cyan claw shape appeared in midair, unexpectedly grabbing the five scattered elders\u2019 bodies together from where they had been thrown. The five were now still in that eight second restrained time from the Unfixed Storm, basically powerless to resist, they could only urge the spirit power within their bodies, but they still didn\u2019t have the space to catch their breath from the Millennial Space\u2019s explosion. Their united Clear Sky Defense could now only become single targeted.</p><br/><p>After that giant cyan claw grabbed them, the five elders suddenly just felt a pain emerge from the depths of their souls. All their thoughts seemed to slow, and everything they saw seemed to become slow motion.</p><br/><p>The differences between spirit ring and spirit bone abilities lay in the fact that spirit ring abilities were a new abilities formed from the killed spirit beast\u2019s abilities combining with the spirit master\u2019s spirit, while spirit bone abilities were the spirit beast\u2019s strongest capability.</p><br/><p>What Tang San used now was one of the Sky Blue Bull Python\u2019s right arm bone abilities, Sky Blue Slowing God Claw. As the supplementary ability of the Sky Blue Bull Python\u2019s right arm bone, when facing the Sky Blue Slowing God Claw, physical defense was ineffective. Targeting, pursuing, if hit, the grabbed person\u2019s six senses and physical movements would all slow tenfold.</p><br/><p>This ability was noiseless and traceless, without causing any energy fluctuations, it\u2019s effects lay in restraint. Being grabbed by it, even the strongest experts, unless they had a way to instantly break it, there was no difference from death.</p><br/><p>This was Tang San\u2019s present understanding of this ability. As for further uses and effects, as well as practical applications, was something that still needed constant combat trials to comprehend.</p><br/><p>The Sky Blue Bull Python and the Titan Giant Ape were worthy of being the strongest forest kings. Just the spirit bone abilities they gave Tang San were one control and one burst attack, endlessly formidable.</p><br/><p>A spirit bone ability\u2019s might not be equal to spirit ring abilities, but its greatest advantage was in spirit power consumption. Especially hundred thousand year spirit bones needed only a fifth of the spirit power of an equally leveled spirit ring ability. Otherwise, how could Tang San close to infinitely have used Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit bone teleportation ability? Unfortunately, he no longer had it.</p><br/><p>Breaking the Sky Blue Slowing God Claw wasn\u2019t difficult, all that was required was using an at least eighth spirit ability energy attack and it would instantly collapse. Only, when it collapsed, any spirit abilities in contact with it would also disappear. But thee five elders were still being restrained, how could they break this spirit ability? The cyan light faded, and each of the five elders\u2019 six senses and movements sank into a ten times slowed state.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But the ones chasing him were still Spirit Sage level powers. There was no lack of agility attack type Spirit Masters among them. With them in pursuit, the distance between both sides was still constantly closing.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step was admittedly wondrous, but Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step was best at dodging, not running.</p><br/><p>Tang San very clearly knew that in the world of his old life, there were some movement arts that were more suited to this kind of situation than Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step, like Shaolin\u2019s Eight Step Catching Cicada as well as a kind of Transient Light Passing Shadow movement art. However, what use were these right now? All he could do was only constantly move forwards.</p><br/><p>Having reached the Spirit Sage level, if the qi locked on the opponent, as long as they didn\u2019t leave a certain range, it was impossible to lose them. Among the thirteen Spirit Sages there were altogether five agility attack type Spirit Masters. The five spread into a semi circle, half surrounding them like lightning.</p><br/><p>Let alone these five being able to kill Tang San and capture Xiao Wu, even if they couldn\u2019t as long as they could tangle with Tang San for a while, allowing their companions to catch up from behind, the outcome would still be the same.</p><br/><p>The longer he confronted crises, the sharper Tang San\u2019s mind became. Brain operating rapidly, thinking about ways to get out of the current danger.</p><br/><p>Gradually, they had already left the territory of the two great spirit beast kings, and in the surroundings also began to appear the auras of spirit beasts. To Tang San and Xiao Wu, this wasn\u2019t any good news. With their present speed, if they were stopped just for a moment by alerted spirit beasts, the enemies behind them would swiftly catch up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu softly called out.</p><br/><p>Tang San lowered his head. His spiritual force found the path forward, and the effect of his eyes was on the contrary not as clear.</p><br/><p>Using a hand to softly coil Xiao Wu\u2019s long hair, Tang San pulled her in tight,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I still live, I won\u2019t ever let them harm you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, Tang San\u2019s speed forward suddenly dropped. His body was abruptly raised outright, the top four Eight Spider Lances thrusting into the trunks of two large trees ahead, bringing him across the trees like a giant spider, successively crossing several great trees.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s movements naturally had a destination, he was circling to one side. The five people chasing closest behind moved held a semicircular pattern. He was currently circling to one side, and thus, when the opponents caught up, they didn\u2019t have to face the attacks of five Spirit Sages at once.</p><br/><p>A blue light halo suddenly released, and the blue silver grass on the ground began to grow frantically. With blue silver grass growing everywhere in the Star Dou Great Forest, Tang San\u2019s strength could undoubtedly be displayed to its greatest extent.</p><br/><p>This absolutely wasn\u2019t the time to be merciful. Tang San\u2019s eyes were already filled with a ruthless ice chill.</p><br/><p>That closest agility attack type Spirit Master was already in viewing distance. Monstrously fast, dashing in Tang San\u2019s direction just like a phantom.</p><br/><p>Seeing the opponent approach, Tang San no longer moved his body, Eight Spider Lances sticking to a tree trunk behind him, suspending him and Xiao Wu in the air.</p><br/><p>That pursuing agility attack type Spirit Master was roughly fifty years old. He didn\u2019t have Tang San\u2019s ability to probe with spiritual force, but pulled by the energy he could still sense that he approached the target with extreme speed, and was immediately overjoyed. Seeing Tang San and Xiao Wu\u2019s silhouettes appear before him, both his hands immediately turned into sharp blades, throwing himself forward like a bolt of lightning.</p><br/><p>This agility attack type Spirit Master\u2019s spirit was called Spirit Chasing Swallow, excelling in speed and arcing attacks, its attack power unusually high. Right now, in order to pursue Tang San, he had already fully used his Spirit Avatar, and his entire body was like an immense black swallow, cutting straight at Tang San and Xiao Wu with a pitch black chill in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shouted.</p><br/><p>Just as if following orders, the Soul Chasing Swallow Spirit Sage abruptly slowed in midair, completely stalling in the air, falling towards the ground. His body was already twisted up by numerous and densely packed Blue Silver Emperor. In order to deal with any eventualities, as early as before they met Xiao Wu, Tang San had already spread Parasite Blue Silver Emperor seeds on each member of the Spirit Hall party except the two Title Douluo. Launching it now, was just right to catch him off guard.</p><br/><p>However, the opponent had still used Spirit Avatar. It could only really delay him for one second. His body had just started falling, when the Blue Silver Emperor twisting around him were already torn apart by his unreasoning attack power.</p><br/><p>But this one second, to Tang San, was already enough.</p><br/><p>Throwing himself head on, exploiting the flying ability of the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone, Tang San charged forward in the split second the opponent was restrained. The opponent was originally charging towards him, and under such circumstances, the distance closed in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Both Tang San\u2019s hands looped and pulled at his chest, the Clear Sky Hammer already appearing out of nowhere. With a keng sound, the opponent\u2019s hand blades were both scattered the moment he broke free of Parasite.</p><br/><p>In terms of both Spirit Power as well as the opponent\u2019s Spirit Avatar strength, Tang San would ordinarily inevitably be sent flying here. But in fact, Tang San still didn\u2019t break out of fighting range. Because, those incomparably sharp Eight Spider Lances were already thrusting towards the opponent\u2019s body from eight directions.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s second spirit ability, Parasite, stunning the opponent and frantically breaking free, this was all in Tang San\u2019s grasp of timing. It was just that split second that the battle was already decided.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer blocked the opponent\u2019s attack, but the enormous impulse also made his Clear Sky Hammer rebound. Tang San\u2019s other hand promptly pulled away Xiao Wu, his Clear Sky Hammer directly striking his chest, and the opponent\u2019s hand blades also left bloody scars.</p><br/><p>But this was also all that this Soul Chasing Swallow Spirit Sage accomplished. His body was instantly corroded when the Eight Spider Lances entered his body. Tang San clearly felt the opponent\u2019s vitality rush out through the Eight Spider Lances, and his own previously enormously consumed spirit power also subsequently recovered somewhat.</p><br/><p>How heavy was the Clear Sky Hammer? Even more when it was mixed with the opponent\u2019s spirit power attack. Tang San felt a sweet taste, and with a belching sound he vomited up a mouthful of fresh blood. But when the Eight Spider Lances left the opponent\u2019s body, it had already completely turned into a dried out corpse, completely emptied by the Eight Spider Lances.</p><br/><p>From start to finish, the entire process only took less than three seconds. In practically a single breath, the fight was already over.</p><br/><p>If it was a one versus one battle, relying on his two great domains and three great spirit bones, even if Tang San\u2019s spirit power was ten ranks lower than the opponent\u2019s, he could still be certain of victory, even to the extent of a complete victory.</p><br/><p>However, right now he basically didn\u2019t have the time to carefully look for the opponent\u2019s gaps to reach victory. Fighting quickly to reach a conclusion quickly let him use this method of using his life to take the opponent\u2019s life, instantly dealing with this Spirit Sage level agility attack type Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>What was called using his life to take the opponent\u2019s life wasn\u2019t the same as doing his utmost. What Tang San did was use the smallest price to achieve the greatest results.</p><br/><p>He had only spit out a mouthful of blood and suffered light injuries, the chest wounds weren\u2019t deep either. But taking the opponent\u2019s life in return, this was undoubtedly an extremely profitable exchange.</p><br/><p>The moment he pulled out Eight Spider Lances, Tang San again pulled Xiao Wu close and shot away. The instant he left his former position, at least four long range attacks struck the place he just was. The other four agility attack type Spirit Masters were already catching up.</p><br/><p>Tang San understood that in order to separate Xiao Wu from the pursuers, these agility attack type Spirit Masters had to be dealt with. Otherwise, he basically couldn\u2019t outrun the opponents. If they were blocked by spirit beasts, he and Xiao Wu would be finished. Therefore, he brazenly decided that, no matter how, he still had to think of a way to dispose of them.</p><br/><p>On the surface it seemed that he had paid a very small price, but Tang San\u2019s heart was still bitter.</p><br/><p>Spirit Sages were after all Spirit Sages, especially Spirit Sages already using Spirit Avatar. In spirit power, he basically wasn\u2019t on their level. Even this comprehensively advantageous exchange just now, Tang San was counter struck in the chest with the Clear Sky Hammer, and right now he was still aching. Those sharp blades streaking across his chest had even more delivered a destructive sharp energy into his body, doing its utmost to drill into him, forcing him to divert a portion of Mysterious Heaven Skill inner strength to drive it out.</p><br/><p>Thus, his and Xiao Wu\u2019s speed forward dropped once again. The other four already berserk agility attack type Spirit Masters were catching up with astonishing speed.</p><br/><p>Previously pulled aside by Tang San, Xiao Wu stared blankly at the wounds that agility attack type Spirit Sage left on Tang San\u2019s chest, immediately awakening from her charming gentleness. Gathering air to lighten her body, she did her utmost to lessen the burden on Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San spoke in a low voice as he swiftly rushed forward:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to get rid of these agility attack type Spirit Masters behind us, otherwise we won\u2019t be able to escape. Just now I killed one, there are still four.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu smiled sweetly, the circumstances before her eyes making her feel as if she had returned to those days she and Tang San faced powerful enemies in the Great Spirit Arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let our Three Five Combination give them something to look at.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Xiao Wu embraced Tang San\u2019s neck with one hand, her entire body slipping over Tang San\u2019s shoulders as if boneless, reaching Tang San\u2019s back. As her soft as if boneless delicate body passed Tang San\u2019s body, dense spirit power fluctuations immediately released.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu also hadn\u2019t reached the sixtieth rank, it felt as if her spirit power level wasn\u2019t much different from Ma Hongjun\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve entered. Xiao Wu, in a moment I can directly get rid of two, but afterwards I\u2019ll need some time to readjust. After I\u2019ve launched my attack, it\u2019ll be your turn to bring me running forward, go as fast as you can, my back on yours. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaning over Tang San\u2019s back, Xiao Wu nodded, expressing she understood.</p><br/><p>Due to Tang San previously halting and his speed dropping, the four agility attack type Spirit Masters were already close behind. In order to prevent circumstances like being suddenly attacked, these four Spirit Sages advanced close together, in a moment the distance to Tang San and Xiao Wu was less than fifty meters.</p><br/><p>The Eight Spider Lances suddenly rose on either side, and Xiao Wu took one step on Tang San\u2019s back to launch herself into the air at his indication, and Tang San himself stepped with the toes of his left foot on a large tree in front, with a shout turning in a moment, both hands simultaneously rising high, soaring.</p><br/><p>The agility attack type Spirit Sages were really too fast, Tang San only did one very simple motion, and they had already closed to within twenty meters, the quartet\u2019s abilities already prepared.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the four bodies simultaneously slowed a moment. The two Spirit Sages on the sides both bound by Blue Silver Emperor Parasite launching in a flash, the gazes of the two people in the middle completely lifeless. Their bodies uncontrollably flew forwards and down, until they struck the ground.</p><br/><p>But Tang San also seemed drained, his complexion abruptly turning deathly pale. If not for the prompt support of the Eight Spider Lances. right now he would already be unable to stand.</p><br/><p>Soul Chasing Life Taking Yama\u2019s Invitation. Yes, when the Spirit Sages used Spirit Avatar, of all of Tang San\u2019s hidden weapons, only these Soul Chasing Life Taking Yama\u2019s Invitations could kill in one hit with certainty.</p><br/><p>Tang San originally refined altogether three Soul Chasing Life Taking Yama\u2019s Invitations, he used one before, and Tang San threw out the remaining two in this split second.</p><br/><p>The Soul Chasing Life Taking Yama\u2019s Invitation wasn\u2019t only terrifying in itself, even more important was the combination of technique and Mysterious Heaven Skill. In order to use this third ranked Tang inner sect hidden weapon, Mysterious Jade Hand, Purple Demon Eye, Controlling Crane Catching Dragon, Mysterious Heaven Skill, all four great secret skills were indispensable.</p><br/><p>At the fortieth rank, Tang San could only use it once when exhausting his entire spirit power. And now at close to sixtieth rank, simultaneously using two Yama\u2019s Invitations exhausted seventy percent or more of his spirit power. Including the previous consumption, it was naturally rather difficult to take.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shouted loudly. To him and Xiao Wu, right now was their best chance. If they ignored this opportunity, then with Tang San\u2019s already substantially consumed spirit power and Xiao Wu\u2019s low strength, they basically wouldn\u2019t get another.</p><br/><p>A formidable pushing force appeared at Tang San\u2019s back. The next moment, he flew out, crashing towards one of the agility attack type Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Just like the agility attack type Spirit Sage that died under the Eight Spider Lances before, this Spirit Sage tang san chose as target could also only be held for one second.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San approach, even fully using Spirit Avatar he only had time to issue a frontal attack.</p><br/><p>However, just when he prepared to launch his attack, he discovered that he completely couldn\u2019t move his arms and legs.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu had at some unknown time already appeared behind him, arms and legs glittering with dazzling golden radiance, forming a unique layer of armor type equipment over her skin, her entire body was like a giant vise, rigidly locking down the opponent.</p><br/><p>This was Xiao Wu\u2019s fifth spirit ability, Soft Bones Lock.</p><br/><p>If one was locked down by the Soft Bones Lock at close range, without physical strength more than double that of the wielder, one could only accept being held, until Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit power ran out or she voluntarily left.</p><br/><p>But while using the Soft Bones Lock, Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t use any other attack methods. But the effect of this lock was still extremely terrifying, after Xiao Wu again separated from the opponent, the opponent would still be deadlocked for five seconds. This was most important.</p><br/><p>Relying on Teleportation and Soft Bones Lock, this Spirit Sage was directly sentenced to death.</p><br/><p>Eight Spider Lances violently pierced his body, the essence of his vitality flowing out, and obtaining the replenishment of the Eight Spider Lances draining the opponent\u2019s vitality, Tang San\u2019s mind was greatly roused, instantly recovering forty percent of his spirit power.</p><br/><p>Drain, this was Eight Spider Lances\u2019 additional ability. Tang San very rarely used it in the past, because this ability was really too evil, and also too merciless. But now, in order to live, he couldn\u2019t have any considerations. Erupting with all his strength, Eight Spider Lances was the most conspicuous.</p><br/><p>With a muffled grunt, the moment Xiao Wu undid the Soft Bones Lock, her body already blocked in front of Tang San. An immense impulse pushed her body back into Tang San\u2019s embrace, and at the same time there still rose a burst of intense sonorous metallic sounds.</p><br/><p>Successively striking and killing three agility attack type Spirit Sages, Tang San and Xiao Wu could even be said to have revealed all their secrets. But they were after all confronting four enemies.</p><br/><p>The final agility attack type Spirit Sage, watching his three companions unexpectedly dying by the hands of two opponents with spirit power far below theirs, besides fury, there also rose a chill at the bottom of his heart. At the same time as Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances drained, he also launched a sneak attack.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, what he attacked was Xiao Wu using her fourth spirit ability, Invincible Golden Body.</p><br/><p>Despite the tremendous impulse pushing Xiao Wu back into Tang San\u2019s embrace, those brief seconds of Invincible Golden Body meant she hadn\u2019t suffered any injuries. One hand embracing Tang San\u2019s waist, both feet pushing off the ground, drawing on the impulse, the two swiftly charged forward. And those sonorous sounds, was Xiao Wu\u2019s other hand firing the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.</p><br/><p>She had previously already readied it while held by Tang San.</p><br/><p>A series of resounding cracks echoed. The Godly Zhuge Crossbow of course couldn\u2019t injure a Spirit Sage level power, but it could still manage to stop the opponent. Tang San had recovered several tenths of his power. Eight Spider Lances pushing off the ground, shooting out, he brought Xiao Wu to once again fly into the depths of the forest.</p><br/><p>Five agility attack type Spirit Masters had already lost four. As long as they entered the forest, Tang San had confidence in relying on Blue Silver Grass to make this last agility attack type Spirit Master unable to attack them. Once he had recovered a bit of spirit power, the two could once again join hands to eliminate this sacrificial agility attack type Spirit Sage. Outrunning the pursuit of the other Spirit Sages wasn\u2019t any difficult matter.</p><br/><p>The other Spirit Hall experts were currently more than five hundred meters behind. At this distance they were basically unable to threaten them.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s planning and strength, his cooperation with Xiao Wu, had undoubtedly already reached perfection. Relying on their less than sixtieth ranked strength, they still struck down and killed four Spirit Sages within a short time. This was undoubtedly worthy of pride. If it really went according to Tang San\u2019s plans, they would also have a very large chance to break away from the pursuit and escape. As long as they waited until the Titan Giant Ape and the Sky Blue Bull Python broke free of Ghost Douluo and Chrysanthemum Douluo\u2019s domain, they would not longer be in any danger.</p><br/><p>But the plans of men aren\u2019t equal to the plans of Heaven. Just as they threw themselves into the forest, with the agility attack type Spirit Sage stopped behind them due to the Godly Zhuge Crossbow, suddenly, a blue ghastly great net spread open in front of them.</p><br/><p>That large net was constantly dripping with sticky fluid, and a more than three meter in diameter, all over black and white, enormous silhouette appeared in Tang San and Xiao Wu\u2019s line of sight. That great web was spit out by it.</p><br/><p>That was a spirit beast, and moreover one that Tang San was exceedingly familiar with.</p><br/><p>Known as the Wicked Butcher, the Man Faced Demon Spider.</p><br/><p>This Man Faced Demon Spider that appeared in front of them was larger than any one he had seen before. Being able to appear here, undoubtedly proved that this Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s cultivation had reached at least a terrifying thirty thousand years.</p><br/><p>In fact, because the terrifying Man Faced Demon Spider was too vicious, it would frequently be hunted and killed by some formidable spirit beasts. Just cultivating to ten thousand years wasn\u2019t easy, let alone several tens of thousand of years. As Tang San saw that enormous silhouette and that spread wide dripping with sticky liquid spiderweb, his heart sank. Could it be that this was what was called chickens coming home to roost? He had killed two Man Faced Demon Spiders before, and moreover possesses their spirit ring and the external spirit bone Eight Spider Lances had given him enormous advantages. But this Man Faced Demon Spider in front of them seemed to have become the end of him and Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>What Tang San could least understand was that he had always scanned the surroundings with his spiritual force, but still hadn\u2019t discovered anything abnormal. Just how did this Man Faced Demon Spider appear?</p><br/><p>How could he know that, with the Man Faced Demon Spider being a creature that gobbled up life, the target of all spirit beasts\u2019 loathing, the terrifying wicked butcher, after its strength reached the ten thousand year level, it would gain a special stealth ability. This ability could not only conceal its figure, but at the same time also conceal its aura, even blocking spiritual force probes. Not even Grandmaster knew this, after all, the ten thousand year Man Faced Demon Spider was really too rare.</p><br/><p>This was how it could suddenly appear in front of Tang San and Xiao Wu. Clearly, it had already taken Tang San and Xiao Wu for its prey.</p><br/><p>Two spider legs on the left side swept against the ground with all their might, raising an ear piercing grinding sound, making Tang San and Xiao Wu instantly tilt, changing their direction into a large arc, dangerously close but not colliding with that spider web.</p><br/><p>However, they confronted not only a spiderweb, but still a terrifyingly strong, more than thirty thousand years Man Faced Demon Spider.</p><br/><p>The enormous demon spider quietly moved sideways, already waiting in the direction they had shifted to, four thick and solid spider legs thrusting perfectly straight at the two.</p><br/><p>The Eight Spider Lances blood draining effect came from the Man Faced Demon Spider, so Tang San of course knew what the result of being pricked by these spider legs would be. Even if his body was even more durable, he still wouldn\u2019t dare come into contact with these terrifying blood sucking pikes.</p><br/><p>This moment Tang San\u2019s rich combat experience was embodied. His sliding body using the four Eight Spider Lances below him to stick into the ground to halt him slightly, simultaneously raising the four Eight Spider Lances above, using spider lance against spider lance, meeting the Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>A sonorous brittle sound echoed, and Tang San and Xiao Wu were sent flying by the tremendous impact. With a vomiting sound, Tang San again spouted up a mouthful of blood under the immense shock. Even at peak condition he would need to go all out against such a powerful spirit beast, let alone now that he only had forty percent power left.</p><br/><p>But that Man Faced Demon Spider didn\u2019t find it easy either. Even though its spider pikes were still larger than Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances, Tang San lost out in power in both sides\u2019 collision, but in durability, his external spirit bone Eight Spider Lances held the advantage.</p><br/><p>This ten thousand year Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s four spider pikes revealed four small holes, unexpectedly pierced by Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances.</p><br/><p>In fact, Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances were constantly evolving along with Tang San\u2019s strength rising. Whether it was at the time of the two great immortal herbs Infernal Precious Apricot and Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass, or later when Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Grass awoke to Blue Silver Emperor, both made it constantly evolve.</p><br/><p>Along with Tang San\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Skill advancing, also the progress of spirit power, the Eight Spider Lances once again passed many kinds of evolution. The degree of its own durability had long since surpassed even that of the Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s own spider legs. Especially when it still contained the ice and fire attributes.</p><br/><p>When Tang San and Xiao Wu were knocked flying, this Man Faced Demon Spider couldn\u2019t pursue. Because on the ground, throngs of blue silver grass was already rigidly tying it down. And those four spider legs that collided with Tang San before were already showing red and blue colored light, just swiftly spreading along its leg towards its body.</p><br/><p>That was the hybrid ice and fire poison. It could mutually counteract with the Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s poison, but this attribute specific to Tang San wasn\u2019t something the Man Faced Demon Spider could easily eliminate. Fortunately it had also hit his legs, so the spreading speed was slow.</p><br/><p>The Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s mouth issued an extremely sharp hissing sound, its enormous body struggling forcefully, relying on unreasoning strength to finally tear open the blue silver grass surrounding it. But it didn\u2019t pursue Tang San and Xiao Wu again, clearly it knew the difficulty. A portion of black energy circulated within its body, resisting the spread of the red and blue colors, swiftly shooting out and disappearing in the forest.</p><br/><p>The Man Faced Demon Spider was scared off by Tang San\u2019s ice and fire poison, however, it had still brought them an enormous disaster.</p><br/><p>To Spirit Sages, five hundred meters wasn\u2019t a particularly large distance. Even without agility attack type Spirit Sages, they could still catch up extremely quickly.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Xiao Wu had lost a lot of time before when they joined hands to kill four agility attack type Spirit Sages, and now that they were hindered by this Man Faced Demon Spider, the enemies behind them were already catching up.</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help inwardly thinking of the words \u2018men plans are unequal to the plans of Heaven\u2019.</p><br/><p>Clear Sky Hammer replaced Blue Silver Emperor and, with a loud explosion, smashed away the attack of that remaining agility attack type Spirit Master. Tang San managed with difficulty to balance his body after being blasted flying by the Man Faced Demon Spider, but his heart was already miserable.</p><br/><p>Whole body burning with raging flames, Yan had brought eight non-agility attack type Spirit Sages to firmly surround him and Xiao Wu. All their killing intent was targeting them.</p><br/><p>With difficulty managing to use the Clear Sky Hammer to force that surviving agility attack type Spirit Sage to retreat, Tang San was also injured again, once again spitting blood.</p><br/><p>If not for his extremely durable body, after constantly confronting attacks surpassing his strength in this way, perhaps he would long since have been unable to stand.</p><br/><p>Even though his recovery speed had become exceptional after opening up the eight extraordinary meridians, even greater speed still needed time. Starting from when he had launched his surprise attack on Xie Yue, where did he have even a bit of time to catch his breath?</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! Why aren\u2019t you running?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan glared venomously at Tang San\u2019s face. From the Blue Silver Emperor he wielded as well as the hidden weapons, he naturally recognized him. But it was because of this that he loathed Tang San even more.</p><br/><p>Five years had passed, and the youngster that gave him such humiliation back then had already turned into a youth, and the spirit power gap had moreover unexpectedly pulled close a lot.</p><br/><p>Even though there was still a gap between Yan\u2019s strength and the surrounding Spirit Hall experts, because of his status from the Golden Generation, right now he was instead the leader of these people.</p><br/><p>In the chase, Yan had seen scenes to shock the eye. One after another, four agility attack type Spirit Sages had died in Tang San and Xiao Wu\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>In fact, those were four Spirit Sages! And in order to chase Tang San\u2019s pair they had even used Spirit Avatar. But it was still difficult for them to escape death. Right now two of them had even turned to pus water, not leaving a corpse.</p><br/><p>Towards Tang San, Yan\u2019s heart held a fear so profound it was even jealousy. From childhood, cultivating in the most sublime palace of Spirit Masters, he had always been an outstanding member of the young generation, only Xie Yue and Hu Liena could compare to him. But, in a few short years, this youth in front of him had given him a feeling that it was difficult to even see his back.</p><br/><p>Further adding the feelings Hu Liena showed for Tang San before, right now Yan\u2019s regard for Tang San could only be described as hating him to the bone. Surrounding them with great difficulty, Yan secretly swore that, no matter what, he would destroy Tang San here today.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you want to deliver your funerary mats, why would I still want to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said indifferently. Right now, he had already thrown off the despair of being stopped by the Man Faced Demon Spider. Even if there was only a slim chance, he still wouldn\u2019t give it up.</p><br/><p>While speaking with Yan, he did his utmost to urge the Mysterious Heaven Skill within him to recover faster.</p><br/><p>The remaining nine Spirit Sages all secretly felt their hearts go cold as they heard Tang San\u2019s words, even though they were now only confronting a less than sixtieth rank opponent, they still didn\u2019t feel a bit relaxed.</p><br/><p>Of twenty Spirit Sages, only nine remained that could properly stand here. If someone had told them this one Spirit King could accomplish this before, they wouldn\u2019t have believed it. But the facts appeared before them, and Tang San\u2019s proud and straight backed figure caused an incorporeal pressure in their hearts.</p><br/><p>They understood clearly that Tang San no longer had any possibility to escape, but who wanted to go make that funerary mat? He had already killed so many, and pulling a couple with him into death wasn\u2019t anything worth surprise. Thus, what these Spirit Sages thought of first of all was their own defense, defensive abilities appearing around them one by one.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was only half a head shorter than Tang San, but now with her feet on the ground, she still leaned against Tang San\u2019s chest. She basically didn\u2019t look at those enemies surrounding them, completely nestling into Tang San\u2019s embrace, just like she wanted to completely merge into his body.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was so heavy it seemed you might wring water from it. Even though Tang San was calm on the surface, Mysterious Heaven Skill was circulating in a close to mad manner within his body. When he could live, nobody wanted to die, especially when he still held his beloved Xiao Wu. Even if the surrounding enemies were excessively powerful, Tang San would anyhow or any way go through this final fight, he wouldn\u2019t give up even a shred of possibility.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San\u2019s body showed the level of its endurance. Previously injured several times, especially suffering formidable shock, he still didn\u2019t suffer any substantial injuries. Passing the battering of the waterfall, the baptism of the two great immortal treasure herbs, and still the tempering of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well and the awakening of the Blue Silver Emperor, further adding the boost of the three great spirit bones, the current Tang San was an existence like a fortress, even without using spirit power protection.</p><br/><p>Left hand stretching out, the Clear Sky Hammer appeared out of nowhere in his grasp, the lower four Eight Spider Lances sticking into the ground, the blue silver grass surrounding Tang San began to grow with extremely astonishing speed under the effect of the Blue Silver Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan abruptly shouted.</p><br/><p>Just at the same time as Yan spoke up, the first to move was nevertheless Tang San. The frantically growing blue silver grass under his feet suddenly shot up like a spring, Eight Spider Lances simultaneously springing up. Under the effect of the two forces, Tang San pulled Xiao Wu close and shot into the air like an artillery shell.</p><br/><p>The two were completely targeted by the nine opponents, but in the split second they shot up, the Clear Sky Hammer in Tang San\u2019s hand abruptly swung towards the sky, rich white light soaring up like needles, ice cold, cruel, thick, bitter, the tremendous killing intent was so rich it was practically tangible, unexpectedly forcibly breaking the lock of the nine spirit hall experts, and the two were sent flying into the air like that.</p><br/><p>There was no door into the ground, all directions were sealed, the only route remaining was the sky. With Tang San\u2019s intelligence, even though time was scarce and the Man Faced Demon Spider had forced them into an impasse, it was still only a moment\u2019s work for him to find the most probable escape route.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

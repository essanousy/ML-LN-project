There\u2019s no special way of eating it, chewing and swallowing will suffice, the flavor is sweet and fragrant. Just like Dai Mubai, you also have to focus your spirit power to assimilate the medicinal effects, afterwards slowly absorb it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San had carefully thought about the most suitable plants for everyone even before he had returned.</p><br/><p>Even though there was a limited amount of immortal treasures, there was still enough for one for each of the Shrek Seven Devils. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to give the teachers immortal treasures as well, but the absorption rate for these immoral treasures was better the younger the user. The opposite would drain the medicinal effect.</p><br/><p>Oscar happily ran over to the other side of the room, swallowing the Eight Petal Immortal Orchid in one mouthful, and immediately starting cultivation.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun was next when going by age, and he impatiently moved closer,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, mine, mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the excited Fatty, Tang San said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t forgotten you. Fatty, I\u2019ve thought carefully about your Evil Fire. This variant Evil Fire is admittedly very powerful, but at the same time it\u2019s constantly eroding your body. This is essentially because your Phoenix flame isn\u2019t pure enough. This time I\u2019ve found you a nourishing and purifying yang medicinal herb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong let a giggle escape, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe still needs nourishing? In this time Fatty went out for bad things a lot. However, he said Heaven Dou City was very expensive, but still spent enormously. Nourishing him even more, perhaps he\u2019ll have to go out even more frequently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. As I said, his evil fire\u2019s impurity leads to his own backlash. If it continues like this, then perhaps one day it will lead to his evil fire destroying him. By filtering out the impurities of his Phoenix flame, he might truly be considered a Phoenix Spirit Master. Fatty, this is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a deep red trembling, silky soft immortal herb. Its appearance seemed very simple, only formed from red grass leaves. The tip of the grass leaves were shaped just like cockscombs, but when observing carefully one could discover its distinctiveness, the venation was unexpectedly gold. When it was taken out, the temperature in the room immediately rose sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is called Cockscomb Phoenix Sunflower, swallow it without chewing. Congregate spirit power and conduct, no matter how painful it is you must be patient, otherwise you will ruin the effect. This thing\u2019s effect is quite obvious, it should substantially increase your spirit power and flame. If you give up halfway, the medicinal effect will lower a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San placed the herb in Ma Hongjun\u2019s hands, and Fatty immediately left.</p><br/><p>Tang San had taken out three immortal herbs and given them to three people one after another, even Grandmaster couldn\u2019t help being moved. Let alone seeing these herbs, he had never even heard of them before.</p><br/><p>The fourth one Tang San brought out wasn\u2019t according to age Xiao Wu, but rather for Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, what are you giving me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Tang San to start speaking, Ning Rongrong already ran up and grabbed his arm. Xiao Wu frowned behind, but didn\u2019t say anything. Tang San smiling stretched his hand into the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, and in a flash of golden light, a fantastic immortal herb already appeared.</p><br/><p>This was a very fantastic immortal herb, below the stalk and leaves were all wisteria drapes, finely combed. But at the top was a golden dazzling tulip, and a heavy tulip fragrance immediately replaced Oscar\u2019s previous Eight Petal Immortal Orchid, the rich fragrance giving a splendorous and majestic feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda spirit is extremely special. I thought it over carefully, and selected this immortal herb for you. This thing is known as a Beautiful Silk Tulip, it\u2019s graceful and luxurious. By taking it you can breathe in the quintessence of heaven and earth. The radiance of the sun and the moon. Your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda is on its own classified as a treasure type spirit. With the help of this Beautiful Silk Tulip, the effect should be very complementing. This flower can\u2019t be devoured. You have to breathe in the stamen, slowly absorbing the best features within, afterwards cultivate your spirit power and slowly circulate it, letting the medicinal effects find its way to the hundred bones of all four limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong took the Beautiful Silk Tulip, and giggling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, I really want to kiss you, only in order to keep Xiao Wu from upending the vinegar jar[1], I\u2019ll let it be. But I really can\u2019t accept this flower from you free of charge, later little sister will definitely do something in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four of the Shrek Seven Devils had already obtained immortal herbs, finally remaining was only Xiao Wu and Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu stood there calm and composed without the slightest bit of anxiety. Tang San gave the others such good immortal herbs, how could he treat her unfairly?</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s natural disposition was reclusive, and extremely shy. Even though she was inwardly equally brimming with expectation, she found it embarrassing to be as forward as Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>Tang San walked over to Zhu Zhuqing,</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuqing, this immortal herb I\u2019ve chosen for you is the easiest to absorb and transform. Moreover the efficacy is even better than the others\u2019, considered an all-round boost. However, to eat this immortal herb you must pay a certain price. I hope you have the mental preparation.\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone else had said this, Zhi Zhuqing would certainly have believed they had ulterior motives, but when it came from Tang San she didn\u2019t have the slightest uncomfortable feeling. Everyone had been together for so long, even if Zhu Zhuqing very rarely spoke, how couldn\u2019t she know Tang San\u2019s character?</p><br/><p>Immediately nodding, she quietly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you third brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhu Zhuqing had called Tang San \u2018third brother\u2019, and Tang San couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly, once again pulling out a herb from the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse.</p><br/><p>It was a seemingly common white flower, palm sized, a bit like a tree peony, without leaves, the stalk connecting to a big rock. That stone was completely pitch black, and from how Tang San carried it could be seen that its weight was astonishing.</p><br/><p>On that white flower were a few flecks of red, scarlet red like blood giving people a hair-raising feeling.</p><br/><p>Tang San grimly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis herb is called Yearning Heartbroken Red. Among immortal treasure herbs it\u2019s a divine treasure. It also has a legend. A very long time ago, a youth, quiet and contented, most liked gardening and planting trees, filling his garden with green and blue lotuses and bulbs, thousands of purples and reds. Ordinarily singing to flowers, toasting to the moon, when a flower fell, he would be boundlessly grieved, sweeping up the flower, burying it in the ground, shedding tears again and again. It\u2019s said his feelings moved Heaven, and his great love for flowers moved the Heavenly Flower Immortal, who personally descended to the world to marry him, happiness like fish in water need not be mentioned. But unexpectedly the good times didn\u2019t last, god learned about their matters, and was furious, saying immortals and the mundane didn\u2019t match, ordering Flower Immortal to return to the divine realm. That youth having lost his lover, moaned and groaned in pain all day, depressed, discarding matters of flowers, consequently the walls fell and fences collapsed, flowers and trees withered, the land growing desolate. One day a white haired old man arrived, telling him that the white tree peony flower in his garden, was his wife\u2019s reincarnation, as long as he destroyed the flower, the Flower Immortal would lose her immortality, banishing her to the mundane world to be his wife again, but he couldn\u2019t by any means destroy a flower. The words turned into a pure wind and disappeared, and the youth suddenly came to himself, deeply regretting his mean treatment of the blossoms, he again carefully tended to the flowers and plants, even though he deeply loved his wife, he couldn\u2019t bear to burn down the tree peony, it was even more cherished than himself, day and night watering the flowers with his tears, the tears stemmed from deep sorrow, and yearning and heartbroken he died, in his final moments, he dripped some blood on the petals, and you see those dark red stains, that is the heart\u2019s blood of that youth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quietly listening to Tang San\u2019s story, whether it was Zhu Zhuqing or Xiao Wu to the side, both were somewhat sentimental. Even Grandmaster felt his heart sway, unable to help himself.</p><br/><p>Tang San solemnly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe flower is an exceptional treasure that chooses its master. When picking it you must keep your beloved in your heart, with absolute sincerity, spitting out blood on the petals. If you are at all half-hearted, even if you spit blood until you die, don\u2019t think about removing the flower. After picking the flower, as long as it is by your side it will never wither. The rock it grows from is called crow break, if it\u2019s forcefully broken, this Yearning Heartbroken Red will equally lose its medicinal strength. Using this herb has the immortal results of heaven and earth, by my conservative estimate, it can at least increase spirit power by ten ranks, and it will still substantially remould the body. Zhuqing, even if I\u2019m not entirely sure what\u2019s between you and Mubai, of us seven, you are the only ones who are certainly sweethearts, therefore I\u2019ve brought this to you, hoping you can become that destined person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing looked blankly at this touching bloody tree peony Yearning Heartbroken Red in front of her, softly nodding, her gaze floating over to Dai Mubai cultivating not far away,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Urging the spirit power within, prompting the movement of qi and blood, Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s cherry lips parted, spitting a drop of blood on the petals.</p><br/><p>The moment she spit out blood, in her mind was fixed the figure of Dai Mubai. But for some reason she recalled Dai Mubai\u2019s dissolute past, and her attention shifted slightly, unable to keep her state of mind from swaying.</p><br/><p>When the blood fell on the petals, the Yearning Heartbroken Red trembled slightly. Tang San, Xiao Wu, Zhu Zhuqing and Grandmaster\u2019s gazes were all fixed on this flower, quietly waiting.</p><br/><p>However, Tang San quickly lost hope. That Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s swaying gradually stopped, without falling off.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing sadly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, third brother, my heart is too greedy, I can\u2019t take this flower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed, helplessly shaking his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuqing, don\u2019t be like that. When I returned I prepared you another herb as backup. Wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San held up the Yearning Heartbroken Red to Grandmaster,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you and aunt Erlong\u2019s feelings are deep and heavy, it would be better for you to try. Perhaps, this Yearning Heartbroken Red might be able to change your spirit variation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a divine treasure, how could I eat it? By now I have long ago passed the age for cultivating. If it is destined for me, I will keep it at my side forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the bloodstains on the Yearning Heartbroken Red, Grandmaster couldn\u2019t help recalling all that had happened between him and Liu Erlong, a burst of pain in his heart, he didn\u2019t use his spirit power, but directly raised his hand to hit his chest. As Tang San cried out in alarm, blood forced its way out of his mouth, just right to spurt onto the flower.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>The moment he spit out the blood, Grandmaster\u2019s spirit was equally shocked, in his mind appeared the two most painful words of his life, \u2018little sister\u2019.</p><br/><p>This time the Yearning Heartbroken Red swayed even more fiercely, in a moment about to fall from the black breaking rock, but in the end lacking that last trace of strength, the swaying returned to its original position, whether it was the blood Grandmaster or Zhu Zhuqing had spit out, both gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said in a rough voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m always unable to put down the burden in my heart, I\u2019m not qualified to take this herb.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a dispirited expression he turned to look out the window, apparently again recalling those sad forgotten events.</p><br/><p>As Tang San prepared to put away the Yearning Heartbroken Red, taking out the backup he had prepared for Zhu Zhuqing, suddenly, a small pu sound echoed. When Tang San turned his head to look, he saw a drop of blood had already fallen on that Yearning Heartbroken Red, and before he could react, the Yearning Heartbroken red, this time without the slightest swaying, already quietly fell from the black breaking rock, falling into slender jade-white hands.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu wiped a bloodstain from the corner of her mouth, her charming face revealing a smiling expression, looking at that touching flower in her hand with blurred emotions in her eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would be this destined person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart shook, and Zhu Zhuqing to the side was equally shaken. None of them had expected that this Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s final owner would actually be Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>In that previous moment, Tang San\u2019s gaze had been fixed on Grandmaster and hadn\u2019t seen it, but Zhu Zhuqing clearly saw, when Xiao Wu spit out blood, her gaze didn\u2019t leave Tang San for a moment. That single-mindedly devoted expression was something Zhu Zhuqing would never forget.</p><br/><p>Until now she had always seen how good Tang San was to Xiao Wu, but now she truly understood what position Tang San held in Xiao Wu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing saw very clearly how pure Xiao Wu\u2019s gaze at Tang San had been, perhaps even they didn\u2019t know whether the feelings between them were that of man and woman, but their feelings were absolutely the purest sincerity, without any flaw.</p><br/><p>And that Yearning Heartbroken Red became the best proof.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked stupidly at Xiao Wu, for a long while speechless. Xiao Wu lowered her head, her fingertips caressing the flower petals,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, that story was definitely true, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Eat it, it will give you the best help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu shook her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Grandmaster was right, an immortal herb like this, how can people part with it by eating it? Didn\u2019t you say that, as long as it recognized its owner, it will never wither? I want to keep it with me. Loving it and cherishing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat hesitantly thought to say something, but was interrupted by Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ge, I won\u2019t fall behind everyone. I will make great effort to cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu naturally understood what Tang San was worried about.</p><br/><p>Even though she didn\u2019t advance to the next step in strength because she didn\u2019t eat this Yearning Heartbroken Red, at this moment her heart was already content. Just like Zhu Zhuqing thought, she hadn\u2019t known what her feelings towards Tang San actually were, but at this moment, this Yearning Heartbroken Red had already told her.</p><br/><p>To her, there was nothing more important than this.</p><br/><p>Tang San would never force Xiao Wu to do anything. Raising his hand to gently caress her head, he said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen protect it properly, and it will also always protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stretching his hand into the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, Tang San pulled out the sixth immortal herb.</p><br/><p>That was a white flower with a gem-like luster, appearing spotless as a blue lotus white root. Tang San handed over it to Zhu Zhuqing, saying with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is called Daffodil Jade Flesh Bone. Its function is to soften muscle and mend bone, the clearing the eight extraordinary meridians. Originally I was going to give it to Xiao Wu, but she already has the Yearning Heartbroken Red, and this immortal herb suits you just as well, take it at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because she couldn\u2019t obtain the Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s approval, but Zhu Zhuqing was somewhat depressed, sadly shaking her head:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you were going to give it to Xiao Wu, you should still give it to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, a person of integrity can\u2019t be too greedy, each of these immortal treasure herbs are precious treasures that Heaven yearns for, taking several is no good, it will instead be harmful. Even if Xiao Wu doesn\u2019t eat the Yearning Heartbroken Red, the Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s energy still exists. If she takes yet another immortal treasure herb, she will be unable to completely absorb it, so this Daffodil Jade Flesh Bone should go to you. Its effect will lead to the same result by different means as Mubai\u2019s Singular Velvet Sky Chrysanthemum. Your spirit is similar to Mubai\u2019s, and using it won\u2019t be a problem. When eating it only eat the petals, then finally suck on the stamen, that will absorb its efficacy. At the same time you have to urge your spirit power. Zhuqing, remember, you have to stay calm to absorb its best properties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, third brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing tightly gripped the Daffodil Jade Flesh Bone and walked over to sit by herself in a corner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was still playing with the Yearning Heartbroken Red in her hands, and Tang San couldn\u2019t help ask once again:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, are you really not prepared to take it? With it your strength would increase greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu lightly shook her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, I won\u2019t eat it, unless one day\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t continue, but her gaze floated to Tang San\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>From within Xiao Wu\u2019s big eyes, Tang San saw a somewhat different spirit. He didn\u2019t know why, but Tang San didn\u2019t dare look directly at this light.</p><br/><p>Tang San felt about in the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, and after hesitating a moment pulled out a mildly purple medicinal herb. The top of the herb was like a cap, precisely a lingzhi mushroom[2]. The lingzhi mushrooms cap was purple, with a jade green stalk below, growing nine leaves.</p><br/><p>Tang San walked over in front of Grandmaster,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, Even though this Nine Treasure Purple Zoysia doesn\u2019t count as an immortal treasure, it still strengthens foundations, its effect promoting energy. It will have a considerable beneficial effect to your body. Please take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Grandmaster to decline, Tang San pulled off the lingzhi cap from the stem, presenting it to Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Seeing the earnest light in Tang San\u2019s eyes, Grandmaster secretly sighed, but still accepted it and put it in his mouth, chewing it a few times and swallowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lingzhi\u2019s nature is mild, but this Nine Treasure Purple Zoysia is a top quality lingzhi. Teacher, since Xiao Wu doesn\u2019t want to eat the Yearning Heartbroken Red, let her keep watch over us and cultivate a moment to dissolve its medicinal effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded, reining in his mind, as much as possible keeping himself from thinking about Liu Erlong. Sitting down in the light from the window, he started to quietly cultivate.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, don\u2019t you have anything for yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu asked.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he pulled out a seemingly unremarkable herb from the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse. Its body was jade green, but bizarrely at the center of the plant were three snow white leaves, and at the center of the leaves were a few water droplets, as if dew left behind in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis herb is called Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew, eating it will train piercing eyes, passing through ten thousand strange things. Even though the description is a bit exaggerated, it will be of considerable benefit to my Purple Demon Eye cultivation. That can also be considered an immortal treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu frowned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, why did you give everyone herbs to promote their strength, but only this for yourself? Even if I don\u2019t understand these immortal treasures, shouldn\u2019t yours be the best?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled faintly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew isn\u2019t considered the best immortal treasure, it\u2019s effect is still better than you imagine. Besides, I\u2019ve already taken two kinds of immortal treasure herbs before, I can\u2019t be greedy. Just those two herbs are enough to benefit me all my life. I even hesitated over this Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew again and again before deciding to take it. Its medicinal effect is very mild, and doesn\u2019t conflict with the two immortal treasures I used before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San still hadn\u2019t completely absorbed the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot he used half a year ago, his originally gentle Mysterious Heaven Skill had already changed significantly.</p><br/><p>Since it was these two kinds of extreme herbs he used simultaneously, these two kinds of herbs within his body neutralized anything absorbed later.</p><br/><p>There wouldn\u2019t be any destructive effects to Tang San\u2019s body, but the two herbs efficacy could arbitrarily change under Tang San\u2019s control, in other words, within his spirit power the extreme cold and extreme hot energies had already mixed.</p><br/><p>These two energies didn\u2019t belong to the Blue Silver Grass spirit, but rather to Tang San\u2019s internal strength. Only when his spirit power was infused into Blue Silver Grass would there be any effect to the spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen hurry up and eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu urged.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, raising the Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew in front of him, tilting it slightly, letting the transparent drops of liquid drop into his mouth. The moment those drops of liquid left the leaves of the plant, the whole Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew completely withered in Tang San\u2019s hand, in the blink of an eye becoming dust wafting through the air.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t say anything else, without leave walking over to sit next to Grandmaster, adopting a lotus posture[3] and quietly starting to cultivate.</p><br/><p>Right now only Xiao Wu was still awake in the small log cottage. Standing there, her gaze never left Tang San, her eyes revealing a struggling light. In her heart reverberated a voice only she could hear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mustn\u2019t I leave him after all? If I leave, could we still meet again? But, if I didn\u2019t leave, perhaps sooner or later that Title Douluo that returned with him would be harmful to me. Little San, thank you for this Yearning Heartbroken Red. It let me understand so much. No, I can\u2019t leave, just now I swore never to leave him. Only when I\u2019m together with him will I feel the happiness mama talked about.\u2019</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>There was an unhesitating light in Xiao Wu\u2019s eyes. Nobody knew just how fearless she was to make this decision, or just how determined.</p><br/><p>The minutes and seconds slowly passed. In a flash it had already been six hours, and the effect of the immortal treasure herbs showed. Besides Xiao Wu, the other Shrek Seven Devils and Grandmaster all now showed different degrees of change.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai who had taken the Singlular Velvet Sky Chrysanthemum had by now grown a layer of white fur all over, just like when he summoned his White Tiger for Spirit Body Enhancement. Originally sitting crosslegged, now he lay sprawled like a  character on the ground, the four limbs clearly having swollen to twice their original size, the sounds of cracking bones constantly rising from his body.</p><br/><p>His three spirit rings were flashing with breathtaking speed, from his throat occasionally rose a thunder-like low roar. His whole body quivered with a kind of particular rhythm.</p><br/><p>Oscar was the most tranquil of everyone, only sitting there quietly. But his body was emitting a fragrance like the Eight Petal Immortal Orchid, and a faint white mist seeped from his skin, undulating densely around him.</p><br/><p>He was the most handsome among the Shrek Seven Devils, and being set off by this white mist even more increased his earthy nobility.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun\u2019s appearance was the most fiery. By now the clothes on Fatty\u2019s torso had completely turned to ashes, exposing bright red fat. The Cockscomb Phoenix Sunflower\u2019s medicinal effect was extremely potent, and his skin constantly exuded thin layers of juices. Fatty\u2019s body looked like cooked shrimp, and even his hair had become fiery red.</p><br/><p>Bizarrely, whenever a layer of black juice seeped out of his body, his fat would contract a bit. Xiao Wu standing to the side couldn\u2019t help but think that what Tang San gave fatty to eat was some weight loss drug.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s change was the most magnificent, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda floated in front of her in a halo of seven colored light, three rings of light flickering within, set off by a layer of intense golden light.</p><br/><p>This golden light was released from Ning Rongrong herself, bringing a strong tulip fragrance, a gem like light moving within, just like a fairy descended to the mortal world. Each time the golden light strengthened, it seemed Ning Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda became even more beautiful and dazzling.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s golden light and Oscar\u2019s white mist seemed to give off a mutually attracting feeling. The white mist and golden light flowed together in the air, the two fragrances mixing together, creating a kind of incomparably cozy scent.</p><br/><p>Even Tang San didn\u2019t know that the Beautiful Silk Tulip Ning Rongrong ate and the Eight Petal Immortal Orchid Oscar ate were a pair of mandarin duck[4] herbs, with a complementing effect just like the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot he ate.</p><br/><p>Similar circumstances arose for Zhu Zhuqing and Dai Mubai, but it wasn\u2019t because of any relationship between their herbs, but rather because of their spirit fusion ability.</p><br/><p>After Zhu Zhuqing ate the Daffodil Jade Flesh Bone, a layer of faint jade light spread all over her body. Different from Dai Mubai who lay spread eagled on the ground, she moved from crosslegged to standing upright as the medicinal effect released, standing there with both hands crossed over her ample chest, quietly absorbing the medicine.</p><br/><p>As the White Tiger radiance appeared from Dai Mubai, it was echoed by Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s Black Civet, their breathing completely in sync, each inhalation and exhalation fitting each other.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sat there very serenely, his whole body suffused with a faint purple light. Even though his appearance wasn\u2019t as fiery as Ma Hongjun, just like Ma Hongjun his body was constantly exuding a layer of black fluid.</p><br/><p>The Cockscomb Phoenix Sunflower and the Nine Treasure Purple Zoysia both had the effect of rebirth. This was something Tang San had neglected to mention.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San\u2019s own reaction wasn\u2019t very large, only his head was enveloped in a layer of pure golden light, the golden light constantly condensing towards his eyes like threads of silk or strands of hair.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu stood there holding the Yearning Heartbroken Red, quietly sniffing its rich fragrance. Her gaze only rarely swept across the others, and was otherwise fixed on Tang San.</p><br/><p>The sun ascending in the east gradually began to descend in the west. The first to awaken from cultivation was the one who had taken the gentlest herb Eight Petal Immortal Orchid, Oscar.</p><br/><p>Stretching his arms wide, Oscar opened his eyes as if he had just woken up from sleep,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo comfortable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu glared at him, saying in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone else are still cultivating, lower your voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar blinked, only then discovering the others sitting around him, hastily covering his mouth he stood up.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu looked him up and down a few times. She found that the earthen noble air that had appeared on his body when he absorbed the Eight Petal Immortal Orchid hadn\u2019t faded when cultivation ended, and his whole body looked like it was covered in a layer of glossy luster.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs anything different?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu quietly asked.</p><br/><p>Oscar looked distracted a moment, remembering to sense the changes to his body.</p><br/><p>Very quickly his expression became odd, a double mood of pleasant surprise and disbelief. The smile on his face gradually grew, and if it hadn\u2019t been for the others right now cultivating around them, perhaps he might have laughed out loud right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t cover your mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu slapped Oscar\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>A burning excitement appeared in Oscar\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, it\u2019s really too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu glared at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak quickly, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, holding out a hand, shaking it in front of Xiao Wu,</p><br/><p>\u201cFive ranks, my spirit power increased a full five ranks, this is just too unbelievable. I\u2019ve already reached the thirty eighth rank. Heavens, I\u2019ll overtake Dai Mubai soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had guessed that the immortal treasure herb Tang San gave him would have a very good effect, hearing it from his own mouth was still different. One Eight Petal Immortal Orchid had actually helped Oscar\u2019s spirit power leap up five ranks.</p><br/><p>In other words, right now they were on more or less the same average spirit power as those Emperor Team Spirit Masters who were five years older.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you squawking for, isn\u2019t it just five ranks? Then I\u2019m still better off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s voice rose from the side. The golden light over her body was already completely gone, her right hand supported her Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, and underneath the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was a tulip petal like golden outline.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong and Xiao Wu smiling looked face to face,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve improved six ranks, thirty seventh rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar couldn\u2019t help say:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be a dream. If cultivation were to become this easy hereafter, then what would there still be to work hard for? Every day we\u2019d just eat flowers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu curled her lips,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go dreaming. Little San said that you can\u2019t eat several of these immortal treasure herbs, eating more will instead be harmful. Are you still dissatisfied with gaining five ranks? Grandmaster said that the younger the easier it is to cultivate. You\u2019re still just fifteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong excitedly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that I would advance so much so shortly after just breaking through the thirtieth rank juncture. Maybe before long we\u2019ll also be able to reach the fortieth rank. Moreover, I feel that my Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda seems to have changed a bit, even if I can\u2019t say just how it has changed, I still feel somewhat abnormal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar lowered his head to look at the pagoda in Ning Rongrong\u2019s hand, then suddenly called out,</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong covered his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cBe a bit quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar pulled away Ning Rongrong\u2019s hand from his face, deliberately lowering his excited voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, Rongrong count quickly, how many layers does your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked distracted, then paid attention to her pagoda,</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Nine? Why, how did it become nine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong only felt a heat rush from her heart. Right now, even her voice trembled. What did the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda becoming nine layers mean?</p><br/><p>It meant she no longer had a Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, but rather the legendary Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, the lifelong goal of her father, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi. And now she had actually reached it herself.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong couldn\u2019t keep her gaze from turning to Tang San. If it hadn\u2019t been for Xiao Wu, right now she would have had the impulse to devote her life to him.</p><br/><p>Only the directly related members of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School understood the meaning of the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. All of this really was far, far too significant to the entire Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.</p><br/><p>After a brief excitement, Ning Rongrong gradually calmed down, but the hand supporting the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda still trembled. She knew that Tang San\u2019s kindness no longer affected just her, but the entire Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. It seemed she would have to make a trip back home.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you absorbed them well?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the moment Tang San\u2019s voice rose, standing up from the floor with both eyes closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong suddenly pounced at him, giving Tang San a big hug, both hands around his neck, kissing his face hard.</p><br/><p>Her actions made Tang San dumbfounded, and even Oscar and Xiao Wu were stunned, both their faces becoming somewhat strange. Fortunately, what Ning Rongrong said next made them relieved.</p><br/><p>[1] \u201cVinegar jar\u201d is an idiomatic expression for a jealous person.</p><br/><p>[2] Mentioned this one in an earlier footnote.

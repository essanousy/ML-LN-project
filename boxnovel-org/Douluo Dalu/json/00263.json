Forest King, Tang San\u2019s Nine Rings</p><br/><p>(TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>That dignified voice in Tang San\u2019s mind was already faint by the end, but Tang San still felt deeply respectful. He didn\u2019t need to ask to understand that, whether that golden figure or this voice, both came from the true Seagod. Perhaps it could be called the Seagod\u2019s brand on this world. He\u2019d also finally for the first time peeked at the door to divine skills.</p><br/><p>At the same time as Tang San regained control over his body, the four seriously injured Title Douluo were just crawling up from the ground, their faces overwhelmed with shock. And in the air, the purple fragments Bibi Dong had transformed into were swiftly circling and gathering, actually stitched together by lines of purple light. At the same time these fragments were also surrounded by a ring a bizarre purple light.</p><br/><p>Tang San fully believed the Seagod, and since the Seagod said he couldn\u2019t kill Bibi Dong before becoming a god, then he certainly didn\u2019t stand a chance. Without any hesitation, with his mental strength almost completely exhausted, he managed to raise a wisp of energy to urge the Vast Sea Barrier\u2019s stealth, quietly vanishing in the depths of the forest. And those four rising Title Douluo didn\u2019t dare pursue. They were already truly terrified by the Golden Thirteen Halberds true divine ability.</p><br/><p>It was also no wonder they were this way. Seriously injuring five Title Douluo with one strike, including the Spirit Empire\u2019s Empress, the peak level Bibi Dong. How could they not fear such strength? The Seagod Trident in Tang San\u2019s hand was too shocking.</p><br/><p>The purple magic lines grew more and more intense, and the shattered Death Spider Emperor form slowly came together, once again returning to its condition before breaking. Only, the purple magic lines on her body had faint traces of gold. Having just restored her form, Bibi Dong immediately withdrew her spirit avatar, transforming into her real body, and even withdrawing her spirit.</p><br/><p>With a retching sound, she vomited a mouthful of gold flecked blood, her body trembling violently, her eyes filled with unwillingness,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person, is my greatest obstacle to unifying the Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, she directly sat down on the ground, assuming a bizarre posture with both hands as she entered cultivation.</p><br/><p>Previously Bibi Dong had used the Death Spider Emperor\u2019s ninth spirit ability, called Undying Body. Ordinary spirit masters definitely wouldn\u2019t absorb a support ability for their strongest ninth spirit ability, but Bibi Dong possessed twin spirits, she naturally wouldn\u2019t be afraid. Her ninth spirit ability came from the same spirit beast as her spirit, a hundred thousand year Death Spider Emperor. Back when she killed this spirit beast, she spent a full year to complete her purpose, obtaining this spirit ring and the Death Spider Emperor\u2019s spirit bone. Of the two abilities this hundred thousand year spirit ring gave her, one was the life saving support ability she just used, Undying Body. Even if her body was smashed and scattered by the enemy\u2019s attack, it could still reform. One step further than Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone.</p><br/><p>When Bibi Dong clearly sensed the threat the golden trident constituted to her life, she quickly switched over to her Death Spider Emperor spirit, and then used this life saving ninth spirit ability. No matter how powerful the enemy\u2019s attack was, it still wasn\u2019t enough to kill her. But, the Seagod\u2019s golden divine power wasn\u2019t that easily resolved. Even though she relied on Undying Body to block the majority, she was still invaded by a portion and forced to neutralize it on her own.</p><br/><p>In such circumstances, let alone mentally searching for Tang San and the others, even defending herself was a problem. The four Spirit Empire elders quickly guarded around her. Of course, deep in their hearts, even Chrysanthemum Douluo who wished he could cut Tang San\u2019s corpse into ten thousand pieces didn\u2019t dare pursue. Everyone only had one life, and having strenuously cultivated to the Title Douluo level, where would they be willing to take risks? At the same time, the strength Tang San displayed gave them a powerless feeling. What kind of enemy was it who possessed such a degree of power, even seriously injuring the lord Supreme Pontiff.</p><br/><p>But in fact, the ability Tang San had of course wasn\u2019t enough to accomplish this. Just like he didn\u2019t understand Bibi Dong\u2019s abilities, Bibi Dong and these Title Douluo were the same towards his abilities, and especially ignorant of the Seagod Trident. In such circumstances they were caught unprepared, plus that the true Seagod brand showed its strength, thus beating them back in one go. If the true Seagod was here, that second Millennial Space was enough to take their lives, even directly injuring Bibi Dong. After all, rank ninety nine peak Douluo might just be one step short of gods, but their strength were as different as heaven and earth. Moreover, the present Bibi Dong also wasn\u2019t the complete Bibi Dong. A portion of her strength was used elsewhere, and couldn\u2019t be transferred. The use over there was even more important than the two Forest Kings\u2019 spirit rings.</p><br/><p>When Tang San escaped, he was already overdrawn. The Seagod Trident\u2019s consumption of mental strength and spirit power really was too large, even if the last attack had relied on the Seagod brand\u2019s own energy, Tang San had already used it three times before. Although he wasn\u2019t a dried out lamp, he was still out of strength. Maintaining the Vast Sea Barrier was difficult.</p><br/><p>Drawn by his soul, very soon Tang San sensed Xiao Wu\u2019s anxious soul waves, and quickly approached. His estimation of Bibi Dong\u2019s and the Title Douluos\u2019 circumstances was the same as the facts. Within at least an hour, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t dare leave Bibi Dong to pursue. This gave him plenty of time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu and the others hadn\u2019t run very far, five li from the site of the previous battle. As Tang San arrived, Xiao Wu was crying bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming, Er Ming, you have to hold on, you can\u2019t die! Ge is coming. He\u2019s a poison expert, he can definitely save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While crying, Xiao Wu constantly poured her soul force into the two great divine beasts.</p><br/><p>But, whether Da Ming or Er Ming, the light in their eyes was still growing duller and duller, they were already unable to move again.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, stop wasting your strength. We can\u2019t hold out. That person\u2019s spirit has the strongest poison of this era. The Death Spider Emperor\u2019s poison is basically unsolvable. Besides, the poison hasn\u2019t just entered our organs, it\u2019s also corroded our souls. Don\u2019t cry, we\u2019re already happy that you and Tang San could save us from being killed by the enemies. We\u2019ve both lived for a hundred thousand years, dying now isn\u2019t too early. Not dying by the hands of the enemy, not becoming her spirit rings, we\u2019re satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming\u2019s eyes were now almost closed, even the strength to lift his eyelids was almost gone.</p><br/><p>While they were talking, Tang San had arrived and removed the Vast Sea Barrier.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San, Xiao Wu was like she had caught a life saving straw, hurriedly pulling him:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, hurry up and save them. Da Ming and Er Ming will die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was shocked, not caring about his own weakness, he hurriedly came closer and pulled out two antidotes he\u2019d refined himself back when and gave them to the two spirit beasts. At the same time he used his remaining spirit power to hasten it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, don\u2019t waste your strength. Even if a god came, he still couldn\u2019t save us. Our bodies are built differently from you humans. You came just in time. Before we die, there\u2019s still time to thank you. Thank you for not letting us die in that person\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hurriedly comforted:</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming, you\u2019ll be alright. I will definitely think of a way to bring you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Da Ming\u2019s eyes opened sharply. His eyes unexpectedly again possessed an intense luster, as if he\u2019d instantly recovered his vitality.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with his mind recovering, Da Ming\u2019s voice grew forceful. Seeing this, Tang San\u2019s expression was tragic. He could see how deep the poison was, and Da Ming was now truly a lamp running on its last fuel, the sudden recovery was the last flash!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming looked at Tang San, then at Xiao Wu. Next to him the equally at his last gasp Er Ming also opened his eyes, but his originally yellow eyes had now become murky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, we know the state of our bodies. This body has already been completely corroded, unless you can now take out the same kind of medicinal herb as saved Xiao Wu last time, there is no chance for us. I don\u2019t have much time, let me finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>The herb Da Ming meant was of course the Yearning Heartbroken Red. Where would Tang San find that? Even if he could, it was already too late. The restrictions to consuming it was also so severe.</p><br/><p>Tang San sadly watched Da Ming and nodded. Xiao Wu fiercely threw herself forward, hugging Da Ming\u2019s thick neck and weeping bitterly.</p><br/><p>A lazy light flickered in Da Ming\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San. To be honest, at the start, I didn\u2019t like you. In the past, Xiao Wu was always together with us, us three were together for close to a hundred thousand years. No matter what she did, me and Er Ming always supported her, even when she finally decided to become human. When you appeared, we discovered that Xiao Wu\u2019s heart was already set on you, do you understand that feeling? Just like your sister following someone else. But, after the events last time, we both understood that you truly love Xiao Wu. In order to save Xiao Wu, you would rather give up your own life, Xiao Wu didn\u2019t choose wrong. You are the best home for her. This time, we are truly happy that you returned together. Seeing that Xiao Wu can already attach her soul to her body, I understand, these years, you\u2019ve always untiringly worked for her resurrection. Xiao Wu truly has insight, finding you, I am happy for her. I will leave, but, I still have a final wish. I hope you can help me achieve it, can you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded firmly, getting straight to the point:</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. No matter what it is, I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter anything else, he would complete Da Ming\u2019s final wish just for his and Er Ming\u2019s affection.</p><br/><p>Da Ming nodded to Tang San, gratified:</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Tang San. Today might be the day I\u2019m the most thankful. Xiao Wu, don\u2019t feel sad. You are like us, we\u2019ve all lived a hundred thousand years. You have Tang San, evolving as a human, you have a new hope. But we\u2019ve lived in this big forest for a hundred thousand years, we no longer have anything keeping us in this world. In some sense, Dying can be considered the end, but also a new beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, me and Er Ming have seen through life and death, dying isn\u2019t frightening to us. We are already satisfied with not dying in humiliation by the hands of the enemy. My only remaining wish, is Xiao Wu. My final desire, my wish in the final moments of my life, is to see Xiao Wu being resurrected with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked distracted, he hadn\u2019t thought Da Ming would actually raise such a request. Sadly he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Da Ming, it\u2019s still impossible. I still don\u2019t have the strength of a Title Douluo. I may have to disappoint you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming\u2019s gaze suddenly became severe, his burning eyes fixed on Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf course I can sense it, your current spirit power is rank eighty five, right? Isn\u2019t that just five ranks short? I and Er Ming will give you these ranks. But. After having these five ranks, you must resurrect Xiao Wu. Can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was shocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu sharply raised her head, tightly holding on to Da Ming\u2019s neck,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Da Ming, Er Ming, you can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The always silent Er Ming suddenly opened his mouth. At this moment, his eyes were also bright, just like Da Ming he had entered the final flash of radiance before death, and equally stared at Tang San with burning eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, if you don\u2019t want our deaths to be without any value, don\u2019t stop us. Me and Da Ming thought it through just now. Since we will die, why not give our deaths meaning. If we can help you resurrect, our deaths will also be worth it. Bsides, after we become Tang San\u2019s spirit rings, we can still watch over you. Tang San, do you agree? We three are men. For Xiao Wu, wouldn\u2019t you want to pay together with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming both knew how large the harm to Tang San would be in order to resurrect Xiao Wu. They knew they were dying, and hoped to force Tang San to resurrect Xiao Wu together with them in their last moments.</p><br/><p>They had seen Tang San\u2019s strength. Resurrecting Xiao Wu meant giving up on the last ten ranks of spirit power, forever unable to become a true power. This part would be even worse than death to a talented Spirit Master. That\u2019s why they worried that Tang San would finally let Xiao Wu stay in her current condition, and not help her truly resurrect.</p><br/><p>Sensing the two great divine beasts\u2019 gazes, Tang San\u2019s eyes grew equally bright, cold light flickering,</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming, Er Ming. What are you worried about? Even if you\u2019ve been together with Xiao Wu for a hundred thousand years, while me and her have only been together for ten odd years, my feelings for Xiao Wu absolutely aren\u2019t shallower than yours. I originally brought Xiao Wu back to the Star Dou Great Forest this time in order to resurrect her. More words are useless, watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San suddenly patted Xiao Wu next to him with one palm. Xiao Wu was now completely lifeless, she could never imagine Tang San would attack her. Before she could react, Tang San\u2019s palm hit her forehead, and she fell limply to the ground with a groan. Red light overflowed from her body, struggling and unwilling to return to Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming shouted simultaneously. But they couldn\u2019t move a bit now, and could only watch Tang San act.</p><br/><p>Due to his lacking mental strength, Tang San\u2019s Seagod\u2019s Light was very faint, but as that golden light appeared, it immediately bound Xiao Wu\u2019s soul, pulling her into his body.</p><br/><p>His gaze sweeping Da Ming and Er Ming, the corner of Tang San\u2019s mouth twitched. Suddenly, his left hand flipped the Seagod Trident, the main blade stabbing straight at his right arm. The Seagod Trident was a true divine tool, and even his incomparably durable physical body couldn\u2019t block it. Blood splashed, and he immediately severed his right arm.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s complexion instantly paled, but he still didn\u2019t even grunt, his gaze still ice cold. With a flip of his foot, the right arm flew into the air, and at the same time his left arm poked continuously, sealing the blood vessels of his right shoulder.</p><br/><p>Watching this, Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s originally severe gazes completely changed. Tang San didn\u2019t explain anything to them, using actions to prove his determination. First pulling Xiao Wu\u2019s soul back into his body, and then immediately severing his right arm.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s right arm was where Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit bone was, and as a not yet rank ninety spirit master, only death would separate the spirit bone. Put a different way, when the spirit bone left his body, he would die. Tang San even used the Seagod Trident out of fear he couldn\u2019t sever his arm, that was the strength of his determination.</p><br/><p>Tang San stabbed the Seagod Trident in the ground next to him, his left arm catching his falling right arm. With a sudden tremble, he broke down the surrounding flesh, extracting Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit bone within. Before the gazes of the two great divine beasts, he coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time either, this is a man\u2019s determination.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming looked at each other. Right now, not only were they nearing death, Tang San was as well. As long as his spirit power couldn\u2019t reach rank ninety, and break his connection with the spirit bone, he would die.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming spoke simultaneously, their severe expressions already softened. Even though they were a lot bigger than Tang San, at this moment, in their hearts Tang San was now standing far higher than them. Especially that madness of sparing nothing for Xiao Wu, made the two even more feel ashamed. They asked themselves, if it wasn\u2019t because their lives were ending, they absolutely couldn\u2019t do the same as Tang San. Yes, he was a true man.</p><br/><p>Two heaven-drowning roars resounded. Two balls of blazing red light ignited in the Star Dou Great Forest. The glaring red light was released simultaneously from between the eyebrows of the two great divine beasts, and everything in the range of that red light turned completely static.</p><br/><p>Sacrifice, yes, it was Sacrifice. This was the method Da Ming meant when he said he and Er Ming would make Tang San directly enter rank ninety. The growth from the sacrifice of two overlords of the Star Dou Great Forest, two hundred thousand year spirit beasts. Enough to directly let Tang San\u2019s spirit power jump five ranks, rising to rank ninety.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, we will leave Xiao Wu to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s voices echoed simultaneously in Tang San\u2019s heart. Tang San\u2019s cold gaze grew burning hot, and in the instant that red light spread, two hot tears hung fixed on his face. He of course knew what the two great divine beasts had decided, both he and Xiao Wu knew. But like the two spirit beasts said, they didn\u2019t want their deaths to be without value. Helping Xiao Wu resurrect was their last wish.</p><br/><p>Red flames began to burn Da Ming and Er Ming. That wasn\u2019t fire, but rather an extremely special blood flame. And within it burned their blood, life, as well as a hundred thousand years of cultivation.</p><br/><p>This was the second time Tang San had received a hundred thousand year spirit beast\u2019s sacrifice, and even though a long time had passed, when he received Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s sacrifice, he still couldn\u2019t help recalling everything that happened with Xiao Wu back then.</p><br/><p>Tang San could no longer budge within the red light, but he used his soul to tell them:</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming, Er Ming, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely resurrect Xiao Wu, and guard her with my life. At the same time, I will definitely help you take revenge, to kill Bibi Dong, to destroy the Spirit Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s bodies were already gradually fading. Hearing what Tang San said, the two forest kings\u2019 eyes revealed satisfaction. They of course understood, this was a man\u2019s oath. Tang San definitely wouldn\u2019t spare any effort to complete it.</p><br/><p>The blood flame grew more and more flourishing. Gradually it turned from red to deep red, and Da Ming and Er Ming also gradually faded in this process, like red crystals growing more and more transparent.</p><br/><p>Da Ming\u2019s body faded first, all the red expanding into a giant ring that slowly contracted, revolving around and slowly merging into Tang San\u2019s body. Immersed in the blood flame from the two great divine beasts, Tang San\u2019s whole body constantly itched, the near death feeling completely obliterated. The spirit power within him, in chaos from the severed arm and previously exhausted from the fight with Bibi Dong, now grew geometrically, charging at one bottleneck after another at a mad pace.</p><br/><p>But Tang San wasn\u2019t the slightest excited over his rising spirit power, his heart was instead filled with grief. His rising strength came from Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s sacrifice. If he had a choice, he would wish his strength never rose in this way.</p><br/><p>Da Ming, Er Ming, leave at peace, I will definitely avenge you. Spirit Empire, the hatred between us has another cause.</p><br/><p>Finally, Da Ming\u2019s light completely faded, and a red arm bone flew uncontrollably towards Tang San\u2019s severed shoulder, forcefully stabbing into the wound.</p><br/><p>Da Ming\u2019s last voice echoed in Tang San\u2019s heart,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the best human I have seen. Actually, both me and Er Ming like Xiao Wu, only since we are brothers we never wanted to hurt each other, to your benefit. Tang San, I\u2019ll repay you with my spirit bone and spirit ring, perhaps, you won\u2019t have to lose ranks. Therefore, I won\u2019t owe you. Don\u2019t forget your promise, protect Xiao Wu for us. The moment you severed your arm, I took you as a brother\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDa Ming\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s tears finally fell. Da Ming\u2019s voice faded and disappeared, and his enormous body turned into a small cyan snake that fell to the ground. The cyan light gradually faded, turning a dull gray.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor showed itself, and at the same time appeared yellow, yellow, purple, black, red, red, red, red, eight spirit rings. Along with Da Ming\u2019s energy turning into a giant blood red ring slowly revolving in the sky, it converged around Tang San, finally occupying the last position.</p><br/><p>Yes, under Da Ming and Er Ming\u2019s combined sacrifice, Tang San\u2019s spirit power had finally attacked the rank ninety bottleneck, promoting to the Title Douluo level. The spirit ring from Da Ming\u2019s sacrifice also became his ninth spirit ring. Emperor of the forest, hundred thousand year Sky Blue Bull Python ninth spirit ring.</p><br/><p>At the same time, along with that blood red right arm bone stabbing into Tang San\u2019s shoulder, Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone violently undulated with energy, one blue ray of light after another surging, crystal blue light constantly revolving around the wound. Flesh and arteries began to wiggle around that red arm bone, growing at a pace visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Title Douluo level spirit power made the Blue Silver Emperor right arm bone\u2019s Wildfire Burns Without End, Spring Wind Breathes Life Again ability to completely erupt. A hundred thousand year spirit bone\u2019s ability required Title Douluo level spirit power to completely erupt.</p><br/><p>Da Ming could be called the number one power of the Star Dou Great Forest. Even though he and Xiao Wu equally had lived a hundred thousand years, but as imagined, his spirit ring and spirit bone quality were absolutely above Xiao Wu\u2019s. This was also why he said he wouldn\u2019t owe Tang San. Even if Tang San lost a spirit bone and a full spirit ring, his and Er Ming\u2019s two spirit bone and two hundred thousand year spirit rings could absolutely make up the difference. After all, lost spirit rings could be hunted again, but finding two hundred thousand year spirit rings and bones wasn\u2019t so easy. When he saw Tang San\u2019s four hundred thousand years spirit rings, Da Ming already understood that Tang San absolutely wouldn\u2019t need to give Xiao Wu all his spirit power to resurrect her.</p><br/><p>Er Ming\u2019s red flame was still burning, only already a lot dimmer than before. The spirit power the sacrifice could reward was already completely infused into Tang San. If it wasn\u2019t for him and Da Ming being so powerful, it absolutely wouldn\u2019t have been possible to help Tang San rise five ranks of spirit power and break through the most difficult rank ninety bottleneck.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San\u2019s right arm bone grow back, the ninth spirit ring also completely fusing with the Blue Silver Emperor, Er Ming\u2019s deep voice echoed,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy turn. Tang San, please don\u2019t tell Xiao Wu me and big brother liked her. We don\u2019t want her to suffer. Let her always be glad, let her be happy. I believe, you can do it. If one day you truly break through rank one hundred and become a god, you will have the ability to condense our souls, and release us for a short time from the spirit rings and spirit bones. At that time, we will meet Xiao Wu again. Also, your current spirit ring quality is too high, definitely don\u2019t lose it to Xiao Wu. That will have the opposite reaction. Actually, big brother was wrong. We still owe you. If you didn\u2019t rescue us today, we wouldn\u2019t even have the chance for this sacrifice. Put the abilities we give you to good use. Love Xiao Wu well, I wish you two happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood flame ring once again expanded, seeing Da Ming\u2019s big gentle eyes, Tang San clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>The blood colored ring of light landed on Tang San. Immediately, the Blue Silver Emperor disappeared, the nine spirit rings around him also vanishing. In its place, that black Clear Sky Hammer appeared out of nowhere in front of Tang San, floating quietly.</p><br/><p>The Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s dark golden pattern flowed like mercury, as if it knew it would possess its first spirit ring, and looked forward to it with excitement.</p><br/><p>The blood colored flame vanished, turning into an enormous spirit ring enveloping Tang San and Er Ming. As that ring contracted so it revolved only around Tang San, Da Ming\u2019s body was already gone. The last of the red light froze on the Clear Sky Hammer, the bloody light making the originally already heavy presence of the Clear Sky Hammer grow even more domineering. The Deathgod Domain inscribed on the Clear Sky Hammer this moment burst forth with white radiance, letting the bloody color of this first spirit ring permeate within, adding a bit of a bloody luster to the white light of the domain.</p><br/><p>Da Ming became the last spirit ring of Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor, and Er Ming became the first spirit ring of Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer. If a hundred thousand year spirit ring was appropriate in the ninth position, then Er Ming\u2019s hundred thousand year spirit ring becoming the first on the Clear Sky Hammer was unprecedented.</p><br/><p>This year Tang San was only just twenty five. Not only had he set the record for the youngest Title Douluo in history, at the same time, he also a terrifying record of having a spirit\u2019s first spirit ring being hundred thousand year. Even though it might not never be repeated, it was absolutely unmatched in history.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Da Ming and Er Ming had given thought to Tang San\u2019s capabilities. Da Ming\u2019s physical form was long and thin, somewhat similar to Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor strands, and naturally most suited being the Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s spirit ring. And Er Ming was focused on force and violence, just in keeping with the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s requirements. Tang San had never given any spirit rings to the Clear Sky Hammer, and even he himself had never expected that the first would actually be this powerful.</p><br/><p>But, all this wasn\u2019t finished. Along with the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s first spirit ring appearing, a scarlet spirit bone grew transparent and disappeared in front of Tang San. That was a left arm bone. Even though a hundred thousand year\u2019s spirit beast poured his soul into the spirit ring and spirit bone, equally, they decided the forms of the spirit bones formed from their sacrificial energy. The left arm bone and right arm bone matched, and at the same time Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer came from his left hand, so consequently Er Ming chose for his spirit bone form to be Tang San\u2019s left arm.</p><br/><p>The scarlet spirit bone instantly disappeared, but different from Da Ming\u2019s gentle endless spirit power, the split second Er Ming\u2019s spirit bone merged with Tang San\u2019s left arm, Tang San\u2019s whole body produced an impression of explosive power. Even though the left arm didn\u2019t seem to change on the surface, Tang San felt as if his left arm was expanding unhindered, a forceful feeling filling his arm, the vessels beneath the skin constantly wiggling. At the same time, these two hundred thousand year spirit rings and spirit bones merging with him made all of Tang San\u2019s bones crackle.</p><br/><p>Whether spirit ring or spirit bone, both would increase the attributes of the user\u2019s body, and a hundred thousand year spirit ring and hundred thousand year spirit bone were undoubtedly even more outstanding. Tang San originally already had eight formidable spirit rings, and his body had also passed the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well\u2019s forging, his innate attributes were already quite formidable, surpassing that of ordinary Title Douluo. Now, joined with another two great spirit rings and bones, immediately gave a feeling of his body bursting.</p><br/><p>All attributes related to strength rose explosively, and Tang San\u2019s skin also became blood red. The meridians within his body pulsed explosively, his blood circulation speed tripling from before, even his mental strength moved rhythmically.</p><br/><p>That the human body could absorb energy was of course a wonderful matter, it could make one\u2019s physical qualities strengthen comprehensively. But if the energy absorbed was too great, especially if it was absorbed in one go, if it surpassed the limits of the body, the result would absolutely be appallingly miserable, meridians bursting to become crippled, and even explode and die.</p><br/><p>This was also why, back when they discovered Tang San had twin spirits, both Grandmaster and Tang San\u2019s father Tang Hao warned him not to lightly add spirit rings to his second spirit.</p><br/><p>Tang San himself hadn\u2019t expected that just absorbing the first spirit ring of his second spirit would produce such a burden. But in fact, these circumstances didn\u2019t actually appear because his body couldn\u2019t bear it. On the contrary, it happened because Tang San\u2019s physical endurance was too powerful.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar closed the door in passing.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong turned and walked inside. The present Oscar was more mindful about his appearance than before. He was clean shaven, his hair also combed neatly, wearing the pale gold Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School standard clothes, setting off his handsome features even more.</p><br/><p>Especially those big eyes that made even girls jealous, made Ning Rongrong even more afraid to meet his eyes.</p><br/><p>Catching up to Ning Rongrong in a few steps, Oscar pulled out something from his chest and placed it on the desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now on the way past, I saw that your lights were still lit and came over. Why aren\u2019t you resting this late?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong had her back to Oscar, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Oscar joined the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, Ning Fengzhi had let him directly join the inner sect. In fact, the absolute majority of the inner sect were the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s directly related disciples, only especially outstanding outsider Spirit Masters could enter.</p><br/><p>As Ning Fengzhi declared in front of all the sect that Oscar would directly enter the inner sect, he didn\u2019t know how many jealous and envious gazes fell on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterwards when you can\u2019t always stay up late like this. It\u2019s no good to the body, and it will make you age prematurely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar teased.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fourteen, where am I old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing her voice, Oscar couldn\u2019t help looking distracted. Ning Rongrong hadn\u2019t spoken to him like this in a very long time. It sounded like her mood was somewhat amiss today.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what\u2019s going on? Are you ill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong didn\u2019t answer. Originally she had already drummed up enough courage, but as she saw Oscar, for some reason the courage in her heart shrunk. When it finally reached her mouth, she was unable to say it.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ning Rongrong didn\u2019t speak up, Oscar couldn\u2019t help frowning. Sighing lightly, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll return first. Rest early. I brought this for you to eat, eat it and then sleep. It\u2019s a pastry good for digestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Raising his hand to touch Ning Rongrong\u2019s long hair, but in the end still restrained himself. He reluctantly glanced at Ning Rongrong\u2019s beautiful figure from the back, then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>As Ning Rongrong heard Oscar say that he had brought her food, she could no longer hold back the tears in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOscar.\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly cried out.</p><br/><p>Oscar started and halted. When he just turned around, a fragrant wind hit him in the face, as Ning Rongrong leapt into his arms like a swallow, rushing fiercely into his embrace. Holding tightly to his waist.</p><br/><p>After a brief shock, Oscar gradually reacted. Even though Ning Rongrong had already agreed to go out with him, over these days, they had never been as close as now.</p><br/><p>The soft jade tender fragrance filled his arms, that kind of feeling was so pleasurable it was difficult to describe. Turning his hands to hold on to Ning Rongrong, Oscar\u2019s pulse sped up uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>A man and woman alone in a room, the beautiful woman throwing herself into his embrace.</p><br/><p>Oscar was no gentleman, all sorts of fantastic thoughts rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>However, very quickly he felt something was wrong. Because Ning Rongrong\u2019s tender body was twitching slightly in his arms.</p><br/><p>His chest gradually grew moist.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar asked somewhat regretfully. One hand gently caressing Ning Rongrong\u2019s satiny long hair, he quietly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so good to me? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said, choked with sobs.</p><br/><p>Oscar slowly smiled, saying in his heart, \u2018so this girl let me feel moved\u2019. Inwardly unable to keep from feeling proud, he said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cComing to Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, you\u2019re the only one I know, and also the person I love the most. If I wasn\u2019t good to you, who would I be good to? I\u2019ve long since been without parents, and when Heaven has sent you to me, if I didn\u2019t know what to cherish, wouldn\u2019t that shame the good intentions of Heaven?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was originally consoling Ning Rongrong, but who could have imagine that before he finished speaking, Ning Rongrong had already burst into loud crying. The hands holding him also tightened.</p><br/><p>Sensing Ning Rongrong\u2019s pain, Oscar was somewhat at a loss. The previous beautiful feeling completely obliterated, he didn\u2019t know how to best comfort Ning Rongrong this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, don\u2019t cry, your tears break my heart. What\u2019s happened? Tell me. As long as I can do it, I will definitely help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s crying gradually subsided, tightly holding Oscar\u2019s waist, completely burying her body in his arms, lowering her head, not daring to look at him, she almost stammered:</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know? We can never be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at the start, Oscar didn\u2019t hear it clearly. When Ning Rongrong repeated herself once again, he immediately felt as if struck by lightning, his whole body trembling fiercely, he clasped Ning Rongrong\u2019s charming face with both hands and raised her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what are you saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s voice was somewhat trembling. He had never loved someone as wholeheartedly as now, but, what Ning Rongrong said, how could he bear it?</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s silvery teeth clenched. She knew that if she didn\u2019t tell him the truth this time, it would only hurt Oscar even more in the future. Closing her eyes, she resisted the pain in her heart, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, it\u2019s impossible for us to be together. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar looked stupidly at her, a grotesque smile floating onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, do you know? I very rarely shaved before, I never cared anything for anyone else. Even if dean Flender said I was a genius, I still didn\u2019t feel like cultivating. I only wanted to quietly and happily live my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUntil I met you. When I saw you for the first time, I couldn\u2019t help liking your fairy-like mien. Once when you were arrogant and domineering, even at that time, your shadow in my heart didn\u2019t fade. Only I told myself that it was impossible for you and me. You were the magnificent eldest daughter of an influential family, but I was only a common Spirit Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust when I wanted to erase your presence in my heart as far as possible, you began to change. With everyone\u2019s help, you were no longer like before. You began to grow gentle, provoking people\u2019s affection even more. Your faults gradually disappeared, and your shadow, also became more and more distinct in my heart. Until that day, when you told me you wanted to temporarily go out with me, do you know what I felt? Even for a hundred spirit bones, I still wouldn\u2019t trade away the the feeling of that moment. I believed, that my spring had come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to be together with you in the future, in order to gain your father\u2019s recognition, I began to stake my life on cultivation. What I liked the most before was sleeping, but from that day on, I practically never slept, each day was passed constantly cultivating. Even when alone, when in pain, as long as I recalled your smile, I could easily kick the pain aside. I discovered, that I truly loved you. Perhaps I was lowly, each time you were in danger, when I could protect you, I always felt joyous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears flowed down Oscar\u2019s cheeks. He gradually let go of Ning Rongrong\u2019s face, step by step gradually retreating. What his eyes revealed wasn\u2019t sadness, but rather a light close to despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say. Oscar, I, I\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled, a sneer, not towards Ning Rongrong, but at himself,</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly am foolish. I actually already knew it was impossible for us. As the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s invaluable eldest daughter, how would you be together with a poor kid like me? No matter how much effort I made, it would still never be possible for me to be on the same stage as you. In the future, you are the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s school master. And me? Nothing. I really am far too foolish. However, why would you lie to me? Knowing it was impossible, why would you give me that chance? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Oscar\u2019s practically hysterical roar, Ning Rongrong fiercely raised her head. Her eyes were already red from crying, and she equally practically roared back,</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I also loved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was dumbfounded. Looking at Ning Rongrong\u2019s red face, the despair in his eyes once again rose to a hopeful luster.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked at Oscar, tears making her eyes hazy:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, in the beginning, I never considered you. Even though you were very handsome, I\u2019d seen handsome men since I was a child. But, I gradually discovered, that you truly were good to me. To me, you could invest everything. This still wasn\u2019t important, as you began to work hard at cultivating, when you would naturally block in front of me each time we fought, my heart was conquered by you bit by bit. That day, promising to go out with you, that wasn\u2019t a lie. Because I wanted to clearly see, just what place you really had in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we were truly together, when I could see you each day, see you grow thinner day by day because of cultivating hard, I understood that all you did was for me. Your mark on my heart also gradually grew larger. I discovered that my reluctance to part with you grew stronger and stronger. Originally, I should already have told you long ago, it\u2019s impossible for us to be together, but, I really couldn\u2019t say it. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t have the heart to hurt you, but rather that I didn\u2019t want to give up that feeling. That kind of feeling should be called love.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cOscar, I know how much you\u2019ve invested for me, but do you know the suffering in my heart? I constantly told myself that, once the tournament was over, I would tell you the facts. Like that I wouldn\u2019t influence your cultivation. But, within my heart, I didn\u2019t want to tell you the truth, because I didn\u2019t want to leave you. I didn\u2019t want to leave the first man I\u2019ve loved in my life. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Oscar could previously be described as somewhat hesitant, then as he now heard Ning Rongrong\u2019s weeping and complaining sobs, his heart gradually softened.</p><br/><p>Seeing the tears constantly flowing down Ning Rongrong\u2019s face, listening to her speak her mind, Oscar discovered for the first time that what he had invested wasn\u2019t wasted. This was the first time the two of them revealed their hearts, and Oscar\u2019s gaze began to become gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why do you say we can\u2019t be together?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice gradually calming, he asked the question on his mind.</p><br/><p>Nong Rongrong said tearfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the school rules. You also know that our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School directly related disciples are all support type Spirit Masters. Despite having the glory of the number one support spirit, in fact, we\u2019re never able to break away from the fact that we have no attack power. This is also why I originally approached third brother to have those hidden weapons made. Therefore, in the school rules, all spouses of directly related disciples must be battle Spirit Masters with extremely formidable strength, to protect us. If it was another related disciple, perhaps there would still be a chance for flexibility. But I\u2019m my father\u2019s only daughter, and the only future heir of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. It\u2019s impossible for my father to be accommodating with these rules for me. I can only find a future spouse who can use spirit power to protect me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar looked at Ning Rongrong in a daze,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the reason we can\u2019t be together? Because I\u2019m a support type Spirit Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong nodded with eyes hazy with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School has never discriminated against ordinary Spirit Masters. As long as you entered the school, the school would treat you sincerely. But I don\u2019t have the power to change these rules. Not even when I become the sect master. I know you\u2019re good to me, and I also truly like you. But, if we go on, it will only be more painful in the future. I don\u2019t want to drown you in this pain. A brief pain is better than prolonged ache, it\u2019s still not too late to tell you now. You\u2019re sixteen. You still have a beautiful future. I\u2019m sorry, Oscar. Truly sorry\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the sobs made her unable to speak.</p><br/><p>Oscar looked bitterly at Ning Rongrong. Could he truly blame her for this?</p><br/><p>No, of course not. This wasn\u2019t Ning Rongrong\u2019s fault. When he heard Ning Rongrong say she loved him, the softest part of his heart was already completely touched.</p><br/><p>To him, that Ning Rongrong felt for him was more important than anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo late. It\u2019s already too late. Even if I\u2019m only sixteen, in my heart, there will never be room for a second woman. Rongong, do you know? It\u2019s already too late for you to tell me now. I love you, forever and ever, even if the seas run dry and the stones go soft, this won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><br/><p>An incomparably resolute splendor flickered in Oscar\u2019s peach blossom eyes. Taking a few steps forward, he grabbed Ning Rongrong\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong. Look at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s voice suddenly calmed.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stared blankly, raising her head to look at him. Suddenly, she saw a special light in Oscar\u2019s eyes she had never seen before, a light she had only seen in Tang San and Dai Mubai\u2019s eyes at the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament finals.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, listen to me. I won\u2019t give up. I will never give up. I\u2019m very happy, because it\u2019s the first time I heard you say that you like me. There are difficulties before us, but as long as we love each other, the difficulties might not be insurmountable. The rules of your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School is nothing more than a hope for directly related disciples to possess powerful protection. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t do that right now, I\u2019m only a food type Spirit Master, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will never be possible for me. Rongrong, will you wait for me? Give me ten years, I\u2019ll definitely find a way to become powerful, a way to gain the strength to protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what, Ning Rongrong hadn\u2019t expected Oscar to react like this. Seeing the stubborn light in his eyes, she suddenly discovered that this man was worthy of relying on. Practically without the slightest hesitation, she nodded.</p><br/><p>Releasing his grip on Ning Rongrong\u2019s shoulders, Oscar turned sharply, all reluctance to part hidden completely within the deepest parts of his heart,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, I\u2019m leaving. Ten years, wait ten years for me. After ten years, if I still haven\u2019t returned, get married. If I\u2019ve succeeded, I will definitely return to find you. In ten years, you will be twenty four, in your prime. As long as I don\u2019t die, I will succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Oscar didn\u2019t pause, dashing out like a gust of wind. He wouldn\u2019t stay longer at Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. He knew that he would never be able to find the true answer here. He had to go, had to leave this place, go to the outside world to search for the things he needed. Could a food system Spirit Master truly not protect the ones he loved?</p><br/><p>No, he believed he could achieve it. For the stubborn love in his heart, anyhow and anyway, he would achieve it.</p><br/><p>Looking at Oscar\u2019s disappearing back, Ning Rongrong was already stupid. At this moment, she clearly discovered that she couldn\u2019t control her heart from falling for this handsome man who was good to her, who invested everything for her. She was reluctant to see him leave, she truly wanted to have him stay, but she knew that if she said so, she and him would truly be forever unable to be together.</p><br/><p>A gloomy sigh echoed behind Ning Rongrong, a forceful big hand falling on her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t cry. If he truly can return within ten years, perhaps you truly will be able to be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong turned around, looking at Ning Fengzhi who had quietly appeared at some point. She threw herself fiercely into her fathers arms and lost her voice in bitter tears.</p><br/><p>Sword Douluo Chen Xin and Bone Douluo Gu Rong stood there quietly. The two great Title Douluo looked face to face, and the always taciturn Sword Douluo suddenly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppose with time, this kid isn\u2019t something in the pond. Like he said himself, if he doesn\u2019t die in ten years, then after ten years, he will certainly shock the Spirit Master world. Shock us. Let him go temper himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong, as the heir to the school master, having so much noise appear on her side, how couldn\u2019t Ning Fengzhi and the others notice? The three were here long ago, and also heard the majority of Ning Rongrong and Oscar\u2019s discussion, even if they didn\u2019t reveal themselves. As Ning Fengzhi heard Oscar\u2019s final decision, his eyes shone with admiration.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils, they really weren\u2019t ordinary characters. Perhaps this kid\u2019s talent couldn\u2019t compare to Tang San, but the unswerving determination hidden in his heart was enough to deal with a great many troubles.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi didn\u2019t hold back Oscar. He also wanted to see what kind of shock this youngster could give him in the future. If that shock was enough to offset the school rules, then he wouldn\u2019t mind being his father in law.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Putong.</p><br/><p>Tang San wasn\u2019t clear on how many times this was that he\u2019d been blasted into the pool.</p><br/><p>The two hundred meter high torrential waterfall struck with enormous force, this was something he could only truly understand from experience.</p><br/><p>With sealed spirit power, let alone practicing with the hammer in the waterfall, even climbing onto the large round rock was difficult to achieve. A whole three days had passed, and Tang San had never stood firmly on that incomparably sleek rock. He hadn\u2019t even swung the hammer once.</p><br/><p>Each day he would exhaust all his energy, with difficulty climb onto land, recover his energy, and once again return to make an effort under the waterfall.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s temperament had always been known for perseverance, he had never known anything called defeat.</p><br/><p>If the first time didn\u2019t work he would do it twice, if twice didn\u2019t work then thrice. He firmly believed that there would be a reason to what his father had him do.</p><br/><p>Under the effect of the wisdom skull bone, Tang San began to determine the degree of sleekness of that rock, began to determine the force of impact of the water, looking for the best place to cut through to stand on the rock, and began to with great effort dodge the impact of the water.</p><br/><p>Exploiting every fraction of strength in each part of his body.</p><br/><p>The heavy forging hammer no doubt helped him. The heavier he was, the harder it was to be dashed into the pool.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao always sat meditating in the cave he made, never paying any attention to what Tang San did. Tang San had stockpiled a great amount of drinking water and food in the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, enough to let two people persist for a month.</p><br/><p>Therefore, in this month, Tang San didn\u2019t go to pick any fruit.</p><br/><p>Whenever he came up to rest, he would separate some food and bring it to his father\u2019s cave, arranging it in front of his father.</p><br/><p>After eating he would immediately rest, and once his energy recovered he threw himself into the water.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao occasionally opened his eyes, his gaze involuntarily falling on Tang San. Watching his son again and again be dashed down and climb up again, his eyes would reveal a faint gratification.</p><br/><p>\u2018Foolish kid, do you know? This waterfall is a hammer to forge you. What it forges is your body. As the only Divine Craftsman on the Continent, what I want to do is forge you yourself into a true divine tool.\u2019</p><br/><p>Five seconds. He finally endured for five seconds.</p><br/><p>On the fifth day, Tang San could already endure on the rock for five seconds.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Finally on the fifth day, Tang San could endure for five seconds on the round rock.</p><br/><p>Even without the aid of spirit power, standing on the rock, his body could move softly according to the rhythm of Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step, unloading the force of impact from the waterfall, as far as possible finding the best position to endure the strike.</p><br/><p>Even when it was difficult to breathe, he still endured for every moment possible.</p><br/><p>To Tang San, this was undoubtedly a good start. Just as they say, all things are difficult at the start. The first perseverance is undoubtedly the most painful. Not only did Tang San have to endure the tyrannical battering of the waterfall, but he still had to endure the pain while unable to use spirit power.</p><br/><p>Just like an adult suddenly turning into a small child, when strength abruptly dropped, one would need some time to adjust.</p><br/><p>And five days was just this time for adaptation. in five days, in the constant battering of the water, the pain of being unable to use Mysterious Heaven Skill gradually faded. Relying on the wisdom skull\u2019s intelligence boost, he gradually grasped the technique.</p><br/><p>From the sixth day on, the time he could stay on the round rock rose geometrically, and he could also finally start to swing the forging hammer in his hand.</p><br/><p>Using strength on the slick and smooth round rock was no doubt an extremely painful matter. But Tang San was astute, he didn\u2019t anxiously start to practice the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method, and rather first adapted himself to the strength of the waterfall as far as possible, making great efforts to control his balance, allowing the waterfall to wash him.</p><br/><p>When Tang San could finally stand firm under the waterfall without getting pounded into the water, Tang Hao finally gave him a word of advice.</p><br/><p>Cultivate. Cultivate spirit power. Of course, to Tang San, that was cultivating Mysterious Heaven Skill.</p><br/><p>For a while Tang San was astonished by his father\u2019s words. His Mysterious Heaven Skill internal strength was already sealed, how would he still cultivate? But as he truly cultivated, he discovered that the seal his father had given him was extremely odd. Even though he couldn\u2019t use the Mysterious Heaven Skill internal strength, it didn\u2019t influence his cultivation.</p><br/><p>Whenever he started to cultivate the emptiness in his body, after circulating the accumulated internal strength once, it would automatically merge into that fiery seal, fusing with his own original internal strength.</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San was unable to feel to what degree his Mysterious Heaven Skill progressed like this, after cultivating, the recovery speed of his body would clearly accelerate.</p><br/><p>Therefore, from this day on, Tang San would cultivate for six hours each day, training under the waterfall for the remaining time.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The forging hammer caused an enormous splash within the waterfall, circling once, and returning over Tang San\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Success. Tang San exulted. But he was only joyous for a moment, because as his will wavered, the waterfall blasted him into the pool.</p><br/><p>Today was already the fifteenth day since coming here. After unrelenting effort, he could finally successfully do the first Disorder Splitting Wind swing, without sliding from the round rock from the force.</p><br/><p>With the first swing came the second. With Tang San\u2019s constant training, the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method began to emerge in his hands.</p><br/><p>The forging hammer was after all no Clear Sky Hammer, and its weight wasn\u2019t that dreadful. Even more, its weight could help Tang San stand steadily on the rock. Gradually, his Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method grew more and more skillful from practising in the waterfall.</p><br/><p>At the start he could only cause some splashes, but as it danced it would be impervious to the elements. It was like a round barrier beneath the waterfall, constantly blocking the battering of the waterfall, water blooming in large splashes.</p><br/><p>The forging hammer\u2019s swinging frequency swiftly and steadily rose. In an instant, three months had passed.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The final swing lashed out. Tang San\u2019s body soared up like an artillery shell, meeting the battering waterfall for ten meters. Within ten meters, the falling water was struck back against the stream, and under the drive of his figure, issuing an immense explosive rumble. Even that rainbow spanning the pool was turned disorderly at this moment.</p><br/><p>That of course wasn\u2019t something Tang San could achieve with his present strength, but rather a property of the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method.</p><br/><p>One swing was more powerful than the last, the force of the swings overlapping. If not for the inner qualities of Tang San\u2019s physique being extremely powerful, that enormous impact would be enough to rip the muscles from his bones.</p><br/><p>The moment the nine by nine, eighty one swings, were completed, the eighty one overlapping forces condensed together. Despite not being able to use the slightest bit of spirit power at the moment, that instantly erupting terrifying attack power still surpassed his peak.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The force faded away. Tang San\u2019s body in the waterfall was smashed heavily into the pool, but at this moment the excitement in his heart was difficult to describe.</p><br/><p>Three months, he had finally completed his father\u2019s requirement, finally managed the eighty first swing.</p><br/><p>Right now, Tang San\u2019s skin was brimming with a healthy bronze color, his height increased somewhat. Even though his hair and the beard on his face seemed extremely disorderly, his eyes like cold stars tilted dazzlingly.</p><br/><p>The instant the waterfall reversed, Tang Hao sitting in the cavern had already opened his eyes, an astonished light flashing past the corners of his eyes. Even as the youngest Title Douluo of the continent, right now he still couldn\u2019t help sighing in praise at his son\u2019s accomplishments. Back when he completed this step, it had taken him a full half year. But Tang San, with unswerving will and the help of his talent, had unexpectedly used just three months.</p><br/><p>Jumping onto the shore from the pool, Tang San held the forging hammer in one hand, and he first of all looked his father in the eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u2019s gaze swept across his son. In these three months, Tang San\u2019s muscles had become more distinct. Even though none was exaggeratedly enormous, his skin held a faint hazy light. With the eyesight of a Title Douluo, he could naturally detect the accumulated explosive power within.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I succeeded. Eighty one swings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat proudly said to Tang Hao. Eighty one swings, eighty one unrestrained swings, that transcendence of heart and body made him extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao nodded to him, giving him two words,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Only, you can still do better.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang Hao grabbed the forging hammer from Tang San\u2019s hands. With a casual flick, the forging hammer soared away like a shooting star, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Paying no attention to the somewhat lifeless Tang San, Tang Hao\u2019s one hand grabbed a large tree next to him. His hand cut into the tree trunk like a sharp blade, cutting it like it was soft tofu.</p><br/><p>As Tang Hao\u2019s hand moved, Tang San only saw a cloud of wood shavings in the air and Tang Hao\u2019s illusory palm.</p><br/><p>In fact, his Purple Demon Eye had already reached the peak of the third tier, and that he couldn\u2019t clearly see Tang Hao\u2019s movements with his present eyesight, showed just how fast Tang Hao was.</p><br/><p>When Tang Hao stopped, yet another hammer had appeared in his hand, exactly identical to the previous forging hammer, but made from the wood of the tree.</p><br/><p>Stuffing the wooden hammer into Tang San\u2019s palm,</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, use it to practice the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method. If the hammer breaks, make one yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving these words behind, Tang Hao returned to his cave again. Only a few simple words, but what he had given Tang San was an even more difficult challenge.</p><br/><p>When he first got the hammer, Tang San didn\u2019t feel anything. For three months he had used the several dozen jin forging hammer, now holding this wooden hammer, it was practically light as air.</p><br/><p>As he once again swam back to the waterfall, he was a lot more relaxed than before. The wooden hammer was buoyant, and moreover so light, it saved him practically a fifth of the time before he reached the waterfall.</p><br/><p>However, when he climbed onto the round rock under the waterfall, he immediately felt something amiss. Under the immense impact of the water, his body swayed, and he was unexpectedly almost smashed onto the rock.</p><br/><p>In fact, these three months of training had long since let him stand stable on the round rock like a nail hammered into a board. Having his steps suddenly falter, how could he not be shocked?</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Tang San realized the problem. The forging hammer in his hand had turned into a wooden hammer, and the weight was massively different. The center of his gravity as well as his familiarity with the stream of water had all changed.</p><br/><p>With different weight, it was naturally even more difficult to stand steadily. Having figured this out, Tang San immediately understood some of his father\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Astutely, he didn\u2019t immediately swing the wooden hammer after standing firm, but rather stood there stably, controlling the wooden hammer to swing it softly, feeling the sensation of the wooden hammer in the stream.</p><br/><p>The seemingly light as a feather wooden hammer unexpectedly received even greater resistance in the water than the forging hammer from before. It suffered the double influence of its own buoyancy and the water\u2019s impulse, making Tang San\u2019s control even more difficult.</p><br/><p>When Tang San felt he could once again stand firmly, he began to use the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method again.</p><br/><p>The first and second swings still continued as normal, just not so easy. But when the third swing arrived, the frail wooden hammer snapped the instant it would split the water. One wooden hammer, broken.</p><br/><p>From this day on, Tang San entered the second stage of training.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have internal strength. Unable to infuse the wooden hammer with internal strength to protect it, what he could do was to control his use of strength as far as possible, controlling the force constantly exerted on the wooden hammer to keep it from breaking under the water. From breaking from his own swings.</p><br/><p>The abruptly growing problem didn\u2019t make Tang San shrink back, on the contrary it made his mind even more focused, starting an even more arduous special training.</p><br/><p>After nine months.</p><br/><p>Within an ear-piercing roar, the tremendous water screen soared up. This time it wasn\u2019t only the part of the waterfall above, but an entire section almost ten meters wide. Under the waterfall, that soaring figure\u2019s whole body twinkled with a bronze radiance, glittering like gold under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Eighty one swings, Tang San had already forgotten how many times this was that he had completed the eighty first swing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Have him hurry up and leave, I don\u2019t want to see anyone related to the Clear Sky School. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for not sparing your feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan was also somewhat angry, he regarded Tang San extremely highly, even to the extent that he had entrusted the Strength Clan\u2019s future to him. Shooting to his feet, he said angrily:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fine, we\u2019ll go together. Our Strength Clan doesn\u2019t need to take part in the gathering this time. Young master, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he headed towards the exit in big strides.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao hadn\u2019t thought Tai Tan\u2019s reaction would actually be so fierce, and his face immediately changed. He and Tai Tan had been brothers for many years, so he naturally knew this old fellow wasn\u2019t one to make decisions lightly. However, his words were already spoken, and as a clan chief, if he were to take it back now he wouldn\u2019t be left with any face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Tai Tan, wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San pulled Tai Tan\u2019s arm. If they truly left, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t be any leeway to change the situation. He of course wouldn\u2019t call Tai Tan \u2018elder\u2019 in front of outsiders.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan looked at Tang San, and Tang San nodded at him, afterwards turned to face Niu Gao, giving him a deep bow,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Niu Gao, I apologize to you for the Clear Sky School and my father causing the four single category clans trouble back then. I know that such an apology can\u2019t mean anything. Following senior Tai Tan this time was in the hopes of finding a way to make it up to the four clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao glared at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Clear Sky School has lifted the seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cI only represent myself and my father. Not the Clear Sky School. The sect is still sealed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter whether the Clear Sky School has lifted the seal or not, there\u2019s not a copper spirit coin of responsibility towards our Defense Clan. We\u2019ve done very well, we have no use for any of your compensation. Nor is it something a kid still smelling of his mother\u2019s milk can repay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Niu Gao\u2019s words, Tang San instead of getting angry, smiled. He had already heard some margins for redemption in the meaning behind the counterparts words. Of course, this margin wasn\u2019t something Niu Gao had set aside for him, but rather for Tai Tan\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Right now, Tai Tan had also turned around, standing next to Tang San.</p><br/><p>Confronted with Niu Gao\u2019s angry glare, Tang San seemed very leisurely. Embracing Xiao Wu, his graceful character not the slightest flustered. In fact, Niu Gao was also a Spirit Douluo level power, and even if he didn\u2019t purposefully release his strength to pressure Tang San, his own aura as well as the aggression saved up over decades as clan chief wasn\u2019t something an ordinary person could endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Niu Gao, of course I can\u2019t swear that I can do anything for the four clans. You won\u2019t believe empty promises, and even I feel that\u2019s unconvincing. However, I hope you can give me one chance. Let me stay here to participate in the gathering. I don\u2019t want the Defense Clan to regard me as an enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao suddenly smiled, but his smile was even more frightening than his chill just now. A tyrannical pressure suddenly burst from him, oppressing Tang San just like a raging wave.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive you a chance? Back when the Clear Sky School declared themselves sealed, did they give us four clans any chances? Back when your father fought Spirit Hall, did he think of our interests? Why would I give you a chance? Fuck off, get out of here, otherwise don\u2019t blame an old man for being blunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>An angry light flashed in Tai Tan\u2019s eyes, about to erupt, but was forcefully stopped by Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Tai Tan, let me deal with it on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s goal was to establish the Tang Sect in another world, to let the Tang Sect grow and develop on this Douluo Continent. If he couldn\u2019t even deal with this, how could he run a sect?</p><br/><p>Confronting the immense pressure released by Niu Gao, Tang San advanced rather than retreat, taking a step forward. A faint white light appeared from his body, but the white light wasn\u2019t extroverted, but rather gathered close around him. When the formidable pressure Niu Gao released fell on him, a bizarre scene appeared. That immense pressure was unexpectedly cut in two by Tang San\u2019s body, slipping past on either side of him, unable to affect him in any way.</p><br/><p>Who was Tang San? As early as when his strength was still low and confronted the three board members of the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy, he had forcefully overcome their pressure, let alone the current him. That white light was undoubtedly the Deathgod Domain inscribed on his Clear Sky Hammer, and the effect that appeared now was the evolved effect of the Deathgod Domain \u2014\u2014 Deathgod Assault.</p><br/><p>Just like the group binding after the Blue Silver Domain evolved, Deathgod Assault was also the result of the domain evolving along with Tang San\u2019s strength. The evolved Blue Silver Domain\u2019s ability Blue Silver Ranged Binding was a large scale control ability, superior in large areas. And the Deathgod Domain\u2019s evolved ability Deathgod Assault was completely used on a single target. Right now Tang San had focused the Deathgod Domain within himself, and that Deathgod Assault turned his body into a sharp blade, immediately causing a tyrannical cutting effect on that incorporeal pressure.</p><br/><p>In the Spirit Master world, strength could always be said to solve a great many things. When Niu Gao felt the pressure he released unexpectedly cut apart like that, he also couldn\u2019t help being shocked, his gaze at Tang San immediately changing.</p><br/><p>Somewhat stunned looking at Tang San, Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthy of being Tang Hao\u2019s son, you can actually block my pressure. How old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled calmly,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost twenty one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s expression changed again, clearly amazed by Tang San\u2019s age. His gaze turned towards Tai Long to the side, and discovered that Tai Long was just now looking at him, the expression in his eyes still with something of looking at a good show. Somewhat in a rage from humiliation he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, if you want to stay it\u2019s possible. Right here, as long as nothing is damaged, if you can persevere against me for the time of one stick of incense, I\u2019ll let you stay to participate in the gathering. I\u2019ll explain it to the two other sides.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one to speak up wasn\u2019t Tang San, but rather Tai Tan. Right now, his face was already covered with a smile.</p><br/><p>When Niu Gao saw Tai Tan\u2019s smile, he suddenly had a feeling of the hairs all over his body standing up, somewhat resentfully saying to him:</p><br/><p>\u201cI, old Niu, am still a clan chief, don\u2019t tell me I\u2019d speak without thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good. It seems there\u2019s no need to leave today. We can still finish off this old fellow\u2019s wine tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao snorted angrily,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld orangutan, are you so confident in this little fellow? My spirit power has advanced in these two years, even if I still can\u2019t compare to you, I\u2019m still at the eighty fourth rank. How old is he? I say it\u2019s one stick of incense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan smiled mysteriously, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou try it and you\u2019ll know. I guarantee you won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try. One try will frighten you out of your skin. Old rhino, don\u2019t blame your big brother for not warning you. There\u2019s none in the young generation of the Clear Sky School that can stand next to Tang San, his talent isn\u2019t inferior in any way to his father. He\u2019s a leading figure of the present Clear Sky School third generation. A strong contender for the next Clear Sky School master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tai Tan\u2019s words, Niu Gao\u2019s expression immediately grew serious. Other things didn\u2019t matter, but Tai Tan saying he was more talented than Tang Hao, that made his spirit droop. He and Tai Tan were close as brothers, and Tai Tan himself wouldn\u2019t lie to him. Moreover, within Tai Tan\u2019s words, there was unexpectedly still a faintly warning feeling. It seemed to warn him not to keel over.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Tang San spoke,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Niu Gao, you are the close brother of senior Tai Tan, naturally you\u2019re also my senior. How about this. We\u2019ll make our competition a bit simpler. Neither of us will use spirit abilities, but we can gather spirit force. We\u2019ll each strike the opponent three times. The other side can\u2019t dodge, only block. If, after three strikes, junior can still keep standing here, the senior please let junior stay here to participate in the gathering, how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San say this, let alone Niu Gao being stunned, even Tai Tan widened his eyes in shock. Naturally not because Tang San gave himself an easy way to win, but rather because the conditions he raised were too favorable to Defense Clan chief Niu Gao.</p><br/><p>The Defense Clan, like the Strength Clan, as a single attribute clan, they wholeheartedly spent all their efforts on defense. Their defensive power was tyrannical, something no Spirit Masters on the same level could compare to. Even the famed Elephant Clan School didn\u2019t dare say they surpassed the Defense Clan in defense.</p><br/><p>Without using spirit abilities, not allowed to dodge, enduring three of the opponent\u2019s attacks. This was clearly a method that allowed the Defense Clan\u2019s defensive power to be displayed to its greatest degree. Not to mention level ground, it already let Niu Gao hold an invincible position. And as a Spirit Douluo level power, even if Niu Gao didn\u2019t use spirit abilities, his pure spirit power bombardment was already quite powerful.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan somewhat anxiously gave Tang San a meaningful look, but Tang San didn\u2019t seem to see it. Still attentively watching Niu Gao with a graceful expression, waiting for his reply.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao glared at Tang San, not recovering for a long time as he couldn\u2019t think why Tang San would propose terms so favorable to him. Clearly, this youth in front of him wasn\u2019t planning on leaving, then that could only prove that he had complete confidence in himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re very brassy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao said coldly.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head with a smile, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. How could junior dare be arrogant in front of two seniors? I just don\u2019t want to harm the friendliness. Senior, please begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he returned Xiao Wu from his arms to the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao walked in front of Tang San with large strides, halting,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe method you\u2019ve proposed already leaves me at a very large advantage, how could I go first. Kid, you begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wasn\u2019t polite about it,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fine, senior be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took a very simple step forward, one fist striking at Niu Gao\u2019s chest. His movements were extremely direct, but astonishing Niu Gao was that he unexpectedly didn\u2019t feel a trace of spirit power from Tang San\u2019s punch.</p><br/><p>After a thump sound, Tang San\u2019s fist withdrew. Niu Gao stared blankly since he basically didn\u2019t feel any attack power, and couldn\u2019t help getting angry,</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, are you playing with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. It\u2019s just that honorable senior\u2019s defensive power is number one on the Continent. What need is there for me to make a fool of myself? Junior\u2019s attack won\u2019t affect senior anyway, so it would be better if I put all my effort into defending against senior\u2019s attack. Like this there\u2019s an even greater chance I will stay behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s neither light nor heavy flattery immediately eased Niu Gao\u2019s expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you take my first punch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao wouldn\u2019t be polite, if he couldn\u2019t beat down a barely twenty years old junior in three punches, he would absolutely lose face. But he would still give something in return for Tang San\u2019s kind intentions, therefore, this first punch only used thirty percent force.</p><br/><p>Absolutely don\u2019t look down on thirty percent of the strength of a Spirit Douluo. Even if Niu Gao\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t as tyrannical as Tai Tan, as a defense type Spirit Master, his strength absolutely wasn\u2019t weak. Further adding his spirit power, this thirty percent strength attack was still equivalent to a common sixtieth ranked Spirit Master\u2019s full strength attack.</p><br/><p>Tang San really didn\u2019t dodge, nor did he use his spirit, directly accepting this punch on his chest without flinching.</p><br/><p>With a thump, Tang San fell backwards in response.</p><br/><p>Just then Niu Gao secretly thought this youngster really was arrogant, unable to take one of his thirty percent strength punches. Only, he shouldn\u2019t be able to either. At his age, to be able to be a fortieth rank Spirit Master was pretty good. This method he had chosen really was disadvantageous to him.</p><br/><p>However, before the thought had faded from Niu Gao\u2019s mind, his eyes widened once again.</p><br/><p>After Tang San\u2019s upper body leaned back forty five degrees, he swung back up. Immediately afterward, his body swayed violently with his waist as axis, constantly moving up and down just like waves billowing. But he didn\u2019t fall, he didn\u2019t even retreat half a step.</p><br/><p>This scene went on for the space of several breaths, before Tang San\u2019s body stabilized, his face not even red, his breath not hurried, looking towards Niu Gao, he smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for senior being lenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thirty percent strength really was considered being lenient, but Niu Gao still hadn\u2019t expected Tang San to be able to keep standing. The reason he didn\u2019t fully use spirit power to attack was out of fear he\u2019d beat Tang San to death, provoking the Strength Clan and, more importantly, he didn\u2019t want to embarass his old brother Tai Tan.</p><br/><p>However, he absolutely hadn\u2019t expected that, after enduring his thirty percent strength punch, without using spirit power, this youth before him would actually look as if nothing had happened, as if his punch just now hadn\u2019t even hit him.</p><br/><p>Of course Niu Gao\u2019s punch hit the target. However, Tang San ingeniously dispersed the majority of it. Tang San\u2019s swaying really wasn\u2019t completely caused by the opponent\u2019s force, but rather him using his Controlling Crane Catching Dragon skill on himself. Each time he swayed, some of the force of the opponent\u2019s attack at his chest dispersed. In the end, he didn\u2019t actually have to endure any violent attack. His skill in using four liang to push a thousand jin really could be called brilliant. But for the people of this world it was very difficult to understand that he had displayed this consummate skill.</p><br/><p>Tang San spread a smile towards Niu Gao,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, junior\u2019s second punch will come. Be careful. This time junior will use strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San punched again.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao basically didn\u2019t plan on blocking, he didn\u2019t believe Tang San\u2019s attack could have any effect on him. In his eyes, Tang San\u2019s fist was even more showy this time, striking light as a feather towards his chest. Right now, all the thoughts in his mind were on how much strength to use for the next punch in order to knock down Tang San, but not cause him too much harm.</p><br/><p>Just when Tang San\u2019s fist was several cun from Niu Gao\u2019s chest, suddenly, a rich white light burst from his body. That wasn\u2019t the release of a spirit, even less a spirit ability, but rather the blessed domain inscribed on his Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>The white light instantly rushed from all over Tang San\u2019s body to gather on his right hand, the Deathgod Domain\u2019s evolved ability Deathgod Assault condensing on his fist in an instant. Just relying on these few cun of distance, Tang San\u2019s fist abruptly accelerated, bombarding Niu Gao\u2019s chest with speed difficult to discern with the naked eye. Strangely, as this punch struck Niu Gao\u2019s chest, it didn\u2019t make any sound.</p><br/><p>The excessive modesty was only to make the opponent underestimate him. When he returned from the Clear Sky School, Tang San had already understood that this was a world where you had to speak with strength. The one with the strongest fist was the one with the loudest voice. If he didn\u2019t reveal his strength, others would only have a low opinion of him here.</p><br/><p>His not using any force in his first punch was naturally not for the reason he said, but rather to make Niu Gao despise him. But this second punch used his real skill. Deathgod Domain\u2019s evolved ability Deathgod Assault, and further adding the instantly erupting short range power, already used his full strength. If anyone could see it, they would discover that after his right hand was wrapped up in the Deathgod Domain, it had completely turned a jade color. The extroverted force of the Controlling Crane Catching Dragon erupted completely. He had already warned Niu Gao when he punched the second time, as for whether Niu Gao would really listen, that wasn\u2019t his problem.</p><br/><p>Tang San moved very quickly, from the Deathgod Domain condensing to the short range force erupting, only an instant passed. With the single attribute of defense, Niu Gao wasn\u2019t specialized in reaction. Suddenly feeling a chill approaching his chest, Tang San\u2019s fist was already planted in his stomach.</p><br/><p>When Tang San\u2019s fist made contact, Tang San\u2019s face flushed red, but very quickly recovered to normal.</p><br/><p>But Niu Gao\u2019s expression gradually changed from lifeless to groteseque. Suddenly, his face changed greatly, and immediately afterward, step, step, step, retreated three paces. Standing firm, opening his mouth, a white mist flowed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao was now both alarmed and furious. He had secretly sneered at that lightning bolt like attack of Tang San\u2019s even when it hit his chest, \u2018want to use a method like that? Can you imagine this old man\u2019s defense?\u2019 Without even using his spirit, the durability of Niu Gao\u2019s skin wasn\u2019t any less than a real rhinoceros\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, as the fist reached him, he discovered it wasn\u2019t that simple. First, Tang San\u2019s punch just struck a great acupuncture point on his chest, and moreover the spirit power erupting over the short range completely condensed together. But most dreadful was still that concentrated Deathgod Assault. The instantly erupting killing intent wasn\u2019t something that could be blocked with physical defense.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao only felt a great force reach him, he actually blocked that force, but the chill brought within the force pierced his chest like a steel needle, immediately numbing his whole body. That cold air unexpectedly forced him to gasp for breath, and even his heart seemed agitated to the point of bursting. Fortunately his strength was tyrannical, and his defense powerful beyond powerful, with a heart far stronger than an ordinary person\u2019s. He then straightened with difficulty, opening his mouth to spit out white mist. That was the killing intent produced by Tang San\u2019s Deathgod Domain.</p><br/><p>Watching Niu Gao successively retreat three steps, Tai Tan was also unable to conceal his shock. He was very clear on how powerful Niu Gao\u2019s defense was, he himself might not be able to injure that old man at all in a frontal confrontation even going all out. But he had retreated under Tang San\u2019s one punch. Just how had Tang San done it?</p><br/><p>His heart still cold, a meaning from the depths of his heart made Niu Gao shiver. That ice cold and cruel killing intent had baptised him. Even though the attack power was great, he could still withstand it, but that frightful killing intent made him completely believe in Tai Tan\u2019s previous words. Tang San really was even more outstanding than Tang Hao. He was sure that Tang Hao, at Tang San\u2019s age, didn\u2019t have such strength. But that icy cold overbearing killing intent was exactly the same.</p><br/><p>After Tai Tan\u2019s initial shock, he burst into laughter. Looking at Niu Gao\u2019s shriveled appearance after Tang San\u2019s attack made him indescribably happy. He hadn\u2019t seen his brother so embarrassed in a long time.</p><br/><p>Actually, right now Tang San was also greatly startled. He had already been mentally prepared for Niu Gao\u2019s defense, but as this punch directly bombarded Niu Gao\u2019s chest, he still discovered that Niu Gao\u2019s defensive power wasn\u2019t as simple as he imagined.</p><br/><p>First of all, his fist striking Niu Gao\u2019s chest hadn\u2019t felt the acupuncture point in his attack. Niu Gao\u2019s thick skin and muscles were just as tough as bullhide, and besides being extremely tough, there was also a kind of extraordinary elasticity. Just from this one punch, the rebound force made his wrist ache. Besides the Deathgod Assault, the short range produced spirit power was completely blocked by the skin.</p><br/><p>Even if it was only a single attribute, just how frightening this pure attribute was could only be truly understood through experience.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao glared resolutely at Tai Tan, his face already turned red as pork liver,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood kid, I won\u2019t be polite with the second punch either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly shouting loudly, the entire hall trembled, left foot taking one step forward, right fist directly striking at Tang San. And his original plan to use fifty percent spirit power had already turned to seventy percent. Niu Gao meant to win with this punch. Being forced to retreat three steps by a youngster several decades his junior, to a grandmaster of defense like him, this was simply an extraordinary humiliation.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014 A violent blast rose at Tang San\u2019s chest, and Tai Tan\u2019s smiling expression immediately vanished.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s upper body was blown back so he faced upward, his feet also staggering backward. But the instant Niu Gao\u2019s fist struck his body, one blue and one white, two colored lights instantly erupted.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao felt his whole body turn cold, his heart contracting once, the force of this fist immediately weakening somewhat, and the feeling of his fist striking Tang San also startled him. As a grandmaster of defense, he clearly felt Tang San\u2019s body brimming with an elastic feeling, with a peculiar resilience contained within the elasticity. As his fist struck, even though Tang San seemed blown back and swiftly retreating, Niu Gao discovered that, in fact, his power basically didn\u2019t completely affect this youth\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>His body still swaying violently, at the same time, a burst of cracking sounds could be heard from Tang San\u2019s bones, the white light he released vanished, but the blue light held a faint golden red color.</p><br/><p>After directly retreating more than ten steps, Tang San managed to stand firm. But he wasn\u2019t as easy going as before, his complexion seeming somewhat pale, his chest also heaving slightly. However, he still didn\u2019t fall. Under the seventy percent strike of a Spirit Douluo, he could still stand. This already proved a great many things.</p><br/><p>While striking Tang San, Niu Gao regretted it a little. If Tang San really had an accident, there would be a great deal of trouble. Even if he didn\u2019t use spirit abilities, he still had complete faith in his strength and spirit power. However, Tang San still stood after retreating more than ten steps.</p><br/><p>Simply moving his body, that blue and gold light slowly fading, Tang San\u2019s pale face unexpectedly turned healthy again, spreading a smile at Niu Gao,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, such powerful spirit power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao stupidly looked at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, isn\u2019t your spirit a cockroach? Even among my Defense Clan\u2019s disciple, there\u2019s none under the age of forty that can block my punch to this degree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s smile didn\u2019t change. In terms of defensive strength, how could he be lacking? He knew clearly from experience what kind of painful upgrades his defensive strength had undergone.</p><br/><p>First of all were his six spirit rings, skipping levels to absorb already from his third spirit ring. Enduring the tremendous pain at that time was a feat of heroism. With the circumstances of skipping a level to absorb it, at the same time as his strength rose, the attributes transformed by his spirit rings were far more powerful than those of Spirit Masters of equal level.</p><br/><p>Next, taking the two great Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot immortal herbs, forging his body in the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, further adding the transformation of the Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s second awakening, Xiao Wu\u2019s sacrificed hundred thousand year spirit ring transforming his body, as well as the amplified attributes of those four heavenly blessed spirit bones. All these elements superimposed over each other, producing the terrifying defensive power Tang San now possessed. Among equally leveled Spirit Masters, his defense could absolutely be regarded as the strongest. Perhaps one might say that, of Spirit Masters under the seventieth rank, three wasn\u2019t anyone who could compete with him in defensive power, not even the Defense Clan.</p><br/><p>When he still didn\u2019t possess Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit ring and spirit bone, he could already endure the attacks of Spirit Sages without dying, finally when his right leg broke it was due to him taking the initiative to reduce his defense, deliberately sacrificing himself to save Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head to Niu Gao with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior comes from the Clear Sky School. How could I possess a cockroach spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tai Tan saw Tang San was alright, he also loosed a long breath, laughing out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cI think like this. Two punches each, if it goes on like this, friendliness will be injured. I don\u2019t want either of you to suffer any injuries. Old rhino, you\u2019re already so old, can\u2019t you calm down a bit? It\u2019s better than being that competitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit. Can he injure me? I admit that this kid really is pretty good, your evaluation of him isn\u2019t any exaggeration. However, with his present strength it\u2019s still impossible for him to injure me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan pursed his lips,</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible? Before his second attack just now, could you imagine he\u2019d push you back three steps? Didn\u2019t you still retreat? How do you know he doesn\u2019t have some unique skill for the third blow? To let you old brat suffer a major loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao grew angrier,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what\u2019s said this old man is still a Spirit Douluo, if that happens, there\u2019s no need for me to go out in public any more. Old orangutan, you still underestimate me too much. Fine, Tang San, as long as your third punch can make me retreat further than you just did, not only can you stay, but hereafter my Defense Clan won\u2019t be your enemy any longer, the matters from those days struck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San exulted, he had finally found a way to resolve this hatred. Hastily he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao spread his feet, both hands behind his back, proudly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side, Tai Tan snickered inwardly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNiu Gao, ah, Niu Gao. For so many years, you\u2019re still so easy to rile up. Not as steady as me. Perhaps this time you really will suffer a loss. You\u2019ve separated from the Clear Sky School for too long, you\u2019ve even forgotten about the Clear Sky School\u2019s formidable ability. Tang San could make you retreat three steps just now, then, now he can just have you retreat further than he did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was an intelligent person, and absolutely wouldn\u2019t let Tai Tan down. Taking a stance five steps away from Niu Gao, he drew a deep breath, spirit power swelling all over his body. Mysterious Heaven Skill accelerating made him seem to immediately flourish with imposing manner.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao was closest to him, and naturally felt it the deepest. The spirit power Tang San released shocked him, that was spirit power over the sixtieth rank! Could it be that this youth in front of him actually already possessed strength exceeding the sixtieth rank? No, that was impossible. Absolutely impossible.</p><br/><p>However, even if he didn\u2019t believe it, the facts were already before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly raised his right arm. This time, he didn\u2019t use Deathgod Domain, his right fist slowly turning a lustrous jade color under the effect of Mysterious Heaven Skill. In order not to injure himself from the countershock of striking the opponent, he was already using Mysterious Jade Hand to the limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, what are you stalling for? Come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao shouted. This time, he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit careless. His face concerned, spirit power covered his whole body, his defensive strength reaching a peak. This was already the most powerful defense he could muster without using his spirit and spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>Tang San moved, toes pointing to the ground, using his calfs to generate force, he suddenly half turned, his right arm swinging out. Only, this punch of his didn\u2019t strike Niu Gao, but rather hit empty air.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s movements were very fast, a second punch immediately following behind the first, the imposing manner instantly superimposing over each other. Amidst the compressed spirit power, white light could already be glimpsed.</p><br/><p>Seeing this second punch, Niu Gao\u2019s expression had changed. In his mind he also finally thought of that name. Yes, this kid came from the Clear Sky SChool, how couldn\u2019t he know this ability? Only, right now he didn\u2019t use the hammer, but rather his hand, how much of its power could he display?</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, what Tang San was using was the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method. Using his fist as hammer was originally seen very rarely. Since the Clear Sky Hammer was a spirit, it could be used at any time. But even though he lost the amplification of the Clear Sky Hammer when using his fist, the efficacy of the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method didn\u2019t decrease.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s hard training under the waterfall wasn\u2019t in vain. How many years did a person have in their lives? That was at least one percent of his lifetime he had spent completely immersed in uncomplicated hammer method. Using it again now was like driving a cart on a familiar road, without the least delay.</p><br/><p>Tang San quickly rotated with his left foot as axis. Nobody had stated you couldn\u2019t store strength before the attack, just that the method Tang San used to store strength made Niu Gao\u2019s complete confidence start to show cracks.</p><br/><p>The Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method was split into several levels, the simplest was nine swings, followed by eighteen swings, thirty six swings, sixty four swings and, most powerful, eighty one swings.</p><br/><p>In a fight against ordinary Spirit Masters, it would be very difficult for this hammer method to show its effect, only when meeting abilities like Feng Xiaotian\u2019s Stormwind Demon Wolf Thirty Six Successive Chops last time could it collide.</p><br/><p>But now he had ample time to store strength. Niu Gao only prayed to himself, hoping Tang San\u2019s Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method wasn\u2019t trained higher than the sixty fourth swing level. Even if his defensive power was strong, if he truly faced the superimposed blast of those eighty one swings, he wouldn\u2019t have any certainty either. Let alone when Tang San\u2019s spirit power was so much stronger than he had anticipated.</p><br/><p>Spinning like a top, each of Tang San\u2019s punches blasted out very rhythmically. In the center of his fast rotation, his left foot never left that spot. Making Niu Gao most nervous was that the spirit power Tang San released didn\u2019t give him any pressure, but was rather completely contained within that circle of rotation.</p><br/><p>The white light gradually grew richer, wrapping up Tang San\u2019s swiftly spinning body, making people unable to see his figure. As Spirit Douluo, whether Tai Tan or Niu Gao, both could feel the constantly rising terrifying force within that white ball of light.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

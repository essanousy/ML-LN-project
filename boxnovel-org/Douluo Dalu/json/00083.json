No matter how it was described, this was still a close to five thousand year spirit beast.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong very quickly showed everyone her violent side. One hind claw still standing on the Giant Earth king\u2019s back, the other hind claw rapidly rose and fell. With a peng sound, the Giant Earth King\u2019s whole tail was stomped into the ground, the scarlet scorpion tail trembling, but no longer whipping about.</p><br/><p>In force, this thousand year spirit beast basically couldn\u2019t match Liu Erlong.</p><br/><p>Raising the front claws and smashing down simultaneously, one slamming down on top of the Giant Earth King\u2019s head, Liu Erlong roared ferociously,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you wrecking an old woman\u2019s happy occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Earth King\u2019s sharp cry stopped abruptly, of its giant body only those two claws were still above ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this old woman doesn\u2019t play until you\u2019re dead, my name isn\u2019t Liu Erlong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong, hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Completely without abilities, using only the brute force of the [email\u00a0protected] Dragon Avatar, Liu Erlong\u2019s both front claws unhesitatingly struck at the Giant Earth King\u2019s front claws, and immediately following her claws cut downwards, precisely at the joints where the Giant Earth King\u2019s claws connected to its body.</p><br/><p>With a terrifying kaka sound, the Giant Earth King\u2019s head and body shuddered violently, but Liu Erlong\u2019s strength was too great, and no matter how it struggled it didn\u2019t have any chance of escaping.</p><br/><p>With a pupu sound, the two enormous scorpion claws were torn off by Liu Erlong while the beast was still alive, and deep red blood sprayed out.</p><br/><p>However, to Liu Erlong, this was only the beginning.</p><br/><p>In front of everyone\u2019s stupefied attention, Liu Erlong\u2019s tremendous body turned, one front claw already gripping the Giant Earth King\u2019s tail stinger. In fact, this tail stinger was the Giant Earth King\u2019s most powerful weapon, not only incomparably hard, but also surprisingly hot.</p><br/><p>Only a fire attribute Spirit Master like Liu Erlong would dare directly grab it like this.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Liu Erlong leapt down from the Giant Earth King. Of course, this wasn\u2019t to let it off.</p><br/><p>Swinging her front claws, the already embedded in the ground Giant Earth King whirled up, and then again heavily smashed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>In Liu Erlong\u2019s hands, the Giant Earth King was like a broken burlap sack, continuously thrown up and smashed down again.</p><br/><p>That brutal scene made everyone\u2019s stomachs churn. Even Tang San with his calm and steady temperament wanted to ask his Teacher, \u2018She, is she really human?\u2019</p><br/><p>Right now, none of the Shrek Seven Devils dared step forward to speak to Liu Erlong, telling her that this spirit beast still had its use.</p><br/><p>After throwing it around several times and it could be seen that the Giant Earth King had completely lost any ability to fight and seemed somewhat lifeless, Liu Erlong stopped moving. Just when everyone thought the brutal scene was over, they could just hear Liu Erlong muttering to herself:</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving you wreck an old woman\u2019s happy occasion, this time I\u2019ll have you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she muttered, using her dragon claws she began to dismantle that Giant Earth King into its components. Starting with the minutely varied tailbones, afterwards the joints of the tail, in a moment, of this supposedly magnificent spirit beast only remained the head and torso, the surroundings filled with discarded remains and sprays of blood.</p><br/><p>However, this Giant Earth King\u2019s vitality was indeed unyielding, even now it still breathed.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong swung her dragon claw, throwing the Giant Earth King\u2019s body in a parabola in the air, falling heavily to the ground in front of the Shrek Seven Devils.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere, Fatty. It\u2019s yours. You\u2019re also fire attribute, it suits you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant the Giant Earth King crashed loudly onto the ground, the Shrek Seven Devils practically simultaneously retreated a step. The three girls\u2019 complexions were already pale from watching the gruesome spectacle, and if it wasn\u2019t for Grandmaster\u2019s special training before, perhaps they would already have vomited.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor-, for me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked at that terrifying scarlet dragon, probingly asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not moving? This old woman let you have what you wanted, why so much nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong\u2019s dragon eyes widened, the intimidation almost knocked Ma Hongjun to the ground, before he hastily moved, with a heart filled with mercy finally ending that pitiful Giant Earth King\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>The red light withdrew, and Liu Erlong again recovered her human form. The fiery gaze had now become completely ice cold, somewhat bitterly sweeping across Grandmaster, then without saying anything she returned to the tent to sleep.</p><br/><p>Besides Ma Hongjun who quickly sat on the ground and released his spirit to begin absorbing the spirit ring, the others stood there motionless, seemingly afraid that a single sound would infuriate Liu Erlong again.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Zhao Wuji furtively glanced at the tent behind him, saying in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to imagine, before I actually shared a tent with a humanoid tyrannosaurus rex. Flender, when you said before that your sister Erlong had a temper I didn\u2019t quite believe you, she\u2019s so pretty. But now I know, you weren\u2019t exaggerating a bit, even so much that you didn\u2019t say enough. I\u2019ve decided, I\u2019ll take the night vigil from now. Don\u2019t fight me over it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender nodded repeatedly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty\u2019s absorbing the spirit ring, as his teacher I should still watch over him. Xiao Gang, you go rest. Me and Wuji will handle things here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster extremely depressed glared at Flender. By now the burning flames in his heart had completely gone out. Glancing at the tent, he walked straight to a tree stump to the side, and sat down closing his eyes without a word.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai coughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Erlong really is my idol. Now I know what true violence is. No wonder she\u2019s called the slaughtering corner of the Golden Iron Triangle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu, Ning Rongrong and Zhu Zhuqing were unwilling to stay here another second, and swiftly returned to the tent. As for whether the scene Liu Erlong\u2019s displayed affected their sleep, only they knew.</p><br/><p>Oscar pulled Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems tonight there\u2019s no need for you to keep watch. Little San, boss Dai, let\u2019s go back to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Returning to the tent, because they were one Ma Hongjun less, Tang San had a flash of inspiration and had Dai Mubai and Oscar shift aside, leaving an empty space between him and Xiao Wu, then again lay down. However, in the minds of each of the six within the tent, the scene of the havoc wrought by the scarlet dragon played repeatedly.</p><br/><p>This was the true strength of a high level Spirit Master, a five thousand year spirit beast perished in a flash, and moreover was still dismembered by that \u2018particular\u2019 method.</p><br/><p>After an eventless night, when everyone woke from their dreams early the next morning and left the tent, Ma Hongjun was still sitting where he had been last night. Only now he had already changed considerably.</p><br/><p>The first thing to catch the eye were the four spirit rings, two yellow and two purple.</p><br/><p>Only his body that had slimmed down some because of taking that immortal treasure herb seemed to have grown a size fatter. The atmosphere around him seemed to be brimming with fiery bursts.</p><br/><p>Flender stood beside Fatty with a satisfied expression, his disciple being able to obtain his fourth spirit ring even earlier than Tang San made him extremely pleased.</p><br/><p>People will inevitably have vanity, and he was no exception.</p><br/><p>\u201cDean Flender, has Fatty still not finished?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked somewhat astonished. Generally speaking, for absorbing a spirit ring half that time was enough, but this had already taken a full night.</p><br/><p>Flender said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe absorption finished long ago, I had him continue cultivating to let the spirit ring\u2019s energy merge completely with his body. This Giant Earth King suits him precisely, it seems that this fourth spirit ring\u2019s ability of his should be pretty good. You work hard as well, quickly find a suitable spirit beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Making the three girls feel much more comfortable was that last night\u2019s Giant Earth King remains had already disappeared, clearly Flender and Zhao Wuji had cleared them away. Only the depression in the ground still reminded everyone of the purely one sided battle that took place last night.</p><br/><p>As everyone simply washed up, and after eating breakfast, Ma Hongjun woke from his cultivation.</p><br/><p>A resonant phoenix cry rose from his mouth, his chubby body leaping up, covered in flames, golden red light releasing in a flash, then vanished again, the four spirit rings quietly merging into his body. The instant his little eyes opened, a radiance flickered. His expression was lively and spirited.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone were about to ask Fatty how he felt absorbing the fourth spirit ring, and angry voice berated from within the other tent,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has nothing better to do that shouting things at first light?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the originally somewhat complacent Fatty heard this voice, his whole body shivered immediately, and without the slightest hesitation he dodged behind Flender.</p><br/><p>Flender frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what are you hiding from. Don\u2019t tell me you really thing teacher Erlong would hit you? You must understand that she\u2019s after all no longer young, her hormones are somewhat out of tune. Her character is mostly as usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlender, do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Flender spoke very quietly, Liu Erlong\u2019s hearing was even better.</p><br/><p>A messily dressed humanoid tyrannosaurus rex burst out from the tent.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong\u2019s eyes were somewhat red, clearly she hadn\u2019t slept well last night. In the beginning she had still hoped Grandmaster would enter the tent and continue what they were doing before, but as she waited and waited, with no sign of Grandmaster, Liu Erlong\u2019s mood was as one might expect.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 Erlong, I wasn\u2019t talking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time Flender didn\u2019t wish to provoke her, and simultaneously sighed inwardly, somewhat pleadingly looking at the apathetic Grandmaster, eating breakfast to the side.</p><br/><p>Erlong, enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster finally spoke up.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong stopped her charge at Flender, turning her head to look at Grandmaster, her delicate body trembled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even less good, even bullying me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, she turned sharply and dashed back into the tent, leaving a string of sparkling drops in the air.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster painfully closed his eyes, and even though he didn\u2019t say anything, the steamed bun in his hand had already been squeezed into paste.</p><br/><p>After an hour the packing was done and the party set out once again, only the mood had clearly become a lot more delicate.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong gloomily walked behind the group, while Grandmaster, Flender and Zhao Wuji took the front, against expectations letting the Shrek Seven Devils walk in the center.</p><br/><p>Oscar bumped Ma Hongjun,</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, dealing with the fourth spirit ring, how does it feel? Easily absorbed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cVery easy, it was settled in just an hour. It didn\u2019t even bring me any trouble. Really strange. Don\u2019t tell me, did that Giant Earth King already give up its wish to live under teacher Erlong\u2019s tyranny and believed I helped liberate it, letting me absorb it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn some sense, such circumstances can occur. In Teacher\u2019s research, if a spirit beast doesn\u2019t have any deep resentment when it\u2019s killed, then absorbing it will be a bit easier, relatively speaking. Vice versa, if the spirit beast carries extremely deep resentment, then absorbing the spirit ring will become severely challenging. Last time when I absorbed the Man Faced Demon Spider\u2019s spirit ring was under such circumstances. But, Teacher also said, absorbing the spirit ring after the spirit beast died under these two kinds of circumstances will have benefits to the Spirit Master. One kind is when the spirit beast is brimming with extreme resentment, under such circumstances the chance of a spirit bone dropping is substantially increased. The other kind of circumstances is when the spirit beast dies voluntarily, voluntarily letting itself become a Spirit Master\u2019s spirit ring, there\u2019s practically a one hundred percent chance of a spirit bone dropping, and moreover the spirit ring will be perfectly absorbed, not suffering the restrictions of age limit. In other words, even if we\u2019re now only fortieth rank, if a ten thousand year spirit beast wanted to let us kill it and absorb its spirit ring, we still wouldn\u2019t suffer any backlash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar and Ma Hongjun spoke in unison.</p><br/><p>To the side Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood how? You think it\u2019s easy! Why would a spirit beast wish to let you kill it, wish to give you its spirit ring? This is only an ideal situation, one might say it\u2019s basically impossible for it to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu rocked the \u2018Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019 in her hands, calmly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing is impossible. With a destined coincidence, perhaps it will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty somewhat disappointed said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell me, was this spirit ring I absorbed the first kind, or the second kind of circumstances?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that Giant Earth King had been killed by senior Erlong, perhaps it would be the first kind of circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to him, everyone couldn\u2019t keep from shivering, recalling Liu Erlong\u2019s berserk attack yesterday. Each person were somewhat shaking in fear at the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>Tang San continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s equally a large problem with the first kind of circumstances, in order to have the spirit beast\u2019s resentment reach such an extreme, it requires fighting it yourself. You can\u2019t use others, or the spirit beasts resentment will be scattered. But, in ordinary circumstances, the strength of the spirit beast a Spirit Master wants to hunt would be a bit stronger than himself. Something as difficult to accomplish as the one sided pattern like teacher Erlong yesterday would naturally be impossible to achieve. And although teacher Erlong could oppress the Giant Earth King like yesterday, since the strength difference between it and teacher Erlong was too great, even if teacher Erlong needed another spirit ring right now, she definitely wouldn\u2019t choose it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar thought deeply and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder spirit bones are so rare. These circumstances are too extreme. Oh, right, Fatty, what\u2019s your fourth spirit ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty had a secretive expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cWait until there\u2019s a chance to use it, and I\u2019ll let you see. But it really seems very good! It\u2019s a pity the attack range is a bit small. Moreover there\u2019s no way to lock down the opponent again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The morning air temperature in the Sunset Forest was low and the air was extremely humid, forming a morning mist.</p><br/><p>The fog was extremely cold, and along with a fluttering breeze, right now when the sun still hadn\u2019t risen, the fog was very dense.</p><br/><p>Tang San pulled out a small porcelain bottle from Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges and dumped out some small black pills from inside, handing out one for each person, including Flender, Grandmaster and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender looked at that only rice grain sized pill, puzzled asking Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a miasma pill I made myself. In the woods and deep mountains, miasma will frequently appear. The miasma air is incomparably poisonous, and eating this pill you can at least avert the majority of the misma attack. It also has an invigorating effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender said with sudden understanding:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what that old freak Dugu Bo taught you. It seems you indeed learned a lot of things from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled faintly, not explaining. With the cover of his half year together with Dugu Bo, the medicines he used wouldn\u2019t provoke anyone\u2019s doubts. It would be even less likely someone would associate this with his innate gifts.</p><br/><p>The morning mist grew denser and denser, and although the morning cold didn\u2019t influence a group of generally over fortieth rank Spirit Masters like them, the visibility grew worse and worse.</p><br/><p>Flender cautiously said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone be careful, some spirit beasts are especially fond of moving in the early morning. With the visibility so poor right now, gather a bit closer just in case there are any surprises.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong quickly took a few steps forward, reaching Flender\u2019s side and patting Zhao Wuji\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go in the back. We\u2019ll change places.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Liu Erlong seemed to have recovered her calm, Zhao Wuji didn\u2019t dare say anything against her and hastily changes positions with her.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong glanced at Grandmaster, standing on his other side and protecting him from both sides along with Flender. Even though this process was very simple, nobody would miss that Liu Erlong was afraid the weakest Grandmaster would meet any danger in the mist, and wanted to personally protect him.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster naturally also understood Liu Erlong\u2019s intention, and secretly sighed, but didn\u2019t have anything to say, still silently moving forward.</p><br/><p>Before they had moved forward three hundred meters, suddenly, a strange wind blew from the front, unexpectedly causing a change in color in the morning fog. The originally dense white mist instantly became pink, directly shrouding everyone within. That pink fog held a faint sweetness, giving people a kind of addictive sensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone careful, the mist\u2019s poisonous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender shouted loudly, simultaneously as Liu Erlong making a palm strike forward, relying on their profound spirit power to scatter the poison fog in front. At the same time he also couldn\u2019t keep from inwardly sighing in admiration over Tang San\u2019s previous foresight. This seemed to be the miasma he spoke of.</p><br/><p>However, everyone quickly felt something was amiss, this suddenly appearing poison fog was even thicker than they had imagined, and even though Flender and Liu Erlong\u2019s spirit power could scatter it, it condensed again very quickly, and in just a few eyeblinks their surroundings were already pink. Most shocking to the Shrek Academy party was that within that pink fog their visibility dropped to its lowest point, and it was difficult to even see the people next to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t miasma. Little Ao, detoxifying small sausages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San suddenly shouted, and immediately afterward a purple golden light was emitted from his eyes. The others might not see clearly in the thick fog, but the influence on his mustard seed stage Purple Demon Eye was a lot less, and he could vaguely see the surrounding scenery.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, it\u2019s spirit beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San called aloud once again. Stretching out his right hand, he pulled in Xiao Wu\u2019s hand, simultaneously swiftly releasing his Blue Silver Grass spirit, spreading it out in all directions, creating an early warning system around everything within several dozen square meters.</p><br/><p>Stretching a hand into the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, he pulled out a large, faintly pink flower. The flower was leafless, its stalk three chi[1] long, with an enormous flower with a diameter over one chi. Each petal was sparkling and translucent like crystal, the stamen was faintly purple as if it was a purple diamond inlaid there. A touching fragrance wafted out from the flower, penetrating the heart.</p><br/><p>After Tang San drew out this flower, a bizarre scene immediately appeared. With Tang San at its heart, within a ten meter diameter that pink fog seemed to instantly melt away like snow meeting boiling water, forming a faintly purple stream of air that swiftly scattered into the surroundings, allowing the Shrek Academy group to again see their companions.</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody leave this circle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s left hand carefully held that large flower, calmly observing the thick pink fog in front. Everyone clearly saw that right now there was an incorporeal faintly purple air around them, and no matter how thick that pink fog was, or how the wind in the forest blew, that pinkness was unable to get into the ten meter range around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my hand is an Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, it has the effect of neutralizing ten thousand poisons, and within its range any poison will lose its effect. For the moment don\u2019t leave this range, this thick fog seems to be caused by spirit beasts, and it\u2019s not just one. We\u2019re surrounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Grandmaster knew the capability of Tang San\u2019s eyes and immediately questioned closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, can you see the appearances of those spirit beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>With his experience, as long as Tang San could describe the spirit beasts, he could determine what kind they had encountered, and dealing with them would naturally become a lot easier.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Urging his Mysterious Heaven Skill, Tang San congregated it at his eyes, purple golden light suddenly flashing out of them in chi[2] long rays of light in the direction he was looking.</p><br/><p>The immortal treasure herb \u2018Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew\u2019 changed Tang San\u2019s Purple Demon Eye, not only could he see more clearly, but also more penetratingly.</p><br/><p>Even to the extent that it could be used as a mental attack.</p><br/><p>Right now, with Tang San using his full strength, his gaze cut through the layers of fog, gradually seeing clearly the spirit beasts around them.</p><br/><p>As he saw these spirit beasts, he couldn\u2019t help drawing a deep breath. These spirit beasts own strength wasn\u2019t so scary, what was scary was that their numbers really were too high.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s \u2018Pink Maiden\u2019 spirit beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked distracted,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make a mistake? Even though the Pink Maidens have poison, even at the ten thousand year level they still can\u2019t produce a poisonous fog over such a large area to attack us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression was serious:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m certain. Moreover I also know why there would be such a dense poison fog. Because, there are no less than one thousand Pink Maidens out there. Even though for the most part they\u2019re only on the hundred year level, such an amount of Pink Maidens can rely on the morning mist to release poison to such a degree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A thousand? Is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a shocked light in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes, and his stiff face immediately grew serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What \u2018Pink Maidens\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong couldn\u2019t keep from asking.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said in a heavy voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cPink Maidens are a kind of spirit beast. It\u2019s shape is similar to a scorpion, but compared to the Giant Earth King it\u2019s considerably inferior. It\u2019s a flock spirit beast. It\u2019s nature is comparatively mild. Because its body appears to be pink and translucent, its profile dazzling, it\u2019s given the name \u2018Pink Maiden\u2019. Generally speaking, it will very rarely take the initiative to attack humans, and seems to only keep away from Spirit Masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach group of Pink Maidens only number around a few tens to a hundred, with the most powerful one as leader. In order to keep other members from surpassing it, if there is a member that evolves faster, the most formidable one will kill it. This leads to this kind of spirit beast very rarely resulting in ten thousand year level existences. Even to the extent that thousand year levels are very few.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender frowned:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the attack capability of such spirit beasts? Only poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but their poison also isn\u2019t very strong. The Man Faced Demon Spider that Tang San killed is their natural predator. One Man Faced Demon Spider can even easily kill a group of a hundred Pink Maidens. Among all spirit beasts that attack with poison, they\u2019re still considered pretty inferior. Their poison is very particular, a kind of stimulating poison. Breathing in a little bit wouldn\u2019t be harmful, and would instead cause the victim to become excited. But if too much is inhaled, and gradually causes excitement, once the stimulation reaches a certain degree it will overdraw one\u2019s vitality, until death. Precisely because its body is weak, it\u2019s also extremely difficult for them to evolve, and they become food for a lot of high level spirit beasts. If it\u2019s like little San says, and we\u2019ve now encountered a thousand member Pink Maiden community, then I can say with certainty that within this community there must have appeared a \u2018Pink Queen\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Pink Queen is a variant Pink Maiden. It\u2019s also the most powerful Pink Maiden, and in order for this mutation to occur it will first require at least three thousand years of cultivation, next it requires eating at least a hundred of its own clansmen. Once such a Pink Queen emerges, it will gather its kin on a large scale, using them as food. Because her strength is much more powerful than ordinary Pink Maidens, as a result, even if there is the risk of being eaten, the majority of Pink Maidens will still obey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA single Pink Maiden is even unable to harm a tenth rank or so Spirit Master, but the poison secreted by a Pink Queen is enough to stimulate a fiftieth rank Spirit Master to death. This kind of peculiar poison can\u2019t be guarded against, it will even invade the body through the skin. The poison fog released by these thousand Pink Maidens is in order to poison us to death here. But I don\u2019t understand why a mild tempered Pink Maiden would show such hostility towards us. It\u2019s as if they ambushed us here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Grandmaster talked about the characteristics of the Pink Maiden, Tang San silently reflected by his side. Now hearing Grandmaster say this, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, wouldn\u2019t you say it\u2019s because of that Giant Earth King last night? The Giant Earth King is the same as the Pink Maiden, they\u2019re both scorpion shaped spirit beasts, perhaps it would be related to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flickered in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Don\u2019t tell me, this community\u2019s Pink Queen unexpectedly was the mate of that Giant Earth King? This is very possible. The intelligence of spirit beasts will grow along with their age, even if it\u2019s a Pink Queen, among spirit beasts it\u2019s still considered fairly weak. And the Giant Earth King is nevertheless a similar kind of creature, the Giant Earth King\u2019s Magma Earth Rending Strike even has a certain restraining effect on the Man Faced Demon Spider. If one said the Pink Queen committed herself as the price for its protection, the theory holds water. That Giant Earth King\u2019s strength should be considered pretty good in this Sunset Forest. Further adding this enormous Pink Maiden community, it\u2019s sufficient to control a corner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender looked at Liu Erlong at his side, unable to keep from laughing:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bullied the husband, so now the family\u2019s come for revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold light flashed in Liu Erlong\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cRevenge? Fine! Then I\u2019ll keep killing, making them a pair of mandarin ducks[3].\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster firmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe poison fog aggregated by more than a thousand Pink Maidens is no small matter, we absolutely can\u2019t be careless. Just now we were all affected by a bit of the poison, and were it not for little San having this bizarre anti poison flower, it would be hard to say what would have happened. Right now there are several ways to settle the issue. One is to rely on this flower\u2019s poison resisting properties to break through, an even more dependable method is to rely on Flender\u2019s flying ability to shift us one by one out of this area, as long as we get out of the affected region it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But that also confronts us with the danger of ambush by other kinds of spirit beasts. Little San, you have a comparatively better understanding of poison, what\u2019s your proposal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cPink Maidens after all lack attack power, with our strength it\u2019s still preferable to break through. As long as we keep a close formation it\u2019s possible. Best would be if that Pink Queen couldn\u2019t keep from coming out to attack, as long as we could dispatch her, the headless spirit beast group would naturally disperse. As long as everyone stays within a ten meter diameter from me, the poison wouldn\u2019t take effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then it\u2019s settled. Let\u2019s not delay, little San, since you can see the surrounding circumstances, we\u2019ll follow your directions. Wuji take up the rear, Erlong and Grandmaster, we\u2019re in front. Mubai, all of you coordinate in the center, make sure to protect little San, little Ao and Rongrong. Especially this Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure little San holds.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an accurate analysis of the situation, naturally there was less bewilderment. Everyone\u2019s battle lust ignited, even Grandmaster, each person released their spirit.</p><br/><p>As a result of obtaining a third Spirit Ring, Grandmaster\u2019s spirit Luo San Pao\u2019s body had changed somewhat, not only growing a size larger than before, but also gaining some golden color in its deep purple fur. Looking at his appearance, if Grandmaster really could obtain nine spirit rings, maybe it would really be capable of evolving into a Golden Saint Dragon.</p><br/><p>Under Tang San\u2019s directions, using the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure\u2019s poison resistance, everyone advanced cautiously.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster and Tang San\u2019s judgement was exceptionally correct. This group of Pink Maidens leader was precisely a Pink Queen, and it was also the mate of last night\u2019s unfortunate Giant Earth King.</p><br/><p>Spirit beasts had methods of communicating between each other, and the Giant Earth King naturally released a kind of scent when it died, informing the Pink Queen. Further adding the existence of the Giant Earth King\u2019s aura on Ma Hongjun, naturally the family would come calling.</p><br/><p>The area the Pink Maidens surrounded wasn\u2019t too large, but Tang San very quickly found something wrong.</p><br/><p>Along with their movements, the entire encirclement also moved.</p><br/><p>Right now, even though the morning mist had already gradually dissipated in the sunlight, their surroundings were still concealed by a pink poison gas, only appearing a bit thinner than before.</p><br/><p>Pausing, Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do. These Pink Maidens are also moving. My line of sight is unclear, and within the forest our speed is also limited. If this continues, we can only continue within their encirclement. Even though we have the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, we still can\u2019t continue this way. Little Ao, prepare mushroom sausages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar looked inquiringly at Flender, and Flender used his hand to point to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San directs.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Oscar\u2019s spirit power progressed, when consuming his entire spirit power he could produce twelve flying mushroom sausages, just enough to satisfy everyone\u2019s requirements.</p><br/><p>Even though the effect would reduce by half when he himself used these flying mushroom sausages, but he could prepare two (Flender had his own flying spirit, and didn\u2019t need a mushroom sausage), he could still fly for one minute like everyone else.</p><br/><p>[1] 3 = 1m</p><br/><p>[2] It\u2019s two rays that are \u2153 m long.</p><br/><p>[3] Mandarin ducks in pairs (or any animals in pairs) is a common symbol of love.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But to Tang San it was basically nothing. Even if all his energy channels burst, as long as he had one breath left, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t die. Among all Tang San\u2019s spirit rings and spirit bones, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone was the only one without attack power. But it was still a hundred thousand year level.</p><br/><p>The flight ability really was amazing to lower ranked spirit masters, but with Tang San\u2019s present cultivation, he could fly even without using spirit bone abilities by coordinating his spirit power. Just like what he saw Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi do.</p><br/><p>Therefore, flying wasn\u2019t the most valuable ability of the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone. Its strength was practically all on Wildfire Burns Unending, Spring Wind Blows Life Again.</p><br/><p>If there was any doubt, then the fact that even shattered limbs could be restored showed how powerful it was. As long as Tang San still drew breath, he practically couldn\u2019t die. Only the recovery speed would be different based on the severity of the injuries.</p><br/><p>Just like now, when Tang San\u2019s energy channels ruptured in battle, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone\u2019s energy instantly intervened, controlling the damaged channels and directly sealing the damaged cross sections, keeping him from bleeding all over. The blood Tang San spit out was all from the moment the violent shock just damaged his energy channels. Otherwise, with the degree of damage caused by using Great Sumeru Hammer, he would already be done for.</p><br/><p>And after he left the battle, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone\u2019s energy would first condense the shape of the energy channels within his body, connecting each fractured channel to form the normal connections, making his blood circulate once again. Then through this power, it would pull the fractured veins and gradually heal them. This was also an important reason why Tang San\u2019s spirit power could recover so quickly.</p><br/><p>Right now, Tang San was completely quiet. The instant he was soaked into the beauty of cultivating, his entire body entered a perfect cultivation state. Profoundly sensing the recovery process of each damaged vein. As a power, the first one had to do was familiarize oneself with one\u2019s body. If one couldn\u2019t promptly grasp one\u2019s state after each time one\u2019s attributes changed, it was impossible to use one\u2019s condition well in battle. Especially someone who possessed a tyrannical yet dangerous ability like Tang San\u2019s Great Sumeru Hammer. He had to grasp the limits of his body even better so he wouldn\u2019t break them in the middle of combat, so preserving his life.</p><br/><p>Completely soaked in cultivation, his body was recovering at its fastest. In this battle with Qian Renxue, Tang San could be said to have exhausted his ingenuity. He\u2019d never been as exhausted as now. Even though he had faced a lot of powers stronger than him in the past, the gap had never been as wide as this time. Don\u2019t be fooled by the apparent five rank gap with Qian Renxue. Just like Qian Renxue said, their difference was that between man and god. If not for Tang San exploiting all kinds of circumstances to force Qian Renxue not to use her divine weapon, even if she didn\u2019t start with her full strength, he wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of survival.</p><br/><p>That he could finally win the bet with Qian Renxue was even more due to his Seagod Trident. The mental efforts far exceeded that of his physical strength. Especially that last strike, using Guanyin\u2019s Tear for the first time, practically drew out all the hidden potential he had. It seriously hurt Qian Renxue, but he himself was also a lamp at the end of its wick. Fortunately he had the support of Oscar\u2019s big recovery sausage, and could so leave the Star Dou Great Forest.</p><br/><p>The reason Tang San insisted on leaving the range of Qian Renxue\u2019s divine senses before string to cultivate wasn\u2019t because he wanted to hide the direction he left in, but rather in order not to let Qian Renxue see the state of his body. If he cultivated inside the Star Dou Great Forest, he\u2019d be caught by Qian Renxue\u2019s divine senses. Then she could roughly assess Tang San\u2019s injuries through his cultivation and recovery time, as well as how far he could escape after recovering.</p><br/><p>In order to win the bet with Qian Renxue, Tang San had already exhausted the cards in his hand. Qian Renxue already understood his strength extremely well. The only thing worth being happy over was that his spirit power level rose, making his spirit power superior to before, giving him an advantage in Qian Renxue\u2019s pursuit. Three days wasn\u2019t a short time to powers, but three days was far too short for Tang San right now. He could be certain that, no matter how he left, Qian Renxue had a chance of catching up to him. Only the time it took was in question. Therefore, the game had already begun the moment Tang San left Qian Renxue\u2019s divine sense range and started to cultivate.</p><br/><p>Using a full sixteen hours, Tang San\u2019s veins were completely recovered. Just as he expected, he really had advanced in rank. After his channels were completely restored, rank ninety six spirit power immediately showed its effect. With each cycle of Mysterious Heaven Skill, the spirit power recovery speed was at least thirty percent higher than before. In a few cycles, his spirit power was already sixty percent recovered. Sixty percent spirit power was enough to let Tang San fly at full speed. As for the remaining spirit power, he could recover it while flying.</p><br/><p>It was a few hours faster than he had expected. Tang San knew that his chance of surviving Qian Renxue\u2019s pursuit was a bit bigger. This was inextricably linked to his ability to calm down and wholeheartedly cultivate before.</p><br/><p>Taking to the air once again and clearly identifying the direction, Tang San advanced with full strength, leaving behind a line of afterimages as he flew straight for the seashore. With his spirit power increasing, even his flight speed had increased somewhat.</p><br/><p>Tang San maintained his highest flight speed practically the whole time. In order to be able to be able to use his full speed, he flew at almost a kilometers distance from the ground. At this height there were very few birds, and nothing to disturb him. Moreover, at a kilometers altitude, he was difficult to spot from the ground, let alone when he flew so incredibly fast.</p><br/><p>Tang San stopped to rest a while every twelve hours. In full flight speed mode, not only was his spirit power consumed, but also his mental state. Of course, if Tang San wished, he was perfectly capable of maintaining such flight speed for three days. However, he also knew that if he did, it would be impossible to maintain his peak condition. If Qian Renxue caught up, he would instead be in even more danger. But by resting every twelve hours, he could maintain peak condition the whole time, ready to react at all times.</p><br/><p>After flying for more than two days, the agreed upon time with Qian Renxue was almost up, but with his all full flight speed, he was coming closer and closer to the ocean, he could already smell the refreshing scent in the air.</p><br/><p>He had released the Vast Sea Barrier around him twelve hours ago, placing him in a stealth mode. This was of course to isolate him from Qian Renxue\u2019s divine sense search. Tang San knew that if Qian Renxue\u2019s divine sense really caught up to him, he would have nowhere to hide, unless there was a woodland the size of the Star Dou Great Forest, which would give him a fifty percent chance. But very clearly, on the entire Douluo Continent, there were very few areas that could compare. Even more, he wouldn\u2019t be safe even so. When Qian Renxue searched for him before, she hadn\u2019t used any divine tool. Who knew how far she could reach after she did? Therefore, Tang San only used the Vast Sea Barrier to simply hide his body, while still flying quickly. What Tang San hoped for the most right now was that Qian Renxue searched in as wrong a direction as possible, or that her god level strength speed was limited to some extent, unable to catch up to him quickly. By the present circumstances, in at most six hours, he could reach the seashore. As long as he was there, entering the range of the ocean, it wouldn\u2019t matter how powerful Qian Renxue\u2019s divine senses were.</p><br/><p>As the Seagod\u2019s successor, if he could still be targeted by the enemy in the ocean, there was no point to Tang San muddling along. The ocean was like blue silver grass, only much, much larger than the Star Dou Great Forest. The Seagod\u2019s power was enough to become Tang San\u2019s best concealment.</p><br/><p>Time passed second by second. Tang San was fully immersed in the tense situation. His right hand tightly gripped the Seagod Trident, letting him maintain top flight speed.</p><br/><p>The weather was especially sunny and cloudless today, and the visibility high in the air was especially clear, especially with Tang San\u2019s Purple Demon Eye ability. Four hours passed, and he could already see the rough shape of the ocean in the distance, even better sensing the humidity reaching the sky.</p><br/><p>A bit faster, and a bit faster, even with his calm, at this moment he couldn\u2019t help his heart beating faster. He was going to make it, in less than two hours, he could absolutely reach the shore.</p><br/><p>It was already four hours past the agreed upon time, and Qian Renxue still hadn\u2019t caught up. Very clearly, even as a god, her speed was still limited, and couldn\u2019t instantly teleport anywhere in the continent. It seemed he really would escape her pursuit. Qian Renxue, once I become Seagod, I will definitely repay you for my humiliation this time.</p><br/><p>Only, Tang San was clearly happy a bit too early. A quarter of an hour later, when he was one step closer to the ocean, suddenly he felt the hairs all over his body tighten, and especially his soul had a shivering feeling. Inwardly cursing, he turned his head to look back without slowing his flight. His heart instantly sank to the ground.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t tell how far away, but a very small golden speck of light was just quickly approaching. In just moments that golden speck of light had doubled in size, clearly showing how terrifyingly fast she moved. Besides Qian Renxue, who else could reach such speed?</p><br/><p>Tang San secretly sighed. What he feared the most had occurred. He understood that even if Qian Renxue was a god, she couldn\u2019t possibly guess which direction he was heading in, but she still caught up. That only proved one thing, she had definitely left some kind of mark on him. Relying on her divine senses, she could then accurately determine the direction he left in. And this mark was something he couldn\u2019t discover.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Tang San could also sense just what kind of determination the constantly approaching speck of light possessed. This time, Qian Renxue was determined to completely annihilate him. It was already impossible to exploit that contradictory attitude she had towards him. Moreover, this time she was also clearly much stronger than before. It seemed he was going to face the God of Angels wearing the Anglic Raiment!</p><br/><p>Only an hour remaining, with the destination before him, and he was caught by a life and death crisis. That definitely didn\u2019t feel good.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue\u2019s figure was already within his line of sight. Within less than a few minutes, she would catch up. What to do?</p><br/><p>Cold light flashed in Tang San\u2019s eyes. Clapping the flat of the Seagod Trident\u2019s main blade against his forehead, he used the ice cold sensation to calm down a bit. Clenching his teeth, looking down, he flew straight for the ground.</p><br/><p>The God of Angels could be called the ruler of the skies. Back when Tang San\u2019s great grandfather Tang Chen was equally famous to Qian Daoliu, Tang Chen was peerless on the ground, and Qian Douliu peerless in the sky, with Bo Saixi peerless in the ocean. Very clearly, contending with Qian Renxue in the air was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Tang San picked fighting on the ground as most suitable to him, charging towards the ground at top speed. Right now, below him was a wide expanse of hills, and past this were two mountains, and then you could reach the sea.</p><br/><p>While flying downwards, Tang San simultaneously raised the Seagod Trident in his hand. Like a greeting to Qian Renxue, a line of Seagod\u2019s Light shot into the Seagod\u2019s Heart, the trident instantly exploding with intense golden light that shot towards the sky. At the same time, he flew into the hills, the Eight Spider Lances shoot out from his back, leaping like a shooting star and quickly advancing.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue naturally saw the Seagod Trident\u2019s light, a cold smile rising at the corners of her lips. She sped up once again, the six wings on her back spreading out simultaneously, then instantly beat back. The God of Angels\u2019 golden light seemed to cut through space, and in practically just a few breaths, Qian Renxue had already arrived above Tang San.</p><br/><p>Surging golden light fell from the sky, like the sun shining on the earth. No matter how fast Tang San was, it was still impossible to outrun the light. That intense golden light instantly enveloped the entire space. Golden light heaved, the Angelic Domain.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue\u2019s Angelic Domain was at least twice as strong as before, that terrifying glue-like golden light seemed tangible. Being directly enveloped by it, this time Tang San didn\u2019t stand any chance. Even ring explosion plus the final strike of Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method couldn\u2019t cut open this god level domain.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue was completely different from her last time facing Tang San. She didn\u2019t have that graceful and noble palace dress, and in its place was the Angelic Raiment formed from six evolved spirit bones, Sacred Angelic Armor.</p><br/><p>The dazzlingly beautiful golden armor seemed perfectly tailor made for her, swelling chest armor, and narrow at the waist, a golden battle skirt, perfectly round shoulder armor, as well as other perfectly proportioned armor pieces enveloped her completely. That small angel brand on her forehead was behind a circle on her forehead, and within that circle was a small glittering angel shaped gem. Altogether seven crested circles were on top, forming a head ornament like a princess crown.</p><br/><p>Feather shaped decorative designs extended to every part of the armor, and the six wings on her back had turned completely glittering and transparent gold. With a soft wave, circular golden ripples constantly spread out with Qian Renxue as center. The guard of the completely golden Sword of Angels in her hand unfolded like a pair of angel\u2019s wings. Enormous golden flames covered every part of her.</p><br/><p>Without question, this Qian Renxue was the true God of Angels. That enormous golden light descending from the sky was released by that small angel shaped golden gem at the center of the circle on her forehead.</p><br/><p>In practically just a flash of gold, Tang San had become frozen, his speed forward coming to a sudden halt. With the Eight Spider Lances released he was like a spider trapped in an enormous web, even taking a single step was a struggle.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue laughed coldly. Even floating there, her voice spread out in all directions, just like the Sanskrit i once heard in his precious life, awing heart and soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, how does it feel to be caught on the verge of escape? Isn\u2019t it very hopeless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue\u2019s eyes had already lost that thirst to subdue Tang San, they only held ice cold killing intent. If she wasn\u2019t already a god, she would have died to Tang San\u2019s Guanyin\u2019s Tear. She had never thought that her god level form was unable to respond to that attack. Rebuilding the heart definitely wasn\u2019t a simple task even for a god. The suffering involved wasn\u2019t any less than accepting the angel\u2019s inheritance. After all, angels weren\u2019t widely known for their recovery ability. She could only rely on her enormous divine power to reconstruct the heart. She suffered through this process for a full three days, and she had also used the pain she experienced to raise her killing intent to an unprecedented level. Go all out, kill Tang San.</p><br/><p>Just like Tang San anticipated, when Qian Renxue fought him in Star Dou Great Forest, she had left a divine sense imprint on him. This was the divine sense of the God of Angels, even though it wouldn\u2019t cause any harm to Tang San, as long as he was still on this planet, on this continent, no matter where he was, Qian Renxue could rely on her divine sense to find him.</p><br/><p>Gods were gods. Rank ninety six Tang San ran as hard as he could for two and a half days, but Qian Renxue only used four hours to catch up. This also included the time to restore her spent divine power after restoring her heart. The time spent on actual pursuit was only two hours. It really was a thousand li in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly unpleasant. Qian Renxue, you\u2019re even more valiant and formidable-looking in that armor, it must be your divine tool as the God of Angels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San raised his head to look to the sky. Even though it was still golden light covering him, this time it was transparent, allowing him to see Qian Renxue in the sky. But that powerful Angelic Domain had already started to devour his spirit power.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue said coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is the armor of the God of Angels. With your strength you should be able to tell just how enormous the gap is between us right now. Even if your strength has increased again, it\u2019s still impossible to fight me. You\u2019re already very close to your goal, but unfortunately, you won\u2019t have another chance. Since you are the Seagod\u2019s successor, how could I let you into the sea? Die.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had no plans to speak further to Tang San, because Qian Renxue feared her killing intent would waver. The Sword of Angels in her hand slowly rose, the winged guard releasing multicolored light everywhere. Instantly, countless motes of golden light could be seen condensing on the sword.</p><br/><p>A strange scene appeared. Besides where Qian Renxue was, the surrounding rays of light dimmed, the light of the sun actually being controlled, shining only on that angelic sword. The terrifying power of the sun instantly rose, giving Qian Renxue\u2019s entire body a dizzying golden brilliance. Once could imagine just how terrifying the thunderclap strike of this God of Angels was when drawing on the divine power of the sun to attack.</p><br/><p>Tang San naturally wouldn\u2019t tie his hands and wait for death. He of course understood that this attack absolutely wasn\u2019t something he could endure. Black light rushed out, and the Clear Sky Hammer appeared in his left hand. The eight spirit rings had already completely recovered, and the first spirit ring brightened in practically the same moment Qian Renxue raised the Sword of Angels. At the same moment, a circle of gaudy golden light also spilled out from the Seagod Trident he held.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue was different from three days ago, but Tang San was also different. Even if it was impossible for him to bring out true god level strength like Qian Renxue did with the Angelic Raiment, don\u2019t forget that he also had the Seagod\u2019s weapon united with his mind, the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>The ripples of the Seagod Trident spread out in an instant, and while briefly, it clearly pushed away the Angelic Domain a little. And Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer swung at this moment. Not towards Qian Renxue in the sky, but rather towards the ground beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>When the first spirit ring\u2019s spirit ability was released, that pitch black Clear Sky Hammer quietly entered the ground. The next moment, Tang San\u2019s body suddenly disappeared. Disappeared the instant the Sacred Angelic Sword chopped down with the condensed divine power of the sun.</p><br/><p>The pure golden blade seemed about to plow open the earth. The split second that pure golden light collided with the ground, there was no sound, but an enormous hole was still cut open in the ground. The air twisted, immeasurable silt and rocks melting under the divine power of the sun. This attack was a true god\u2019s strike, called Sacred Sun Sword. It was an ability specific to the God of Angels. It was powerful, with surpassing explosive force.</p><br/><p>The six winged God of Angels relied mainly on the divine attribute, with flame as support. Under the effect of Qian Renxue\u2019s Sacred Angelic Sword right now, the two great attributes erupted fully through the divine power of the sun. This slash cut fully into the ground, in a five hundred meter range. An incomparably enormous pit appeared in the ground after the pure golden light passed. Moreover, that pit was still constantly expanding, because it was completely rendered pure gold, constantly melting further.</p><br/><p>The instant the Sacred Sun Sword fell on the ground, Qian Renxue revealed a somewhat sorrowful expression. It seemed impossible to her for Tang San to escape this attack again. After all, this was the only man she had ever liked! The result was that he still died by her hand. That bitterness constantly gnawed on her heart. She knew that her decision was correct, Tang San had long since become the greatest weakness in her heart. Now that she had killed him with her own hands, this weakness had grown immense. Absolutely nobody could be allowed to learn about this.</p><br/><p>Only, the pain and sadness on her face didn\u2019t stay for long. Looking at the incomparably enormous pit in the ground melting wider, her expression suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>The moment the Sacred Sun Sword hit, even her divine senses were curbed in order to avoid being affected by that terrifying true sun fire. But now that the Sacred Sun Sword\u2019s power was spreading, after her divine senses automatically spilled out, she discovered that presence of the divine sense lock hadn\u2019t disappeared along with the attack, but was just now moving towards the ocean with remarkable speed.</p><br/><p>How was it possible? This was Qian Renxue\u2019s first thought. The next moment she flew out. Attentively watching a remote patch of land, the corners of her mouth revealed a relieved smile. This moment she actually had a somewhat refreshing feeling, even forgetting the pain of her shattered heart.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t die, his presence didn\u2019t disappear, still running, he wasn\u2019t dead. Only, Qian Renxue also very quickly grew alert, the smile on her face disappearing somewhat awkwardly. She\u2019d obviously come here to kill him, so why was she so happy he didn\u2019t die? Through dithering on the border of life and death this time, it seemed like his place in her heart had come one step closer. Qian Renxue frowned, she knew that if it went on like this, if Tang San didn\u2019t die, her heart might fall first.</p><br/><p>She suddenly accelerated, dashing forward. Tang San, you really are capable, you could even think of a method like this. You\u2019re the one who could do it.</p><br/><p>How did Tang San escape the Sacred Sun Sword strike? It seemed impossible, but it was really quite simple. He only used one spirit ability to bring him out of range.</p><br/><p>Tang San was never one to waste time. In these two days of flight, his thoughts had never stopped. He definitely wouldn\u2019t just hope that Qian Renxue wouldn\u2019t catch up to him by luck, binding the bamboo before it rains was what a wise man did. Therefore, he was always thinking about how he could respond to Qian Renxue\u2019s pursuit after she was restored to her full state. Among this, he thought of one method.</p><br/><p>It was clearly impossible to escape Qian Renxue by flying. She was the God of Angels. Since flying wouldn\u2019t do, then he\u2019d go to ground.</p><br/><p>Among Tang San\u2019s two spirits and seventeen spirit rings, only one spirit ring was related to the earth, but this one spirit ring was already enough for him. That was the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s first spirit ring from the Titan Giant Ape Er Ming. As a hundred thousand year spirit ring, this first spirit ring assigned Tang San two hundred thousand year spirit abilities. Tang San had never used it himself, he\u2019d always used the Titan Giant Ape left arm bone\u2019s two spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>The two spirit abilities the spirit ring gave were Titan Hammer and Force of Earth. They weren\u2019t two attack abilities, but rather one power attack, and one support. Tang San had once tested the might of Titan\u2019s Hammer, and the attack power of this hundred thousand year spirit ability wasn\u2019t a bit inferior to when he used Great Sumeru Hammer after detonating the same first spirit ring, or even surpassed it. Only after using it there was still a brief charge up time, and it couldn\u2019t used for consecutive attacks like the Great Sumeru Hammer\u2019s Ring Detonation. And the other ability Force of Earth was completely a support ability.</p><br/><p>Controlling the power of the earth for his own use, if combined with Titan Hammer plus all manner of Tang San\u2019s attributes plus the power of the Clear Sky Hammer itself, it was enough to become the most powerful frontal attack weapon among all of Tang San\u2019s spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>But right now Tang San wasn\u2019t using the destructive power these two spirit abilities produced, but the Force of Earth\u2019s ability to control the earth.</p><br/><p>The name Titan, in the Douluo Continent\u2019s ancient era, represented the God of Earth. The Titan Giant Ape, by another name, was the Child of Earth. This was also an important reason why the Titan Giant Ape could become the forest king, become a peak level spirit beast. So then, Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor most controlled all blue silver grass, and as long as it was on the ground, the Titan Giant Ape could control the strongest force. The difference between them wasn\u2019t easy to see.</p><br/><p>Therefore, after Tang San released the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s first spirit ring, it instantly drew him into the ground. At the same time the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone flight ability started, exploiting Force of Earth to shift the mud and rocks, quickly travelling underground. At the same time, in order to raise the movement speed to the limit, he also used the left arm bone ability Gravity Control. This time it wasn\u2019t to increase gravity, but rather decrease it, cooperating with the control from Force of Earth, Tang San could instantly travel underground at flight speed, quickly leaving the battlefield like a swimming fish.</p><br/><p>The God of Angels was the god that controlled the skies. Therefore, even Qian Renxue\u2019s divine power couldn\u2019t use her Angelic Domain underground, so Tang San left the domain\u2019s restriction and drilled away. But even so, he was still grazed by the Sacred Sun Sword\u2019s might. The scorching feeling almost melted him directly. Fortunately the god level Eight Spider Lances dissolved the power of the true sun fire.</p><br/><p>Having escaped Qian Renxue\u2019s attack, Tang San wouldn\u2019t dither longer. Using his full speed, he quickly moved towards the ocean.</p><br/><p>Once Qian Renxue discovered it, he had already run almost ten kilometers.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue had always admired Tang San. In her eyes, Tang San was like a bottomless pit, as long as you squeezed hard or he faced a life and death crisis, he could always create miracles, always shocking everyone. Without a doubt, what astonished Qian Renxue the most was the Quanyin\u2019s Tear that could even pierce her heart, but Tang San\u2019s ability to fly away underground also surprised her a lot. She of course clearly understood Tang San\u2019s thoughts. Underground, her fighting power would be enormously weakened.</p><br/><p>Tang San also equally sensed Qian Renxue\u2019s presence. She was straight above him in midair, but he had no idea when the next attack would come. His mental strength was already completely suppressed by Qian Renxue\u2019s divine senses, basically unable to discover any information useful to him.</p><br/><p>Helplessly, Tang San\u2019s instant choice was to suddenly turn down, infusing the Clear Sky Hammer with spirit power and quickly hiding deeper underground. As long as he reached a certain depth, he could rely on the earth to shield him from Qian Renxue. Even though the continuous control of Force of Earth was exhausting, it was the only choice he had.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s ability to resist pressure was extremely high, and even though the pressure of the earth was much heavier than the ocean, he could still endure it a while. Just as Qian Renxue\u2019s attack was ready, he had already quickly sunk more than five hundred meters underground. At this distance, even if Qian Renxue launched god level attacks, the strength of Tang San\u2019s body and drawing on the buffer of earth, Qian Renxue was still unable to directly cause him any harm.</p><br/><p>Qian Renxue clenched her silver teeth. Fine then, Tang San, you really are too cunning. But even if you go underground, can you escape my pursuit? She clearly understood that, as long as Tang San entered the ocean, she might truly be unable to kill him. Even though the earth was a very large restraint on her power, it was after all better than the ocean. The sea was the Seagod\u2019s domain, and there Tang San could display even greater abilities. Whether her divine senses were enough to keep up pursuit was a question. Therefore, Qian Renxue firmly decided that she had to catch up to Tang San before he reached the shore.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

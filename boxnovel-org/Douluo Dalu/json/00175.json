The most powerful can threaten a sixtieth rank Spirit Master going all out on defense. The most ordinary is still a level of power above this basic one. Enough to make forty fifth ranked Spirit Masters hateful. Split into twelve types of crossbow bolts, they\u2019re each Bone Piercing Bolts, Thunderflame Bolts, Armor Breaking Bolts, Edge Cracking Bolts, Devil Suppressing Bolts, Overlord Bolts, Deep Yin Bolts, Dragon Cutting Bolts, Extinguishing Lust Bolts, Dragon Beard Bolts, Meteor Destruction Bolts and Seven Killing Bolts. The most difficult to deal with among them are the Meteor Destruction Bolts and the Seven Killing Bolts. Just that since these crossbow bolts require extremely fine craftsmanship and uncommon materials, the cost is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San took back the Godly Zhuge Crossbow, swiftly winding the mechanism,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior please watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San raised his hand and fired. Along with a series of sonorous cracks, sixteen streaks of shadow entered the ground in an instant. Bai He didn\u2019t clearly see how they shot, but the granite floor already had sixteen small holes.</p><br/><p>Bai He couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow large is the killing range for this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greatest killing power is guaranteed within fifty meters, further than that, the power gradually weakens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drawing a deep breath, Bai He was unable to conceal the excitement revealed by his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll buy this thing. How much? I want two hundred.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot expensive, one hundred fifty gold spirit coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He pondered, then said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you make it a bit cheaper?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though his character wasn\u2019t willing to haggle, one hundred fifty gold spirit coins wasn\u2019t a small sum to the entire Speed Clan.</p><br/><p>Bai He never allowed his junior clansmen to go draw the Spirit Hall stipend. The level of poverty for the whole clan ranked among the top in the Spirit Master world.</p><br/><p>Tang San pondered, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re friends with senior Tai Tan, I\u2019ll give you a favorable price. One hundred twenty gold spirit coins. I can\u2019t go lower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He, slightly relieved, said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, swiping the spirit tool bracelet on his wrist, he took out a pouch of precious and heavy gold spirit coins.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere is one hundred gold spirit coins. I\u2019ll give you the remaining twenty after the Breaking Clan has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t accept it, somewhat awkwardly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, you seem to have misunderstood. The one hundred twenty gold spirit coins I mentioned was for one. If you want two hundred Godly Zhuge Crossbows, then the price should be twenty four thousand gold spirit coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He shot to his feet. His face was already deep red. Originally he had suffered because of the poverty of his clan, but now hearing Tang San mention such an astronomical sum, the pride in his heart immediately turned into anger,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you playing with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>An almost severe pressure immediately gushed out from within his body. Even if he cultivated in the direction of speed, no matter what was said, he was still a Spirit Douluo level power.</p><br/><p>The young woman sitting by Bai He\u2019s side also stood up with him, glaring at Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go robbing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled calmly, as if he didn\u2019t feel the pressure Bai He released. Equally being Spirit Douluo, the pressure Bai He gave him was a lot less than Niu Gao,</p><br/><p>\u201cBe calm, senior. When our Tang Sect does business, it\u2019s absolutely without cheating either old nor young. One hundred twenty gold spirit coins is cheap rather than expensive. When I sell to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, the price is closer to one hundred eighty gold spirit coin for one. You already have completely favorable treatment. Don\u2019t forget that my Godly Zhuge Crossbow is made from refined iron, according to the price you wish for, wouldn\u2019t that be less than one gold spirit coin for each Godly Zhuge Crossbow? The manufacturing cost for the refined iron is more than this. Even more so the craftsmanship and technique, I dare say it\u2019s unique and unmatched on the Douluo Continent. Before senior gets angry, please think clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San raised a foot and lightly stomped on the ground. Faint white light stealthily rushed from him. Bai He clearly felt the pressure he released being forcefully cut apart. And on the ground, sixteen black shadows shot up, caught in Tang San\u2019s hand, then slowly and calmly returned the sixteen crossbow bolts to the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBai He, I can prove this on his behalf. Selling this Godly Zhuge Crossbow for one hundred twenty gold spirit coins absolutely isn\u2019t expensive. As far as I know, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School is the Tang Sect\u2019s long term client. This price for you is already very low. My meaning is, if you\u2019re interested, you can buy one for self protection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He disappointedly sat back in his seat,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is good, but what use is only one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Niu Gao said, the greatest problem perplexing the Speed Clan was attack power. If they had sufficiently formidable attack power, then even going to specially hunt spirit beasts was enough to support the clan. The appearance of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow undoubtedly made Bai He\u2019s eyes brighten, but, to him, this price really was a bit too difficult to accept.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Bai he, trading can\u2019t become charity. Since today is our first meeting, I\u2019ll present this Godly Zhuge Crossbow to you as a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he once again held the Godly Zhuge Crossbow in front of Bai He.</p><br/><p>Bai He snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to give it to me? No unjustly deserved rewards. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his heart, one hundred twenty gold spirit coins was no small figure. Accepting the help of the four single attribute clans was one thing, accepting the gifts of other people was definitely something else. If he wasn\u2019t so proud, the Speed Clan wouldn\u2019t have reached its current state.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about this. This young lady should be senior\u2019s granddaughter. Junior has always been extremely interested in speed. I don\u2019t know whether me and this young miss could compete in speed. If I win, senior gives me the one hundred gold spirit coins you hold. If I lose, this Godly Zhuge Crossbow will be regarded as the stakes for senior. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Bai He\u2019s heart immediately thumped. Speed was the greatest advantage of their clan. Even if the aura Tang San revealed just now wasn\u2019t weak, he still absolutely didn\u2019t believe his granddaughter would lose to him. Moreover, he assumed that Tang San himself was planning to give this thing to him, and this was just finding a justification. Even though Bai He had a very proper face, the lure of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow was just too large. He couldn\u2019t help subconsciously looking to his granddaughter.</p><br/><p>That beautiful young woman directly leapt up from her chair, in practically an a flash, she stood at the center of the hall,</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll compete with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San put the Godly Zhuge Crossbow aside, strolling over in front of that young woman. Right now, looking face to face, he couldn\u2019t help praising her inwardly. This young woman really was beautiful. Especially her harmonized figure. Only, he still only appreciated her. In his heart, besides Xiao Wu, there was no longer room for a second woman.</p><br/><p>The young woman haughtily faced up, looking at the half a head taller than her Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you want to compete?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI have always admired the speed of the Speed Clan, we\u2019ll do it according to nimbleness. We\u2019ll be within this drawing room. As long as you can touch me anywhere, it will be your win. The time is one stick of incense. Conversely, I win.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman said without the slightest hesitation:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, then light the incense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges had everything. Casually stroking it, pulling out one stick of incense, he threw it to Ma Hongjun. Ma Hongjun flicked it with a finger, immediately lighting the incense, holding it in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Sect\u2019s Tang San, please guide me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San gracefully made an inviting gesture, immediately focusing his entire attention.</p><br/><p>The young woman disdainfully curled her lip. She didn\u2019t believe Tang San could compare to her in speed,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeed Clan\u2019s Bai Chenxiang[1]. I will begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s words had just fallen when Bai Chenxiang was already in motion. Even with Tang San\u2019s eyesight, he only caught a smear of shadow in front, before Bai Chenxiang had already reached him.</p><br/><p>However, he was also long since prepared. At the same time as he said \u2018please\u2019, his feet shifted slightly, moving half a chi to the left.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang was strangely fast, but exactly because she was fast, her momentum was naturally also powerful. Immediately charging past Tang San\u2019s side, she missed him by a hair\u2019s breadth.</p><br/><p>Right now, azure color already burst from his eyes within a purple golden luster. His back was also cold. The Speed Clan\u2019s speed was even scarier than he had imagined. He didn\u2019t dare be careless, directly using Purple Demon Eye, his spiritual force also spreading out.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang charged and leapt dexterously, the tips of her toes lightly poking a pillar within the drawing room, using even greater speed than before to return. One charge and one return, added together, took only the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Tang San was now extremely careful, Purple Demon Eye targeting Bai Chenxiang, using Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step, his whole body immediately turning illusory.</p><br/><p>Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step absolutely wasn\u2019t the fastest of footwork, but it was absolutely the most profoundly nimble. Even if Bai Chenxiang was fast, Tang San\u2019s movements were still always outside of her expectations, and she struck empty air again.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang naturally wouldn\u2019t give up, chasing Tang San with all her strength. Tang San just didn\u2019t look at her, relying on spiritual force to track her, minding his own business and using Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step within a narrow range. The reason why he reacted as he did today, was his previous consultation with Tai Tan and Niu Gao. The most crucial of this was whether he could convince the other party.</p><br/><p>Speed was where the Speed Clan was best, and just like Tang San defeated Niu Gao in defense, if he could defeat the Speed Clan in speed, everything would become a lot easier.</p><br/><p>The choice to compete within the drawing room was also considered Tang San\u2019s painstaking efforts. Bai Chenxiang in front of him wasn\u2019t difficult to deal with, the difficult one was the Speed Clan chief, Bai He. Tang San knew that even if he added his Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone, it was still impossible for him to compete with Bai He in straight line speed. Therefore, he could only choose agility. There were no Spirit Masters faster than the Speed Clan in a straight line, but linear speed and flexibility, after all, didn\u2019t completely overlap. Tang San would exploit his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step to conquer the other side.</p><br/><p>Just at the start, Bai He\u2019s expression was still completely relaxed, but along with Tang San successively dodging Bai Chenxiang several times, his face gradually fell.</p><br/><p>Even though Bai Chenxiang still hadn\u2019t used her spirit yet, in fact, speed was still something every Speed Clan member had in their bones, they were extremely fast even without the aid of spirits.</p><br/><p>The burn speed of the incense was a bit faster than ordinarily, this was of course the effect of Ma Hongjun\u2019s phoenix flame, just that nobody paid attention to him right now. Even if the incense burned even faster right now, the Speed Clan\u2019s speed was still enough to carry out multiple lunges in this time.</p><br/><p>Bai He gradually saw some clues. Tang San really wasn\u2019t faster than his granddaughter, but that footwork of his was mysterious, and he could always dodge Bai Chenxiang\u2019s lunges at the edge of danger just by relying on this profound footwork.</p><br/><p>The stick of incense had already burned close to half, and Bai Chenxiang was still unable to deal with Tang San without using her spirit. With a low shout, the hair on her head grew, her arms stretched out, her spirit releasing in a moment.</p><br/><p>Two yellow, two purple, four spirit rings appeared around her tall delicate body. Twenty years old, fortieth ranked Spirit Ancestor, her strength was quite uncommon. Moreover, she still had an ideal spirit ring configuration. Even though this girl wasn\u2019t old, she was still the pride of Bai He\u2019s Speed Clan. Bai He firmly believed that his granddaughter would have a chance to attack the Title Douluo level in the future.</p><br/><p>Abruptly putting her spirit to use, Bai Chenxiang shot out like lightning, both feet gathering as if stuck together, each of her two arms turned into wings, flapping once, and along with her third spirit ring flaring, she flew in the air. Her speed suddenly increased, and she lunged towards Tang San.</p><br/><p>This third spirit ring was undoubtedly her spirit ability. Under the effect of the flying ability, some tables and chairs and other small objects on the floor could no longer block her. Further adding the increase in speed, the pressure she gave Tang San instantly increased substantially.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, Bai Chenxiang\u2019s first spirit ring was also used. Behind her four broken shadows appeared simultaneously, and they were moreover extremely distinct shadows. Looking exactly like her, as she flew horizontally, it seemed as if five Bai Chenxiangs charged Tang San simultaneously. The area covered immediately increased substantially. Despite being fully aware that four of those five were illusions, such a sudden appearance would still very easily cause optical illusions.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Bai Chenxiang had encountered Tang San. The light of the Purple Demon Light pulsed, and practically none of the shadows had any meaning against his powerful eyesight. Tang San\u2019s pace suddenly accelerated, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone displaying its effect. Even though Tang San didn\u2019t use speed boost abilities, along with his spirit power infusing, his speed still rose, dodging between the illusions in the drawing room just like smoke.</p><br/><p>Despite Bai Chenxiang\u2019s flight speed being incomparably fast with her spirit released, and moreover with her extremely agile lunges in the air, she was still unable to catch Tang San\u2019s silhouette. The two chased and dodged like this, and time unceasingly drained away.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang was filled with an unreconciled feeling. She could clearly see that even after Tang San accelerated, his speed still couldn\u2019t compare to her. But that strange footwork caused great problems for her judgement, it always seemed like she would catch him, but he still dodged as if he anticipated it.</p><br/><p>Right now, besides Bai He, everyone watching the fight, even Tai Tan and Niu Gao, were also stunned. Six silhouettes constantly flickered within the hall, and it was already very difficult to clearly see the movements of both sides. Especially Bai Chenxiang. Her movements were too fast. It seemed she lunged directly, but suddenly turned nimbly, her body would twist beautifully in midair, instantly changing direction. But Tang San\u2019s reaction couldn\u2019t be called slow either, no matter how fast Bai Chenxiang\u2019s Needle-Tailed Swift flying speed was, he could always dodge in time, not letting Bai Chenxiang touch him.</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s brows wrinkled sharply. he knew that his granddaughter was already using her full strength, and that their side had lost this battle. Bai Chenxiang\u2019s fourth spirit ability was only advantageous in straight line flight, no use in such a narrow space. It seemed that if it continued, it was impossible for his granddaughter to catch that youth called Tang San no matter what. Lowering his head, he looked somewhat grudgingly at the coin purse in his hand, inwardly thinking, \u2018don\u2019t tell me Heaven really wants wants to set itself against my Speed Clan?\u2019 People can\u2019t be greedy? With greed, even this final bit of coin couldn\u2019t be preserved. In the next days, how would the Speed Clan continue? Would they really have to go seek shelter from a sect? Even if they wanted to find shelter, in the present world, the upper three sects no longer existed, when all was said and done, how many sects still had enough strength to stay unrelated to Spirit Hall?</p><br/><p>\u201cTime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun shouted, the incense in his hand finally ended.</p><br/><p>The two figures suddenly halted. Tang San still had a smile, his graceful temperament unvarying, leisurely straightening the clothes that were in disorder from the fast movements.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang couldn\u2019t be as leisurely as him. Because of her gasping for breath, her small chest heaved, glaring fiercely at Fatty,</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless, how could one stick of incense be so short?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun grinned,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith another stick of incense, you still couldn\u2019t have touched one hair on my third brother\u2019s head! The result would still be the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang still wanted to say something else, but was stopped by Bai He. With movements nobody saw clearly, he had already arrived next to Bai Chenxiang. He threw the purse of gold spirit coins in his hand to Tang San,\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s right. You couldn\u2019t touch Tang San. We\u2019ve lost. If you agree to bet you must accept to lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San caught the coins, but didn\u2019t put it away,</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Bai, you let me win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang looked at Tang San with an unreconciled expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat let you win, if you have the skill, we\u2019ll compete in long distance speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled, and Bai He shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. If people compete in speed with our Speed Clan, they should naturally choose the manner. It\u2019s your own cultivation that\u2019s imperfect, and you still dare show off? Defeat isn\u2019t dreadful, but you have to find the cause for your defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang felt somewhat wronged, but was clearly very fearful of her grandfather. She fiercely glared at Tang San, then furiously walked towards her own previous seat. When she passed by Ma Hongjun, she \u2018very carelessly\u2019 stepped on Ma Hongjun\u2019s foot, eliciting a grimace of pain, but no complaints. This fellow was always extremely forgiving towards beautiful women.</p><br/><p>Bai He looked at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour footwork is very marvellous. We are convinced in heart and word of our loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San bowed slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s junior\u2019s tricks. In pure speed, nobody can compare to your noble clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s eyes displayed a trace of darkness,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat use is that? Of the four single attribute clans, our Speed Clan is the most useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that, it\u2019s just that your noble clan doesn\u2019t have a suitable space to use. Senior, it would be better if we competed again. You\u2019ve also seen that our Tang Sect has enough hidden weapons to arm your clan. Moreover, we aren\u2019t a Spirit Master sect in the traditional sense. If senior loses, I hope senior can join the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect will completely provide your noble clan with equipment as well as all necessary resources. Furthermore, we won\u2019t issue any requests in the forms of commands to your noble clan. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The light in Bai He\u2019s eyes suddenly grew almost severe, just like two sharp blades thrusting straight at Tang San\u2019s eyes. But, he still confronted Purple Demon Eye. Wouldn\u2019t making anything out from Tang San\u2019s eyes be easier said than done?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, you\u2019ve got a big appetite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He said coldly.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao sitting in the main seat snorted disdainfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you alone still dare compete with old whitebird in speed. Young people being a bit proud is nothing, but if it comes to arrogance, you can only suffer the painful consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smile was as light as a breeze,</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the start, junior didn\u2019t think about winning. I only want to try it once. Just like the possibility of the Speed Clan joining our Tang Sect is extremely small. Senior Bai He, if I lose, we\u2019ll provide your noble clan with a full complement of hidden weapons. Everyone will have equipment worth five hundred gold spirit coins. Including one Godly Zhuge Crossbow, two Silent Sleeve Darts, one Tight Back Head Bowed Crossbow, one Sand Projecting Shadow, as well as two Leg Crossbows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San\u2019s words, even Tai Tan and Niu Gao couldn\u2019t help secretly being speechless. Niu Gao\u2019s words were clearly a concealed provocation, but they originally hadn\u2019t even planned for Tang San to actually win against Bai He in a competition of speed. If Tang San lost, since everyone were friends, they could pull close the relationship between both sides by relying on the attraction of the Tang Sect hidden weapons. But they hadn\u2019t expected Tang San to actually toss out such large bait. If they lost here, the price would be a bit much. The Speed Clan still had more than two hundred people, a full set of five hundred gold spirit coins of equipment was definitely a hundred thousand gold spirit coins. Even to some Spirit Master sects with notable strength, this didn\u2019t count as a small sum.</p><br/><p>It was naturally impossible for Tang San to be sure he could win, but he still wanted to bet. Admittedly he hoped to even more directly obtained the backing of the Speed Clan, but at the same time it was also to reveal his strength one step further in front of these clan elders, to obtain even better approval. Besides, there were still a lot of secret skills Tang San hadn\u2019t used in his previous fight with Bai Chenxiang. Facing Bai He, had at least fifty percent certainty in his success.</p><br/><p>Even if he lost, as long as they could pull the Speed Clan into the Tang Sect later on, these hundred thousand gold spirit coins in equipment still wouldn\u2019t be a loss. Equipping their own side, wasn\u2019t that very regular?</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty. You come act as target, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun directly jumped up,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem! Come.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was just looking for an opportunity to show off in front of the beautiful woman. Eager to take on this task, he walked over to stand ten meters in front of Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, wait for me to prepare. Those hidden weapons of yours aren\u2019t so easy to block.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Fatty immediately released his spirit.</p><br/><p>Along with his spirit releasing, Ma Hongjun\u2019s body immediately straightened somewhat, his hair gathering into a mohican, turning scarlet, his bare limbs displaying dazzlingly beautiful feathers, and his whole body seemed to thin a bit. What drew most attention was naturally those five spirit rings of his.</p><br/><p>Two yellow, two purple, one black. Five rings altogether.</p><br/><p>Even Niu Gao was secretly startled. Originally he hadn\u2019t paid this always smiling and giggling Fatty much attention, he hadn\u2019t expected him to actually also be a Spirit King level Spirit Master. From how he called Tang San third brother, he was clearly even a bit younger than Tang San.</p><br/><p>The grandfather and granddaughter Bai He and Bai Chenxiang thought even more deeply. First putting aside Ma Hongjun\u2019s spirit rings, when he released his spirit, both of them simultaneously felt an indescribable pressure hitting them. That was a feeling that made their souls tremble, an innate fear of their spirits.</p><br/><p>How was it possible? Their always proud expressions immediately changed greatly.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun somewhat boastfully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior is Ma Hongjun. Fifty seventh ranked power attack type Spirit King. Spirit, Fire Phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, his second and third spirit rings flashed simultaneously. Red hot flame suddenly soared from his body, the temperature in the entire drawing room suddenly rising sharply, a pair of wings of flame extended from his back, immediately making this originally harmless seeming Fatty filled with an oppressive might.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun shouted to Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San took out one hidden weapon after another from his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, at once wearing them over his clothes. With his present strength, he wouldn\u2019t ordinarily wear these hidden weapons, non mechanical hidden weapons were enough for him to use. In order to display them now, his actions weren\u2019t slow, at once installing the hidden weapons he mentioned just now, besides the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.</p><br/><p>Raising both hands, Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSilent Sleeve Dart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each of his arms shot a dark shadow, flashing past, reaching Ma Hongjun in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The flame on Ma Hongjun\u2019s body suddenly burned brighter. He had already prepared in advance, Phoenix Firewire shooting out, turning into a sheet of flame under his clever control and the amplification of two great spirit abilities, blocking the two sleeve darts with tyrannical impact force.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, another two volleys, four sleeve darts also silently shot out. All blocked by Ma Hongjun. With a series of jingling sounds, six cooked deep red sleeve darts fell to the ground and Ma Hongjun also retreated half a step to dissolve the impact force.</p><br/><p>Tang San pushed on his stomach,</p><br/><p>\u201cSand Projecting Shadow, shoots poison mist.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a puffing sound, countless flying needles shot out along with poison mist. His movements didn\u2019t stop, legst shifting slightly, relying on muscular contractions, the crossbow mechanisms on his legs fired simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun\u2019s both hands swiftly drew a circle in front of his chest, spirit power jetting out. In front of the red hot phoenix flames, the poison mist naturally lost its effect, and concentrated popping sounds echoed continuously. Ma Hongjun retreated several steps in succession, and when confronted with the leg crossbows, he already had some difficulty warding them off.</p><br/><p>Just when he had when difficulty blocked this round of hidden weapon attacks, Tang San bowed his head sharply, and with a sonorous crossbow crack, the most formidable Tight Back Head Bowed Crossbow abruptly fired, the bulky crossbow bolt shooting straight for Ma Hongjun\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, do you want me dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red light on Ma Hongjun\u2019s right arm rose sharply, the flame wings on his back abruptly expanding. With a loud explosion, his fist blasted out, relying on the flame right arm\u2019s added Phoenix Burst Attack ability to just manage to block this attack.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s entire chain of attacks was as fluent as moving clouds and flowing water. All the Spirit Masters here were experts, and could naturally sense how frightening the attack power of the hidden weapons were. Of course, they also sensed ma Hongjun\u2019s formidable strength. He seemed to be blocking in a fluster, but very clearly, these hidden weapons still weren\u2019t enough to threaten him.</p><br/><p>Tang San then said to Bai He:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, the full set of equipment I mentioned is all here. This is the full deployment of five hundred gold spirit coins. Of course, these still don\u2019t count as my Tang Sect\u2019s most tremendous hidden weapons. Only sect disciples have the right to use those most powerful ones. Please forgive junior for being unable to provide them. You\u2019ve seen he might of these hidden weapons. I think that if the Speed Clan\u2019s clansmen were equipped with them, it would definitely have a pretty good effect. Do you wish to bet with junior on this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s expression changed continuously. Ma Hongjun had now already withdrawn his spirit, and the pressure naturally also vanished. Tang San and Ma Hongjun\u2019s team gave him a very great shock. Even more important was these hidden weapons, making even a proud person like him unable to keep from being greedy. He really couldn\u2019t refuse the stakes Tang San had raised, and Bai He sincerely believed that this youth in front of him couldn\u2019t escape him in a bout of speed. No matter how miraculous his footwork was, before absolute speed, its effect was still limited.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Bai He lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll bet on this fight with you. If I lose, then, I\u2019ll lead the Speed Clan to join your Tang Sect. You were brought by Tai Tan, I believe there shouldn\u2019t be any relation between you and Spirit Hall. I\u2019ll first declare that if this Tang Sect of yours and Spirit Hall has any relationship in the future, I\u2019ll immediately lead my clan to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one possible relationship between Tang Sect and Spirit Hall, and that\u2019s their destruction. Senior, we\u2019ll begin. Within the time of one stick of incense, the conditions are the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he once again threw a stick of incense to Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>Bai He dodged ten meters away from Tang San, and just the instant Ma Hongjun lit the incense, he was already moving. With the fate of his clansmen in the balance, he had no choice but to do his utmost.</p><br/><p>With this move by Bai He, Tang San learned what pure speed was. Even his Purple Demon Eye only caught a white shadow flash in front of him, before Bai He\u2019s hand was already before his eyes. In this moment, Tang San couldn\u2019t rely on Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step to dodge.</p><br/><p>Too fast, he really arrived too quickly. Since Tang San obtained Purple Demon Eye, this was the first time he felt his eyesight couldn\u2019t keep up with the opponent\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Of course, he still wasn\u2019t caught by Bai He. Bai He\u2019s hand only grabbed the afterimage left behind by Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeleportation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s shocked voice echoed. Tang San was already on the other side of the room, pink light flickering on his left arm.</p><br/><p>(Author\u2019s note: In some places there was an error. Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit bone is in Tang San\u2019s left arm. I confirm it here. Everyone please excuse the error. Hereafter it\u2019s the left arm.)</p><br/><p>Bai He stood in Tang San\u2019s previous location and looked at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so confident, you had the guarantee of such an ability. I want to see how many times this teleportation of yours can work. Take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Bai He suddenly radiated light, his spirit releasing.</p><br/><p>Two yellow, three purple, three black. Eight spirit rings appeared simultaneously. The split second his spirit was released, Tang San\u2019s spiritual force fluctuated slightly, and he teleported a second time without the slightest hesitation. This time, he couldn\u2019t even see Bai He move. The next moment, Bai He\u2019s hand already flitted past where he stood before.</p><br/><p>So fast. Tang San felt cold all over. Worthy of being a single attribute spirit cultivator, this speed could no longer be described as astonishing, it was simply universally shocking.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Tang San was already using teleportation once again. This time his body appeared at the doorway.</p><br/><p>Bai He disappeared, in the whole room one could only see a faint mirage. He didn\u2019t use any spirit ability, only spirit amplified pure speed. Wherever Tang San appeared with teleportation, Bai He\u2019s hand would inevitably appear the next instant. Tang San was forced to constantly teleport to avoid Bai He\u2019s pursuit and attack. And after each time he teleported, he only had a moment to pause. The Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track he previously used against Bai Chenxiang was unexpectedly completely useless.</p><br/><p>This was Spirit Douluo level Speed Clan speed! Tang San constantly changed direction, making himself move irregularly as far as possible. Purple Demon Eye and his spiritual force were used to their limit, and even then he could only barely keep up with Bai He\u2019s silhouette.</p><br/><p>[1] Bai Chenxiang - () \u201cWhite Agarwood\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

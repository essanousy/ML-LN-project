This kind of cultivation by communing with wild Blue Silver Grass made him feel as if he\u2019d discovered some secret. Just what it was would have to be seen after a time of cultivation.</p><br/><p>When Grandmaster heard Tang San\u2019s explanation, he smiled faintly:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, then you go back first. Never mind them, these days of matches have been exhausting. Let them rest. Change your clothes before you leave, and mind your safety on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled and agreed. Grandmaster\u2019s words brought him a fatherly kind of concern and warmth. Faintly saluting Grandmaster, he didn\u2019t bother the others who were watching the matches, and silently left the through the back.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Academy group were all watching the matches with keen interest, and nobody noticed Tang San\u2019s departure.</p><br/><p>It was instead on the other side of the competitors\u2019 viewing platform that a pair of gloomy eyes all along attentively followed Tang San, and as Tang San disappeared from the platform, that cold gaze also vanished.</p><br/><p>Changing into proper clothes, Tang San slipped quietly out of the Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena.</p><br/><p>Right now, besides some people who hadn\u2019t gotten tickets and some scalpers, the area outside the Great Spirit Arena was calm.</p><br/><p>Leaving the Great Spirit Arena, Tang San stepped quickly in the direction of Shrek Academy. Right now his mind was deeply pondering how he could become even stronger, and also the mysteries of the Blue Silver Grass changes.</p><br/><p>It was still morning, the warm light from the bright sun giving people a comfortable feeling. Tang San quite liked immersing himself in sunlight, and while contemplating the cultivation problem and walking by feeling, his whole body relaxed, unspeakably comfortable.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Tang San felt that today the road seemed a bit long. Though he had been immersed in pondering the Heart Separation Control skill, he felt he should have already arrived at the Academy.</p><br/><p>But raising his head to look, it seemed he was still quite a ways from the Academy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could I have been walking slower today?\u2019 Tang San frowned, speeding up once again.</p><br/><p>Walking and walking, Tang San\u2019s steps suddenly slowed. Vaguely, he already felt something amiss.</p><br/><p>The sunshine clearly shone on him, but that warm feeling was already gone. In its place a faint gloomy and cold feeling quietly spread from all around.</p><br/><p>Slowing to a stop, the light at the corners of Tang San\u2019s eyes immediately became vigilant. Nothing around him seemed to have changed, an endless stream of pedestrians passed around him. The distance from here to Shrek Academy wasn\u2019t very far.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could it be that I was oversensitive?\u2019 Tang San turned his head to look in the direction from which he came, his gaze sweeping across the pedestrians around him, but he didn\u2019t discover anything wrong. Everything was quite ordinary.</p><br/><p>Concentrating, Tang San raised his foot once again, stepping forward, Mysterious Heaven Skill unconsciously condensing.</p><br/><p>He trusted his own senses, and since his tempering in the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, these senses had become exceptionally sharp. That keen intuition made the unease in Tang San\u2019s heart constantly grow.</p><br/><p>His calm demeanor kept him from speeding up once again, instead slowly walking forward. At the same time he spread his awareness as far as possible, looking for the slightest clue in his surroundings.</p><br/><p>After walking a short time, Tang San suddenly stopped, his expression already serious. Wrong. There was definitely a problem.</p><br/><p>Even though his senses hadn\u2019t discovered any issue, Tang San\u2019s mind was meticulous. From the first step until now he had altogether walked six hundred five steps. Under ordinary circumstances, he should already have reached the Shrek Academy gate.</p><br/><p>But right now it seemed there was still a short distance to the gate. Perhaps there would have been a change in his pace, but that change absolutely wouldn\u2019t have been so large.</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know how this situation came about, Tang San immediately went on the alert. A Godly Zhuge Crossbow falling into his grasp and he directly summoned his Blue Silver Grass, not paying any attention to the pedestrians nearby.</p><br/><p>From that trace of cold air, a faint killing intent seeped out. That was a spirit murderous enough to threaten his life.</p><br/><p>The surroundings suddenly became very still. Those proper street sounds from before quietly faded away at the same time.</p><br/><p>The scenery in front of him also became misty, everything turning indistinct at the same instant.</p><br/><p>A faint silhouette gradually became clear about ten meters in front of Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthy of being Shrek Academy\u2019s most outstanding disciple. You really are very vigilant. Unfortunately, you discovered it too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a white clothed old man, a person Tang San had met more than once. It was that Blue Sunshine Academy team\u2019s coach, the seventy second ranked Spirit Sage Flender once warned them of, Shi Nian.</p><br/><p>Seeing this person, Tang San couldn\u2019t keep his heart from falling lower and lower. Quietly watching Shi Nian, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s teacher. I don\u2019t know whether you might have stopped me here for some advice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo advice, I just need you to disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Shi Nian\u2019s mouth showed a trace of a cold smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been looking for an opportunity these last few days. Unfortunately, you were always together with the other Shrek Academy students, leaving me unable to act. But today you still gave me this chance. It really is a pity you\u2019re not one of my Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pupils of Tang San\u2019s eyes contracted slightly.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can only blame yourself for being too outstanding. Even though the Shrek Academy team is strong, its true strength is precisely you. As long as you disappear from this world, our Blue Sunshine Academy will have the chance to advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed grimly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think that by killing me, your Blue Sunshine Academy can beat our Shrek Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian spoke indifferently:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf killing you won\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll just keep killing. Until I\u2019ve killed enough. Perhaps that student called Dai Mubai is suitable next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at the hazy surroundings,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do it here? Don\u2019t forget, this is an open street. Once you\u2019ve killed me, don\u2019t think you can stand up in the Spirit Master world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian smiled, the expression making his wrinkles deep enough to trap house flies, a pair of cold eagle eyes flickering with cold light, </p><br/><p>\u201cSince I decided to act, I\u2019ve long since made thorough preparations. You\u2019re hoping your relation to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School will save you? Don\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t leave behind evidence for them. Look, is this really a street in Heaven Dou City?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hazy scene in the surroundings suddenly became clear, and Tang San discovered to his shock that he stood in a desolate area outside of the city. Turning to look around, he could vaguely see the top of Heaven Dou City\u2019s city walls. He judged that this should be a small grove outside the city.</p><br/><p>Tang San reacted quickly, a sonorous sound erupting from the long ago prepared Godly Zhuge Crossbow in his hand as soon as the surroundings became clear. Sixteen sharp iron source crossbow bolts instantly smashed into Shi Nian\u2019s chest with overbearing penetrating power.</p><br/><p>Light flickered, and the sixteen crossbow bolts disappeared.</p><br/><p>However, Tang San\u2019s expression became even more serious.</p><br/><p>No blood. Yes, even though the sixteen bolts entered Shi Nian\u2019s chest, not a trace of blood flowed out. The sixteen crossbow bolts seemed to have disappeared in midair, they didn\u2019t even make another sound.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian somewhat startled looked at the Godly Zhuge Crossbow in Tang San\u2019s hands,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Such a powerful weapon. Is it a spirit tool?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t reply, only quietly watched Shi Nian.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian smiled, and this time his smile seemed quite relaxed,</p><br/><p>\u201cAmong people your age, you\u2019re no doubt very powerful. Even I haven\u2019t seen a more remarkable young Spirit Master. Unfortunately, the gap between the two of us can\u2019t be bridged by the word \u2018talent\u2019. Your weapon is pretty good, but unfortunately, everything you see right now, the position of things, they\u2019re all part of my Brutal Dream. Even though I let you see the true scene just now, it was still an illusion. Within my Brutal Dream, I\u2019m the ruler of everything, let alone some of the fortieth ranker like you, even Spirit Masters of the same rank as me would be unable to break free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression became ugly, withdrawing the Godly Zhuge Crossbow in his hand into Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, do you know what the greatest pleasure in my whole life is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian\u2019s smiling expression suddenly became somewhat eccentric. If it were to be described, perhaps the word \u2018perverted\u2019 would suit him the best right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San weakly asked.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this life, what I like the most is seeing my opponents go insane within my Brutal Dream, until they die. When I\u2019m about to see a youth regarded as a genius degenerate like that, I\u2019m already excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to kill me? Isn\u2019t there any chance to save myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San weakly asked.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian\u2019s expression suddenly became severe,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve let you see me, do you think I would still let you go? There\u2019s no use struggling, everything\u2019s already without any meaning to you. Next year today will be the anniversary of your death. If people have souls, then, use your soul to watch Blue Sunshine Academy destroy the qualifiers, entering the next stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t say anything else, but sat crosslegged on the ground. Blue Silver Grass formed naturally, deploying into his surroundings as a slowly spiralling defense.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Shi Nian laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe you can resist my spirit like this? Young man, you really are too naive. If my Brutal Dream was so easy to resist, I wouldn\u2019t be worthy of the title Spirit Sage. Wait and see. You\u2019ll die in extreme suffering, and this suffering will be brought on by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian\u2019s voice gradually weakened, the surroundings becoming hazy once again, as if he had already moved away, already left.</p><br/><p>Tang San sat motionless on the ground, quietly condensing his spirit power. Because of the Blue Silver Grass hovering around him, from the outside it was very difficult to see just what kind of expression he had right now.</p><br/><p>The surroundings began to change, and Tang San discovered to his shock that the Blue Silver Grass circling around him under his control seemed to disappear. Even though he could feel its existence, there wasn\u2019t a trace of it in his line of sight.</p><br/><p>The surrounding scenery changed, no longer that small grove from before, but a precipice. An incomparably familiar precipice.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hell\u2019s Peak, how come I\u2019m at Hell\u2019s Peak?\u2019 Tang San\u2019s originally calm eyes suddenly opened wide.</p><br/><p>He had left behind far, far too many memories in this place. Several meters ahead was an abyss with clouds and mist rising in spirals, and behind him, ten white silhouettes gradually grew distinct.</p><br/><p>Lowering his head, Tang San clearly saw that his clothes had changed, that enormous \u2018Tang\u2019 character told him a lot.</p><br/><p>\u2018A dream, don\u2019t tell me that everything in the Douluo Continent was a dream? That in the end I\u2019m still that Tang Sect disciple who offended the sect rules?\u2019</p><br/><p>Tang San stupidly looked ahead, becoming utterly perplexed. Those ten silhouettes gradually becoming clear completely blocked all routes of retreat. Familiar and indignant faces gradually appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, you\u2019ve actually stolen the sect\u2019s Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record, your evil crimes overflow to Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, Tang Sect raised you, taught you, what you\u2019ve done is detested by men and gods\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One by one, the voices constantly grew in Tang San\u2019s mind, those faces also constantly grew. Very quickly, those ten Tang Sect elders were already in front of him, surrounding him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElders, listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can be said. Tang San, your crimes are great, your evil extreme, you will take the sect\u2019s most severe punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San could no longer move his four limbs, simultaneously detained by four elders, one of them had already raised his hand, internal Big Dipper qi spilling out of his palm. The palm struck his arm. Tang San emitted a blood curdling scream, his entire left arm shattering into thumb sized fragments. Pain, enlarged tenfold, instantly spread through his brain, his entire body spasming violently.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward was his right arm, and both legs. In front of the elder\u2019s internal Big Dipper qi, the bones of Tang San\u2019s body were continuously smashed, until not one intact bone remained.</p><br/><p>However, he still wasn\u2019t dead. His whole body constantly convulsed, but no matter how strong the pain was, his mind still worked. A working mind meant he completely endured each painful sensation that came.</p><br/><p>The elders\u2019 faces gradually dulled, and they left Tang San on top of Hell\u2019s Peak, all the bones in his body in pieces. They told him they would leave him there to scream for seven days and seven nights, to die from the eagles and falcons.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes had already become hazy. The violent pain constantly swept through him, making his entire body jerk and twitch.</p><br/><p>The scene in front of him was still Hell\u2019s Peak, but another silhouette began to take shape.</p><br/><p>Slender, graceful, long scorpion braid, charming young face, it was Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>At the same time as Xiao Wu appeared, so did another person, a forty something uncle, a vulgar uncle whose every bone had been disintegrated by Xiao Wu. Bu Le[1].</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao-, Xiao Wu\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wanted to shout, but he couldn\u2019t utter a word. He didn\u2019t understand. Why would Xiao Wu and Bu Le be here together?</p><br/><p>Bu Le\u2019s one hand tightened around Xiao Wu\u2019s neck, and he looked at Tang San with a cold smile. And on Xiao Wu\u2019s face was grief and unwillingness.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, Ge, help me, h-help me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu did her utmost to struggle, but no matter how she tried she was unable to escape the strange uncle Bu Le\u2019s grasp.</p><br/><p>Making Tang San almost weep blood was that Xiao Wu\u2019s clothes were being torn off piece by piece by Bu Le, exposing skin like suet white jade[2].</p><br/><p>Apart from watching Bu Le\u2019s coarse big hands start to wander over Xiao Wu\u2019s body, watching his mouth constantly drool and smile evilly, Tang San couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>Blood began to drip from the corners of his eyes, but with all his bones broken, right now he could only look on helplessly as Xiao Wu was disgraced.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s eyes were brimming with despair and hatred, and this despair and hatred were unexpectedly completely aimed at Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, don\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u2019 Tang San wanted to shout, wanted to get up, but no matter what he said he was unable to move. In a moment, Bu Le\u2019s evil hand already stretched towards\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle beauty, since you can\u2019t resist, I\u2019ll enjoy it slowly. Uncle loves you. Hahahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Le\u2019s voice was as unpleasant as a night owl, each word like the point of a needle, piercing Tang San\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>A heart tearing, lung rending scream resounded in Tang San\u2019s mind. He had already gone completely mad. However, the scene before his eyes became even more clear.</p><br/><p>Bu Le\u2019s nauseating panting, Xiao Wu\u2019s despairing gaze, it was all magnified in his six senses.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Shi Nian leaned against a large tree, his seventh spirit ring constantly releasing a dazzling light, his face covered with a cruel and perverted sly smile.</p><br/><p>Just ten meters in front of him, Tang San lay convulsing violently on the ground, Blue Silver Grass spiralling around him. Shi Nian basically didn\u2019t need to look with his eyes, he could clearly sense that Tang San was already on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t had the pleasure of torturing someone to death for a very long time. It\u2019s a pity on such a young genius, who let you go against me? Very well, I want to see just how you\u2019ll die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I really want to see it, just what kind of illusion is he experiencing right now?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018My seventh spirit ability, Nightmare, can only bring out what you fear the most in your heart. What is it that this genius youth fears?\u2019</p><br/><p>The convulsions of Tang San\u2019s body among the Blue Silver Grass had gradually weakened. He was only lightly twitching.</p><br/><p>The coiled Blue Silver Grass gradually slid to the ground, and Shi Nian could clearly see Tang San with a deep red face, a trickle of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018So what if he was a genius? He still died most painfully within my Brutal Dream.\u2018 The smile on Shi Nian\u2019s face became even crueler,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a pity, if my strength could reach Title Douluo, I could have seen everything he experienced within my spirit. That would have been even more perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena.</p><br/><p>While she was focused on watching the match, Xiao Wu\u2019s right hand suddenly trembled, a burning hot feeling in her chest.</p><br/><p>With astonishment, Xiao Wu stretched a hand inside her chest, pulling out the unbreakable as diamond Yearning Heartbroken Red.</p><br/><p>The Yearning Heartbroken Red seemed to have made a fantastic change. The flower was glittering with faint red light, and a burning hot draft hit her in the face.</p><br/><p>What was this? Xiao Wu stared blankly. She didn\u2019t know why, but looking at the red light on the petals, an intense unease welled up from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>Turning her head, she searched for the person who concerned her the most, however, she discovered that seat was already empty.</p><br/><p>Blood colored light heralded disaster, Xiao Wu\u2019s heart instantly tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did little San go?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nervously asked. Her loud voice simultaneously stunned the Shrek Academy group.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San said he\u2019d go back to cultivate first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San\u2019s in trouble. He\u2019s definitely in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s hands clutched the Yearning Heartbroken Red, without the slightest hesitation running outside.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked in the direction Xiao Wu ran,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Xiao Wu? Didn\u2019t Grandmaster say little San went back to the Academy? What can happen in Heaven Dou City?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what it is, we\u2019ll go take a look as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai also stood up, chasing after Xiao Wu. The Shrek Seven Devils were like siblings, and everyone got up one after another. Even though they didn\u2019t believe Tang San would be in any trouble, just in case they still moved as a team.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The illusion still continued, and vulgar uncle Bu Le prepared to move to the last step, already loathsomely stuck to Xiao Wu. The whole scene constantly grew in Tang San\u2019s eyes, that heart tearing, lung rending pain seemed to tear his heart into shreds.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the blood red eyed Tang San suddenly changed. What changed was his eyes.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the blood red in his eyes suddenly disappeared, and purple golden light shot out, that light instantly shattering the \u2018Xiao Wu\u2019 and \u2018Bu Le\u2019 in front of him. The illusions surrounding him practically disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>Left hand clapping the ground, his body shooting up, Tang San made a half turn in the air, his right arm flinging out in this turn. Those purple golden eyes of his just met with the stupefied gaze of Shi Nian.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>A noiseless black light had already arrived in front of Shi Nian without warning. As a Spirit Sage, Shi Nian reacted extremely quickly, but at this moment it was already too late to dodge. Both his arms rose in that practically impossible moment, his spirit power extremely condensed. His left arm tingled, as that black light already entered within. He hadn\u2019t obstructed it even when when he didn\u2019t hesitate to injure his body to urge his spirit power to the limit.</p><br/><p>Peng\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Tang San was like a deflated rubber ball, his body spinning in midair fell heavily to the ground, gasping for breath in great mouthfuls. The light in his eyes had already recovered to normal, he used one hand to strenuously raise himself from the ground, and the other to wipe the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Even though he had already blocked that black light, Shi Nian\u2019s gaze was still lifeless, muttering:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is impossible. You\u2019re only a fortieth rank Spirit Ancestor, how could you break my seventh spirit ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked coldly at him, leaning on a nearby tree, only with difficulty managing to stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, nothing is impossible. You\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian laughed wildly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost? You\u2019re such a tiny brat, but your mouth is unexpectedly big. Even if I don\u2019t know how you saw through my seventh spirit ability, Nightmare, do you really believe this is enough to defeat me? Really too ridiculous. With my seventy second rank spirit power, even if I didn\u2019t use any spirit abilities, that still isn\u2019t something you could guard against or restrain. Even if you\u2019ve broken my ability, the conclusion hasn\u2019t changed. Only, before you die, I\u2019ll give you a chance. I\u2019m very curious as to how you broke my my Nightmare divine ability. Tell me, and I\u2019ll let you die a bit happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stood there leaning against the tree,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not qualified to know, you\u2019re just an idiot ghost. When Yama calls for your death at midnight, who dares keep you until morning? Good\u2014\u2014bye\u2014\u2014.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Nian first looked distracted, but immediately afterwards, his face suddenly became grotesque, his entire body standing there rigidly. Raising his right hand, pointing at Tang San, he wanted to say something, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. Both his eyes seemed as they were about to pop out of their sockets.</p><br/><p>Tang San still calmly looked at his opponent, as for everything that happened in front of him right now, it seemed he had anticipated it long ago.</p><br/><p>With a peng sound, Shi Nian\u2019s body fell to the ground. Black blood flowed from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth, his entire body already permeated with a layer of black, black blood spreading on the ground, seemingly constantly leaking out of his body. Gradually, including skin and bones, Shi Nian\u2019s body actually vanished like smoke within that black.</p><br/><p>Was Shi Nian\u2019s death really so mysterious? No, of course not. Heaven is impartial. Something like luck is only relative. His death was by Tang San\u2019s hand, or perhaps it should be said his death was by Tang San\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>Shi Nian, a seventy second ranked Spirit Sage, could never have suspected that Tang San\u2019s Purple Demon Eye was the nemesis of all illusions.</p><br/><p>If it was the original Purple Demon Eye, perhaps it would still have been unable to break Shi Nian\u2019s seventh spirit ability due to the difference in spirit power between them. However, after Tang San had taken the Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew, his Purple Demon Eyes had become like piercing eyes. Let alone a seventh spirit ability\u2019s illusions, even a ninth spirit ability, as long as it was an illusion, would be unable to deceive his eyes.</p><br/><p>As soon as Tang San had discovered something was weird, he had secretly applied Purple Demon Eye to carefully examine everything in his surroundings. Shi Nian had believed Tang San was trapped in the illusion, but in fact, Tang San had always known where he was, only he didn\u2019t act from the start.</p><br/><p>The difference in spirit power from forty first to seventy second rank was really far too great. Tang San knew that even if he wanted to escape, it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Therefore, from the time Shi Nian revealed himself to begin killing him, he had created his opportunity, creating an opportunity to kill the opponent in one hit. Tang San knew that was the only chance he had to survive.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he always waited. Even when he suffered such painful torment in the illusion, he still endured silently, only the moment Xiao Wu was truly about to be disgraced did he erupt. Even though that wasn\u2019t the optimum opportunity Tang San wanted to find, that moment was already more than he could bear.</p><br/><p>With Tang San\u2019s intelligence, wouldn\u2019t he be unaware that the shroud of Blue Silver Grass would be unable to protect him in the illusion? No, of course not. He didn\u2019t use that Blue Silver Grass to protect himself, but rather to block Shi Nian\u2019s line of sight. Sheltered from Shi Nian\u2019s gaze, Tang San took out one thing from Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, the only thing that could turn the tables in this situation.</p><br/><p>Third ranked of Tang Inner Sect hidden weapons, Soul Chasing, Life Taking, Yama\u2019s Invitation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t take out his mechanical class hidden weapons, and he didn\u2019t take out that wide area Cluster Soul Chasing Ball. Because Tang San knew he would only have one chance. If he failed, then with the difference in spirit power between them, he would die even if his opponent didn\u2019t use his Brutal Dream Spirit. Besides Yama\u2019s Invitation, Tang San couldn\u2019t think of any other weapon that could penetrate the opponent\u2019s defense.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even use any control ability to lock down the opponent, because there was basically no need. Partly because Tang San basically didn\u2019t have enough spare spirit power to use spirit abilities, and secondly, would Yama\u2019s Invitation need to lock down the opponent? If it was like that, how could this hidden weapon be third ranked in Tang Sect? And how would it be famed as Yama\u2019s Invitation?</p><br/><p>That faint black light was condensed with Tang San\u2019s entire spirit power. After reaching the fortieth rank in his cultivation, he possessed the strength for one attack.</p><br/><p>Originally at the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, Tang San had refined three Yama\u2019s Invitations. And now, their terrifying efficacy had been revealed.</p><br/><p>Yama\u2019s Invitation had a two tiered effect, also known as \u2018one invitation kills twice\u2019. Poison, undissolvable poison. Even if one cut off the limb the instant the poison entered the body, they would still be unable to prevent the poison\u2019s instantaneous spreading. Even if it was Tang San himself, when handling Yama\u2019s Invitation he had to boost his Mysterious Jade Hand to the limit, not daring easily touch it.</p><br/><p>Besides the poison, even more frightening was the structure of Yama\u2019s Invitation. Immediately after entering the body, it would disintegrate and spread through the veins, and simultaneously also follow the blood vessels to enter the heart.</p><br/><p>This was \u2018one invitation kills twice\u2019, Yama\u2019s Invitation left no survivors. Even Tang Sect itself didn\u2019t have any antidote. That didn\u2019t mean there was no way of removing Yama\u2019s Invitation\u2019s poison. Everything in the world had a counter, and naturally there would be antidotes for poisons. However, Yama\u2019s Invitation really spread far, far too fast. Even if there was an antidote, there would be no time to use it.</p><br/><p>As Yama\u2019s Invitation entered the body one would only feel a slight tingle. It didn\u2019t cause any pain, and once one discovered something was wrong, it was already time to die. Even with Shi Nian\u2019s seventy second ranked spirit power, he was still only able to say a few words before he had completely turned into a puddle of black liquid.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t leave right away, since at the moment he lacked the strength. How would Yama\u2019s Invitation be so easy to use? Condensing inner strength to a point, just to the limits of what Yama\u2019s Invitation could endure, and only then releasing it, that was the only way it could ignore defense. Any defensive Big Dipper qi was unable to obstruct the attack of Yama\u2019s Invitation, this was where it was the most terrifying. Further adding a particular technique, and dodging became almost impossible.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was different in this world, after all, some formidable defensive type spirit abilities might not be unable to block Yama\u2019s Invitation, like that Black Tortoise Spirit Master Tang San and the others met. If a spirit like Black Tortoise was cultivated to a certain degree, and unleashed some defenses beforehand, that could stop Yama\u2019s Invitation. Unfortunately, Shi Nian was an Illusionist Spirit Master. Defense wasn\u2019t his strong suit. Furthermore, how could he know Tang San possessed such a terrifyingly potent hidden weapon?</p><br/><p>Panting for breath, Tang San looked at the place where the black liquid had already drained into the yellow earth, and inwardly he couldn\u2019t help feeling a burst of lingering fear.</p><br/><p>It was after all a seventy second ranked Spirit Sage that had wanted to kill him. If the opponent hadn\u2019t used illusions, but rather was a power attack type Spirit Master, even if he had been able to use Yama\u2019s Invitation to kill the opponent, perhaps it still might have ended in mutual death. In his heart, he intensely felt that his own strength was insufficient.</p><br/><p>Even though he could be considered a genius among his peers, compared to true powers, the distance was still way too far.</p><br/><p>Pulling out a Dragon Zoysia Leaf from the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse and stuffing it in his mouth and recovering his strength, when Tang San prepared to harmonize his breath and return to Shrek Academy as soon as possible, out of the corner of his eye he suddenly caught a brilliant light from that puddle of black liquid that had been Shi Nian.</p><br/><p>An intense astonishment rushed out of his heart. He was only too clear on the corrosive effect of Yama\u2019s Invitation\u2019s poison. Let alone clothing, even solid gemstones would be corroded into smoke by that violent poison. What thing had actually not been destroyed by that toxic fluid?</p><br/><p>Forcing himself to his feet, Tang San cautiously approached the side of the black liquid, and as he clearly saw that brightly glittering object, the pupils of his eyes suddenly contracted.</p><br/><p>That was a round skull, three cun[3] in diameter, entirely glittering with rainbow-colored light, seemingly like a shrunken human cranium.</p><br/><p>Two words abruptly flashed through Tang San\u2019s mind, making his brain completely turn blank for a moment.</p><br/><p>Spirit bone.</p><br/><p>Yes, this was definitely a spirit bone, and it was even an extremely precious skull bone. That Brutal Dream Spirit Shi Nian actually also had such a treasure?</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t feel pleasantly surprised, but rather fearful. If before, Shi Nian had used the effect of this spirit bone, then\u2026...</p><br/><p>[1] Vulgar strange uncle Bu Le, whose chicken was roasted by Fatty back in Suotuo City.

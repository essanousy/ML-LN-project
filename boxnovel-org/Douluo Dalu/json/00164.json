After the matter with Xiao Wu, his attitude had undergone a Heaven and earth revolving change, the original gentle ease disappearing long ago, only an intense stubbornness remaining. Tang San was unwilling to think of even those things he learned back in the Moon Pavilion. Now, besides Xiao Wu, the only thing he longed for was to increase his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the way, are you blind?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leading horseman saw Tang San walking forward with his head bowed, and curse furiously. The horsewhip in his hand rose, and the instant he approached, overbearingly whipped towards Tang San. He was very confident in his strength, he only needed this whip to certainly sent Tang San flying, making him unlikely to hinder their way forward.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Tang San\u2019s gaze slowly rose from Xiao Wu, and along with his head rising, a clearly visible white light abruptly spread out from his body.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the air seemed frozen, a pinnacle chill suddenly releasing within the range of that white light.</p><br/><p>Amidst calls of lament, more than ten very carefully chosen warhorses almost simultaneously fell paralysed to the ground, spitting out white froth. Under the effect of their inertia, they directly went straight to knock against Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Exhaling, Tang San\u2019s left hand grabbed the horsewhip lashing towards him, his right hand making a fist, suddenly striking out.</p><br/><p>A white light completely different from the one that spread out before condensed on Tang San\u2019s fist, this punch seemed gentle, but it contained explosive force.</p><br/><p>With an explosive sound, the first warhorse halted under Tang San\u2019s fist, the solid horse head smashed to pieces, the whole horse\u2019s body instantly squeezed, unreasoning force penetrating its body. And the horses behind and to its side also came to a halt under the explosive force of this one punch. The more than ten mounted horsemen were thrown off practically simultaneously.</p><br/><p>What Tang San released first was his Deathgod Domain, and then stored up strength with his fist. But he still acted with propriety, while he injured the horses he didn\u2019t harm the people. Only that horse was directly killed.</p><br/><p>Left hand pulling the horsewhip, the master of that blasted dead horse was directly pulled from the saddle by Tang San.</p><br/><p>When the force on Tang San\u2019s fist erupted, there were already cries of alarm all around. The eyes of the commoners there for the spectacle mostly held pleasure, but even more people had fearful moods. Because these horsemen all wore the clothes of the imperial forbidden guard regiment. The imperial forbidden regiment was the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s most core soldiers, each passed very careful selection. Junior captain level or higher were all Spirit Masters. To the Heaven Dou Empire that lacked Spirit Masters, this was absolutely the elite of the elite.</p><br/><p>That imperial forbidden guard Tang San pulled down still wanted to resist, but with only a shake of the whip by Tang San, a surging force passed through it, and he fell limply to the ground.</p><br/><p>A crowd of imperial forbidden guards fell into confusion. One among them fiercely crawled up from the ground,</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard. Kill him for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, strong spirit power fluctuations burst from the speaker, Spirit Body Enhancement.</p><br/><p>Looking at this person, Tang San couldn\u2019t help being somewhat stunned. He was the only one among the knights not wearing forbidden guard armor. Apparently magnificently dressed, approximately thirty years old or so. This was someone Tang San recognized, back when they left for the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy, they had gotten into a fight with this person. It was Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s fourth prince, Xue Beng.</p><br/><p>It had been many years since he\u2019d seen him. Even though he had aged a lot, that pompous appearance hadn\u2019t waned in the slightest. Looking at his clamoring appearance, Tang San inwardly felt loathing. With the same father, how could the sons be so different? Compared to Xue Qinghe, he really was far too lacking.</p><br/><p>Two yellow and two purple, altogether four spirit rings appeared around Xue Beng. Born of the imperial family, his spirit rings were naturally an optimal configuration. Only fortieth rank at thirty years of age, even if he cultivated assiduously later, in his life, it would still be impossible for him to reach the Title Douluo level.</p><br/><p>Tang San softly caressed Xiao Wu\u2019s fur in his arms, no longer looking at these people, as if they were basically unrelated to him.</p><br/><p>The imperial forbidden guards swiftly crawled up from the ground, encircling Xue Beng, then cautiously staring at Tang San, their expressions nervous.</p><br/><p>Even if Tang San didn\u2019t fully use his spirit, from the explosive punch just now, as well as that vast killing intent still making them tremble, these imperial forbidden guards accustomed to being arrogant still didn\u2019t dare act blindly. None of them wished for the same fate as that warhorse.</p><br/><p>Able to become imperial forbidden guards, they were all true battlefield veterans. The feeling Tang San gave them was like like someone who had crawled out from a mountain of corpses, that deathly still ice cold murderous spirit wasn\u2019t something ordinary people could produce.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it, you trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Beng clamored loudly, and these imperial forbidden guards unexpectedly without one Spirit Master, slowly encircled Tang San at his orders.</p><br/><p>Tang San strolled forward, and those imperial forbidden guards surrounding him swiftly recoiled in answer to his footsteps, not one with the courage to attack Tang San. They weren\u2019t even Spirit Masters, and after suffering the Deathgod Domain, their hearts were already filled with shadow.</p><br/><p>Xue Beng was just about to move, launching spirit abilities at Tang San, when suddenly, a large hand fell on his shoulder, forcibly restraining his spirit power.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t want to die. Leave it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep aged voice echoed by Xue Beng\u2019s ear. Hearing this voice, Xue Beng\u2019s taut body visibly relaxed.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, Tang San\u2019s disregarding everything footsteps suddenly paused, once again raising his head, something within his ice cold eyes.</p><br/><p>An old man had appeared at Xue Beng\u2019s side at some unknown time. Long green robes, disheveled grizzled hair, just standing at Xue Beng\u2019s side, the atmosphere had become entirely different. The intense pressure gave even Tang San a feeling of being unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>The green robed old man stared coldly at Tang San, but the astonishment within his eyes couldn\u2019t be concealed.</p><br/><p>The aura this youth released before was clearly a domain type of power, and the spirit power contained in that punch was also quite considerable. In his impression, this wasn\u2019t something someone so young could possess. Even that little freak he had considered a friend couldn\u2019t possible be so outstanding. Especially when he still held a rabbit, making a somewhat strange appearance.</p><br/><p>Tang San placed Xiao Wu on his left shoulder, simultaneously raising both his hands.</p><br/><p>In the heart of his right palm, glittering with blue light, a blood red and resplendent gold double veined Blue Silver Emperor quietly came out.</p><br/><p>In his left palm black light gathered, inscribed with the lines of the Deathgod Domain, two chi[1] long, the cylindrical Clear Sky Hammer appeared from nothingness.</p><br/><p>Without using spirit power, only simultaneously revealing two types of spirits, this was the greatest degree to which Tang San could simultaneously use his two spirits. When the two spirits appeared simultaneously, he couldn\u2019t use any spirit abilities, even unable to bring out the might of the spirit. It was only a kind of demonstration.</p><br/><p>When the green robed elder saw Tang San raise his hands, his surroundings erupted with green light, but as he saw the two kinds of separately appearing spirits in Tang San\u2019s hands, the pupils of his eyes contracted violently, incredulously looking at the youth in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed lightly.</p><br/><p>Appearing at Xue Beng\u2019s side, was precisely the Poison Douluo, Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Tang San with shock on his face,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this still not enough to prove who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Dugu Bo\u2019s face abruptly turned cold, the once vanished green light appearing once again. Silhouette flashing, he charged in Tang San\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>As a Title Douluo, the pressure he gave Tang San was obvious. Simultaneously withdrawing the twin spirits, Tang San swiftly retreated a step. Flicking his right wrist, a golden red pearl appeared in his palm.</p><br/><p>Others might not react to the appearance of this pearl, even the commoners in the distance didn\u2019t. However, with the appearance of this pearl, Dugu Bo was like he had seen a ghost. Retreating like a flash of lightning, at least twice as fast as when he charged forward. The green light around him weakened substantially, and his face displayed a horrified expression.</p><br/><p>What Tang San pulled out, was naturally that Ten Headed Ardent Yang Serpent neidan. This neidan could not only receive any snake venom, but simultaneously had an extremely powerful restraining effect on all kinds of serpents. Even if Dugu Bo\u2019s spirit was the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor, he still suffered enormous influence in front of the antedeluvian mythical beast Ten Headed Ardent Yang Serpent\u2019s neidan. This sudden change left Dugu Bo without any choice but to retreat.</p><br/><p>Trembling from his very soul, even as a Title Douluo he was still terrified. His gaze at Tang San immediately changed a lot.</p><br/><p>Actually, Tang San didn\u2019t really need to pull out the Ten Headed Ardent Yang Serpent\u2019s neidan, even though it was still impossible for him to beat Dugu Bo with his present strength, resisting for a little while still wasn\u2019t any problem. But he had the original form Xiao Wu on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t want Xiao Wu to suffer any harm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking bewildered at Tang San, the expression in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes flickered.</p><br/><p>Judging by the spirits, that was the Clear Sky Hammer without a doubt, and that glittering with peculiar light Blue Silver Grass also seemed to be one of the twin spirits. But Tang San\u2019s appearance had really changed too much, and even his temperament had undergone fundamental changes. He had planned to first capture Tang San then slowly ask him afterwards.</p><br/><p>Patting his Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, we\u2019ll find somewhere to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San flicked his hand and withdrew the neidan.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded, clapping Xue Beng\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou deal with this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he walked into the distance with large strides.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s feet slid, passing Xue Beng, he reached Dugu Bo\u2019s side, Xiao Wu again returned to his embrace.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shifted a meter sideways, keeping his distance from Tang San. That Ten Headed Ardent Yang Serpent neidan from before really left him somewhat apprehensive.</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help laughing:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, when did you become so timid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s aged face reddened,</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a break, even if everything points to you being little freak, how could little freak have grown into your appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pointing to a tea house ahead, Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll talk there.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Xue Beng\u2019s gloomy face revealed a somewhat peculiar vigor, his brows wrinkling slightly, as if thinking of something. Waving his hand, he had the imperial forbidden guards swiftly put the scene in order, his whole aura seeming somewhat different.</p><br/><p>Entering the tea house, Tang San asked for a private room, and poured two cups of fragrant tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Little freak, how come you look like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Tang San pointed out the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse at his waist, Dugu Bo was already convinced to some extent, recognizing him. Twin spirits, and still knowing the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse was given by him, even the other Shrek Seven Devils might not know it clearly. He already had some trust towards Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San carefully placed Xiao Wu on his thighs, glancing at Dugu Bo, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYour hair has already changed to its true color, the remaining poison within your body should also have almost dissolved. Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>While listening, Dugu Bo\u2019s face relaxed a lot,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems, you really are little freak. However, how did you turn out so handsome? Teach me, perhaps I can still recover the spirit of my youth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would it be that easy, this is the changes caused by my spirit\u2019s second awakening, inheriting my mother\u2019s part of my genes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, he recounted everything that had happened since he left with his father almost without holding anything back, he didn\u2019t even omit the events in Slaughter City, up until what happened in Star Dou Great Forest.</p><br/><p>When Tang San spoke of Xiao Wu sacrificing herself to save him, his gaze was completely focused on Xiao Wu, his sorrowful expression unspeakably tender.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo listened dumbstruck to everything he said,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, you really were a freak from the start. You actually have the bloodline of spirit beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression sank,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, even though my mom was born a spirit beast, when she had me, she was already human. If not for Spirit Hall, our family wouldn\u2019t have changed to this, and mom wouldn\u2019t have returned to a Blue Silver Emperor again. I just didn\u2019t expect that I would encounter the same thing my parents did. Me and Spirit Hall, it absolutely won\u2019t be left at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Tang San in front of him, unable to hold back a burst of sorrow within his heart. Among his peers, Tang San really was an outstanding figure, possessing things countless Spirit Masters yearned for even in their dreams. But in reality, everything he had paid and endured was equally far beyond what ordinary Spirit Masters experienced!</p><br/><p>Difficult cultivation, his parents\u2019 tragedy, his lover\u2019s tragic death as sacrifice, all this had fallen on these only twenty year old shoulders. That he could stand straight was already unusual. Extraordinary people had to go through extraordinary events.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, what are your plans? Retaliating against Spirit Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo asked.</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot right now. I still haven\u2019t lost all sense of reason. With my Spirit Emperor power, how could I rock Spirit Hall\u2019s foundations? My dad was too rushed back then. I won\u2019t make the same mistake. I won\u2019t stir things up. Once I move, I\u2019ll definitely leave Spirit Hall grievously injured. Until they\u2019re thoroughly rooted out. I\u2019m twenty this year, I have plenty of time, when I feel I have saved up enough strength, I\u2019ll move on Spirit hall. Old freak, what about you, why are you together with someone like Xue Beng? With your brains, it\u2019s not like you couldn\u2019t see Xue Beng and prince Xue Xing\u2019s position back then in the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy. Are people like that worthy of your protection?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked deeply at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Freak, you\u2019re still too young. Some things aren\u2019t as simple as they seem on the surface. Very often you will have to look carefully to see the truth of things through the surface.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was startled,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying there\u2019s some problem with Xue Qinghe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded silently,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why Xue Beng is such a dandy? That\u2019s actually something Xue Qinghe forced him to. The present Heaven Dou Emperor Xue Ye originally had four sons. Xie Qinghe was the oldest, Xue Beng was the youngest. Originally, the most outstanding child of the imperial family wasn\u2019t Xue Qinghe, but rather emperor Xue Ye\u2019s second son. That was an alarmingly talented youngster. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t compare to you in Spirit Master cultivation, but in intelligence and wisdom, he was still above you. But when he was twelve, he died prematurely. At that time, as the elder brother, Xue Qinghe was fourteen. The next year, emperor Xue Ye\u2019s third son, a son extremely gifted in Spirit Master cultivation, died prematurely at eleven. Therefore, of emperor Xue Ye\u2019s originally four sons, only two survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>A chill bubbling up in his heart, Tang San looked at Dugu Bo, unable to keep his heart from fluttering,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Xue Qinghe had something to do with the death of the two princes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said indifferently,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can be certain, because there\u2019s no proof. Only, two days before the second prince\u2019s death, emperor Xue Ye had just convened some ministers to discuss the position of crown prince. Almost all the ministers were inclined towards the second prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes displayed a trace of introspective light,</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be the actions of someone backing Xue Qinghe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. At that time the four princes all lived in the inner palace, the second prince died from poison, and all the food and drink passed stringent inspections on that day. There absolutely wasn\u2019t any chance to add poison. Only people on the inside had any opportunity. It was basically impossible for outsiders to approach. The chamberlains and maids minding the prince were all the trusted aides of emperor Xue Ye. After the event, this became a case without clues. But when the third prince died the next year, the circumstances were almost exactly the same. At that time the fourth prince Xue Beng was still only seven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to his grief, emperor Xue Ye sent prince Xue Xing to investigate the matter. The results of prince Xue Xing\u2019s investigation were very strange. From the clues, he discovered that the two princes were killed by exactly the same poison. But it wasn\u2019t a poison drug, but were rather poisoned by a Spirit Master\u2019s spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat still can\u2019t prove a relation to crown prince Xue Qinghe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo gave a cold laugh,</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout evidence, go look for who benefits the most. The second and third princes died young, the fourth prince was underage. Who obtained the most benefit? If outsiders did it to strike at the Heaven Dou imperial family, why leave behind the eldest son? In fact, even though Xue Qinghe\u2019s innate talent wasn\u2019t equal to the second prince, he was still quite intelligent. The reason why Xue Beng turned to this appearance was because he didn\u2019t want to die. Back then prince Xue Xing personally instructed him in a unique skill that could save his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the reigning monarch\u2019s younger brother, prince Xue Xing absolutely isn\u2019t as simple as the face you see. Originally he did me a life saving favor, that\u2019s why I know so much behind the scenes information. Over these years, crown prince Xue Qinghe has obtained the support of more and more chancellors. Emperor Xue Ye also trusts him extremely much, leaving even more affairs for him to handle. But emperor Xue Ye\u2019s body is steadily deteriorating. Not long ago, prince Xue Xing suddenly discovered that emperor Xue Ye is suffering from a slow acting poison, and found me to diagnose it. I discovered that what emperor Xue Ye suffered is a kind of mixed poison, the poison is ordinarily introduced through food, and comes from a kind of spice. In the imperial palace, ordinarily only one person uses this spice. That\u2019s Xue Qinghe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mixed poison is extremely surreptitious. If it was me from before, I still wouldn\u2019t have been able to discover it. It\u2019s thanks to the knowledge of those mixed poisons I got from you. Through various clues I discovered, I then associated it with the events back then. Do you still believe Xue Qinghe would be clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Dugu Bo, Tang San\u2019s expression immediately grew serious. This was the first time he encountered people using something like mixed poison in this world, and it was furthermore used on the emperor. Dugu Bo\u2019s Title was Poison. That he was unable to discover this poison with his previous abilities clearly showed how much thought the poisoner had put into it.</p><br/><p>Recalling Xue Qinghe\u2019s modest and respectful appearance, even though Tang San in his heart wasn\u2019t willing to believe it, Dugu Bo\u2019s words still made his impression of Xue Qinghe change to some extent. But as is said, take what you hear to be false, only believe it when you see it, he would still have to find the concrete details from his own later observations.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you following Xue Beng? You\u2019re not afraid it will make Xue Qinghe act against him? Moreover, no matter what is said, this is still the internal affairs of their imperial family. Don\u2019t tell me you want to help Xue Beng take his place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo gave a cold snort,</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Beng that kid isn\u2019t simple either, he\u2019s an extremely clever person. Only he\u2019s always hidden himself very deep. You see that he presently has no more than forty something ranks spirit power. Actually, that isn\u2019t because he hasn\u2019t had the chance to cultivate even higher, but rather him deliberately not putting effort into cultivating, letting his spirit power stagnate. This matter relating Xue Qinghe and the mixed poison, I\u2019ve only told prince Xue Xing. Right now even emperor Xue Ye is kept in the dark. Only I made him an antidote that can slowly dissolve the poison. I only told emperor Xue Ye that he had been poisoned, and had him continue acting as if he was, so don\u2019t tell anyone about it. I don\u2019t want to get involved with the matters of the imperial family, but if you want to deal with Spirit Hall later, then you should hope that Heaven Dou Empire has a stable ruling class. You returned from Star Dou Great Forest just now, so you still might not know of the two major things that happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat major things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan were ambushed. Because the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School discovered it in time, they responded appropriately. They paid with the lives of more than two thirds of their disciples and retreated into Heaven Dou City. The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan has already been wiped from this world. A total massacre. Only some children not in the sect at the time managed to survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shot to his feet, involuntarily crying out in alarm. However, even when losing his self control like this, he still didn\u2019t forget to lift Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan are two of the three upper sects. Even Spirit Hall wouldn\u2019t be able to extinguish them so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo sighed, his eyes revealing a meaning of the fox grieving for the death of the hare,</p><br/><p>\u201cFacts are facts. Two great sects are finished. Even if the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School wasn\u2019t completely extinguished, it still greatly lost strength. The two great Title Douluo were seriously injured simultaneously, and of them, the Sword Douluo had his strength greatly reduced from the heavy injuries. Think, capable of mobilizing several tens of thousands of Spirit Masters to besiege and annihilate two great sects practically simultaneously, who has that kind of power?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked somewhat dully at Dugu Bo, muttering:</p><br/><p>\u201cFiercely done, Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThrough these events I learned that I\u2019ve originally always underestimated Spirit Hall. They can actually possess such tremendous strength. By the descriptions from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, when they launched the attack, the counterpart had mobilized four Title Douluo. And the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan was attacked almost at the same time. Extinguishing the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan without three or four Title Douluo is impossible. But there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of the Spirit Hall Supreme Pontiff being present, and you say Ghost Douluo and Chrysanthemum Douluo were in Star Dou Great Forest. This means that Spirit Hall itself actually possesses the strength of more than ten Title Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes suddenly displayed a trace of alarm,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan was destroyed, then Teacher\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster is alright. Right now he\u2019s already formed an alliance with the Heaven Dou imperial family, and is just painstakingly training the empire\u2019s Spirit Masters. The destruction of two of the three upper sects rocks the balance of the two great empires. Spirit Hall\u2019s actions this time can be said to have caused intense panic in both empires. It\u2019s impossible for them not to deal with Spirit Hall. If you can draw on their power to deal with Spirit Hall, wouldn\u2019t that be half the work for twice the effect? That\u2019s why, get to the bottom of this matter with Xue Qinghe as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t sit back down,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, you research the imperial family side some more. I have to go see Teacher at Shrek Academy. With his clan destroyed, even if Teacher\u2019s natural disposition is staunch, I\u2019m still afraid he\u2019s unable to stand such a heavy blow. I\u2019ll go see him at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. Take care to hide yourself. Right now you\u2019ve made an enemy of Spirit Hall. Especially destroying their good occasion this time as well, plus killing so many of their experts. They absolutely won\u2019t let that rest. Don\u2019t go strutting on the streets afterwards. Even if this is the capital of Heaven Dou Empire, Spirit Hall\u2019s influence still isn\u2019t weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, Tang San hurriedly left the tea house, heading straight for Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>After this exchange with Dugu Bo, the confusion caused by the matters with Xiao Wu settled again. Everything was a lot more complex than he had imagined. This left Tang San with no other choice than to reconsider his plans.</p><br/><p>Holding Xiao Wu, Tang San used the fastest possible speed to reach Shrek Academy while not attracting attention. Grandmaster was like a second father to him. One might say that without Grandmaster, he wouldn\u2019t be who he was today. Tang San could imagine Grandmaster\u2019s pain over his family being destroyed.</p><br/><p>When he reached Shrek Academy\u2019s gate, the students on duty this time didn\u2019t block him. The frightening display of the Shrek Seven Devils in the Academy that time left an extremely profound impression on all the students.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s face was a lot more rigid than before, coldly watching the students doing their utmost to run in front of him. The chill on his face seemed like it could make the air solidify.</p><br/><p>These of course weren\u2019t common students, but the young Spirit Masters with promising potential sent over by the imperial family. The reason why there were no Spirit Masters among those imperial forbidden guards Xue Beng had along, was because the majority of the Spirit Masters were already here, conducting unified training under Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Heaven Dou Empire possessed a lot of Spirit Masters, but the ones truly grasped in the imperial family\u2019s hand weren\u2019t many. Including the Spirit Masters from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, there were altogether less than five thousand. And the powers among them were just a handful. In the area of Spirit Masters, Heaven Dou Empire was far from able to compare to Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>Of course, if war truly started, Heaven Dou Empire could still dispatch some Spirit Masters from other regions. However, their overall strength was comparatively low. It was also due to the lack of Spirit Masters that the two great empires had no choice but to patiently endure against Spirit Hall. On a true battlefield, Spirit Masters facing one hundred alone wasn\u2019t empty talk. Among the several tens of thousands of Spirit Masters controlled by Spirit Hall, there were powers like clouds, and they also had the backing of those duchies and kingdoms. Even if the two great empires joined hands, they still wouldn\u2019t dare speak of certain victory. Even more, on the surface the conflict still wasn\u2019t completely roused, therefore they could only endure silently, storing their strength.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster had split more than four thousand Spirit Masters into twenty teams for training. Even though Shrek Academy was a bit small, this could still be considered the most suitable place in Heaven Dou City. Not only were all kinds of facilities completely allocated, three were still numerous mimicry environments for Spirit Master cultivation.</p><br/><p>The twenty groups Grandmaster had sorted them into were separated according to cultivation direction. Among them, the most numerous were power attack and agility attack type Spirit Masters. Added together they accounted for sixty percent of all the Spirit Masters or so.</p><br/><p>Right now Grandmaster was just training a team of power attack type Spirit Masters. Before ordinary special training, terrifying hell model physical strength type drills were naturally unavoidable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji stood to one side, his Gravity Control open, completely falling on the more than two hundred Spirit Masters currently running, making the weight each person carried extremely well distributed. Under the tiger like glare of Liu Erlong, these Spirit Masters could only train honestly.</p><br/><p>Not long ago, because of Grandmaster neglecting sleep and work, Liu Erlong had suddenly fallen ill. This had made Grandmaster rest a while because he had to look after her. But Liu Erlong couldn\u2019t keep pretending forever. Helplessly, she could only accompany Grandmaster to train these students together, helping share some of his burden so he could relax a bit.</p><br/><p>She also knew that Grandmaster\u2019s exhaustion came even more from the heart. She equally endured that kind of pain. Even though the two weren\u2019t husband and wife in truth, their hearts were still as one. Tortured by this kind of pain, she had also almost collapsed. She also wanted to take revenge, but after constantly obtaining reports from Heaven Dou Empire about Spirit Hall\u2019s strength, even her fiery temper had to grow colder and colder.</p><br/><p>Just at this time, suddenly, a somewhat irritable voice echoed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it. This isn\u2019t something humans can endure.\u201d</p><br/><p>One Spirit Master currently in training suddenly halted, quickly stepping out of the area of Zhao Wuji\u2019s Gravity Control, sitting his butt on the ground and gasping for big mouthfuls of breath.</p><br/><p>The training Grandmaster gave these Spirit Masters really was very tough. Because they were all already twenty or thirty years old, their training capacity was thirty percent higher than the Shrek Seven Devils back then. These Spirit Masters\u2019 training was too difficult for words.</p><br/><p>With someone taking the lead, among the more than two hundred Spirit Masters there was immediately a lot who halted, their clothes long since drenched in sweat, violently gasping for breath as soon as they stopped. One expectant gaze after another turned to Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked at those students taking the lead to move away, coldly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said this couldn\u2019t be endured?\u201d</p><br/><p>That Spirit Master looked thirty years old or so, build robustly, a power attack type, spirit power at the forty eighth rank. Among Spirit Masters of the same age, that was considered quite good.</p><br/><p>As a Spirit Master, always living like a prince, the focal point no matter where, when had he ever suffered like this? Shooting a glance at Grandmaster, he gasped:</p><br/><p>\u201cGot skill\u2026\u2026 got skill\u2026\u2026 you come and\u2026\u2026 try it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, this isn\u2019t training for humans, if it goes on, we\u2019ll all collapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>With someone taking the lead, the resentful voices immediately spread, the halted Spirit Masters whispering among themselves, looking at Grandmaster with gazes filled with resentment and even hatred.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong snorted furiously, stepping in front of that Spirit Master in a few steps, pulling him up from the ground,</p><br/><p>\u201cLine up, continue training, otherwise, I\u2019ll give you training alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at a violent mother dragon like Liu Erlong, the robust Spirit Master\u2019s eyes held some fear, but he still defiantely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not your oxen. At worst I\u2019ll quit. I don\u2019t want to die here. Grandmaster is also only a Grandmaster of theory, if he can\u2019t do it, why have us do it? Even Title Douluo might not be able to endure this kind of torment without using spirit power.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] 2 = \u2154 m</p><br/>\n</div>"}

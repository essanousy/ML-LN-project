At that time, the door swung open, and a person entered from outside.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s appearance made all the Emperor Team members spread out over the room perform the same action, even captain Yu Tian-Heng sitting in the sofa, even the Shi brothers sitting on the floor meditating opened their eyes. The seven people all stood up, making respectful salutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person walking in from the door was a middle aged man, appearing thirty years old or so, ordinary appearance, simple black hair, simple and unadorned clothes, only his eyes were especially bright. He wasn\u2019t as eye catching as the Emperor Team members, rather giving the impression of an entirely ordinary person. But, able to obtain the respect of all the Emperor Team members, how ordinary could he be?</p><br/><p>The middle aged man\u2019s complexion appeared somewhat strange, Emperor Team captain Yu Tian-Heng had never seen this kind of expression before, quietly stepping forward a few steps and lowering his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Qin, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed in teacher Qin\u2019s eyes, glittering black pupils displaying a deep lustre,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, you will perhaps meet your match. I\u2019ve just received the basic information on your opponents today from the city lord. This was determined just now by Suotuo Great Spirit Arena. Have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he walked over to the sofa behind the crystal table and sat down, in his hand already holding shining cloth and silk, unfolding it on the tabletop.</p><br/><p>The Emperor Team members all gathered round, looking at the cloth.</p><br/><p>Vice captain Dugu Yan read:</p><br/><p>\u201cShrek Seven Devils team, seven members, history unclear. Iron spirit fighter badge. Teacher, what\u2019s with this iron spirit fighter Shrek Seven Devils team, are they qualified for a team spirit fight with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Qin calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. For the past month they indeed held iron spirit fighter badges. But, through spirit fights in this month, their total points have already reached the silver spirit fighter level. Although they still haven\u2019t been calculated, Suotuo Great Spirit Arena has already decided to confer them silver spirit fighter qualifications in advance. Just in time to challenge you. According the the city lord, Shrek Seven Devils have participated in twenty seven team spirit fights. Twenty seven fights, twenty seven wins. How much time did you use to reach silver spirit fights? It wasn\u2019t one month, but a whole year.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master Yu Feng somewhat unconvinced said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s because they haven\u2019t met any formidable opponents. To so easily hold these victories. How can Suotuo City compare to our Imperial City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shooting a glance at Yu Feng,</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the city lord\u2019s investigation, Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 first team spirit fight was against the Mad Battle Team you faced. You should clearly know the Mad Battle Team\u2019s strength, their spirit power level wasn\u2019t unlike yours, only somewhat lacking in spirit abilities and the spirits themselves to be able to defeat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Shrek Seven Devils won?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time the speaker was the Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler.</p><br/><p>Vice captain Dugu Yan gave him a look,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there still a need to ask, teacher already pointed it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng continuously looked at the cloth information, suddenly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, their spirit power is so low, how are they able to beat the Mad Battle Team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Low? The Emperor Team members couldn\u2019t help but again cast their glances to the cloth, carefully reading the material.</p><br/><p>Shrek Seven Devils team.</p><br/><p>Captain: Evil Eye White Tiger, spirit: White Tiger, thirty eighth ranked power attack system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow, one purple.</p><br/><p>Vice captain: Thousand Hands Asura, spirit: Blue Silver Grass, thirty second ranked control system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow, one purple.</p><br/><p>Member: Soft Bones Demon Rabbit, spirit: Jade Rabbit, thirty first ranked close quarters power attack system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow, one purple.</p><br/><p>Member: Evil Fire Phoenix, spirit: Evil Phoenix, twenty eighth ranked power attack system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow.</p><br/><p>Member: Hell Civet, spirit: Hell Civet, twenty eighth ranked agility attack system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow.</p><br/><p>Member: Sausage Monopoly, spirit: Sausage, thirty first ranked auxiliary system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow, one purple.</p><br/><p>Member: Seven Treasures Glazed Tile, spirit: Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda, twenty seventh ranked auxiliary system Spirit Master. Spirit rings: Two yellow.</p><br/><p>Underneath this team information was still an annotation: Shrek Seven Devils in this month obtained obtained a complete victory record in team battles, their true strength is not as simple as levels suggest. Among them, the control system Spirit Master Thousand Hands Asura is of particular note, this person\u2019s control strength is extremely high, often capable of turning the tide.</p><br/><p>Reading the material, Dugu Yan couldn\u2019t help but giggle,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Qin, who gave you this information, it could make the dead laugh. A Blue Silver Grass Spirit Master is unexpectedly of particular note, what \u2018turning the tide\u2019. I expect he probably can\u2019t even stand up against my first spirit ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Qin snorted coldly, the Emperor Team members simultaneously felt their hearts contract a moment, intense shock making their faces reveal somewhat aghast expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan, even if Yu Feng is a bit careless, you as vice captain would unexpectedly underestimate your opponent like this. With this kind of attitude in the ring, I can practically guarantee you will immediately suffer an enormous setback.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan stuck out her tongue, but didn\u2019t dare speak. Although these Emperor Team members were all a cruel and untamed generation, they only had deference and admiration for this teacher Qin before them, it was not only because this teacher Qin was their specially coaching teacher, at the same time it was also because of his strength. Teacher Qin\u2019s full name was Qin Ming[1], thirty four years old this year, at the beginning of the year, he had just recently broken through the sixtieth ranked threshold, becoming a Spirit Emperor. Reportedly, in Spirit Hall\u2019s records, he was the second youngest Spirit Emperor, second only to another gifted genius.</p><br/><p>Spirit Emperor at thirty four, this was the goal of every member of the Emperor Team.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng waved his hand at Dugu Yan behind his back, hinting that she mustn\u2019t say more, himself speaking to Qin Ming:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Qin, in this Shrek Seven Devils team, in the end what is there for us to pay attention to? Going by their spirits, Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda is undoubtedly worth our attention, but the level difference between them and us is large, even if they have the support of the Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda, at most they can only pull close the spirit power gap between them and us, that\u2019s all. Perhaps this is the main reason they\u2019ve been able to obtain a perfect record in their previous fights. Of the other six, their captain, Evil Eye White Tiger with the White Tiger Spirit should merit attention. Still the Evil Phoenix Spirit. I\u2019ve never heard of such a spirit\u2019s existence, perhaps this \u2018Evil\u2019 part should be due to variation. As for the control system Spirit Master mentioned in the material, Thousand Hands Asura, on this point my opinion is the same as Yan\u2019s. Even if his spirit rings are remarkable, his spirit is after all only Blue Silver Grass. How powerful can it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming nodded faintly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour analysis is cool headed. This is the only information we have on the Shrek Seven Devils, we\u2019ll have to wait until actually fighting them before learning everything. Remember what I said, you must never underestimate any opponent. Since Suotuo Great Spirit Arena dares dispatch them, they will certainly have some confidence. Furthermore, I have a requirement for you. Whatever the outcome of this fight, nobody can kill anyone, you mustn\u2019t even injure your opponents. Do you understand? Yan, you especially, if you poison the opponents, after the fight you must immediately treat them. You cannot delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan said baffled:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Teacher, aren\u2019t you always telling us that on the battlefield are no sons and fathers, one must use all one\u2019s effort, if one doesn\u2019t injure the opponent, perhaps one will suffer wounds in turn, and that we absolutely mustn\u2019t start of leniently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ming\u2019s face showed a wry smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time is different. You still don\u2019t need to know. Wait until after this fight ends, I\u2019ll give you the answer. Good, it\u2019s time. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he took the lead to leave the VIP lounge, while walking, Qin Ming secretly sighed, \u2018children, I can\u2019t tell you the reason, I hope that this time you can suffer a bit of a setback. Growing too smoothly will often lead to brittleness.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Suotuo Great Spirit Arena\u2019s Central Main Spirit Arena.</p><br/><p>This place wasn\u2019t as large as those commoners who could only spectate in the sub arenas, in fact, if they came here, they would certainly believe that this was another sub field.</p><br/><p>The entire area of the Central Main Spirit Arena was only a bit larger than the sub spirit arena fields. The most peculiar thing was that this Central Main Spirit Arena was exceedingly calm.</p><br/><p>The reason was that the surroundings didn\u2019t have any outdoor stands, but each was a completely sealed box, only viewing the scene from behind crystal glass, concealing the VIP audience from outside.</p><br/><p>These people didn\u2019t wish to easily reveal their identity here, even more they wouldn\u2019t cheer like ordinary people. They had to be classified as having their own kind of arrogant and aloof feeling.</p><br/><p>Even more, the stakes here were big, even all the bets in the sub-venues put together would fall far short, in order to avoid conflicts between the nobles due to bets, it was even more important to conceal their identities, at least then nobody would know who won their money and even if they wanted to make reprisals they still wouldn\u2019t have any means.</p><br/><p>Although the inside couldn\u2019t be seen through the crystal glass windows, the Central main Spirit Arena\u2019s golden spirit tool lanterns shone dazzlingly, and the spirit fighting ring here was especially huge, since without outdoors spectators, the spirit fighting ring was able to have a diameter of over seventy meters.</p><br/><p>Let alone team spirit fights with less than ten people, even if both sides had a hundred people there was enough room and spare for close combat fights.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>The Central Main Spirit Arena altogether had twelve high level VIP rooms, and three hundred twenty common VIP rooms. These rooms were practically never empty; the high level VIP rooms had permanent owners, while the common VIP rooms were booked ahead at the start of each year.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, in the Central Main Spirit Arena the already extremely bright golden lanterns once again increased in brightness, and their brightness was no longer spread in every direction but focused on the spirit ring, as if a an enormous golden spotlight shone down from the sky, just right to envelop the entire spirit fighting stage. It was from the use of this kind of lantern type spirit tool that it could be seen how wealthy the Spirit Arena was.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the spirit ring, the ground suddenly buckled upwards in a two meter in diameter circle, the section slowly rising up from the stage could be seen supported by a thick golden pillar, and rising with the golden pillar right now was a young woman.</p><br/><p>The young woman only appeared eighteen or nineteen, wearing a dignified beautiful white dress, brown long hair in a large wave, well rounded chest and an excitingly slender waist, an incarnation of astonishing beauty. In her hand she held a conical sound amplifying spirit tool, on her charming face a professional smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are very honored to once again see such distinguished guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman in the white dress after rising to the intended location stepped out on the stage, turning in place and waving out at the surroundings. That platform that delivered her to the stage quietly withdrew back down, very quickly restoring to its original location, unexpectedly without leaving behind any trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cAble to once again before all distinguished guests preside over the main Spirit Arena\u2019s great team spirit fight is Doudou\u2019s[2] great honor. We hope all distinguished guests will be able to enjoy yourselves this evening. Today we have one highlight, we have tonight also only arranged this one spirit fight. Although both sides battling are only Spirit Elder level, they both already possess silver spirit fighter badges. If one absolutely had to give them a title, I think the word \u2018genius\u2019 would be exceedingly suitable. Doudou will from beginning to end conduct commentary for all distinguished guests. Next, I would like to introduce to all distinguished guests the sides ready for battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor Team, captain: Yu Tian-Heng, Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShrek Seven Devils team, captain: Evil Eye White Tiger, White Tiger Spirit Master\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This white dressed young announcer Doudou very skillfully introduced both the competing teams, the purpose very simple, precisely to raise the expectations of each VIP spectator.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Doudou has no more to say. Next, will the team members of both sides please take the field. Doudou is also a Spirit Elder level Spirit Master, and is truly very eager to see what brilliant display these Spirit Masters on the same level as Doudou will show us.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she spoke, white light suddenly burst out from this presenter Doudou, immediately following, in her brown long wavy hair suddenly appeared a lock of white, and behind her back extended a pair of pure white wings. Three yellow spirit rings simultaneously appeared around her, the third spirit ring flaring, wings lightly beating, unexpectedly bringing her soaring into the air with the sound amplification tool. Just like what Doudou said herself, she was also a Spirit Elder level Spirit Master, although her third spirit ring wasn\u2019t an ideal thousand year level, the ability bestowed on her by this spirit ring was clearly flight. To a flying type spirit\u2019s Spirit Master, this was extremely significant. Doudou\u2019s spirit was a kind of adorable and gentle animal symbolizing peace: White Dove.</p><br/><p>On either side of the spirit ring, two sliding doors silently opened wide, both sides\u2019 team members simultaneously entering the venue, walking into the center of the spirit fighting stage.</p><br/><p>On the left side was Emperor Team. Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Yu Tian-Heng walked at the front of the team, Dugu Yan customarily snuggled up to his side. Following closely behind the two were the Shi brothers. After came Black Leopard Osler and Wind Chime Bird Yu Feng. Walking last was that mysterious Nine Heart Flowering Apple Spirit Master Xiu Lingling.</p><br/><p>Compared to the all uniquely dressed Emperor Team members, Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 side appeared much more uniform. The same black tight fitting clothing, the same green masks. Although their height varied, with one look could be seen this was a group in orderly formation.</p><br/><p>These clothes were specifically made to order for them by Grandmaster, to change into for spirit fights. One reason was to hide their appearance, the other was also to let them feel even more like a team.</p><br/><p>The clothes could conceal the body, the masks could conceal their features, but there was still no way to conceal their eyes.</p><br/><p>As both sides\u2019 team members just started to appear, the gazes of Dai Mubai walking at the front of Shrek Seven Devils and Emperor Team\u2019s captain Yu Tian-Heng met resolutely.</p><br/><p>Their expressions seemed to congeal for a brief moment, the whole Spirit Arena seeming to echo with a dragon\u2019s howl and a tiger\u2019s roar.</p><br/><p>Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s heart trembled, looking face to face with those double pupil evil eyes of Dai Mubai, he immediately felt an immense pressure hit him. He immediately understood that this opponent only one rank lower than him wasn\u2019t easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>Coldly opposing, bright light flared in the eyes of both sides, the spirit fight had not yet begun, but both sides spirit already clashed with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth sides participating in the team spirit fight please take note, you have one minute to begin summoning your spirits. As I declare the beginning, both sides can attack, until one side concedes, all have collapsed or been thrown off the spirit stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doudou hovering in midair while flapping her white dove wings, used her gentle and beautiful voice to speak to both teams.</p><br/><p>That gentle and beautiful voice in the ears of the VIP guests was a kind of pleasure, but to the ears of Shrek Seven Devils and Emperor Team\u2019s members, it was the sign the spirit fight was about to start.</p><br/><p>As the two spirit fighter teams appeared, at the mouths of the passages stood the two sides\u2019 leaders. As the team members took their places, they naturally also observed the counterpart.</p><br/><p>The leaders on the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 side were Grandmaster, Flender and Zhao Wuji. They didn\u2019t have VIP qualifications, and naturally could only observe from the side. On the other side, the Emperor Team\u2019s leader was that teacher Qin.</p><br/><p>Flender glanced at Qin Ming a hundred meters away on the other side, his expression suddenly changing, then immediately gradually relaxing, his originally nervous mood seemed to ease up a lot,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, this time we don\u2019t need to be anxious. Wuji, you see who is on the other side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji also looked at Qin Ming, his eyes immediately widening,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, isn\u2019t he\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster gave the two a puzzled look,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the other side\u2019s leader? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender smiled mischievously, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret, wait until after this spirit fight is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the center of the spirit ring, practically simultaneously, both sides with altogether fourteen people completely released their spirit power, their intense battle lust surging out, scaring the White Dove Spirit Master Doudou in the air to once again increase her altitude. It\u2019s not like she hadn\u2019t seen more powerful team spirit fights than these people below her, but both sides with such powerful battle lust as right now was still a rare sight.</p><br/><p>To Doudou\u2019s eyes, the fourteen people below her could only be described with one word: \u2018Power\u2019.</p><br/><p>As the arena announcer and commentator, right now she didn\u2019t know what words to use to describe this competition. She knew right away that an extremely fierce spirit fight was about to begin.</p><br/><p>A tiger\u2019s roar issued from Dai Mubai\u2019s throat, worked up, somewhat scorching air surged out from his body, his bones making cracking sounds just like bursting peas, the muscles all over his body swelling in a flash, sharp claws ejecting from his hands, although wearing a mask, his knife sharp eyes were brimming with wild atmosphere.</p><br/><p>At Dai Mubai\u2019s lead, the Shrek Seven Devils all released their spirits, Oscar\u2019s three kinds of sausage had already been divided out between everyone before the fight, still standing with Ning Rongrong at the very rear of the formation, Xiao Wu and Zhu Zhuqing respectively at Dai Mubai\u2019s left and right sides, Tang San standing behind the three.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun actually stood a bit further ahead than Ning Rongrong and Oscar, purple red flame constantly throbbing in his palms.</p><br/><p>Blue purple Blue Silver Grass quietly roamed out into the surroundings from Tang San, along with spirit power rising, after entering the Spirit Elder realm, the quantity of Blue Silver Grass he could release was much more than before, blue light constantly flickered in his palm, Blue Silver Grass surging out like it was limitless, while occupying the floor next to him, simultaneously, six Blue Silver Grass quietly rose up, twisting around the waists of the other six Shrek Seven Devils.</p><br/><p>Under the effect of Blue Silver Grass, the seven people immediately formed a single entity with Tang San at its heart.</p><br/><p>As the Shrek Seven Devils side released their spirits, the other side naturally wouldn\u2019t stay idle.</p><br/><p>The Emperor Team\u2019s formation was entirely different from the Shrek Seven Devils. Standing furthest ahead wasn\u2019t at all their captain Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master Yu Tian-Heng, rather the two Black Tortoise Spirit Master Shi brothers. One left and one right, as Doudou announced the start of the spirit fight, simultaneously shouted loudly, earthen yellow light rose from under their feet, their bodies issuing sounds even more fierce than Dai Mubai\u2019s bones.</p><br/><p>Before releasing their spirits, the Shi brothers threw off their jackets, revealing muscles like solid granite, following the release of their spirits, the pair\u2019s shoulders slowly stretched out, their entire backs half curving, all their spirit power condensing into earthen yellow light gathering and coagulating at their backs, actually forming an immense dark yellow tortoiseshell.</p><br/><p>The pattern on the tortoiseshells was pale yellow, the Shi brothers\u2019 bones appeared to also transform somewhat along with this tortoiseshell appearing.</p><br/><p>Not only did the tortoiseshells appear at their backs, the same appeared on their fronts, and their four limbs all also became somewhat shorter. At the center of their front tortoiseshells was an enormous symbol.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>With faint flickering blue light, two yellow and one purple, three spirit rings rose from bottom to top twining around their bodies, on account of their bodies swelling from growing tortoiseshells, the spirit rings coiling around them also appeared to have changed somewhat.</p><br/><p>After the Shi brothers released their spirits, the intense pressure Dai Mubai emitted was unexpectedly blocked in front of them, entirely unable to pressure the other Emperor Team members behind them.</p><br/><p>From a small crack between the Shi brothers, Yu Tian-Heng could be seen. With the one of the first rate spirits Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon, just at the beginning, ignited all the VIP spectators\u2019 mood.</p><br/><p>A dazzling blue light suddenly shone between Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s eyebrows, immediately following, the blue light spread in a flash, from his eyebrows falling into his body, streams of blue purple violent lightning erupted all over him like small snakes, migrating around his body. On the surface, Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s change didn\u2019t seem very large, besides a blue lightning symbol on his forehead, on his whole body there was only one change from Spirit Body Enhancement.</p><br/><p>But, the one change was even more thorough than all Beast Spirit Masters present.</p><br/><p>The change that appeared was his right arm. The sleeve that originally covered his right arm swelled up and completely burst to ashes, the arm\u2019s length increasing by half a chi[3], the entire arm extremely bulky, covered with blue purple scales, the hand becoming a claw, covered by the same scales, each of the joints in the hand becoming extremely bulky, the blue purple snakes of lightning revolving around his body constantly coagulating or scattering on his arm, two yellow and one purple spirit ring did not revolve around his body like other Spirit Masters, rather spiralling around this arm.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze carefully watched the change in Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s body past Dai Mubai. Grandmaster once explained this first rate spirit Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon to him in detail. Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon and his own spirit were somewhat different, first of all, as a Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master, all spirit rings had to be obtained from dragon subspecies spirit beasts, similar to Oscar obtaining spirit rings from types like that Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent.</p><br/><p>Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Masters starting from thirtieth rank, with each obtained spirit ring, when using the spirit would have a part of their body replaced with a dragon analogue. Like Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s right arm just now was his first limb to change. Up until the seventieth rank, when Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Masters were truly incarnations of dragons, bursting with extremely terrifying strength. Among equally ranked they were the most terrifying power attack system Spirit Master. Put simply, if Yu Tian-Heng was the same rank as Zhao Wuji, then, Zhao Wuji\u2019s spirit Vigorous Vajra Bear incarnation would in no way be the match of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon\u2019s incarnation. How could Bear and Dragon be on the same level?</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s current right arm was already completely not classified as human but rather a dragon arm, with dragon scales adhering to the skin, the right hand also becoming a dragon claw.</p><br/><p>Behind Yu Tian-Heng was a dark green color. Red hair and green eyed Dugu Yan\u2019s body right now seemed to become soft, lightly swaying, pressing close to Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s back, a pair of green eyes becoming especially sharp. Her ice cold atmosphere couldn\u2019t in any way be classified as human.</p><br/><p>Between her brows was a rhombic green scale, when looking close, all the Shrek Seven Devils couldn\u2019t help but be shocked, since right now Dugu Yan already had no legs, no, it should be said that both legs had fused together, becoming a thick serpent tail, relying on the serpent tail to prop up her upper body, it was no wonder she would be swaying.</p><br/><p>Black Leopard Spirit Master Osler\u2019s change wasn\u2019t large. He was basically entirely dressed in black, and now even the hair on his head turned black. His elegant like a woman kind of face seemed somewhat pale, but his pupils already became vertical slits, his whole body brimmed with danger waiting to be released. He equally had two yellow and one purple spirit ring, this kind of spirit ring configuration was for the entire Emperor Team apparently nothing out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Among all the Emperor Team, the last Spirit Body Enhancement and also the biggest, perhaps had to be the Wind Chime Bird Spirit Master Yu Feng. A pair of medium sized wings stretched open from his back, different from that White Dove Spirit Master Doudou in the air, his wings were light brown, and the feathers on the wings would appear to lack any kind of softness, but had a solid texture.</p><br/><p>These wings of Yu Feng\u2019s weren\u2019t at all baseless, rather were actually his two arms transformed, right now beating the two wings, he already rose into the air, attentively observing the movements of the Shrek Seven Devils from up high, still not forgetting to take a look at the beautiful Doudou in the air overhead, even so much that he whistled at Doudou\u2019s long legs. Of course, he basically didn\u2019t take the opposing Seven Shrek Devils seriously.</p><br/><p>As a result of the team members crowded together, from Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 angle the opponent\u2019s auxiliary system Spirit Master couldn\u2019t be seen, Nine Heart Flowering Apple Xie Lingling.</p><br/><p>The pressure brought by the opponents all having the optimal two yellow one purple spirit ring configuration was incomparable, whether it was in spirit quality or spirit ring configuration, this time the Shrek Seven Devils were in an all round disadvantageous position.</p><br/><p>And these two areas were also where they had the advantage when confronting other spirit fighting teams.</p><br/><p>Although this battle hadn\u2019t yet begun, the faces hidden under the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 masks were already extremely serious.</p><br/><p>To them, this would definitely be an unprecedentedly bitter struggle.</p><br/><p>At this time, flying in the air Doudou\u2019s charming face was already somewhat heated from Yu Feng\u2019s stare after his Spirit Body Enhancement, but she still cultivated a great deal of professionalism, from her cherry red lips was uttered a very simple word, but still the fuse to an explosive substance.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a tiger roar towards the sky, Dai Mubai used action to shake up his side\u2019s vigor, taking the lead to charge at the opponents, fully using the White Tiger Body Barrier for his protection, whole body enveloped in golden light, again adding his indomitable manner, giving of an an extremely alarming impression.</p><br/><p>The Shi brothers\u2019 expressions were like the tortoiseshells on their bodies, from beginning to end without any change, watching Dai Mubai\u2019s brazen charge, the pair hadn\u2019t the slightest amount of fear, simultaneously drawing close to the center, obstructing Dai Mubai\u2019s advancement from the front. The first spirit ring brightening, a stagnant air released from these two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters, filling the air around them with yellow light and again merging with their thick tortoiseshells, clearly already prepared to meet Dai Mubai\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s left foot stepped heavily on the floor, soaring into the air, the sharp tiger claw blades ejecting, both hands swiping left and right, going straight for the Shi brothers\u2019 heads. And at this moment, Ning Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda thirty percent boost reached him, immediately making Dai Mubai\u2019s attack speed and tiger claw power rise yet again.</p><br/><p>Although this would seem like a very common change, the power and speed boost very easily made the opponents\u2019 defense suffer. The Shrek Seven Devils had spent this time rehearsing, and their coordination was already without the need for words.</p><br/><p>With Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit power and the sharpness of his tiger claws, let alone a human head, even solid rock would be cut. But, the Shi brothers used a very simple yet strange move, at once dispelling Dai Mubai\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>The two brothers Shi M\u00f2 and Shi M\u00f3 when about to be struck by the tiger claws pulled back their heads, unexpectedly withdrawing into their chests, to be precise, withdrawing into those incomparably solid tortoiseshells. Dai Mubai\u2019s tiger claws naturally could only scratch at those tortoiseshells.</p><br/><p>Resounding through the entire audience, Dai Mubai\u2019s tiger claws scratching the Shi brothers\u2019 tortoiseshells unexpectedly created sparks.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s body right now soared into the air, both arms abruptly jolted high from the shock, despite having White Tiger Body Barrier to dispel a lot of the impulse, his tiger claws still suffered a moment of paralysis from the inherent intense counter force in the tortoiseshells. Black Tortoise, as one of the most powerful defensive spirits, couldn\u2019t be so easy to break.</p><br/><p>Also at this moment, a blue silhouette already appeared before Dai Mubai, the bulky dragon arm shone with a dazzling blue lustre under the lighting of the Central Spirit Arena, before the person even arrived, blue lightning already congealed in the air into the shape of a claw, swatting straight at Dai Mubai\u2019s wide open chest in the air. All of this was already calculated long ago.</p><br/><p>At the same time as Dai Mubai emitted force to rush forward, Emperor Team captain Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master Yu Tian-Heng already launched his assault, but at the same time the two Black Tortoise Spirit Masters drew together, completely sheltering Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s actions behind them, making the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 side unable to see it.</p><br/><p>And the moment Dai Mubai\u2019s fruitless attack revealed a big opening, Yu Tian-Heng soared up, his first spirit ring flashing, condensed thunder dragon claw already swatting. This was all part of Emperor Team\u2019s coordination.</p><br/><p>The lightning was so fast that at the same time Dai Mubai saw the blue silhouette, the blue purple lightning had already reached his chest.</p><br/><p>Even if Dai Mubai was right now capable of pulling back his splayed open arms, he could still only use his arms to block the opponent\u2019s attack and would still be at a major disadvantage.</p><br/><p>As a Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Spirit Master with the most powerful attack, as long as Yu Tian-Heng could pursue and attack, further coordinating with his team members, the scales of victory or defeat would immediately tilt in their direction. But at this time, Dai Mubai suddenly disappeared, at once disappearing from before Yu Tian-Heng without warning. Even with Yu Tian-Heng\u2019s calm, soaring in midair he still couldn\u2019t help but stare blankly.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai naturally couldn\u2019t teleport, but one mustn\u2019t forget, around his waist was still twisted one of Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Grass.</p><br/><p>[1] ()</p><br/><p>[2] () A doudou is an undergarment covering chest and stomach.</p><br/><p>[3] \u00bd = 17cm</p><br/>\n</div>"}

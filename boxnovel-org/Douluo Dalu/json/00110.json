And different from the qualifiers, each student would be revealing their own strength under the gazes of all the spectators. This was also the best opportunity to evaluate the strength of the Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>The edges of the great drill grounds were completely surrounded by ten thousand imperial household knights, forming a watertight encirclement, helmets bright and armor shining. The front row of knights stood, while the back rows were mounted.</p><br/><p>This kind of strict defense could be called watertight. Of course, just like Tang San suspected, emperor Xue Ye\u2019s goal was to let his most elite subordinate knights take a look at the strength of the new generation of Spirit Masters, using this to ignite their fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>Between the great circle of knights and the competition ground, fifteen competing teams were finally arranged. Even the team that could rest today was no exception. Even if they didn\u2019t compete, they still had to gauge the strength of the opponents.</p><br/><p>The rules were very simple. Both sides would each participate with seven team members. Each team that went up would fight until defeated, continuing to fight the next opponent if they won, until the seven people on one side were completely defeated.</p><br/><p>The lots had already been drawn last evening, and Shrek Academy didn\u2019t pull an empty lot for their first round. Their opponent was an advanced Spirit Master academy from Balak Kingdom. Their turn was the third in the seven matches for today.</p><br/><p>The different areas were sorted so teams were grouped by their qualifiers. Tang San naturally saw the familiar rivals of the four elemental academies, and as they looked towards Shrek Academy, several people\u2019s gazes fell on Tang San.</p><br/><p>Those included Godwind Academy team captain Feng Xiaotian, Blazing Academy siblings Huo Wushuang and Huo Wu, Skywater Academy team captain Shui Bing-Er, as well as the Thunderclap Academy team captain Tang San had never seen before, a youth with ordinary build and unremarkable appearance.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster gathered everyone around him, his gaze sweeping across all the eleven Shrek Academy team members,</p><br/><p>\u201cNext I\u2019ll announce the order in which you\u2019ll go up. Xiao Wu, you go up first, after is Tang San, and Dai Mubai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone were still listening, but Grandmaster had already finished.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, aren\u2019t we going to send seven people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me the three of you don\u2019t have the confidence to end the match? Even though the opponents of the ranking competition are a bit powerful, they still won\u2019t be stronger than the four elemental academies. One on one doesn\u2019t need any teamwork, only strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>That simple sentence immediately roused the fighting spirit of the Shrek Academy team. Tang San, Dai Mubai and Xiao Wu all looked at each other, and in each other\u2019s eyes they could all see conviction of certain victory.</p><br/><p>Emperor Xue Ye stood from the VIP seats, speaking through a spirit tool:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ranking competition formally begins today. I hope all the academy teams will be able to amply display their strength in the next fourteen days, displaying the proper elegance of Spirit Masters. Begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words fell, shouts just like a landslide or tsunami resounded,</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live, long live, long live!\u201d</p><br/><p>The imperial household knights raised the lances in their hands, the sounds of their armor resonating with their voices, immediately startling the competing Spirit Masters. Undoubtedly the manifestation of a great nation\u2019s bearing.</p><br/><p>The first match began. Awesomely, first to appear was Blazing Academy. Their opponents was a team known as Fabia Academy.</p><br/><p>The first to represent Blazing Academy was the team captain, Huo Wushuang. Clearly, Blazing Academy\u2019s teacher thought much like Grandmaster. Not only would they win this first match, but also strike a large score.</p><br/><p>In the final ranking of the ranking competition, besides the match points, individual fight victories were also important. If there was a tie in matches, the ranking would be arranged according to fights.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t pay any attention the the match, but stood next to Xiao Wu, saying to her in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go first in our match later. If you find yourself restrained by the opponent, don\u2019t force yourself. You can\u2019t be injured, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San had originally thought he would go up first, but hadn\u2019t expected Grandmaster would send Xiao Wu. Unable to oppose it, he could only give Xiao Wu a few cautioning words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu smiled calmly, pinching Tang San\u2019s hand, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Are you still uneasy about my one on one capability? If I can\u2019t win, I\u2019ll concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stroked her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cCaution sails a ship for ten thousand years. Our opponents will get stronger and stronger, we can\u2019t be careless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matches proceeded very quickly. Between Spirit Masters, if there was a gap in strength, the result would often be settled in an instant. The one with more powerful spirit abilities, with higher spirit power, would easily defeat their opponent. People with spirit bones were, after all, very few.</p><br/><p>In one on one matches it was also impossible for something like spirit fusion ability to appear. Everything had to rely on one\u2019s own strength.</p><br/><p>In the first match, Huo Wushuang successively defeated three people, then lost the next match after substantially consuming his spirit power.</p><br/><p>The continuous battles didn\u2019t give time to rest. This was another area where the ranking competition was more interesting than the qualifiers, it didn\u2019t just test the strength of each member of the team, at the same time tactics and planning were extremely important. Even the most powerful Spirit Masters would find it difficult to consecutively defeat opponents by themselves.</p><br/><p>After all, the more powerful the spirit ability, the more it limited spirit power.</p><br/><p>The second to represent Blazing Academy was Huo Wu. It seemed that her expression was somewhat calmer than in the qualifiers, moving with the force of fifteen tons of thunder. Even though she was a girl, she gave the opponents enormous pressure in each fight. Judging by her appearance, this didn\u2019t seem to be a match, but more like life and death.</p><br/><p>Relying on the advantages of a control system Spirit Master, Huo Wu unexpectedly successively defeated four people, the two siblings directly smashing the Fabia team.</p><br/><p>When Huo Wu returned from the competition area, her physical strength was already somewhat overdrawn due to consuming a large amount of spirit power, but her pale charming face was still brimming with pride, her gaze fixed on Tang San without flinching, and she moreover extended a forefinger, pointing at him.</p><br/><p>Confronted with Huo Wu\u2019s provocation, Tang San only wrinkled his eyebrows and didn\u2019t express anything.</p><br/><p>Because of Huo Wu\u2019s gesture, a lot of Spirit Masters from other kingdoms and duchies now paid attention to him.</p><br/><p>Huo Wu had indeed become strong. Even though only one month had passed, that oppressive strength of hers had clearly grown a lot stronger, and her burst power was even more astonishing. It seemed that she really had worked hard in the past month.</p><br/><p>Among all the fifteen competing teams, Fabia Academy was one of the weakest, but having easily defeated them by sending only two people, Blazing Academy had still put themselves in the spotlight among the competing academies.</p><br/><p>The second match featured two teams Tang San wasn\u2019t particularly familiar with, however, among these strangers, he still saw one acquaintance.</p><br/><p>A simple uniform drawing the outline of a perfect figure, a solid and slender serpent staff held crosswise. It was the Unrivalled Dragon Serpent\u2019s granddaughter, who originally fought Tang San over his third spirit ring, Meng Yiran.</p><br/><p>Meng Yiran appeared on the competition ground as the vice captain of Cryptid Academy\u2019s team, in high spirits.</p><br/><p>As the first tool Spirit Master to appear, she completely displayed the superiority of a tool Spirit Master.</p><br/><p>Even though tool Spirit Masters didn\u2019t have the burst power of a beast Spirit Master, tool Spirit Masters won out in battle endurance. Relying on the extremely toxic serpent staff and her changeable severe attack methods, she unexpectedly also successively defeated three people.</p><br/><p>Making Tang San not know whether to laugh or cry, as Meng Yiran walked off the competition ground, her gaze unexpectedly also fell on him, and she simultaneously imitated Huo Wu\u2019s gesture to hold out a hand and point at him.</p><br/><p>Meng Yiran had originally noticed him when Huo Wu pointed him out. This wasn\u2019t only a demonstration towards him, but also a challenge.</p><br/><p>Sensing the gazes of numerous Spirit Master students fix on him, Tang San could only stand there helplessly. Even Oscar couldn\u2019t keep from snickering to the side:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, it seems you\u2019ve really offended a lot of beautiful women. If you also add that Skywater Academy\u2019s Shui Bing-Er, you\u2019re going to have a lot of people as your enemies. You tell me, won\u2019t the students of other academies think you\u2019ve discarded the two of them after playing around, turning love into hate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San unhappily glared at Oscar,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, I feel it would be relatively suitable to let you go up for a match, how about I propose it to Teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026...\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar hastily smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, we\u2019re good brothers! Big brother is an auxiliary system Spirit Master, it\u2019s still better to leave a difficult challenge like the ranking competition to you. You also don\u2019t want our Shrek Academ to lose face because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they chatted, the situation in the match had already started to change somewhat. Even though Cryptid Academy had Meng Yiran\u2019s three victories, the other students of their academy clearly weren\u2019t as powerful as her, and the opponents wore through four people. In the end the match finished with a close victory for Cryptid Academy after ten fights.</p><br/><p>From the previous two matches, Tang San could already see that the kingdom and duchy academies still had a certain gap in strength to the five elemental academies.</p><br/><p>There was at most only one fortieth ranked Spirit Master among the three academies that had already appeared, while the majority were thirty something ranked. Like Meng Yiran, whose spirit power was presently only at the thirty seventh rank or so.</p><br/><p>This suggested that the fight over the final ranking of the competition should be between the five teams from Heaven Dou City.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Finally it was Shrek Academy\u2019s turn,</p><br/><p>\u201cCome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was first to extend his right hand, followed by Tang San, Xiao Wu, Oscar, Ma Hongjun, Zhu Zhuqing\u2026\u2026 Eleven people put their hands together, cheering with loud voices.</p><br/><p>Boosted by everyone\u2019s expressions filled with confidence, Xiao Wu unhurriedly walked into the competition area.</p><br/><p>Shrek Academy\u2019s first opponents were from Balak Kingdom, their Royal academy. Just like Heaven Dou Imperial Academy\u2019s position in Heaven Dou Empire, their name was also the same as the kingdom\u2019s, Balak Academy.</p><br/><p>First to appear from Balak Academy was a large youth, looking twenty something years old, wearing a black and gold uniform. When he saw Xiao Wu he couldn\u2019t help staring blankly.</p><br/><p>There were two things that made him stare in a daze, one was Xiao Wu\u2019s appearance, and the other was naturally Shrek Academy\u2019s abnormal uniform.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Academy uniform long since didn\u2019t have any room for advertisements, advertising logos could be found on practically each corner of the uniform. Shrek Academy was enormously famous in Heaven Dou City.</p><br/><p>However, Balak Academy from Balak Kingdom naturally wouldn\u2019t know anything about this.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Wu\u2019s snot green and logo covered uniform, that big youth immediately laughed. If Xiao Wu hadn\u2019t been a beautiful girl, he would definitely have mocked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, how old are you? Your Shrek Academy wouldn\u2019t be without people, and sending you to make up the numbers? It would be no good if big brother is a bit serious and you get hurt. I think you had better go down. Find someone stronger to come over. This isn\u2019t a place you should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>The big youth said earnestly.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Wu\u2019s body was already close to that of an adult, she was still growing in some important areas. Moreover, her childish face clearly wasn\u2019t something someone in their twenties would have. Nobody would notice when fighting as a team where numerous people were mixed together, but in the current one on one format, both sides appearance were naturally conspicuous.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu frowned. That tall youth\u2019s voice was very loud, practically all the students around the competition area had heard him.</p><br/><p>Oscar somewhat puzzled said to Ma Hongjun next to him:</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, what are you covering your eyes for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said with feeling:</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t bear to see it. Being so disdainful to Xiao Wu, I\u2019m afraid this Balak Academy brother is out of luck. Did you forget that terrifying continuous throwing technique Xiao Wu has? I think it was called Eight Stage Drop. Eh, that\u2019s right, you weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s a pity, you didn\u2019t see the circumstances at that time. I really can\u2019t bear to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ma Hongjun and Oscar were talking, the referee on the competition grounds had already declared the match started.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was in no rush to act, and blinked at the big youth in front of her,</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, I think you\u2019re right, this really isn\u2019t a place I should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if her mouth said this, her body had already begun to change, her spirit quietly releasing. Two yellow and one purple, three spirit rings spiralled up.</p><br/><p>The tall Balak Academy youth should originally have paid attention to Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit rings and gone on alert, but just like Ma Hongjun said, he really was too contemptuous of Xiao Wu. Even more, he had complete confidence in his own strength. In the whole Balak Academy team, he was not only the captain, but also the strongest person, his spirit power surpassing fortieth rank. Unfortunately, his opponent was Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>The split second Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit released, a spirit ability also launched simultaneously. Second spirit ring ability, Demon Confusion, launched.</p><br/><p>A yellow ring of light flared, and Xiao Wu\u2019s eyes became an alluring pink color. The tall youth immediately turned stupid, completely in a daze. And at this moment, Xiao Wu moved.</p><br/><p>According to the competition rules, both sides started the match at a distance of twenty meters. Xiao Wu\u2019s long legs shot out forcefully, and in practically a split second, the distance between the two had closed to ten meters.</p><br/><p>This tall youth still had higher spirit power than Xiao Wu, and his mind didn\u2019t stay stunned for too long. Subconsciously becoming aware he was in a bad situation, he hastily opened up his own spirit while still only fuzzily aware of the situation in front of him. At the same time he slapped his own face hard, clearing his head somewhat.</p><br/><p>His reactions really weren\u2019t slow, and when Xiao Wu still was five meters away he had already completely sobered. With those growing three spirit rings in front of him, as well as Xiao Wu\u2019s rapid approach, how couldn\u2019t he be alarmed?</p><br/><p>Raising both hands practically subconsciously, he launched his first spirit ability at Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>However, the instant he launched his spirit ability, he was once again staring blankly. Because, that opponent who had originally been in front of him, had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu appeared behind the tall youth with her back to him, scorpion braid whipping out, while that big youth was still shocked, he only felt his neck tighten.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu didn\u2019t even turn around. At the same time as the braid whipped around her opponent\u2019s neck, her left foot supporting on the ground, she raised her right foot behind her, planting it directly on the tall youth\u2019s waist. Her first spirit ability, Waist Bow, launched.</p><br/><p>Pulled back by the braid, waist pushed up, the instantly erupting force immediately choked the big youth. The next moment, he was already completely thrown into the air by Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Only a few moments had actually passed from the start of the competition until now. Launching Demon Confusion, Xiao Wu dashing forward, launching Teleport, applying Soft Skill, throwing the opponent. The entire process was as natural as flowing water and moving clouds, without the slightest pause.</p><br/><p>It was also because of this that her opponent wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to react.</p><br/><p>Leaning forward, Xiao Wu\u2019s braid quietly separated from her opponent. Now, she leapt high into the air to meet her uncontrollably spinning opponent.</p><br/><p>At this point, this fight no longer held any suspense.</p><br/><p>All spirit abilities required a bit of time to store up strength, but if the Spirit Master lost their balance, and were simultaneously locked down by a spirit power burst of their opponent, it was basically impossible to use any spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Xiao Wu\u2019s Demon Confusion ability, or the spirit power she used after her scorpion braid wrapped around her opponent\u2019s neck, both had this kind of effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s one hand grabbed the back of the tall youth\u2019s neck, her left knee shooting up and, with a profound spirit power, heavily striking her opponent\u2019s waist. At the same time, Waist Bow launched. With a twist of her body and a simple throw, the big youth heavily struck the ground.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When the big youth heavily impacted the ground, a lot of people had already closed their eyes. Xiao Wu fell from the sky, both her feet directly stomping on the tall youth\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Under the enormous impulse, originally already confused by the throw, the tall youth\u2019s body immediately spasmed, violent pain making him unable to hold back a blood-curdling scream.</p><br/><p>Raising a foot and kicking out, Xiao Wu\u2019s toes directly nudged her opponent\u2019s jaw. Turning at the same time, executing a beautiful pirouette on top of her opponent\u2019s chest, her other foot lightly nudged her opponent\u2019s temple. The tall youth sank into complete darkness, completely unconscious.</p><br/><p>Three rings against four rings, a complete victory.</p><br/><p>After the air froze for a brief moment, it immediately turned blazing. Voices of admiration, voices of alarm, all rose and fell in succession. Even those Spirit Master academies outside who had once fought Shrek Academy, the four element academy students were also unable to conceal their shock.</p><br/><p>From start to finish, the fight had only taken a few moments.</p><br/><p>Relying on her own strength, Xiao Wu basically didn\u2019t give the opponent any opportunity to resist. A forty something ranked Spirit Ancestor was perfectly smashed by her and could only release his first spirit ability. From start to finish, Xiao Wu had been in control of the battle.</p><br/><p>Right now, his unconscious body was still constantly twitching on the ground.</p><br/><p>As a result of injuries from having his chest stomped heavily, things constantly bubbled out of his mouth even in unconsciousness, foul matter mixed with the blood. Even though his injuries might not be very serious, it would still be very difficult for him to participate in tomorrow\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s face revealed a smile harmless to both men and beasts, her gaze floating over to the other Balak Academy team members, softly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><br/><p>One simple word, but it seemed to ignite a barrel of gunpowder. Seven or eight people from the Balak Academy side immediately leapt up, aggressively dashing at Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee appeared promptly, but he only used words to block the opponents.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant a group battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other six Shrek Seven Devils set foot on the competition grounds in practically the first moment. Xiao Wu even more took a step forward, only quietly looking at the approaching opposing side.</p><br/><p>Actually, she really hadn\u2019t wanted to beat her opponent so miserably, but after she discovered her opponent\u2019s strength surpassed the fortieth rank, she had no choice but to go all out. Further adding that after launching Waist Bow, her strength wasn\u2019t completely under her control, this was her only choice in order to completely remove the opponent\u2019s ability to resist. After all, she was a close combat Spirit Master, she couldn\u2019t just release spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the two sides could get close, a clear and cold voice shook everyone present. Her voice didn\u2019t sound very loud, but when it issued, it was clearly heard by the more than ten thousand people present.</p><br/><p>Nobody on either side clearly saw when a person appeared in the middle, but with her appearance, a tyrannical matchless imposing manner swept towards the Balak Academy side as if hiding the sky and covering the earth.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>That overbearingly tyrannical aura made even the pupils of Ning Fengzhi and platinum bishop Salas in the VIP seats contract.</p><br/><p>This person suddenly appearing in the center of the arena was no stranger, but Slaughtering Corner Liu Erlong. What kind of temper did Liu Erlong have? Once ignited only Grandmaster could suppress her.</p><br/><p>Right now Xiao Wu was her adopted daughter, and seeing the opponents attack en masse, how could she stay calm? Regardless of the occasion, she finally had a target to protect, how could she hold back?</p><br/><p>Under the effect of Liu Erlong\u2019s formidably oppressive strength, the Balak Academy students all screeched to a halt practically in the same instant, looking at Liu Erlong with shock.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong\u2019s tyrannical aura didn\u2019t originate just from her spirit power, but at the same time also from her spirit and her own temper. Even though she was a Spirit Sage, that instantly erupting aura would shock even higher level Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a competition, what are you all doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>An ice cold voice resounded. If saying Liu Erlong\u2019s voice reached people\u2019s heart and soul, then this voice made people shiver.</p><br/><p>Platinum bishop Salas had already stood up from his seat at some unknown time, his ice cold gaze watching both sides in the arena.</p><br/><p>By now, Balak Academy\u2019s team coach had also entered the competition grounds.</p><br/><p>His spirit power wasn\u2019t lower than Liu Erlong\u2019s, but looking at her overbearing appearance, for some reason he lacked confidence.</p><br/><p>He turned and saluted the distant VIP seats,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm your anger, lord platinum bishop. We only wanted to carry away our team mate. We had no other intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Salas indifferently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth sides please remember your positions. Entering the grounds without the permission of the tournament staff will lead to immediate expulsion from the tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>The originally volcanic scene was suppressed like this, but the smell of gunpowder between Shrek Academy and Balak Academy no doubt became even denser.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu still remained in the ring, and Tang San stepped off after giving her a few words of warning as he passed her.</p><br/><p>Balak Academy was clearly infuriated, and astonishing the Shrek Academy party was the the second opponent to go up was unexpectedly also a Spirit Ancestor over fortieth rank. In the ring, he released his spirit without waiting for the referee to announce the start of the match. His spirit was very peculiar, a flower, with red center and yellow petals.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunflower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned. Xiao Wu\u2019s second opponent was a Spirit Master with a plant spirit. Sunflower was clearly of a quality Blue Silver Grass couldn\u2019t compare to, possessing formidable restraining capability.</p><br/><p>Wild sunflowers were capable of releasing an extraordinary scent, making people lose fighting capability, a kind of peculiar mental poison. And Sunflowers were furthermore hard as iron. With this as spirit, it could be treated as a weapon on its own, poison and attack equally serious.</p><br/><p>Clearly, Xiao Wu\u2019s opponent wasn\u2019t easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>Watching the opponent\u2019s white, yellow, purple, and purple spirit rings, Xiao Wu\u2019s expression also became serious. Her abilities had already been revealed once, and the opponent would inevitably be on their guard against them. She naturally also knew about the Sunflower. Dealing with an opponent possessing poison attribute attacks was very difficult, especially when the opponent\u2019s spirit power was above hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for what you just did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though this second Balak Kingdom team member to appear wasn\u2019t tall, he was extremely sturdy, with swelling muscles clearly visible over his wide shoulders. The sight of someone with this appearance cradling a delicate flower was also somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>The referee reminded them:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the rules of the competition, if anyone violates them, they will lose the qualifications to compete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu nodded along with her opponent, but the atmosphere between the two of them didn\u2019t show the slightest sign of weakening.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu knew that the difference between her and her opponent lay mainly in the fourth spirit ring, their actual level didn\u2019t differ much. Judging by the opponent\u2019s spirit power fluctuations, he should also have only just broken through the fortieth rank not long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cMatch start.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the referee\u2019s announcement, the Balak Kingdom student\u2019s first spirit ring brightened instantly, and the Sunflower in his hands faced the wind and grew. In the blink of an eye, it had already grown into one meter in diameter, and the long stalk in his grasp had also reached more than three meters, instantly becoming a bizarre weapon.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hands, a dense yellow mist released from the Sunflower, directly enveloping Xiao Wu within.</p><br/><p>At this moment Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t advance, therefore she could only retreat, backing away with big leaps. But despite this, she still caught a faint fragrance. The fragrance was very rich, and even though it was only a hint, Xiao Wu immediately felt her mind go dizzy.</p><br/><p>In circumstances with equal level, especially when both sides didn\u2019t have very high spirit power, Poison Spirit Masters held a greatly advantageous position. As long as they used it appropriately, they could restrain their opponent to an enormous degree. Like this Balak Academy student, in terms of restraining attributes, besides spirits that specifically restrained poison, only ice and fire type spirits like what Huo Wu and Shui Bing-Er had might control him.</p><br/><p>As the pit of her stomach tightened, Xiao Wu knew that the poison had already begun to take effect, and she hastily urged her spirit power to suppress it. But her opponent still didn\u2019t chase after, only continuously waving the Sunflower in his hands with a malicious smile, sending out that great yellow mist.</p><br/><p>The area it covered began to grow bigger and bigger. By now, two spirit rings were already shining simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the first of these two spirit rings was to enlarge the Sunflower, and the other was this fog.</p><br/><p>What should be done? Hesitation appeared briefly in Xiao Wu\u2019s heart. She knew that to defeat the opponent, she would have to break into the opponent\u2019s poison formation with the force of fifteen tons of thunder and settle him quickly. But wouldn\u2019t he be prepared for that?</p><br/><p>He still hadn\u2019t used his third and fourth spirit abilities. In a situation where she couldn\u2019t get into close range, even though Xiao Wu still had enough spirit power to use abilities, it clearly wasn\u2019t enough to get close to the opponent.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, suddenly, a bizarre heat flowed into Xiao Wu\u2019s body through her chest, and her originally tight stomach immediately relaxed. Not just this, a layer of golden red light began to appear from within Xiao Wu\u2019s body, and in the blink of an eye, she was surrounded by a barrier of golden red light.</p><br/><p>By now, the poison fog had just enveloped Xiao Wu\u2019s position, and a bizarre scene occurred. No matter how tremendous that poison fog, it was still unable to penetrate that golden red light.</p><br/><p>Making Xiao Wu\u2019s opponent even more inconsolably shocked was that when the poison he had already released came into contact with the golden red light around Xiao Wu, it immediately melted away like ice and snow. In a moment, the poison fog had already been completely obliterated within ten square meters of Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Let alone the opponent, right now even Xiao Wu herself didn\u2019t know what just happened, but with her combat experience she naturally wouldn\u2019t give up this opportunity, dashing at her opponent without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s that golden red colored light?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong couldn\u2019t help questioning Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster also had a baffled expression. Even though his research into spirits was incisive, the situation before his eyes still left him puzzled. Originally he hadn\u2019t had much belief in winning this fight, but that golden red light had rekindled his hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San suddenly said in a low voice, his face revealing a hint of a smile.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Academy group\u2019s gazes all instantly focused on Tang San, who smiled and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember Xiao Wu\u2019s Yearning Heartbroken Red? As an immortal treasure among immortal treasures, the Yearning Heartbroken Red is undoubtedly a king among flowers, even the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure is far from being able to compare to it. The Sunflower is also a flower, even though the Yearning Heartbroken Red isn\u2019t particularly good at resisting poison, and Xiao Wu didn\u2019t eat it, the Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s position among flowers really is too high, after fusing with Xiao Wu\u2019s blood, it has already formed a certain connection with her. When the Sunflower launched an attack against Xiao Wu, the Yearning Heartbroken Red would naturally believe it was being provoked. Would the king of flowers suffer the provocation of flowers? How could it endure silently? This golden red colored light should be the Yearning Heartbroken Red\u2019s Monarch Overlooking All Fragrance[1] splendor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar couldn\u2019t keep from saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how couldn\u2019t we be violating the tournament rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled indifferently, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Teacher didn\u2019t notice, do you believe the panel of judges could see what\u2019s going on? That light is emitted from Xiao Wu\u2019s body, after all. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s using something. Keep watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, just like Tang San said, the golden red light emitted by Xiao Wu\u2019s body came from the Yearning Heartbroken Red. Sensing the provoking aura of the Sunflower, the Yearning Heartbroken Red automatically protected itself.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was only possible for this reaction to appear when it faced flowers. If it was some other poison, it would naturally be ineffective. This was also considered the bad luck of Xiao Wu\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>Seeing his poison fog become ineffective and moreover his spirit power being substantially consumed as it melted away under the effect of that golden red light, that Balak Academy team member, with great alarm, had no choice but to use his third spirit ability.</p><br/><p>Half turning, that Sunflower swung out. In an instant, countless specks of yellow light sprinkled out from the enormous flower, enveloping a large area with a powerful aura; dodging was clearly impossible.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xiao Wu could have used Teleport to dodge, but for some reason there seemed to be a voice in her heart telling her there was no need. And Xiao Wu followed it subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Once she came to herself and thought of using her spirit ability again, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cAll Fragrance\u201d can also be interpreted as \u201call flowers\u201d, where flowers can also be interpreted as talents or beauties.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

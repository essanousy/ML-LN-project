When he came here and we met again, everything before that was meaningless. A hundred years, we\u2019ve both lived in this world for more than a hundred years, what could we not let go of? Unfortunately, even though he gave me happiness by coming here, it also brought even deeper grief. None of it is his fault, I\u2019m the one who was too proud back then, I never clearly told him, never even hinted at my feelings for him. All of it is my fault\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s mood was a bit out of control. Even though she still sat there motionless, she trembled slightly, and her right hand tightly grasped her golden scepter, causing tapping sounds where it hit the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, you\u2026\u2026 Just what happened? Where is great grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi looked somewhat absentmindedly at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know, you\u2019re very similar to when he was your age? Only back then he was much more brash than you, not as reserved. Of course, this was also related to his strength. When he was thirty, he was already the power of a generation. None of his peers could match him. It\u2019s also just because of this that I couldn\u2019t help liking him, even fully aware that he already had a wife. Oh, Tang Chen, you really are the bane of my life, you still won\u2019t let me go even at the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Bo Saixi, Tang San was shocked. He couldn\u2019t help standing up, looking at Bo Saixi with a dumbstruck expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s voice sank,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Tang Chen has already passed, passed into eternity. Even though he understood my feelings, and came to find me, what he showed me was still his face at the end. Three days, he only gave me three days before he left me. Then I aged ten years in a day, and ended up looking like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help being stirred up:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Bo Saixi, my great grandfather already has a demigod body, how could, how could he pass like that? You\u2019re definitely mistaken, definitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San had only met his great grandfather face to face once, in his heart, his great grandfather still held an extremely majestic position. Even someone with his father\u2019s character was filled with respect when mentioning him. Moreover, back then his great grandfather Tang Chen had already begun the process of inheriting the Asura God, his physique was already demigod level. On this trip to Seagod Island, besides inheriting the Seagod, at the same time he would also ask his great grandfather to leave. With his great grandfather overseeing things, plus his own strength, the situation on the Continent would naturally be under control. Now hearing Bo Saixi\u2019s heartbroken words, he was unable to take them for facts. With such strength, how could his great grandfather die in obscurity?</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi raised her head to look at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, sit down. I called you here to clarify these matters with you. This is also your great grandfather\u2019s explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sat back down again with heartfelt doubt, gazing at Bo Saixi with eyes filled with puzzlement.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi spoke softly in her gentle yet heartbroken voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, after your great grandfather and Qian Daoliu heard my conditions, they left the Seagod Island together. Qian Daoliu was like me, he was the guardian of a divinity, guarding the Seraphim God, he would never be able to truly become god. Therefore, he naturally chose to give up. But, your great grandfather didn\u2019t. Besides my feelings, his pride made him unwilling to return before he completed his promise to me. After untold hardships, he found it, but the latter half of his life was a nightmare. He should have told you that he discovered the Asura God\u2019s inheritance in Slaughter City, but it was also there that he lost his consciousness, becoming the host body of the Blood Red Nine Headed Bat King, and also the Slaughter King of Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently. Even though he and his great grandfather had only met briefly, he had described this.</p><br/><p>Tang Chen lived in Slaughter City for so many years, and even though he ultimately threw off the restraints with the help of your Seagod Trident, finding himself again, his body was long since completely rotted. The Blood Red Nine Headed Bat King\u2019s poison had long since corroded him. Despite the strength he possessed, his body still basically wasn\u2019t enough to endure that power. It was well enough when he was still Slaughter King and the power within him still wasn\u2019t too vast, and while controlled by the Blood Red Nine Headed Bat King he could still stay alive. But, after he regained his consciousness, his own strength, and a portion of the Asura God\u2019s power entered him, the tremendous energy immediately broke his body. He tried to endure, until he came here, until he saw me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San watched Bo Saixi dumbstruck, whispering:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was me, I killed great grandfather\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi said bitterly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot child, don\u2019t talk nonsense. Even dead, he still lived better than as that Blood Red Nine Headed Bat King\u2019s host body. Besides, you let him return to find me. Even before his death, your great grandfather still wanted glory for you. When Tang Chen came here, his body had already collapsed. I tried to think of a way but couldn\u2019t help him persevere. He originally wanted to wait for your return, to personally see his great grandson inherit divinity, possess the power of gods, but he couldn\u2019t. The Asura God\u2019s energy was too overbearing, how could his shattered body hold out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn his last three days after coming here, Tang Chen spoke with me the whole time, as if he wanted me to listen to everything on his mind over all those years. He said very, very many things, he and I chatted, and unconsciously, three days passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big teardrops rolled down Bo Saixi\u2019s cheeks, her body trembling uncontrollably, sitting there like she was demented. Whenever she recalled Tang Chen\u2019s death, her heart ached so she couldn\u2019t breathe. What she didn\u2019t say was that, after Tang Chen had drawn his last breath in her arms, she held his body unmoving for a full seven days. After seven days, her appearance had changed to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, my condoleances. I didn\u2019t expect I would only meet great grandfather once, and then Heaven would forever part us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s grief couldn\u2019t be faked. When he just came here and heard the news, it had been an enormous blow to Tang San. Even if his mental qualities were quite powerful, he still found it difficult to accept. After all, that was his great grandfather!</p><br/><p>After a long time, Bo Saixi forced herself to calm down, the grief on her face gradually disappearing. In its place was instead a gentle smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s not mention these sad things. The old will always die. These are the rules of nature. Unless one becomes god, only then is there a chance to break them. Even though your great grandfather met a lot of difficulties in Slaughter City, he still lived for more than a hundred years, and he also lived an extremely rich life. He did not live this life in vain. Everything he left behind is bound to benefit your Clear Sky School forever. The bitterness he received was all because of me. In our next life, I will definitely serve him well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore your great grandfather passed, his sole regret was that he couldn\u2019t see you become god, inheriting the Seagod\u2019s divinity. Tang San if you truly respected him, you will definitely fulfill his final wishes. Also, before he died he left something for you. Look after it well, even if only as a memento.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Bo Saixi flicked her wrist and beckoned towards the side of Seagod Palace. A red light abruptly brightened, and in a flash arrived between Bo Saixi and Tang San.</p><br/><p>That was a two meter long blood red giant sword, precisely the one Tang Chen once used to block Tang San\u2019s Seagod Trident, and also sent him flying with.</p><br/><p>The broad, slender blade was densely covered with deep golden magic patterns, the entire blood red sword brimming with extremely severe slaughter aura. Even a power on Bo Saixi\u2019s level couldn\u2019t help frowning when faced with the presence of this wicked sword, clearly influenced by it.</p><br/><p>But, as Tang San lay eyes on it, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Tang San felt nothing of what Bo Saixi did, not a trace of the sword\u2019s slaughter intent influenced him. On the contrary, as he saw this sword, Tang San immediately had an intense urge, uncontrollably raising his left hand. His palm also revealed an equally red magic pattern, its ice cold presence reaching all the way to his shoulder, and it seemed to form a perfect understanding with that wicked sword.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a question that had always puzzled Tang San was made clear, he finally understood what the blood red energy that helped him kill the Deep Sea Demon Whale King and then also had an important effect on absorbing the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s spirit ring energy.</p><br/><p>Indeed, that was a change in his Deathgod Domain, and moreover a change after it reached the highest level. It was no longer the power of the Deathgod Domain, but rather a connection to the power his great grandfather tried to inherit, the Asura God!</p><br/><p>Yes! If that wasn\u2019t the case, then how could the blood red energy filled with slaughter aura fight as equals with his Seagod\u2019s power for a time? If it wasn\u2019t a god level power, then how would his Seagod\u2019s power find it so difficult to contend with? How would the Deep Sea Demon Whale King be so completely suppressed? The Asura God, he actually possessed a portion of the Asura God\u2019s power? This, just what was going on?</p><br/><p>Reason made Tang San make the most proper choice. He sharply raised his right hand, grabbing his left hand, without letting it touch that sword. In his heart, Tang San vaguely sensed that if he touched that sword at this moment, then the Asura God\u2019s power already suppressed by the Seagod\u2019s power within him might rear its head once again. At that time, his body might once again become their battlefield.</p><br/><p>That was no joke. Last time on the bottom of the sea, he still had the Deep Sea Demon Whale King spirit ring\u2019s energy for them to absorb, but that wasn\u2019t the case now. If they really started a fight inside of him, the unlucky one might be him. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew, Tang San absolutely didn\u2019t dare think of simultaneously inheriting two divinities at once, that was pure lunacy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the Asura God might be even stronger than the Seagod he was now prepared to inherit, but even his great grandfather couldn\u2019t absorb that Asura God\u2019s divine power over so many years, and it ultimately still caused his death. This clearly showed just how overbearing it was. The Seagod\u2019s power was much more gentle by comparison, and Tang San had completed the process to inherit it step by step, gradually passing the first eight of the Seagod\u2019s nine trials and now the last. Even if the Seagod Trident was damaged, Tang San would still choose it for his inheritance, there was no need to doubt this.</p><br/><p>As a result, he absolutely couldn\u2019t give the Asura God\u2019s power within him any chance to recover. His great grandfather had left behind this sword with good intentions, giving him one more option, or to say that this Asura devilsword was very possibly the key to the Asura God\u2019s inheritance, but he absolutely couldn\u2019t touch it now. At least he had to wait until he completed the Seagod\u2019s inheritance. Inheriting a divinity really was too dangerous, and understanding the energy within this devilsword would could wait for later.</p><br/><p>In fact, Tang San\u2019s guess was at least seventy percent correct. Tang Chen did leave behind this Asura devilsword to give Tang San another option. When he met Tang San back then he had seen that Tang San already possessed the Deathgod Domain, but what Tang Hao, his son Tang San as well as Hu Liena had no idea about, was that the Deathgod Domain they possessed was actually the Asura God\u2019s first trial. As long a someone had passed the first trial, they had a chance of inheriting the Asura God\u2019s divinity. And Tang Chen leaving behind this devilsword meant that he had already passed the majority of the Asura God\u2019s power of inheritance. As long as it was a spirit master with the Deathgod Domain, they stood a chance of inheriting its divinity.</p><br/><p>The fundamental difference in the Asura God\u2019s inheritance from the Seagod\u2019s lay in the method to choose the successor. The Seagod\u2019s successor was singular. As long as one was chosen, they would be imperceptibly influenced in their cultivation until they possessed enough to complete the process of inheritance. This could be seen in how the trace of Seagod\u2019s divine intent in the Seagod\u2019s Heart saved Tang San\u2019s life several times, as well as how he directly drew the Seagod nine trials after coming to Seagod Island, and moreover taught him the Golden Thirteen Halberds\u2019 first three strikes.</p><br/><p>But the Asura God\u2019s inheritance was much more dangerous. As the god of slaughter, the Asura God\u2019s successor had even harsher requirements, and inheriting the Asura God wasn\u2019t easy even without the Rakshasa God\u2019s interference. Consequently, when the Asura God chose its successor, it cast a wide net with the thought of growing one after another. As long as they got the Deathgod Domain, they were all considered chosen. And who could inherit the god of Asura in the end, that was up to their efforts.</p><br/><p>Of course, Tang San had no idea about this. To him it seemed there was nobody else who could inherit the Asura God. The Asura God\u2019s level was half a step higher than the Seagod, Rakshasa God or Angel God. Even though the previous generation\u2019s Asura God had long since left this world, the divine intent left behind needed no carrier, as long as omeone could cultivate the Deathgod Domain to a degree where it evolved, becoming the Asura God\u2019s power, the divine intent would discover it.</p><br/><p>Previously, Tang Chen regained consciousness from Tang San\u2019s Seagod\u2019s Light, and immediately gained the Asura God\u2019s approval, and could therefore directly reach the Asura God\u2019s demigod form. As long as he also completed the inheritance, he could inherit the Asura God\u2019s divinity. After all, back then Tang Chen had already passed the majority of the Asura God\u2019s trials.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Tang Chen\u2019s physical condition no longer allowed him to undergo the inheritance, and his broken body also couldn\u2019t endure the enormous energy shock. After barely managing to reach the Seagod Island, he only persisted for three days before departing this world. Facing death, Tang Chen was of course unwilling to let his energy pass between heaven and earth, and so he focused the refined Asura God\u2019s power he had received into this Asura devilsword. He believed that as long as Tang San held this sword, he would have a chance of inheriting the Asura God. Moreover, he also specifically guided that the Asura God\u2019s strnegth was even more tyrannical than the Seagod.</p><br/><p>How could Tang San suppress the Deep Sea Demon Whale King? Because of the effect of the Deathgod Domain evolved to Asura Domain. Even gods would tremble at the Asura God\u2019s presence, and even though the Deep Sea Demon Whale King was a million year spirit beast, and also extremely powerful, its level was still far lower.</p><br/><p>The reason why one might say that there was nobody that could inherit the Asura God\u2019s strength besides Tang San right now, was just because when his Deathgod Domain evolved to Asura Domain, he had obtained the Asura God\u2019s approval. With Tang Chen dead, Tang San who possessed the Asura Domain was naturally the first successor candidate. Unless he also died, this Asura God\u2019s divinity could only be inherited by him. Of course, Tang San didn\u2019t choose to inherit the Asura God, but that was another matter.</p><br/><p>The Deathgod Domain was in some sense similar to Tang San\u2019s Seagod\u2019s Light as well as Seagod affinity. As Tang San\u2019s strength increased, the Deathgod Domain constantly evolving was actually equivalent to Tang San constantly accepting the Asura God\u2019s trials.</p><br/><p>When he faced the million year Deep Sea Demon Whale King and simultaneously detonated six spirit rings, the Deathgod Domain inscribed on the Clear Sky Hammer was stimulated by the extremely enormous energy explosion, thereby causing a qualitative leap, evolving to Asura Domain. And as Tang San added the last spirit ring to the Clear Sky Hammer, the Deep Sea Demon Whale spirit ring, it even further gave adequate energy to the Deathgod Domain\u2019s evolution, the process where the Clear Sky Hammer turned from black to red, truly completing the Asura Domain\u2019s evolution.</p><br/><p>When later absorbing energy, the Asura God\u2019s overpowering slaughter energy directly entered Tang San\u2019s body, trying to invade all his spirit bones, soaking him in divine intent, immediately suffered the already present Seagod energy\u2019s rejection. This caused the huge was inside Tang San.</p><br/><p>If the Seagod energy inside Tang San was intelligent, it would definitely have been extremely depressed. This was obviously first come, first served, and when someone had already picked Tang San for so long, some outsider wanted to come force their way in at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Although the Asura God was even a bit stronger than the Seagod, the Seagod\u2019s divine power had after all taken root in Tang San earlier, and with the Seagod Trident present and years of subtle influence of the Seagod\u2019s power finally gave it the advantage. But even so, the Seagod\u2019s power could only suppress the Asura God\u2019s power to Tang San\u2019s left arm, and not expel it. This showed how overbearing the Asura God\u2019s power was. The reason why it finally stayed in Tang San\u2019s left arm was mainly because that was where Tang San released the Clear Sky Hammer. The Clear Sky Hammer had now already become the gathering point for the Asura God in Tang San.</p><br/><p>The sword Tang Chen left behind was the condensation of years of the Asura power he had saved, and with all his remaining energy poured into it before his death, it had already reached the level of a divine weapon, gaining the Asura God\u2019s approval. Its quality was in no way inferior to Tang San\u2019s Seagod Trident, and could also be considered the intermediary for the Asura God\u2019s inheritance. Therefore, if Tang San really had grasped this devilsword, the situation within him might have immediately transformed. As for what the final outcome would be, nobody knew. No matter how overbearing the Asura God\u2019s divine power was, don\u2019t forget that this was the Seagod Palace, on the Seagod Island in the middle of the ocean. To whom the deer would fall could not be known. But it could be imagined that if the two gods fought over Tang San, he naturally wouldn\u2019t find it easy, and might be beyond all hope of salvation.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s wisdom showed an important effect at a crucial moment. He didn\u2019t covet the Asura God\u2019s power, instead firmly holding his left hand and even retreating a few steps, opening some distance between him and the Asura devilsword, resisting its intense lure without being fooled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi couldn\u2019t help asking as she watched Tang San\u2019s odd actions.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, great grandfather really left me a big gift. Only, no matter what, I\u2019d better inherit the Seagod\u2019s divinity first. The energy within the Asura devilsword great grandfather left is too overpowering, if I hold it now it might influence my inheritance of the Seagod.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi gave Tang San a deep glance, then nodded silently,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true, if I help you complete the inheritance a bit earlier, I can also be freed earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she waved her right hand and pulled on the Asura devilsword, returning it to a corner within the Seagod Palace.</p><br/><p>With some more distance between him and the Asura devilsword, its powerful attraction immediately weakened a bit, and Tang San\u2019s expression eased. In terms of willpower, with all the tribulations he had undergone, he was definitely one of the strongest in the present world. Very quickly shifting focus, he turned and looked at the largest platform in the center of the Seagod Palace. That was where he had once drawn the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi said:</p><br/><p>\u201cCall over your comrades. The Seagod\u2019s energy is too enormous, large amounts of it will overflow when you undergo the inheritance. In order to keep this place from being destroyed, them being here can not only absorb the overflowing energy, at the same time it can also protect this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, before starting the inheritance, there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San raised the Seagod Trident grasped in his right hand, holding it in front of Bo Saixi.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi looked distracted, but as her gaze fell on the empty cavity on the Seagod Trident\u2019s main blade, her expression instantly changed,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seagod\u2019s Heart? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>After meeting Tang San again, Bo Saixi\u2019s heart had been filled with Tang Chen\u2019s shadow, and she didn\u2019t pay any attention to the Seagod Trident. But now that Tang San held it out to her, Bo Saixi saw the big problem.</p><br/><p>Tang San said bitterly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, I couldn\u2019t protect the Seagod Trident. It\u2019s like this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, he described how he had been chased by Qian Renxue, how the Seagod\u2019s Heart shattered at the last moment, and the Seagod\u2019s divine intent protected him until he escaped into the ocean.</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, Bo Saixi\u2019s expression grew more and more unsightly. Looking at the Seagod Trident in front of her, she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes from flashing.</p><br/><p>\u201c...... and that\u2019s it. In order to save me, the Seagods Heart shattered. Senior, you\u2019re the Seagod Douluo, the high priest of Seagod Island, do you have any way to restore it? If not, can I still receive the Seagod\u2019s inheritance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s eyes flashed, revealing a pondering expression, but the ugly expression on her face didn\u2019t change. Clearly, the broken Seagod\u2019s Heart wasn\u2019t so easily mended.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, do you still remember the Seagod\u2019s seventh trial, Draw, Divine Instrument, Seagod Trident?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi lowered her voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you certainly remember that when you saw this trident for the first time, it didn\u2019t have the Seagod\u2019s Heart. After you drew it, the Seagod\u2019s Heart was branded on it. The Seagod\u2019s Heart was something you originally brought here. And in fact, the Seagod\u2019s inheritance also mainly relies on the Seagod\u2019s Heart. The Seagod\u2019s Heart wasn\u2019t in the Seagod Island, where it went, even I as the Seagod Island\u2019s high priest cannot say. Only when it meets a suitable candidate for the Seagod\u2019s divinity will it fuse with them, and silently guide the chosen one here to experience the Seagod\u2019s trials. Only after experiencing the trials can they become Seagod. The importance of the Seagod\u2019s Heart is obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the circumstances you described, I can first of all be certain of two things. Firstly, the Seagod\u2019s Heart had a very high approval towards you, that\u2019s why it wouldn\u2019t hesitate to be damaged in order to save you. And second, the Seagod Trident has also lost its intelligence due to the Seagod\u2019s Heart being broken, thereby making you lose the capabilities of this divine weapon. In the materials the Seagod left behind, it is clearly stated that the lord Seagod utilized the majority of his power through the Seagod Trident. It is obvious that the Seagod Trident has an enormous effect on the inheritance process. Since you could kill the Deep Sea Demon Whale King, and also pass the preceding trials so easily, if the Seagod Trident was here, you could certainly extremely smoothly finish the inheritance. But, now that the Seagod\u2019s Heart is gone, without the support of the Seagod Trident, I also don\u2019t know what will happen during the inheritance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no way to restore the Seagod\u2019s Heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi sighed:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, the Seagod\u2019s Heart is not something I am capable of understanding. I don\u2019t even know how it can be restored. Maybe, if you can complete the Seagod\u2019s inheritance, this Seagod Trident will recover on its own. But this inheritance will also turn incomparably difficult. You\u2019re Tang Chen\u2019s great grandson, and also his most outstanding descendant, and also so outstanding that you\u2019ve reached rank ninety nine before you\u2019re thirty. Honestly, Tang San, from my point of view, or maybe from your great grandfather\u2019s point of view, I don\u2019t want you to proceed with the inheritance. You know that if you fail, you will only die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I understand your kind intentions. But, I can\u2019t possibly not proceed. If no gods ever appeared in this world, then my current rank ninety nine strength should be enough to deal with it, and not becoming a god wouldn\u2019t matter. But the god of angels has already appeared, and if I can\u2019t complete the Seagod\u2019s inheritance, then there is nobody in this world to oppose her. I can\u2019t watch the Spirit Empire unify the entire Continent. If you won\u2019t allow me to proceed with inheriting the Seagod\u2019s divinity, then I have to take even greater risks and try with the Asura divinity my great grandfather left me. But you also know that even someone with my great grandfather\u2019s astonishing talent finally ended up dying. Moreover, I already possess a large amount of the Seagod\u2019s divine power, if I chose to inherit the Asura God, it might be even more dangerous. Therefore, please help me, senior. I promised the Seagod Trident that, no matter what, I would definitely help it recover. It\u2019s my partner, I can\u2019t leave it soulless like this forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi watched Tang San;</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really have thought it over. Without the aid of the Seagod Trident, it\u2019s very likely you will die nine times out of ten in the process. Just like how the god of Angel\u2019s inheritance required the Angelic Raiment as intermediary, helping the successor with absorbing the divine power, the Seagod\u2019s inheritance also needs the Seagod Trident to guide the energy and continuing the process. Without the Seagod Trident, you won\u2019t have any buffer in the inheritance. You might even suffer even more brutal trials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, you don\u2019t need to try persuading me. I\u2019ve already decided, inheriting the Seagod is my only choice. I have no way to retreat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Tang San, your stubbornness is exactly like your great grandfather\u2019s. All you Tangs are so stiff. Even a kid who seems to think so carefully and act so reservedly is no different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t speak up again, but the increasingly resolute light in his eyes had already answered Bo Saixi. Yes, he had no choice. In order to defeat Qian Renxue, in order to avenge his parents and Xiao Wu, in order to end the continental war, he had to do this.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi waved her hand, looking a bit tired, she turned towards the central stage in the Seagod Palace,</p><br/><p>\u201cCall your comrades here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, please keep it secret for me. I don\u2019t want my friends to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi nodded silently.</p><br/><p>Tang San then opened the Seagod Palace\u2019s great gates, stepping out into the sunlight.</p><br/><p>The seven Seagod sacred pillar guardian Douluo as well as the Shrek Six Devils all waited outside. Seeing Tang San walk out, Xiao Wu and the others showed questioning expressions.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded quietly to them:</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone follow me inside. We will begin the inheritance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the seven Seagod sacred pillar guardian Douluo changed practically simultaneously. Among them, Seawitch Douluo seemed to want to say something, but was stopped by Seadragon Douluo.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San was completely immersed in the impending inheritance, and didn\u2019t notice these details. Calling out to his friends, he turned and returned to the Seagod Palace.</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo watched the other guardians with a strict gaze, until the other six slowly lowered their heads. Led by Seadragon Douluo, they fell to one knee at the same time, shouting:</p><br/><p>\u201cOur respects, lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thick Seagod Palace gates closed behind the Shrek Seven Devils, isolating inside and outside. Seawitch Douluo couldn\u2019t suppress her agitation,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, why must the divinity be inherited? Lord Bo Saixi is already pitiful enough\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo sighed:</p><br/><p>\u201cSeawitch, don\u2019t talk drivel. Have you forgotten our mission? Our mission is the descent of the new Seagod. To personally witness this scene already makes us more fortunate than generations of guardian Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seawitch sobbed:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the price for the Seagod\u2019s inheritance is lord Bo Saixi\u2019s life!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Grandmaster once said that the best method to deal with control system Spirit Masters, was precisely with control versus control. If speaking of strength system Spirit Masters as the core of the team, auxiliary system Spirit Masters as the team\u2019s foundation, agility attack system Spirit Masters as the team\u2019s eyes, then, control system Spirit Masters were the team\u2019s soul. Over these three months of devilish training Tang San had constantly strengthened his body, at the same time Grandmaster had every evening still specially given him special training, the target of which was the Eight Spider Lance[1] external spirit bone hidden in his vertebra.</p><br/><p>This name Eight Spider Lance was chosen by Grandmaster, since this external spirit bone was obtained from the Man Faced Demon Spider and greatly resembled eight spider lances. Undergoing this period of training, Tang San went from unsuitable to suitable, by now he was already able to control the movements of the Eight Spider Lances effectively for attack and defense, at the same time he was capable of releasing and restraining the poison within the Eight Spider Lance. Grandmaster said that relying on this external spirit bone, in addition to his control system spirit Blue Silver Grass, he could completely resist an opponent under roughly fortieth rank.</p><br/><p>The three hastily ate dinner, Fatty also ate two of Oscar\u2019s recovery sausages, before the four then quietly slipped out of the Academy. Ma Hongjun did not intend to tell the others, after all, this matter of being beaten up in Grass Nest couldn\u2019t be particularly glorious.</p><br/><p>Just when the four walked out of the Academy gate, suddenly, a dark shadow appeared, obstructing their way.</p><br/><p>Since Ma Hongjun was beaten, right now he was already somewhat jittery, he had released his spirit in practically the first moment.</p><br/><p>Red purple flames lit up the darkness, letting the four clearly see who was obstructing their path.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun loosed a breath, withdrawing his Phoenix flames,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, must you scare a person to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>This person suddenly appearing before them, was Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu today wore brown trousers and a simple close fitting white top, although her body wasn\u2019t as fiery as Zhu Zhuqing, the slender feeling of her body had a different distinct style, especially that astonishing slenderness. Also the extreme flexibility of her small waist, and that lustrous black scorpion braid hanging to her feet behind her, gave her even more of a next door little sister sense of beauty. A pair of big dark eyes stared sceptically at Tang San\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing sneaking off like evil spirits? Fatty, why is your face so swollen? You let someone beat you up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun sighed, Tang San and the others were after all men just like him, he had no taboos with them, but Xiao Wu was a girl. Always dissatisfied with his method of settling the Evil Fire. For a moment he was immediately somewhat unwilling to say he had been beaten.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu took a few steps forward, in the moonlight clearly seeing the condition of Ma Hongjun\u2019s face, immediately hopping with righteous indignation,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was this violent? Unexpectedly beating you like this. Boss Dai, it wouldn\u2019t be you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai curled his lips,</p><br/><p>\u201cWould I act so violently against my own brother? Fatty was beaten like this by a love rival. We were just about to go find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for, count me in. Daring to beat my brother, he can\u2019t want to preserve his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s character was motivated by a desire to see the world in chaos. When just entering the Academy, she was somewhat biased towards Fatty, but over this time, with everyone mutually looking out for each other in this devilish training, the bias had faded long ago. Even more, back at Nuoding Academy she was the Big Sister boss, never short of fights when looking for one, now ordinarily everyone exchanged pointers according to a plan, finally with the opportunity for a fight she appeared even more anxious than Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth sister[2], you truly are too good. How about I devote my body to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Wu not only didn\u2019t stop everyone\u2019s revenge, but on the contrary immediately joined in, Fatty was immediately greatly moved. The depression in his heart also immediately disappeared somewhat, the last line clearly held his always vulgar nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would devote your body to who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Fatty, his voice somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>Fatty looked at Tang San, hurriedly smiling awkwardly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI said nothing, third brother[3], let\u2019s hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four became five, taking advantage of the night, again setting foot on the familiar path, the five used spirit power, heading towards Suotuo City at lightning speed.</p><br/><p>In a fraction of an hour.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, is this where you ordinarily settle your Evil Fire issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s eyebrows both scrunched together.</p><br/><p>Before them right now was a row of single story houses. This was a remote corner of Suotuo City. The houses in front were only three meters tall, looking damaged in many places, in the doorway hung several pink lanterns, below the lanterns stood several clearly not young prostitutes with heavy makeup and gaudy dress peddling themselves to people passing by.</p><br/><p>The corners of Oscar\u2019s mouth twitched,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you always say grass nests also hold golden phoenixes, this truly is a grass nest, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Ma Hongjun\u2019s tastes, Dai Mubai and Oscar truly didn\u2019t dare compliment. For Xiao Wu and Tang San it was the first time in this kind of place, apart from curiosity, they had no special feeling.</p><br/><p>Fatty only guffawed twice, in a low voice saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cheap here, ah, the price is cheap and quantity excessive, one silver coin for one time, two silver coins for three. The quality to price ratio is high. Moreover, you must believe the principle of grass nests also holding golden phoenixes. This depends on luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai glared at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t say I know you. Although I knew you aren\u2019t picky, I still didn\u2019t expect you to go as far as this. Coming to this kind of trashy place, the age of those golden phoenixes of yours could compare to your aunts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty somewhat indignantly angry said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Dai, don\u2019t deliberately ridicule me, let\u2019s first deal with business. You wait here, I\u2019ll go ask if that bastard hasn\u2019t left.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Fatty quickly walked towards the \u201cgrass nest\u201d.</p><br/><p>Oscar looked around everywhere,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really remote, it suits the task. I, your father, have a large sausage, I, your father, have a small sausage, I, your father, have a mushroom sausage\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Oscar chant his spirit incantations, starting to prepare for the battle ahead, Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t refrain from making a light spitting sound,</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly worthy of being called Big Sausage Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a moment, Ma Hongjun animatedly ran back,</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect, that fellow still hasn\u2019t left, he only paid the bill just now. I estimate he\u2019ll come out at once. Brothers, for helping me take revenge this time, I\u2019ll host you later and invite everyone to eat a good meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai vigorously waved his hand at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense, I wouldn\u2019t dare go to a meal hosted by you. With your tastes like this, just forget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Dai Mubai\u2019s words, even Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t help but nod, she and Tang San had seen the unconstrained twin sisters Dai Mubai had brought, comparing those top quality twins with these \u201caunties\u201d before them was practically like heaven and underground.</p><br/><p>While they talked, one person already walked out of the grass nest. Tang San\u2019s group stood in a dark corner across from Grass Nest, by now the color of the sky was already completely black, from across the street this side was very difficult to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty gnashed his teeth.</p><br/><p>Just like Fatty\u2019s description, walking out from \u201cGrass Nest\u201d was a forty something middle aged man. Dark skin, one meter sixty tall, on his face a satisfied lascivious smile, right hand wrapped in gauze, wearing large pants with several holes, on his feet a pair of large sandals[4], looking self satisfied as he walked down the street. While walking he hummed a little tune,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle\u2019s mood is good today, ah, the bird came out to stroll[5].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty already cracked his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu grabbed Fatty\u2019s plump shoulder, the other hand throwing back the scorpion braid, on her charming face appearing a harmless smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out in a moment, watch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Xiao Wu took small steps, from the side walking out to that vulgar uncle called Bu Le.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Xiao Wu doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun somewhat puzzled looked to Tang San. Who other than Tang San could understand her best.</p><br/><p>Tang San clapped a hand to his forehead, somewhat helplessly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu didn\u2019t look like she walked quickly, but was just right to block that vulgar uncle\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello uncle. May I ask, is there a place selling candy nearby?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Le had just left Grass Nest, entire person soaked in satisfaction. The sudden voice made him start, raising his head to look towards the source of the voice. Immediately, that appearing straightforward face of his had a kind of particular lustre, a certain place on his body immediately stirring.</p><br/><p>It had to be said, in the night suddenly appearing before him was such a pleasant sight as Xiao Wu. Young and tender fair young face, long black scorpion braid, although not particularly ample, she still had a figure to some extent, in particular the youth and inexperience on her rosy face, was even more attractive to an old pervert like this. Bu Le\u2019s eyes shone as he saw Xiao Wu, saying inwardly, \u2018such a beautiful and lovely little loli. Heavens, Earth, don\u2019t tell me this is your gift for me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Coughing, Bu Le swiftly restrained the obscene light in his eyes, sticking out his chest, assuming a neat posture, changing so quickly that if Xiao Wu hadn\u2019t kept her eyes on him all along, she might have been tricked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle miss, you\u2019ve still come out to buy candy this late, ah? This is so remote, aren\u2019t you worried you\u2019ll run into bad people?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bu Le had a serious face, adding to his simple and honest outward appearance, he still truly had a somewhat dignified appearance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu blinked with her beautiful big eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen uncle, are you a bad person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her soft spoken appearance made Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun and Oscar not far away twitch. Was this flirty Xiao Wu still the same person who had thrown them around like sandbags in fights? This, this was even beyond acting. Only Tang San\u2019s face expressed a wry smile and no surprise, he had already experienced this kind of scene long ago at Nuoding Academy. In deception, Xiao Wu was even better than what Ning Rongrong did when she just arrived at the Academy. Especially when assuming that next door neighbour little sister appearance, practically no man was immune to it. The difference was, proper people seeing her like this would only feel tenderness, but a person like Bu Le seeing the current Xiao Wu would only drool.</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Wu\u2019s question, Bu Le immediately said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course uncle is a good person. Little miss, what are you called, how old are you, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s little face quickly blushed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Xiao Wu, almost thirteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Le was expressionless, thinking to himself, \u2018almost thirteen, in other words twelve?\u2019 His adam\u2019s apple moved vigorously as he swallowed. If he didn\u2019t eat this tender morsel delivered to his mouth, he would truly be letting himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are this tall even at twelve, in the future you will certainly be a great beauty. Xiao Wu, there\u2019s no place here that sells candy, come with uncle, uncle will bring you to buy candy, afterwards I\u2019ll see you back home. All right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu smiled, nodding cutely, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Le hadn\u2019t expected this little miss would be tricked so easily, seeing her agree to go with him, he was immediately exultant, small eyes looking around, going in the direction of a remote place he remembered. In order to not beat the grass to scare the snake[6], he resisted grabbing and pulling Xiao Wu\u2019s little hand.</p><br/><p>Oscar rubbed his eyes hard, poking Tang San at his side,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, is this really Xiao Wu? Why can\u2019t I see any resemblance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat strangely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBack at Nuoding Academy, there were girls molested by a strange uncle. Xiao Wu used just this maneuver, luring that person into a dark corner, afterwards came the Eight Stage Drop[7].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEight Stage Drop? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai also couldn\u2019t help but be curious.</p><br/><p>In Tang San\u2019s eyes expressed a trace of fear,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most violent kind of throw in Xiao Wu\u2019s Soft Skill. Eight throws in succession. As long as the first throw succeeds there is practically no chance to resist. That is Xiao Wu\u2019s true strength. Therefore, by no means meet her at close range. I expect that this strange uncle called Bu Le-something, might be fortunate enough to taste this great banquet. Let\u2019s catch up with them to prevent accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now Bu Le\u2019s lascivious heart was greatly stirred, with his forty sixth rank spirit power, if he was a bit alert like normal he might discover Tang San and the others following, but right now his heart was entirely focused on this young and fresh little loli by his side, with none to spare for others. How would he also know that, sometimes, loli was interchangeable with demon[8].</p><br/><p>Furtively glancing at Xiao Wu, her slender waist swaying slightly as she walked, her butt was not at all large, but her waist was really too slender, that resulting curve made this old pervert Bu Le constantly stealthily swallow. Adding to Xiao Wu\u2019s close to perfection beautiful complexion, a beautiful girl walking beautifully. The Evil Fire that had previously been dispersed was already rising within. To an old pervert his age, the outside was especially important, how could Xiao Wu before him be compared to those free range chickens in the grass nest?</p><br/><p>Further and further away, already very few pedestrians could be seen around. Bu Le brought Xiao Wu around a corner, reaching a secluded and dark little alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, where is the candy store, this is so dark, I\u2019m a little scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu spoke softly, apparently somewhat panicked.</p><br/><p>Bu Le smiled mischievously, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, ah, this late at night, eating candy is no good for the body. Let uncle bring you to see goldfish[9].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee goldfish? Where is there goldfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Bu Le stopped walking, stretching out his hand and starting to untie his trousers,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu suddenly smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, your next line wouldn\u2019t be \u2018I, your father, have a big sausage\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Le\u2019s hands stiffened, his movements immediately coming to a halt, he looked right into a pair of red colored eyes, eyes brimming with Demon Confusion, his entire body immediately becoming rigid, and in the next moment, before him, only remained a smear of purple shadow.</p><br/><p>Tight around his neck, not waiting for Bu Le to release his spirit, that black scorpion braid was already winding around, and in the next moment, Bu Le only felt a force at his neck, his entire body involuntarily leaving the ground.</p><br/><p>If Bu Le had been a power type Spirit Master, perhaps he still would have had a chance to stabilize himself. Unfortunately, he was a control system Spirit Master. But if a Spirit Master couldn\u2019t release their spirit, their strength would also be greatly weakened. Adding to his \u201cindustrious plowing\u201d for a whole day, his strength had long ago dropped by more than half. The current Bu Le only felt the sky spin and earth go round, the next moment he could only see stars.</p><br/><p>Gold stars, silver stars, stars of all sizes flickered continuously, the violent shaking making him completely unable to focus his spirit power to release his spirit. His body didn\u2019t even feel pain, only a strong numbness.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai, Oscar, Tang San and Ma Hongjun had by now already walked out from the darkness. Besides Tang San, the other three without exception stared wide eyed, looking at that previously still acting soft and immature lovable figure now with incomparably berserk movements. This was also the first time they saw the full set of Xiao Wu\u2019s Eight Stage Drop.</p><br/><p>Using the teleportation ability, when Xiao Wu disappeared from in front of Bu Le, her long ago already accumulated power meeting the completely mentally unprepared him, Xiao Wu\u2019s scorpion braid successfully wrapped around Bu Le\u2019s neck. In the next moment, vulgar strange uncle Bu Le\u2019s miserable life had already begun.</p><br/><p>Binding his neck, Xiao Wu\u2019s one foot stepped on his lower back, the first spirit ring ability Waist Bow activating. Neck bending backward, feet moving forward, Bu Le\u2019s body already flew into the air.</p><br/><p>The scorpion braid quietly slipping off, Xiao Wu jumped after Bu Le\u2019s body thrown into midair. That Waist Bow strength of hers was truly terrifying, with thirty first ranked spirit power, one hundred twenty percent amplification, she directly threw Bu Le five meters up.</p><br/><p>When Bu Le\u2019s body climbed to its peak was also precisely the moment Xiao Wu caught up, both hands grabbing Bu Le\u2019s waist, Waist Bow\u2019s strength activating once more, with a snap of her slender waist bringing Bu Le to spin backwards. Currently Bu Le was still bewildered by Xiao Wu\u2019s Demon Confusion, besides the feeling of sky spinning and earth revolving, he could feel nothing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was grabbing the clothes at Bu Le\u2019s waist, revolving a full two turns in midair, as she dropped towards the ground, under the effect of Waist Bow, Bu Le\u2019s rapid spinning made a kind of hair-raising whistling sound and smashed into ground.</p><br/><p>That moment, Tang San\u2019s group closed their eyes at practically the same time. They could imagine the kind of strength of being thrown in a spiral from high in the air like this, Xiao Wu had also used it when competing against them before, only at that time she had directly thrown them in midair towards the sky, and not like this truly throwing them towards the ground.</p><br/><p>Today Bu Le could be considered having bad luck, meeting Xiao Wu, this little baleful star, in addition to his vulgar appearance being what Xiao Wu disliked the most. In this fight she basically didn\u2019t have any intention of starting off leniently. In Xiao Wu\u2019s heart, for this kind of strange uncle who didn\u2019t intend to let off even a twelve years old little girl, even killing wasn\u2019t too much.</p><br/><p>However, Bu Le was after all a forty something ranked Spirit Ancestor, in the two rapid rotations, he also finally awoke from Xiao Wu\u2019s Demon Confusion. Although there wasn\u2019t enough time for him to use his spirit, he still managed to cover his whole body with spirit power, protecting himself. But in the next moment, the violent shock already scattered the spirit power he had gathered.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014-, Bu Le\u2019s body heavily smashed into the ground, Xiao Wu had smacked his body flat onto the ground, each part of his body in contact with the ground, there wasn\u2019t even enough time for Bu Le to scream, blood overflowing from his nose at once. He was completely dumb from the throw. But, this was only the beginning.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu hardly paused, with both hands pressing on Bu Le\u2019s waist made a backflip, both legs pressing directly on either side of Bu Le\u2019s head, Waist Bow activating yet again, throwing Bu Le directly forward. The hands had released, but her legs were able to generate even greater force. Under the driving force of Xiao Wu\u2019s legs, following Xiao Wu\u2019s backflip, Bu Le\u2019s entire body flew up to once again smash into the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu now fully revealed the flexible strength of her waist. With the help of the rebound from this second throw, body flipping over and back, she slammed Bu Le back in his previous position. Bu Le\u2019s body was whirled around by Xiao Wu\u2019s legs like a burlap sack, altogether six times, around the third, his bones started making snapping sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck me, fuck me, \u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and the other two\u2019s gazes continuously followed Bu Le\u2019s body thrown around with all of Xiao Wu\u2019s strength. Each time he was thrown, they couldn\u2019t help but cry out in alarm, blood already splashing next to their feet. Finally, as Xiao Wu once again threw Bu Le\u2019s body, it was without again directly throwing him on the ground and rather throwing him into the air, the six continuous throws were considered finished. In addition to that first spiral drop from high in the air, it was already a full seven drops.</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>Whether it was Dai Mubai, Oscar or Ma Hongjun, all silently thought, if this was them being dropped seven times, what would the scene be like. Perhaps even the strongest Dai Mubai would immediately lose consciousness, even if he had already used his White Tiger Vajra Transformation, when thrown by Xiao Wu like this perhaps his spirit power would come apart from the shock.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu yet again leapt up, but when Dai Mubai\u2019s group thought she would once again use the killing spiral drop from high in the air, Xiao Wu didn\u2019t make those kinds of movements. The current Bu Le was already completely in a semi-conscious state. When Xiao Wu caught up to him, both her feet once again pressed at his neck. She rotated one thousand eighty degrees at lightning speed, with Bu Le\u2019s neck squeezed by her, naturally he could only follow along with her turn, his neck constantly making cracking sounds. Even if the vertebra didn\u2019t come apart, it still wasn\u2019t much better.</p><br/><p>After the one thousand eighty degree turn, Xiao Wu made an elegant backwards summersault, Waist Bow activating one last time, directly throwing Bu Le towards the ground. She also made use of the opposite force from throwing Bu Le to flip several times through the air, landing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014-, the vulgar strange uncle Bu Le smashed into the ground in a kind of extremely monstrous posture. Apart from his whole body twitching, he didn\u2019t make any other movements.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun looked at the slightly panting Xiao Wu who had landed not far from him, probingly asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, you didn\u2019t kill him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu gave the twitching body of Bu Le a glance,</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling him would dirty my hands. I have propriety. Little San wouldn\u2019t let me casually kill people. I only gave him a lesson, that\u2019s all. However, I expect he\u2019ll be out in bed for three months before recovering. By my calculations, several of his joints were dislocated by my drops. For a time, I\u2019m afraid he really will be unable to take care of himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai somewhat gloomily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came here to fight, when you\u2019ve thrown him around like this, we have farts to beat, ah. Only, Xiao Wu, your Eight Stage Drop really is powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar added:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe key point is that her teleportation is too abnormal, once within a five meter range of her, even running is impossible. Furthermore, Xiao Wu, that Waist Bow ability can be used consecutively? Is there no need to aggregate spirit power between uses?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu giggled, as if the impressive feat just now hadn\u2019t been accomplished by her,</p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously I had to condense spirit power, only, after I reached thirtieth rank, there is no longer any need for time. Besides, even if I had to aggregate spirit power, the interval between each Waist Bow is already enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San suddenly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, in the future don\u2019t use that kind of method to lure the enemy again. It\u2019s too dangerous like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu looked blank a moment, looking at Tang San\u2019s serious eyes, she stuck out her tongue, but nodded cutely.</p><br/><p>What Tang San didn\u2019t say was that when he watched Xiao Wu go to entice Bu Le, for some reason, his heart was extremely uneasy.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai waved his hand, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll leave. Fatty. This fellow is more miserable than you. It counts as your revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun had after all not used his own hands, right now he still somewhat hadn\u2019t resolved his anger. Running up next to Bu Le, he raised his foot and stepped down several times with an effort, while stomping he hatefully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting you beat me, letting you beat me. Letting you say my pecker[10] is small. Ai, all right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeming to suddenly recall something, Ma Hongjun smiled mischievously,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go ahead first, I\u2019ll come right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai frowned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be harsh, although this fellow beating you isn\u2019t any good thing, but it still isn\u2019t a deadly crime. You hurry it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Dai Mubai, Tang San, Oscar and Xiao Wu turn around the corner and disappear, Ma Hongjun\u2019s face revealed a monstrous smile. Raising his right hand, a red purple flame appeared in his palm, and his gaze moved to Bu Le\u2019s lower body.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange uncle, didn\u2019t you say I had a small pecker? Fine, then I\u2019ll let yours become a roast chicken[11].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaah\u2014-\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s group still hadn\u2019t gone very far, hearing the unhumanly bloodcurdling scream, the four looked face to face, and somewhat helplessly shook their heads.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Fatty already animatedly chased after them, without waiting for any questions, immediately took the initiative to say:</p><br/><p>\u201cBe at ease, I did nothing like that. I wouldn\u2019t let him die. Xiao Wu was right, killing him would dirty our hands. Fifth sister[12], many thanks for today, if there is anything you have need of this Fatty for then don\u2019t hesitate to ask, as long as I can get it, I won\u2019t decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu cackled,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for repayment. That throwing just now was very invigorating. It\u2019s been quite a while without something so pleasurable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San seeming to ponder something said:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, what we did was no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo good? Little San, you wouldn\u2019t be soft hearted, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai somewhat puzzled looked at Tang San. Although Tang San was ordinarily very calm, he didn\u2019t seem like a soft hearted person. He could still clearly remember the appearance of Tang San fully using his hidden weapons, even Zhao Wuji suffered a small loss.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, cutting grass without rooting it out, once the spring wind blows it grows again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others\u2019 gazes at Tang San immediately changed somewhat. Although they were all genius Spirit Masters, they were after all only teenagers, with regard to murder, perhaps only Dai Mubai could accept it. Nobody expected Tang San would say something like this.</p><br/><p>Tang San never forgot the guiding principles written in Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record. Tang Sect Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record General Principles, third item: Ascertain the opponent is an enemy, as long as they chose the path of killing, never hesitate, otherwise one\u2019s worries will only increase.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat vulgar strange uncle Bu Le didn\u2019t die this time, perhaps the matter will stay at that. But in the end he has more than fortieth ranked spirit power. If he musters a group of friends for revenge, you be careful Fatty. Although who beat him was unclear, by hearing alone, adding to his clash with you in the daytime, he will certainly guess it was you who brought people in.\u201d</p><br/><p>If previously Dai Mubai didn\u2019t say Bu Le\u2019s sins weren\u2019t worthy of death, Tang San already would have acted. Right now he was only reminding Ma Hongjun so he wouldn\u2019t later come to grief.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun swallowed, </p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it would be little San who was the fiercest! Apparently, if one offends somebody it shouldn\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San showed a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we came here you didn\u2019t seem to address me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026, fine, big brother San, and little sister Xiao Wu as well, many thanks for the matter this time, I would still ask you brothers to help keep this a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai raised his hand to lightly pat the top of Fatty\u2019s swollen head,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur own brother, why are you saying such nonsense? Let\u2019s go back quickly. We can\u2019t let Grandmaster discover we were out so late, unless you want more devilish training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>Shrek Academy, dean\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Gang, I don\u2019t want to disturb your teaching of those little monsters of ours, but, I have no choice but to regretfully inform you, the Academy\u2019s little bit of money has already been spent by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Somewhat helplessly saying this, Flender had a sad expression.</p><br/><p>As a formidable Spirit Sage, but whose arrogance kept him from wealth, what kind of sorrow was this.</p><br/><p>According to normal expenses, the tuition the students paid would be sufficient for the expenditures of one academic year. There would even be a bit left over. But Grandmaster\u2019s education plan was in another class, not only did food expenses go up considerably, but along with the food the medicines mixed into the students\u2019 baths every day were even more frightfully expensive. Over these past three months, of this year\u2019s tuition for Shrek Academy there was already nothing left.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded, as always with that rigid face, and said indifferently:</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender said with a wry smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got it, then propose a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce these seven days of rest are over, I will bring them to undergo the second stage of training. You needn\u2019t worry, I will settle the issue of expenses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender sighed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWere it not for these children being so outstanding, I truly wouldn\u2019t think to go on. It\u2019s still the days we together travelled the Continent that moved me the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster showed a brief despondency,</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps there will be a day we can repeat that happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender couldn\u2019t help but ask:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Gang, how are you planning to teach these children in the next stage? Wouldn\u2019t it be taking it easy for a bit, in these three months they have suffered bitterly. They\u2019re after all just teenagers. As they say \u2018excessive hardness leads to an easy break\u2019, don\u2019t be too excessive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s expression again recovered to its normal state, </p><br/><p>\u201cSince you gave these children to me to teach, you can only place your full trust in me. I have measured it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>Limp on the ground, Bu Le was still constantly twitching, but by now he had already woken from unconsciousness. This was already the third time he had awoken. The first two times he woke up the incomparable pain all over his body had instantly brought him back into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Clenching his teeth to resist the pain, Bu Le forced his eyes open, a scorched smell constantly assaulted his sense of smell, but what made him despair the most, was the complete lack of sensation in his lower body. He knew that his whole life might be over. He wanted to move, but could only barely squirm, his four limbs were completely dislocated, even his elbows and knees were separated. At least five ribs were broken. Of his cervical vertebra[13] at least two were displaced.</p><br/><p>[1] ()</p><br/><p>[2] \u201cFifth [younger] sister\u201d Xiao Wu is the fifth oldest, Ma Hongjun is the fourth.</p><br/><p>[3] \u201cThird [older] brother\u201d Tang San is the third oldest.</p><br/><p>[4] Flip-flops, to be precise.</p><br/><p>[5] Sort of a literal translation to what I assume is a lewd song with some wordplay.

The luo in demon () means gauze, and is the same as in Douluo and Star Luo.</p><br/><p>[9] The Chinese equivalent of \u201cpuppies in my van\u201d, stems from a pedophile case in Hong Kong.</p><br/><p>[10] He uses (jiji ), which is a childish way of saying penis, but the character () also means \u201cchicken\u201d, which we all know is sort of a trigger for Fatty.</p><br/><p>[11] Pun alert.

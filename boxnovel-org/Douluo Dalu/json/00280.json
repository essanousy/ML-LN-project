In the first engagement, one was thrown into Bibi Dong\u2019s all out attack by Xiao Wu\u2019s Burst Kill Eight Stage Drop and met a violent death, and Yang Wudi left Snakelance Douluo near death. The Title Douluo that lent his mental strength to Bibi Dong was also seriously injured when he was implicated in the mental attack, leaving only five Title Douluo in fighting shape.</p><br/><p>Seeing Bibi Dong blasted flying by Tang San\u2019s attack, striking the walls so hard she bled, the ignorant Title Douluo leapt down almost at the same time, two of them catching Bibi Dong, the other three guarding in front, warding Tang San\u2019s follow up attack. Seeing Tang San leave, they all couldn\u2019t help but breathe a huge sigh of relief. In today\u2019s battle, this seemingly extremely young, but extremely cunning youth that had given them enormous losses, had left a deep shadow in the hearts of these peak experts of the spirit master world. Especially when Tang San had taken back the Seagod Trident, they really had no hope of fighting him.</p><br/><p>The Heaven Dou Imperial Army drew back five li like a tide before they stopped under Grandmaster and marshal Ge Long\u2019s command, then again arrayed themselves into neat formations that looked as if they were ready to launch a second assault at any time. When the order to retreat came, the Golden Sacred Dragon had already split back into Grandmaster\u2019s trio. When Tang San charged the fortress, Grandmaster had already ordered the other six Shrek Seven Devils to move up and prepare to support Tang San. They were just in time to welcome him back.</p><br/><p>Gathering with his comrades, Tang San immediately reached out with his left hand and pulled Xiao Wu close, whispering:</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a bit of strength, bring me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he struggled to draw breath, swaying softly, scaring Xiao Wu enough to hurriedly infuse him with her spirit power and support him. The feeling Tang San now gave Xiao Wu was as if he might collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San softly shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils had been together for so many years, they already completely understood each other. Oscar immediately produced a big recovery sausage, letting Tang San eat it. The six crowded around him, swiftly returning to camp.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the Tang Army was already moving again. Only, this time they didn\u2019t attack, but rather swept the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Each of the crossbow bolts the Tang Sect forged was priceless, and they only carried one hundred twenty on their person, plus forty eight in the crossbow, each Tang Army soldier was only equipped with one hundred sixty eight bolts. That\u2019s why they had to recycle crossbow bolts from the battlefield, to use them again. This was also why Grandmaster and marshal Ge Long didn\u2019t lead the army the whole way back. With them as deterrent, the Spirit Empire army in Jialing Pass wouldn\u2019t dare act without thinking hard first.</p><br/><p>The people on the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s side that could see something wasn\u2019t right with Tang San was only those of Spirit Douluo strength and above, and Grandmaster who was extremely familiar with him. In the eyes of the common soldiers and even the spirit master legion, he was king Lan Hao returning in victory after crushing the enemy. In their eyes, Tang San was now simply synonymous with the word unequalled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Lan Hao! Long live, long live, long long live!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two hundred thousand strong army gave Tang San a hero\u2019s welcome. Each soldier raised the weapons they held high, cheering indiscriminately.</p><br/><p>Ordinary people could only see battles between spirit masters in the great spirit arena, and even then it was impossible to see Title Douluo level fights. For the majority of the common soldiers, this was the first time seeing spirit masters of this level fight. Tang San\u2019s Seagod Trident had left too deep of an impression, and their cheering like landslides or tsunamis was completely unorganized, completely heartfelt. In their eyes, it was this young king Lan Hao defeating Spirit Empire Empress Bibi Dong as well as a host of Spirit Empire powers that had ld them to this victory.</p><br/><p>Heroes were frequently those with the deepest impact. The entire Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s morale was already at a peak. Before this battle, who could have thought that the Spirit Empire\u2019s spirit master legions would actually break so easily? Not even sixty percent of the Spirit Empire\u2019s heavy legions had returned to Jialing Pass in the end. Those were losses of at least thirty thousand in the previous battle. Even more importantly, there was no longer any way of reforming the Spirit Empire\u2019s all spirit master Sacred Dragon Legion.</p><br/><p>This was a perfect victory, a perfect victory nobody had imagined. The Heaven Dou Empire that had an absolute numerical advantage from the start, had relied on this battle to pressure the Spirit Empire till they almost couldn\u2019t breathe. Not only was morale at the lowest, but a shadow had even been left in the hearts of those generals. So much that some even feld schadenfreude over the Sacred Dragon Legion\u2019s losses. After all, the spirit legions\u2019 lofty position had always in the past made people not only jealous, but those arrogant and despotic Spirit Empire spirit masters had always had a very strained relationship with the ordinary generals and soldiers.</p><br/><p>Tang San clenched his teeth and endured. The originally hundred something jin Seagod Trident that he would easily swing around, now felt like it weighed thirty thousand in his hand. His spirit power overdraft was a bit better, somewhat alleviated by eating Oscar\u2019s big recovery sausage. His body was after all extremely tough. But, his mental strength\u2019s overdraft was still immensely painful, as if his entire brain was hollowed out. And this mental strength was something he could only recover himself.</p><br/><p>Marshal Ge Long asked Grandmaster:</p><br/><p>\u201cState Preceptor, won\u2019t we assault once again? Right now is when our morale is highest, and enemy morale is lowest. Perhaps we can even charge into the city, and eve if not, we can still use attrition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strategy is of course marshal\u2019s decision. Only, I personally believe that now isn\u2019t a good chance for assault. Even though Jialing Pass has low morale, the Spirit Empire\u2019s soldiers also know what the pass being broken means for them. Most important is that there is still a Spirit Empire elite spirit master legion behind the pass. Marshal, absolutely don\u2019t get careless because we defeated the enemy\u2019s spirit master legion today. You saw the true power of a spirit master legion in our attack just now, but our six thousand spirit masters are far from being able to compare with any Spirit Empire spirit master legion. Them fortifying the terrain leaves our side\u2019s Tang Sect unable to show the might of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow. If we force a charge, the losses might be disastrous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Marshal Ge Long\u2019s original haughtiness was already completely obliterated after this battle. Whether Grandmaster or Tang San, the strength they revealed and the might the Tang Army as well as the spirit master legion showed when commanded by Grandmaster, had given him a very large shock.</p><br/><p>Listening to Grandmaster, he pondered:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Our first battle was a great victory. Being too risky really is inadvisable. Come, pass on my orders. Sound the gongs for recall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heaven Dou Imperial Army slowly withdrew, neatly returning to the camp fifty li away, and Xue Beng personally met them. Even though he didn\u2019t understand why the army just withdrew, he didn\u2019t express any concerns on the field. Questioning the commander before the troops absolutely wasn\u2019t sensible.</p><br/><p>When they returned to camp, Tang San was already in a daze. He didn\u2019t even know how he entered the camp and returned to his own tent. When Xiao Wu helped him lie down, he immediately fell into deep sleep. Ever since his mental strength reached the Boundless level, and especially after entering the Title Douluo level, this was the first time Tang San had been this severely overdrawn. He was even more exhausted than when he connected his father\u2019s meridians or helped his mother resurrect.</p><br/><p>That one Asura Demon Light had exhausted Tang San\u2019s mental strength, will and spirit power.</p><br/><p>Tang San slept for a full three days. Each of these days the Heaven Dou Imperial Army would routinely invite battle, but Jialing Pass remained shut. After the walls were quickly mended, they let the Heaven Dou Imperial Army shout and curse outside, no matter what going out to battle again.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s overdraft was admittedly severe, but Bibi Dong\u2019s injuries were even more serious. Not only was she injured by the Seagod Trident, even more important was Tang San\u2019s last Asura\u2019s Light, which knocked Bibi Dong unconscious almost immediately. After being rushed back by the five Title Douluo, she always remained unconscious. Jialing Pass was already in a bit of chaos, fortunately there were still those five Title Douluo as well as the Angel Legion who managed to keep it under control. But they clearly didn\u2019t agree to go out on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The Heaven Dou Empire also moved over siege equipment, trying to siege the walls. But the results were minimal, and moreover came with large losses. Just as Grandmaster said, when the Tang Army\u2019s hidden weapons couldn\u2019t show their power, and the spirit master legion within the pass joined the defense, it was difficult for the Heaven Dou Empire to advance a single step even with millions of heroes.</p><br/><p>What Tang San first saw when he woke from unconsciousness was black hair flowing like a waterfall, Xiao Wu in white, leaning over next to him, sleeping very sweetly. Her silky black hair was like a blanket, drawing the outlines of her perfect curves. Looking at her, Tang San\u2019s heart was immediately filled with tender feelings. His mental strength exhaustion was already almost recovered, and his spirit power was basically already restored without needing him to deliberately cultivate since he reached great accomplishment in Mysterious Heaven Skill.</p><br/><p>Quietly snuggling up to Xiao Wu, he pulled her into his arms. Feeling that rich feeling that made his pulse speed up, Tang San couldn\u2019t help lower his head and softly kiss Xiao Wu\u2019s red lips. He loved her too much, even such a simple embrace constantly stirred up the softest parts of Tang San\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Four lips met. Xiao Wu\u2019s tender body trembled slightly as she woke back up. As she opened her eyes and saw Tang San, her arms already half raised to push him away instead circled around his neck like water snakes, answering passionately. Her two slender legs even more directly twisted around Tang San, like an octopus, she fitted close to Tang San. That completely alluring feeling made Tang San\u2019s blood boil almost instantly.</p><br/><p>Just as Tang San couldn\u2019t help caressing Xiao Wu\u2019s butt, and the two were already somewhat unable to hold back, a shout came from outside,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, is little San awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this voice, Tang San and Xiao Wu separated as if by electric shock. Raising the tentflap, Liu Erlong walked in from outside. Seeing Tang San\u2019s awkward expression and Xiao Wu\u2019s charming blush, Liu Erlong immediately revealed an envious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I disturbed you kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu shyly jumped over to Liu Erlong, grabbing her arm and rocking forcefully to hide her embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong laughed in spite of herself:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shake, you\u2019ll break my weary old bones if you go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s mood had already recovered, smiling:</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt[1], you\u2019re still very young!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong rebuked:</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough flattery. Since you\u2019re awake, me and your teacher can both be relieved. Recuperate properly, don\u2019t mind what\u2019s happening outside. The Spirit Empire is already playing a turtle in its shell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, I\u2019ll go take a look anyway. Physically I\u2019m already fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he nodded apologetically to Xiao Wu, who gave him a warm smile in return, coming over to pull Tang San\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the State Preceptor as well as the Heaven Dou Empire spirit master legion commander, Grandmaster had a large tent of his own, specially for discussing strategy with the high level spirit masters. As Tang San and Xiao Wu were led there by Liu Erlong, the tent was already bustling. The Shrek Seven Devils were present as non voting delegates, and at the same time Poison Douluo Dugu Bo, Strength Hall master Tai Tan representing the Tang Sect, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master and spirit master legion deputy commander Ning Fengzhi, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School elders Sword Douluo Chen Xin and Bone Douluo Gu Rong, and Shrek Academy dean Flender were also there. Not one wasn\u2019t a high level power of the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s spirit master world.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s appearance immediately made everyone show happy expressions. Poison Douluo was the one who hid his thoughts the least, and directly stepped forward to give Tang San a big bear hug,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Freak, I knew you were more tenacious than a cockroach. How is it, all recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf an old freak like you is fine, how could I have any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince little San has come, he\u2019ll attend as a non voting delegate. We\u2019ll continue the conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Tang San was late, he didn\u2019t insist on sitting in front even though his position in the Heaven Dou Imperial Army was exceedingly high. He just pulled up a chair and sat next to the other Shrek Seven Devils.</p><br/><p>Even though Grandmaster and Ning Fengzhi occupied the first seats in the big tent, seeing the calm and composed Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master, Tang San couldn\u2019t help sighing to himself. The events back then had in the end left repercussions. Ning Fengzhi\u2019s judgement wasn\u2019t wrong, but he had personally assumed responsibility for lessening emperor Xue Ye\u2019s lifespan, otherwise, whether in terms of seniority or strength, he should have sat in the seat of the State Preceptor. This was presumably also the reason Ning Fengzhi planned to leave the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master position to Ning Rongrong after the war. Ning Rongrong and the seven devils\u2019 relationship would inevitably improve the misunderstanding between the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Heaven Dou Empire, even more so when even if Xue Beng hated the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, he still wouldn\u2019t dare really do anything to them. After all, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School was extremely closely related to the Shrek Academy as well as the Tang Sect, and these three great systems supported the entire Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s spirit master world. Consequently, Xue Beng could only suppress the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School with authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespite our army\u2019s overwhelming victory in the first battle, heavily damaging the Spirit Empire army as well as the spirit master legions, the present circumstances are still extremely unfavorable to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster continued his speech. Perhaps it was because of holding a high position these years, but his rigid face was a bit more dignified.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur army might seem to have millions of heroes, with vast imposing manner, suppressing the Spirit Empire army until they don\u2019t dare leave Jialing Pass. But in fact, with Jialing Pass fortified, they have it a lot easier than us. We have to guard against surprise attacks at any moment, but they have pretty much no concerns in that respect. At the same time, and most important, is that just because our army is big, the consumption of supplies is astronomical. We can\u2019t afford delays. Even though we\u2019ve always prepared all these years, if it drags out like this, before long the logistics won\u2019t be able to keep up and our army will collapse without a fight. On the surface the Spirit Empire has much fewer troops than us, but relying on the natural defenses of Jialing Pass plus their enormous numbers of spirit masters, it\u2019s very difficult for us to break through. Even if we want a war of attrition with the enemy, that\u2019s also not that simple. The Spirit Empire possesses tens of thousands of spirit masters, but we only have thousands. If we don\u2019t dispatch spirit masters during siege assaults, then our soldiers will be consumed at a frightening pace. If we send spirit masters, we basically can\u2019t afford the losses. Either we find a good way to storm the pass, or, we draw the Spirit Empire out on the field again. And our conference today is on how we can achieve these two possibilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Grandmaster, practically everyone frowned. Jialing Pass was like a flawless stronghold, walls and moat incomparably firm, and behind stood a numerous spirit master army as the cornerstone of the defense. In such circumstances, the Tang Army the Heaven Dou Empire used to restrain the Spirit Empire\u2019s spirit master legions couldn\u2019t show their effect and effectively kill enemy spirit masters. The trouble they understood, the Spirit Empire naturally understood as well. The purpose of their current entrenchment was to drag down Heaven Dou.</p><br/><p>The original plan formulated by marshal Ge Long was for a war of attrition with the Spirit Empire, relying on the formidable national power to smash the enemy. But after the last few days of trying to launch assaults with the army, the result was completely different from the planned circumstances. Due to the large number of Spirit Empire spirit masters assisting the defense within Jialing Pass with powers like trees in the forest, the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s losses during siege assaults was astonishing. This wasn\u2019t even the most important point, most important was that while they suffered large losses, the Spirit Empire\u2019s losses could basically be neglected. If it went on like this, marshal Ge Long\u2019s original plan would undoubtedly be broken.</p><br/><p>Siege equipment was basically nothing before spirit masters, practically the same as losses from soldiers. In the first two days, marshal Ge Long had once proposed that Grandmaster lead the spirit master legion to assist the assault, but Grandmaster had vetoed.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s explanation to emperor Xue Beng was very simple. If the Heaven Dou Empire possessed the same number of spirit masters as the Spirit Empire, assisting the assault was naturally no problem, it was just a question of losses. But, the actual gap in spirit masters between the Heaven Dou Empire and the Spirit Empire was too large. If the spirit masters assisted in the assault, as long as Jialing Pass turned their ballistae to fire on the Heaven Dou Empire spirit masters, they would definitely suffer disastrous losses. If their foundation was harmed, then there would be no way to continue this war.</p><br/><p>Xue Beng agreed with Grandmaster\u2019s explanation, but the crucial point was that he wanted to wait until Tang San recovered to hear his proposal. The deep impression Tang San left in the first battle that day had also given this new Heaven Dou emperor a huge surprise.</p><br/><p>Only then did Xue Beng understand why his father regarded Tang San so highly, naming him as king Lan Hao. Besides the Tang Sect\u2019s enormous effect on the Heaven Dou Empire, Tang San\u2019s own growth potential was also the most important part. Only, even if emperor Xue Ye was resurrected, he might not have imagined Tang San\u2019s potential would be roused quite this quickly.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked towards Ning Fengzhi,</p><br/><p>\u201cSchool master Ning, what do you suggest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San has recovered, so we better listen to him first. This world already belongs to young heroes like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Fengzhi say this, Grandmaster\u2019s rigid face couldn\u2019t help showing a faint smile. To him, Tang San was undoubtedly the greatest pride of his life, even more glorious than his position as State Preceptor. When he heard Ning Fengzhi praise Tang San, Grandmaster hardly concealed his happiness. Being without children of his own, Tang San was his child.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze turned to Tang San, smiling faintly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen little San, tell us, do you have any good plans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San pondered:</p><br/><p>\u201cAt present I seem to have two ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else couldn\u2019t help staring shocked at Tang San. These last days they\u2019d always been considering it from different angles, but without getting any good ideas. Tang San had only just recovered, and had actually straight up told them he had two plans to solve the problem without even asking what had happened over the last days.</p><br/><p>Tang San stood:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, school master Ning, all seniors. What teacher said is correct, a frontal confrontation is definitely unwise. Jialing Pass is easily guarded but hard to attack, causing us too many losses. Forcing the attack would very possibly turn this pass into a meatgrinder. Bibi Dong was seriously injured in the last battle, and by my expectations she won\u2019t appear on the field again within half a month. But she can still give orders. I think that no matter what method we use to draw them out, the Spirit Empire won\u2019t easily take the field. Of my two methods, the first possesses a certain degree of risk. Everyone here are on the same side, and all seniors are very familiar with us Shrek Seven Devils. Among us seven, my second brother Oscar\u2019s original name at Shrek Academy was Sausage Monopoly. And now he is already a food type Spirit Douluo past rank eighty. Among the many sausages his spirit can produce, the third spirit ring ability is known as Swift Flight Mushroom Sausage. With Oscar\u2019s current strength, the flying mushroom sausages he makes can allow anyone to fly for ten minutes, at a speed that at least equals an early level Phoenix Tailed Crested Serpent. That is already a considerable speed. After it produced, the Flying Mushroom Sausage is effective if used within ten days. In ten days, if my second brother has everyone\u2019s help, he should be able to produce at least twenty thousand flying mushroom sausages. If used on my Tang Army, every man can have two sausages. If my Tang Army suddenly takes to the air while the army assaults the front and attacks the enemy spirit masters on the walls of Jialing Pass, it will inevitably be quite effective. Two flying mushroom sausages is enough for every Tang Army soldier to fly into the air, fire the Godly Zhuge Crossbows three times, and return to the formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, everyone\u2019s gazes instantly focused on Oscar, their eyes brightening at the same time. Tang San\u2019s idea was undoubtedly brazen and imaginative, but thinking carefully, in theory it should be quite workable.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a very good suggestion. If it\u2019s done appropriately, we can definitely give the Spirit Empire spirit masters another big surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, this method also has risks. First of all, our Godly Zhuge Crossbow bolts will be fired into the walls, and will be very difficult to retrieve. Three volleys will waste forty eight thousand crossbow bolts, more than a quarter of our entire supply. Second, after our Tang Army flies into the air, they will definitely become moving targets. Even though the Godly Zhuge Crossbows has excellent range, spirit masters over rank sixty specializing in ranged attacks will still very easily be able to attack. Plus the fortress ballistae, the Tang Army might suffer very large losses. Best is if the spirit master legion is thrown in with a full scale attack. Only like this will our attack have its greatest effect, and the losses kept at a minimum.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, everyone nodded one after another. At present, this was the best plan they had heard.</p><br/><p>However, Tang San very quickly surprised them again,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy second method is comparatively safer. That is for me alone to destroy the enemy\u2019s defenses as far as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone probably saw my fight with Bibi Dong that day. Relying on the Seagod Trident, Jialing Pass\u2019 solid walls are nothing. As long as I have enough time, I can even completely level their defenses with the ground. My second plan is for me to attack Jialing Pass\u2019 defenses at close range while protected by all you seniors. I believe I can destroy faster than they can rebuild. Doing it this way will not only likely draw out the enemy spirit master legion to attack, but at the same time also pave the way for our future main attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Tang San paused, his eyes flashing,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, in my opinion, the best way is to use these two methods at the same time. To us, Bibi Dong\u2019s injuries is a rare opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence. The entire tent sank into silence. Each person thought deeply, their brains moving swiftly, calculating all kinds of possibilities.</p><br/><p>Tang San sat back down in his seat. His two plans wasn\u2019t something he came up with on the spot, he had already thought it over on the way to Jialing Pass. He couldn\u2019t command an army, but with his agile mind, as a control type spirit master he could still think of the best way to apply the power of spirit masters.</p><br/><p>After a full half stick of incense of time, Grandmaster sharply stood from his seat, drawing everyone\u2019s eyes. He looked towards Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, let\u2019s go. Come with me to see His Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without question, everyone also saw that after Grandmaster had carefully calculated, he was completely convinced by Tang San\u2019s proposal.</p><br/><p>Only Oscar had a bitter expression, looking miserably at Tang San. Tang San laughed in spite of himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, it seems you\u2019d better start making sausages now. Rongrong, stay with little Ao. Work in secret, the faster the better. Twenty thousand sausages, not one less. The faster you move, the sooner we can launch the attack. Our greatest opportunity is while Bibi Dong is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 </p><br/><p>Seven days later, in front of Jialing Pass, the battlefield that had stood silent for several days was bustling once again. This time The Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s million man army was fully mobilized. The fastest light cavalry, the solid heavy cavalry and heavy infantry, as well as large numbers of regular infantry, were all arrayed in formation, gradually advancing. Even though the numbers were enormous, they still neatly slowly pushed forward in units of legions.</p><br/><p>On the walls of Jialing Pass, standing in the main position in place of Bibi Dong was astonishingly Hu Liena. Hu Liena had been appointed from sickbed. Bibi Dong had been unconscious for a full seven days after the last engagement, and after she woke up she immediately sent orders for Hu Liena, who at the time was in charge of the Spirit Empire\u2019s army supplies, to take over her position, defending with all strength. As the Spirit Empire\u2019s previous Spirit Hall Holy Maiden, Hu Liena had an extremely high position among all the spirit masters related to Spirit Hall. Adding that she was Bibi Dong\u2019s personal disciple, even though it wasn\u2019t enough to attack, it was plenty to defend the walls.</p><br/><p>Right now Hu Liena stood on top of the walls, at the head of five Title Douluo, with a serious expression attentively watching the millions of soldiers slowly approaching Jialing Pass, frowning deeply.</p><br/><p>That was an army of millions! Even though the battle still hadn\u2019t begun, the intangible pressure from such an army still made it hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>Bibi Dong and two severely injured Title Douluo were still gone. After all, not many possessed Tang San\u2019s recovery capability, and their injuries were even more severe than Tang San\u2019s. Even though Bibi Dong\u2019s recovery ability was also very strong, unfortunately, this time it was her soul that was wounded. Tang San\u2019s attack was an extremely heavy blow to her, and injuries to the soul could only be slowly restored with time. The half a month Tang San gave for her to recover was originally a conservative estimate. In fact, after Bibi Dong woke from seven days of unconsciousness and gave a series of orders, she had fallen back into unconsciousness. It was only in the last two days that her condition had taken a turn for the better.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly maiden, no need to worry. The Heaven Dou Empire is just acting strong. If they really do dare attack, we\u2019ll teach them a harsh lesson. The Angel Legion has already finished preparations, and even though the Sacred Dragon Legion took great losses, the remainder are still elites. Our spirit masters still number more than fourteen thousand, more than twice that of the enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speaker was a Title Douluo next to Hu Liena. Listening to him, Hu Liena slowly shook her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the Heaven Dou Empire shouldn\u2019t be blustering this time. Please watch, even though that special troop you mentioned previously are somewhat to the rear of the formation, they\u2019re all filled with a murderous aura. If it\u2019s just a token threat, they absolutely wouldn\u2019t appear like this. Also, the Heaven Dou Empire troops furthest ahead all give me the same kind of feeling. Pass on my orders, prepare the whole army. Very possibly, the Heaven Dou Empire is taking advantage of my teacher\u2019s injuries to launch their main attack. At the same time, pass on my orders to cut the four drawbridges. That will block the Heaven Dou Empire from sending experts to forcing them open. Move the whole Sacred Dragon Legions up on the walls, keep the Angel Legion at level one readiness within the walls. Prepare for battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Possessing the Deathgod Domain just like Tang San, Hu Liena at this moment fully revealed her killing intent, showing her strong side before all the high officers and first rate spirit masters.</p><br/><p>[1] Aunt - To be precise, Tang San addresses her as \u201cteacher\u2019s wife\u201d ()</p><br/>\n</div>"}

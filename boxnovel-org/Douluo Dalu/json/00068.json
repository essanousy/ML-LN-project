From his expression, Tang San could see he didn\u2019t believe in the power of the Yama\u2019s Invitation in his hand.</p><br/><p>Actually, even Tang San hadn\u2019t expected he would be able to refine the Yama\u2019s Invitation.</p><br/><p>As the third ranked in the Hundred Weapon Separation of the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record, how couldn\u2019t he be excited? In his previous world, any one in the martial world would tremble when hearing the name of the soul and life capturing Yama\u2019s Invitation.</p><br/><p>In order to refine Yama\u2019s Invitation, Tang San used forty nine kinds of precious herbs near the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, in order to make this Yama\u2019s Invitation\u2019s poison irresistible.</p><br/><p>These black little needles basically weren\u2019t metal, but were completely condensed from poisonous substances. Once it entered the body it would immediately turn back into poison, taking effect immediately.</p><br/><p>Let alone an antidote, even if one existed, there wouldn\u2019t be a chance to use it. There wouldn\u2019t even be enough time for a hero to cut off his wrist.</p><br/><p>Yama\u2019s Invitation, how could it be so easily received?</p><br/><p>However, the technique for launching Yama\u2019s Invitation required enormous internal strength. By Tang San\u2019s calculations, to have enough Mysterious Heaven Skill to use Yama\u2019s Invitation, he would need to reach at least the fortieth rank, and moreover his entire internal strength would only be enough for one attack.</p><br/><p>But this was already sufficient. Even if Tang San hadn\u2019t tried it, he could be certain that even if he was unable to kill powerful opponents, as long as he could get the Yama\u2019s Invitation to pierce the skin, then the opponent would soon have his life and soul captured.</p><br/><p>Cautiously putting the jade box within Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, Tang San thought to himself that this was fortunately at the side of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, otherwise, where would he find so many precious herbs? Unfortunately, the two higher ranked hidden weapons couldn\u2019t be created just with herbs.</p><br/><p>Sorting out his thoughts, Tang San looked at Dugu Bo. Over this past half year, Dugu Bo\u2019s appearance had changed considerably. The originally wretched green hair had already become an ordinary grizzled color and, besides his eyes, his green tint had gradually vanished.</p><br/><p>Half a year of medication left Dugu Bo practically without the pain from the poison backlash. But he had after all been poisonous for many years. Completely purging himself was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was already extremely satisfied with his present condition. Naturally he was aware of his circumstances. At the same time he could be certain that using the same method to eliminate his granddaughter\u2019s poison wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, return it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo noticed Tang San looking at him, and extended his right hand to make a gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn it? Return what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled asked.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me you still want to keep my pearl your whole life? I\u2019d hate to part with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat astonished said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid I\u2019ll poison your medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cBy now I\u2019ve internalized the poison skills, gathering them in my spirit bone. Mere poisoning, I suspect there isn\u2019t any kind of poison that can kill me. Even if those little needles of yours could really deal with a Title Douluo, they would be useless against me. Quickly give it back, haven\u2019t you had enough benefit from it alread? In this half year your spirit power has already reached the thirty seventh rank. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll absorb all the energy of the pearl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled. He knew that even if Dugu Bo didn\u2019t want to admit it, he already didn\u2019t have any wariness towards him. In this half year he had also gradually come to understand Dugu Bo. This seemingly extremely ferocious Poison Douluo actually wasn\u2019t much different from common elders. Even if the words that came out of his mouth were frightening, his basic character wasn\u2019t bad. As long as he wasn\u2019t threatened or offended, he wouldn\u2019t casually go looking for trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it. Frankly, I\u2019m also a bit reluctant to part with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Dugu Bo with a smile, spreading his arms.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo stepped in front of Tang San, raising his hand to push at Tang San\u2019s stomach. A scorching hot energy immediately provoked a contraction in Tang San\u2019s dantian, and immediately afterward, along with Dugu Bo drawing his hand up, the hot flow followed up to the throat. Tang San opened his mouth, and with a green light the pearl flew out, falling into Dugu Bo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Even though it seemed like such a small thing, Tang San still relaxed his whole body. The threat to his life that had troubled him for half a year was finally dealt with. In fact, he hadn\u2019t had any way to deal with Dugu Bo\u2019s pearl.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, my poison is also practically under control, and recently I\u2019ve felt your antidot have less and less of an effect on me. There\u2019s a lot of poison accumulated within me, I know that myself, it\u2019s impossible to completely store it in the spirit bone. Besides, my body has already adapted to a certain degree of poison, if I didn\u2019t have any at all, it might actually be harmful. I\u2019ll consider it treated here. Later I\u2019ll bring your teachers as well as my granddaughter, and once you\u2019ve cured Yan-yan, you can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting me leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Dugu Bo. He didn\u2019t know why, but deep down he was somewhat reluctant to go. Was it a reluctance to part with these precious herbs around the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well? Perhaps, but that wasn\u2019t everything.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s expression seemed somewhat lonely,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still young, I can\u2019t keep you here for a lifetime. It\u2019s a pity, if you were a few years older, I\u2019d marry my beautiful granddaughter to you, then you could call me grandpa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San helplessly shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about it, it\u2019s enough for that granddaughter of yours to inherit your traditions. Besides, she\u2019s already got a lover. The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan\u2019s direct heir, wouldn\u2019t he be more outstanding than me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, are you provoking me? Even if the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan is powerful, compared to your background it doesn\u2019t count for anything. Besides, that kid Yu Tian-Heng still lacks a lot compared to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy background?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly, unconsciously recalling his, for several years unseen, even without a letter, father, he couldn\u2019t help sighing,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat background, I\u2019m just a blacksmith\u2019s son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo also stared blankly. Over this half year he had also gained a considerable understanding of Tang San. From his expression he could clearly see that Tang San wasn\u2019t deliberately putting on an act.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, tell me about your past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo pulled Tang San to sit by the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, and besides his greatest secret of passing into this world, he didn\u2019t hide anything about his life since coming to this world.</p><br/><p>At once, he spoke of everything from his childhood, spoke of his innate full spirit power, twin spirits, even further spoke about taking Grandmaster as his master, as well as entering Shrek Academy and everything that happened afterward, he recounted everything in detail.</p><br/><p>Carefully listening to Tang San\u2019s story, Dugu Bo was inwardly astounded. Even if he was still certain that Tang San was that person\u2019s son, he hadn\u2019t expected he would be left like that in his childhood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where did you learn about poison? Picking up a book to reach this level? This old man doesn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San grinned,</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you believe it. It\u2019s a secret, I\u2019m not telling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave it at that. Take this.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Dugu Bo pulled out a blue leather purse from somewhere and tossed it to Tang San.</p><br/><p>The leather purse was only the size of two adult palms, the kind that was hung from the belt. Even if it was much larger than a spice bag, it could comfortably fit in one hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Are you bribing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San suspiciously untied the leather purse, without asking he knew this was a spirit tool,</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have Teacher\u2019s Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. You keep this, or give it to your granddaughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is different from the one you have. My granddaughter doesn\u2019t like playing with these drugs, giving it to her is a waste. It\u2019s called Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse[1]. Even though that spirit tool of yours is pretty good, it\u2019s still a bit lacking compared to this. Because, yours can hold dead things, mine can hold living things.</p><br/><p>Tang San was intelligent, and immediately understood what Dugu Bo was saying. His lips moved slightly, whistling quietly.</p><br/><p>A thread of jade light whooshed out from Tang San\u2019s bosom and into his palm, it was precisely that five cun long, entirely jade green Nine Segment Jade.</p><br/><p>In the past half year the Nine Segment Jade had shown a not inconsiderable change. Its size hadn\u2019t changed, but its little eyes had become even more sparkling, its whole body also close to transparent, jade green as if carved from perfect jade, red and white streams moving within its body, and when it was motionless it appeared like a decoration rather than a living thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, this little creature can be held inside without suffocating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression was pleasantly surprised. A spirit tool that could hold living things was vastly different from his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. It wasn\u2019t just holding the little Nine Segment Jade in his hand, even herbs could be kept fresh inside. Like this, he wouldn\u2019t need to render herbs into pills to carry them. In fact, a lot of herbs that could be used fresh would have a better effect the fresher they were.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Tang San\u2019s surprised face, and grinned,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now you seemed to say you didn\u2019t want it, yes. Then give it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he extended his hand and gestured at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because he had been together with Dugu Bo for so long, but Tang San\u2019s character had also been a bit infected. With no trace of politeness he hung the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse on his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I? I can\u2019t remember. Giving me something then still wanting it back, are you still a Title Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s only you and me here, what\u2019s a Title Douluo? Title Douluo are still people. I promised you that as long as you could cure my poison, I would grant you three things. The first you\u2019ve already said, I can\u2019t injure Shrek Academy\u2019s people. If I give you this Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, isn\u2019t it a second?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San winked at Dugu Bo, somewhat innocently looking at the Poison Douluo,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, just now you were the one who took the initiative yo give it to me. Why should I care what you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was immediately angry, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t have a way against Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly smiled, touching his waist, he flicked his wrist, holding out his palm to Dugu Bo,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse can\u2019t be considered one of the conditions, I can\u2019t take something for nothing. I\u2019ll give you this in return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Tang San\u2019s palm. In it quietly lay two not very large iron balls, completely pitch black, without any visible features.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Poison? Or a tonic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo sniffed, but didn\u2019t smell anything, and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see? These are two iron balls. Where would there be any drugs, old freak, don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t even tell the difference between medicine and metal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo glared at him, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can these two things compare to my Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they. They can save your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted disdainfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, there\u2019s no problem with your brain. This old man is a Title Douluo, there aren\u2019t many people in this world who could prevail over me, just a few people with abnormal strength, what can relying on these two iron balls do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? Then fine, I would be reluctant to give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he was about to withdraw the iron balls.</p><br/><p>With a flash of green light, before Tang San could turn his wrist, those two iron balls were already in Dugu Bo\u2019s hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cGiving things and then taking them back, aren\u2019t you the cheeky one? Tell me. What use are these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo held the two iron balls in his left and right hand, but didn\u2019t see any result. Using the other hand to pinch one, he was just about to test its strength when Tang San hurriedly stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die? Don\u2019t pinch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San caught Dugu Bo\u2019s wrist. Even though his strength didn\u2019t have any effect on Dugu Bo, Dugu Bo still held a lot of trust in him and quickly relaxed his grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? So mysterious, quickly tell me. What is this thing really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo asked somewhat impatiently. His curiosity wasn\u2019t any different from normal people. Even though he expressed disdain on the surface, in his heart he was still certain that something a little freak like Tang San would give him as a gift wouldn\u2019t be any ordinary goods.</p><br/><p>At this Tang San sternly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is known as a Cluster Soul Chasing Ball[2], its one of the most potent hidden weapons I can make right now. You must absolutely be careful with it. Once it suffers enough external pressure or a hit, its power will appear immediately. These things are used two together. They have to be used with a swift throwing technique. Perhaps its immediate power isn\u2019t enough to harm a Title Douluo, but its unexpectedness and power is enough to stop any enemy. The greatest feature of these is the user\u2019s internal\u2026\u2026 Eh, no, the higher the spirit power, the more powerful it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two little things can be powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was still somewhat unconvinced.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try them for you to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, grabbing the two iron balls in Dugu Bo\u2019s hands, he weighed them in his hands.,</p><br/><p>\u201cLook closely.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, white light flickered around Tang San, and with a flick of his wrists the two iron balls flew out simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Even though they flew out simultaneously, the two iron balls travelled one after the other. The moment the one in front was about to lose momentum, the rear one suddenly chased after it, directly striking the one in front.</p><br/><p>With a bang, a purple fog filled the air, in a flash covering more than ten square meters.</p><br/><p>With Dugu Bo\u2019s eyesight, he clearly saw what was happening inside the purple fog. Countless small filaments burst out with a delicate hum, in an eyeblink piercing into the not distant mountain wall.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is called \u2018cluster\u2019, indicates the burst attack after the iron balls have ruptured. This purple fog is extremely poisonous. It has a potent anaesthetic effect, and as long as someone inhales a little bit, ordinary people will sleep for ten days. Even powerful Spirit Masters who thoughtlessly get affected with be forced to slow down. And after the two Cluster Soul Chasing Balls collide, they will immediately emit the filaments within. Those are several hundred Bone Changing Soul Needles[3], specially for breaking big dipper defensive qi, with a matchless poison that, once hit, will spread quickly, ossifying their path like cotton.\u201d</p><br/><p>These Cluster Soul Chasing Balls were what Tang San had made while in seclusion at the Shrek Academy. It was considered a combined product of both mechanical class and throwing class hidden weapons, ranked fifth among mechanical class hidden weapons. When he was at Tang Sect, Tang San had been specially in charge of producing these Cluster Soul Chasing Balls, and it was also by making these that Tang San had been considered the first or second best among Tang Sect outer disciples.</p><br/><p>This time Tang San had made altogether eighteen, or to say nine pairs.</p><br/><p>Originally they had been unpoisoned since he didn\u2019t have the ingredients, but since coming here and spending this time refining, these Cluster Soul Chasing Balls had become truly complete.</p><br/><p>As a result of having all kinds of top quality drug ingredients here, these Cluster Soul Chasing Balls\u2019 Bone Changing Soul Needles were even a bit better than in his previous life.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s figure flickered, and he already appeared by the Bone Changing Soul needles in the mountain wall. As he looked closer at everything before him he couldn\u2019t help but inhale deeply.</p><br/><p>Countless black little holes had appeared on the mountain wall, each one penetrating several chi inside, faintly blue smoke emerging, and just by using his nose he could detect that dreadful poison.</p><br/><p>Turning back to Tang San, Dugu Bo couldn\u2019t help but sigh in admiration:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, I really don\u2019t know if I should call you a genius or a lunatic. You can even make these things. I really don\u2019t know how your head is put together. However, looking at this attack power, it still seems far from enough. Let alone a Title Douluo, even a sixtieth or seventieth ranked Spirit Master would have enough defensive power to withstand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, tell me, what rank am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo moved back towards him,</p><br/><p>\u201cOver thirtieth, not more than fortieth anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now I said that when using these things, the higher the spirit power, the more powerful the attack. In other words, the when the Cluster Soul Chasing Ball is used with even more powerful spirit power, it will be faster, and naturally the Bone Changing Soul Needles\u2019 penetrating power will be even more powerful. Unless you encounter a purely defensive Title Douluo, with your spirit power, don\u2019t tell me you still couldn\u2019t injure the enemy? Even if the opponent blocks with spirit power and doesn\u2019t let them collide, once it\u2019s struck by external force it will still instantly burst. The key point to this thing\u2019s strength is its suddenness, the more unexpected its use, the higher the chance of destroying the enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes brightened, now he completely understood Tang San\u2019s meaning, and immediately exulted in his heart,</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed pretty good, little freak, quickly gift me a hundred eighty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was speechless,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think these are sweet peas? A hundred and eighty. I\u2019ve made two, and just now gave them to you to test. Who had you refuse to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes opened wide,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me angry? You made two and still used them for a test. Tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing is believing, if I didn\u2019t let you see it with your own eyes, would you have believed it? Fine, in fact I made four, and I\u2019ll give you another two. Take care of them this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking he waved his hand, and two iron balls flew towards Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo had just now seen the power of Tang San\u2019s Cluster Soul Chasing Balls, and even though he wasn\u2019t worried with his strength, he still jumped with fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little freak, are you trying to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo hastily condensed his spirit power into a defensive screen in front of him.</p><br/><p>But who knew that these two iron balls were thrown with a completely different technique than the last ones, and the moment the nearly reached Dugu Bo they stopped in midair, and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo stretched out a hand and seized the two iron balls. Inwardly he sighed in admiration, \u2018this little freak\u2019s strength might not be up to my own, but these little tricks are still truly outstanding. Perhaps in the future his achievements will surpass even mine.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though if one looked only at their value, the two Cluster Soul Chasing Balls clearly weren\u2019t equal to his Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, looking at the Cluster Soul Chasing Balls\u2019 ability to save his life they were still more useful to Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Collecting the two iron balls, Dugu Bo clasped his hands behind his back and faced the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, when will you be prepared to treat my granddaughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked distracted a moment. Dugu Bo\u2019s words were the same as asking when he would leave.</p><br/><p>All people had feelings, and Tang San had been here even longer than he\u2019d been at Shrek Academy. Even though Dugu Bo had been brimming with menace at the start, over this time the two had developed a relationship of teachers or friends that Tang San was reluctant to part with.</p><br/><p>If not for Dugu Bo, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t have been able to merge his understanding of medicine between these two worlds in so short a time, and it would\u2019ve been even more impossible to make those three Yama\u2019s Invitations.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, are you so eager to get rid of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Dugu Bo\u2019s somewhat lonely back.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I should keep you here for a lifetime? The outside world is a much vaster place, that is where you should go. Without enough experience, what will you rely on to climb over the Title Douluo position in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mask his admiration of Tang San. If the age gap hadn\u2019t been to large, perhaps this should have been called the mutual admiration of talent.</p><br/><p>The air seemed to become heavy, neither Tang San nor Dugu Bo spoke, Tang San didn\u2019t reply to Dugu Bo\u2019s question, he only stepped forward to stand at his side, looking out at the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, frowning slightly, pondering deeply.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Tang San\u2019s furrowed brows suddenly smoothed, seemingly having figured something out, looking at Dugu Bo with a card up his sleeve,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, you still have to do two things for me, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man always keeps his word, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate my principles, I\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fine, I\u2019ve already thought of the other two things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s brows wrinkled, thinking, \u2018this stinking brat, what does he take my promises for, doesn\u2019t he know how important these three commitments could be for him?\u2019 Relying on his Title Douluo strength, they weren\u2019t something to play around with.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, gazing at the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well\u2019s surroundings,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy second condition is to let me take away all the herbs I need from here, you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo unhappily looked at Tang San. Although the medicaments around the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well were precious, to someone who had already reached the peak of Title Douluo like him, it wasn\u2019t of any significance. When he gave Tang San the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, he had already silently agreed to let him take away any plants from here.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, why wouldn\u2019t I agree to such a simple matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said indifferently. At the same time he also indicated to Tang San that he shouldn\u2019t lightly speak his conditions now. Even leaving first and using them later was fine.</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat pondering said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too simple, huh. Then the next condition is a little more difficult. I don\u2019t know whether you will agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo loftily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo me, is there anything that\u2019s difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San probingly asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Ba was no impetuous youngster. How would the old fox lightly promise anything,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me hear what your condition is first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually it\u2019s also very simple. Our Shrek Academy\u2019s teachers are comparatively lacking in strength, and also needs guards. So my third condition, is to invite you as a high ranked advisor at our Shrek Academy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of the question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo didn\u2019t wait for Tang San to finish before rejecting him,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man has always most feared having restricted freedom, this is already a question of principles. I can\u2019t agree to it. You little freak. You would actually have me be a hired thug? Even the Heaven Dou imperial family wouldn\u2019t have the ability to restrict me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho restricted you. If you want to come, then come. If you want to go, then go. Just use your name, that\u2019s all. At least, this way I could meet with you properly. I wouldn\u2019t have you as an adviser for a lifetime either. Once I\u2019ve graduated you can do as you wish, who would care?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked distracted a moment, lowering his head to look at Tang San. Tang San was also looking at him, and in his eyes was a kind of expression Dugu Bo had never seen on him before, a mix of thirty percent hopefulness and seventy percent pleading.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust use my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said in a questioning tone.</p><br/><p>Tang San hurriedly nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Do you think anyone would still care what a Title Douluo like you does? Of course, if you felt like giving us some pointers, I also wouldn\u2019t object.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted unhappily,</p><br/><p>\u201cA little freak like you still wants my directions? Maybe if you couldn\u2019t give me directions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was exultant,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo showed a smiling expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as your teachers don\u2019t drive me away. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo? Go where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled asked.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man never procrastinates. Since I\u2019ve promised to be some advisor, I might as well bring you back, then bring my granddaughter to have you treat her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he could continue being with Dugu Bo, Tang San also felt his mood ease, laughing he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, have you forgotten the second thing you promised me? I still want to bring some of the plants here. Categorizing and listing them will still take time. It\u2019s been half a year, why care about a few days? Give me three days. In three days, we\u2019ll return to the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>After three days.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little freak, you scoundrel, I\u2019ll beat you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo, stomping with fury, raised his hand to swat at Tang San. Tang San hastily retreated with Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, turning around to run,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, didn\u2019t you say I could bring what I wished, you never said anything about any amounts. Besides I still left seeds and such, in a few years they\u2019ll still grow back. But, old freak, your Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse really is excellent, very capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder Dugu Bo would be so furious. These past three days he had cultivated in his cavern, and when it was time he had come to the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well to bring Tang San away. Only, as he once again came to the side of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well and saw his treasured ground had been looted to a miserable state, how couldn\u2019t he be furious.</p><br/><p>As far as the eye could see, the originally verdant garden had already become a complete mess, as if it had been plowed, the soil was turned over everywhere, without the slightest hint of green.</p><br/><p>Seeing such a scene, how couldn\u2019t Dugu Bo be angry.</p><br/><p>Tang San discontentedly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, didn\u2019t you promise to let me take what I wanted, you didn\u2019t say anything about how much. I just chose to take it all. Don\u2019t worry. See, I didn\u2019t move the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, with its moisture, this place will be flourishing again in less than a few decades.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mention that those immortal treasures he had dug up, even if it was next to the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, would need several centuries to be able to grow back once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 This little freak will really have me dead from anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was speechless with fury. He had indeed promised it himself, and those drug ingredients indeed didn\u2019t have any great effect on him, however, those things had been with him for decades, how couldn\u2019t he love them?</p><br/><p>Tang San probing asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo resolutely glared at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he no longer paid attention to Tang San, and soared up towards the mountain top.</p><br/><p>Tang San hastily released Eight Spider Lances, bringing him to swiftly chase after Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Although there were a lot of powerful spirit beasts in the Sunset Forest, Dugu Bo had been here for many years, and all the spirit beasts had become familiar with his smell. None of them would dare approach this old freak, and as Tang San followed Dugu Bo out of the forest, he also didn\u2019t encounter any spirit beast attack.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid drawing attention, after leaving Sunset Forest Tang San withdrew his Eight Spider Lances, only relying on Ghost Perplexing Shadow Track to follow behind Dugu Bo. He knew he had been a bit excessive, but those first rate medicinal ingredients couldn\u2019t be found just anywhere, and would have maximum effect in the future. Even more when he had a top quality spirit tool like the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse that could keep them fresh, without being able to restrain himself he had cleaned the place out.</p><br/><p>On the whole journey Tang San didn\u2019t dare provoke Dugu Bo further. Dugu Bo also didn\u2019t acknowledge him, and the two returned to Heaven Dou City in a silent mood.</p><br/><p>Because the majority of the toxin in his body had fused into the spirit bone, Dugu Bo\u2019s present form wasn\u2019t as conspicuous as before, and he also didn\u2019t rouse the attention of pedestrians. After entering Heaven Dou City the old freak stopped, glancing behind him at the panting Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, lead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San caught up to Dugu Bo\u2019s side, in a low voice saying with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, you\u2019re not angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo glared at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I promised, I won\u2019t argue. But mark my words, only this once, never again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hastily nodded agreement, inwardly smiling, even if there was a next time it would still be in at least a few decades. The old freak was clearly giving himself a way out.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Dugu Bo\u2019s anger had faded a bit, Tang San hastily led the way forward, the two heading towards the former Blue Tyrant Academy, the present Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>While walking, Tang San couldn\u2019t help say to Dugu Bo:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, you coming to our Academy is actually quite fitting. Our Shrek Academy is also known as the Monster Academy, old freaks teaching little monsters, doesn\u2019t that fit beautifully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful your head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo raised his hand to knock on Tang San\u2019s head. He was tall, a full two heads taller than the presently one meter seventy or so Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San groaned,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hit my clever head silly, who will treat your granddaughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo seemed to think of something, and his ice cold expression suddenly softened. Sizing up Tang San, at the corners of his mouth gradually floated a smiling expression.</p><br/><p>From Tang San\u2019s point of view, he would rather see Dugu Bo\u2019s stinky face. Unwillingly looking at his smiling appearance, he couldn\u2019t help shiver all over,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, what are you smiling about?\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] ()</p><br/><p>[2] () \u201cSon Mother Chasing Soul Seizing Life Bladder\u201d.

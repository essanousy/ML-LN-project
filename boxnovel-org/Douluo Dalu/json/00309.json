They had already been held up here for a long time, and Tang San was also feeling nervous about what Dai Mubai worried previously, that Qian Renxue would go on the battlefield. Their family and friends were all there! When Xiao Bai warned him now, he remembered that this Deep Sea Demon Whale King might still have something for him. Xiao Bai definitely wouldn\u2019t speak without thinking. As another fish type demon beast, she understood the Deep Sea Demon Whale King even better than him.</p><br/><p>Nodding to Xiao Bai, Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was still a bit bewildered over his current situation, at the very least he had already passed the Seagod\u2019s eighth trial. Everything after that would have to wait until they reached the Seagod Island. Even though killing the Deep Sea Demon Whale King and absorbing its spirit ring was difficult, it had still gone relatively smoothly, at least everything was completed according to plan without too much trouble. Especially after his spirit power rose to rank ninety nine, Tang San was confident that he at least wouldn\u2019t get killed even if he met Qian Renxue. Of course, that was under the premise that the battlefield was over the ocean or in a forest.</p><br/><p>Soaring up, surging spirit power was instantly infused into the Seagod Trident. Even though this divine weapon couldn\u2019t display its proper splendor, with Tang San\u2019s enormous spirit power as well as the Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s release, intense golden light instantly filled the Seagod Trident, making its three blades glisten anew.</p><br/><p>The Deep Sea Demon Whale King was worthy of being a million year spirit beast. Even though seven days had already passed as it soaked in seawater, its body was only very slightly decomposed. Moreover, after Tang San leapt up he discovered that within this sea region there were already Devil Spirit Great White Sharks everywhere. Clearly Xiao Bai had used some special method to summon her clan. If nothing else, she was definitely very reluctant to just abandon the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Even though they had absorbed the majority of its energy just after it died, some still remained. Also adding in that the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s body was near god level, there were enormous benefits for the Devil Spirit Great White Sharks to eat a bit. It could be easily imagined that, after a bit of work, the Devil Spirit Great White Shark clan\u2019s strength would increase substantially. Xiao Bai might even break the age limits of hundred thousand year spirit beasts and become a true overlord of the sea.</p><br/><p>Only, Xiao Bai had protected the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s head very well, only eating its flesh. Rank ninety nine spirit power erupted, and without need for any spirit abilities, just physical strength and spirit power infused in the Seagod Trident, the sharp main blade stabbed straight towards the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the side, be a bit careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai hurriedly warned.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded in the air, shifting the Seagod Trident slightly and stabbing into the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s gills. This was a comparatively weak part of the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s body to begin with, and now that it had lost its energy defense, the Seagod Trident easily cut through it, causing a soft splashing sound.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s wrist turned, and he flew sideways in the air, forcibly cutting open the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s head, starting from the first cut.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the fishy stink Tang San originally expected didn\u2019t appear, and instead a strong fragrance wafted from the wound. Being the closest, he couldn\u2019t help sniffing it a few times, and immediately had refreshing feeling.</p><br/><p>The Devil Spirit Great White Sharks in the sea now stopped their movements, no longer swimming around, simultaneously looking in this direction. Even Xiao Bai\u2019s eyes revealed a somewhat thirsty light.</p><br/><p>The Seagod Trident flipped up, and the top of the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s head was lifted up. Instantly, golden light filled the surface of the sea. In fact, this Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s body was extremely large, its head alone was more than ten square meters, lifting the top of the skull immediately exposed the whale brain inside.</p><br/><p>Although the whale\u2019s body was large, the brain was very small. Even one as strong as the Deep Sea Demon Whale King was no exception. The limit of the brain was also an important reason its mental strength wasn\u2019t equal to Tang San. Right now, after that more than ten square meter head was opened, the brain revealed was less than one square meter. But, that strong fragrance emanated from within that less than one square meter brain.</p><br/><p>The whale brain was pure gold, seemingly moist and smooth, like melted gold. The intense fragrance was extremely attractive. And in the middle of that whale brain lay a fist sized, entirely purple gold pearl. Although the whale brain was very attractive on its own, as he saw that pearl, Tang San couldn\u2019t move his eyes away.</p><br/><p>He had once seen a pearl when he killed the Dark Devilgod Tiger. That one had three colors, but was much smaller than this one. The only difference was that the Dark Devilgod Tiger\u2019s pearl seemed more spiritual, while this one was like something dead. However, in terms of the energy it contained, this whale pearl had far more. At just a glance, Tang San discovered that this definitely was a heavenly treasure.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai\u2019s voice came faintly from behind,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe brains of sea spirit beasts above one hundred thousand years will evolve, turning into a special medicine. This medicine is an enormous tonic to any living creature, and moreover contains enormous energy, and can have very many effects. This Deep Sea Demon Whale King cultivated for a million years, its whale brain is naturally a good thing. Whether living or dead, flesh or bones, its definitely a treasure. As for how to use it, that\u2019s up to you. You killed it, you deserve this. I don\u2019t fear telling you, after you helped us kill the Evil Spirit Orca King, I secretly ate the Evil Spirit Orca King\u2019s whale brain. Do you feel I\u2019m very selfish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, I\u2019m your friend. Besides, back then I already had the biggest benefit of the Evil Spirit Orca King\u2019s spirit ring and spirit ring both. Let alone that whale brain, if you wanted, I\u2019d let you take this one as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai stared in surprise.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled softly:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Doesn\u2019t my word count?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing, Xiao Bai shook her head:</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind, I appreciate your good intentions, but you better keep this thing yourself. I can\u2019t have it. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m being polite, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve absorbed too much outside energy recently, it\u2019s already enough to advance my cultivation another step. I still know what biting off more than I can chew means. Take it. Judging by this Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s brain, eating it might be beneficial even if you\u2019ve become a god. Next you have to go accept the Seagod\u2019s inheritance, this might be able to help you in the last step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded slightly, pointing at the pearl lying inside the whale brain:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Something that grew from the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai said a bit vacantly:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. It\u2019s possible it\u2019s something that will appear from a million year cultivation. But it may be assumed it\u2019s the condensation of the spiritual influence of heaven and earth the Deep Sea Demon Whale King absorbed over the years, it\u2019s definitely a treasure. Embed it in a weapon, and you might be able to forge a divine instrument.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening To Xiao Bai, Tang San couldn\u2019t keep his heart from twitching. Looking at the rhombic cavity in the Seagod Trident, he turned his head to look at his comrades. Dai Mubai smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you being polite with us for? Even it this thing is any use to us, it\u2019ll still have to wait until we reach the Seagod Island. Senior Bo Saixi will defintiely explain it to us. Hurry up and take it, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, taking off the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse from his waist. Placing such medicinal things in the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse was more suitable. Only the whale brain was too large, and he didn\u2019t have such a large container. He could only clear out a space in the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse and leave it there for now.</p><br/><p>Grabbing in the air with his right hand, a faint golden blue light densely covered Tang San\u2019s palm, causing a powerful suction force from the sky. First to fly out was that whale pearl, and when Tang San caught it, the rich fragrance cleared his mind. Breathing deeply a few times, he felt unspeakable comfortable.</p><br/><p>The whale bead was warm and soft, just like egg yolk, just much larger. Even though it felt very warm and soft holding it, the surface was still extremely tough, cutting it open wouldn\u2019t be easy. Moreover Tang San vaguely felt that the warm and soft whale pearl didn\u2019t contain liquid, but was rather extremely soft all the way through, like gelatin.</p><br/><p>Without studying it further, Tang San placed the whale pearl in the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse, and then increased the suction force from his palm, using Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon. In the process, Tang San radiated golden blue light that circled his arm, faint dragon cries echoing. His arm seemed to produce a dragon with the suction force of a whale, inhaling that whale brain like a golden stream, pouring it directly into the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse.</p><br/><p>Hunting the Deep Sea Demon Whale was painful, but the rewards were correspondingly enormous. Just that unknown level spirit ring and powerful torso spirit bone made Tang San\u2019s strength rise a large chunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a splash, Xiao Bai flitted past the distracted Tang San, landing in the water in front of him.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled faintly, soaring. At the same time his right hand stretched out, and a strand of Blue Silver Emperor twisted around Xiao Wu\u2019s waist, pulling over his lover to land on Xiao Bai\u2019s back. The other Devil Spirit Great White Sharks that Tang San infused the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s energy into with the draining gold threads also one after another carried the other Shrek Seven Devils, accelerating together to move in the direction of the Seagod Island.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai leaned in Tang San\u2019s arms, without saying a word, only quietly holding onto his waist. Her quiet made Tang San think something was odd, Xiao Wu seemed a bit different from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, what is it? Are you angry? I don\u2019t want to take chances either, but you know\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu hurriedly shook her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not angry. Ge, I know, you\u2019re helpless as well. If you don\u2019t grow stronger, how can you deal with powerful enemies? I just hate that I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San put strength in his arms, pulling XIao Wu\u2019s soft body close against him, whispering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said you don\u2019t help me? As long as you\u2019re by my side, you\u2019re the best help. Because only by seeing you will I not be at a loss, and everything I do will be more valuable. Whenever I think that, once all these crises are over, I can live quietly together with my beloved Xiao Wu, my heart fills with happiness. Just this happiness for the future encourages me. When I was chased by Qian Renxue, all I could think of was you. Every moment I told myself I had to do anything to survive, survive for my Xiao Wu. I definitely can\u2019t let you be heartbroken again. If I didn\u2019t have these thoughts to push me, I might not have been able to return to see all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGe\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San\u2019s not quite a confession, but still sincere words, Xiao Wu\u2019s throat seemed to choke on something, holding tightly to Tang San, her eyes hazy.</p><br/><p>Tang San apologized:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, after you revived I haven\u2019t had the time to keep you company. Xiao Wu, you know, I really want to marry you, take you as my wife with the grandest wedding ceremony on the Continent. Remember, this is my vow to you. Before much longer, once the Spirit Empire is smashed, I\u2019ll definitely make you my wife. Then we can spend all our time together, ok? Then, you can give us a few children, and wherever you like, we will live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough, I can\u2019t stand you, I\u2019m still here you know, can\u2019t you not be so sappy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai twisted slightly beneath them. Only, her eyes still revealed admiration.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled silently, and Xiao Wu\u2019s face turned bright red, burying her head in Tang San\u2019s arms. Her charming appearance, so beautiful and alluring it was unreal, made Tang San somewhat stupid.</p><br/><p>From the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s area to the Seagod Island only took the Devil Spirit Great White Sharks one day at full speed.</p><br/><p>Seeing the jade sea and silver beaches again, the Shrek Seven Devils all had a feeling of pride. Last time they had come here like thieves, using the Vast Sea Barrier to its fullest extent and even walking here across the sea bottom. At that time even the strongest of them, Tang San, had only had a spirit power in the sixty something ranks.</p><br/><p>But now the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 strength had undergone a heaven and earth revolving change. Let alone Tang San who had become a peak absolute rank ninety nine Douluo, the others\u2019 spirit power had all progressed enormously after absorbing the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>Calculating in terms of levels, Dai Mubai had changed the least, but that was because his cultivation was the highest of everyone besides Tang San, now he had already reached rank eighty eight, already very close to Title Douluo. With his talent, he would definitely rise to become a young Title Douluo if he cultivated normally for just five years. Even though he wasn\u2019t as freakish as Tang San, right now Dai Mubai was still just thirty years old!</p><br/><p>Because of his physique, Oscar had absorbed less energy, but his spirit power had still definitely progressed, reaching rank eighty five. As a food type spirit master, reaching such a level was already extremely terrifying. Oscar believed that he definitely could become a food Title Douluo, unprecedented in history. Then he would definitely have even stronger Title Douluo sausages. The only thing he prayed for was to definitely not have any \u201cdaddy has a caterpillar\u201d and such incantations. No matter how thick his cheek, his mental endurance still had limits.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun\u2019s spirit power rose one more rank than Oscar, of course because his physical strength was even higher and could absorb even more Deep Sea Demon Whale King energy. At rank eighty six, his attack power was even more terrifying, and the power of the phoenix flames had also increased under the imperceptible influence. The higher his level, the more clear the advantage of his first rate spirit would be. Among the Shrek Seven Devils, besides Tang San, only Dai Mubai had the strength to compete with him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit power reached rank eighty. Of course, this was just under the present circumstances. By Tang San\u2019s estimates, the amount of energy Xiao Wu absorbed was second only to him, and her spirit power should still be able to rise another three ranks or so. In other words, after Xiao Wu got a spirit ring and reached rank eighty one, she\u2019d directly advance to rank eighty four. Like this, she was extremely close to the others. There was morover one thing Tang San had never forgotten, Xiao Wu had received a first rate one trial on Seagod Island, and this trial would conclude once Tang San completed the nine Seagod Trials, and until then the rewards were stacked. Very clearly, the rewards from Xiao Wu\u2019s first rate one trial would surpass that of Ning Rongrong\u2019s first rate seven trials. Tang San clearly remembered how many spirit power ranks Ning Rongrong had gained. After he completed the inheritance, Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit power might very well catch up to Dai Mubai.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s spirit power had broken through rank eighty seven, second only to Dai Mubai. Even though she hadn\u2019t absorbed very much of the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s energy, her Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda spirit really was too outstanding, and after passing the first rate seven trials, her spirit power increase was also more than their companions. Her current spirit power already surpassed Ma Hongjun, reaching an even stronger level.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s spirit power was rank eighty six. Her personal strength wasn\u2019t much in the group, but absolutely don\u2019t forget that if she combined with Dai Mubai to launch the Hell White Tiger, even rank ninety nine Tang San didn\u2019t dare say he could defeat them quickly. Moreover, this spirit fusion ability would keep growing more and more terrifying as their strength increased.</p><br/><p>Rounding their spirit power down to eighty, compared to six years ago they had advanced twenty ranks, and with the peak Douluo Tang San there, the current Shrek Seven Devils even challenged the deep history of all the current powers on Seagod Island. In fact, the teamwork and understanding between them was something even the Seagod Island\u2019s seven guardian Douluo couldn\u2019t compare to.</p><br/><p>They had always cultivated together from the day they entered the Shrek Academy, and now more than a decade had passed. The rapport produced from life and death together was absolutely wasn\u2019t something ordinary spirit masters could reach only by cultivating together day after day. The Shrek Seven Devils could all trust their lives to their comrades.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you here. We have to go back to digest the energy. Tang San, I wish you luck. Once you\u2019ve truly become Seagod, I will congratulate you together with all the creatures of the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai stood upright in the water, waving her forefins at the Shrek Seven Devils. Then she turned and led her clansmen back into the ocean.</p><br/><p>Tang San drew a deep breath, his right hand holding the Seagod Trident, his left hand holding Xiao Wu\u2019s hand. Raising his head, he looked in the direction of the Seagod Palace. Even though it was blocked from his view here, he could still confirm its presence from afar, as if it was calling out to him.</p><br/><p>Seagod Island, Seagod Mountain, Seagod Palace. I, Tang San, have returned. The last trial approaches, Seagod, I will definitely possess your power, returning your august might to this world once again.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai stepped up next ot Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we go right away? Do you want to rest a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>His question naturally made sense. Ever since leaving the Heaven Dou Imperial Army, Tang San had hardly stopped. Hunting powerful spirit beasts in the Star Dou Great Forest, then being chased by god level Qian Renxue, barely managing to escape into the sea, then having barely recoverd from the influence of ring detonation he had started another battle with the million year Deep Sea Demon Whale King, plus finally absorbing the Deep Sea Demon Whale King\u2019s enormous energy. It was obvious that Tang San was tired.</p><br/><p>Seeing his comrades\u2019 deeply concerned gazes, Tang San shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine. My current recovery ability is very powerful. Even going a month without sleep isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned:</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, with my crystal caterpillar sausage, there\u2019s no need to fear injuries. Besides, don\u2019t forget that little San is a freak. Even though we Shrek Seven Devils are all monsters, he\u2019s definitely the biggest one. Don\u2019t delay, even if we rest it\u2019ll have to wait until the Seagod Palace. Trust that senior Bo Saixi wouldn\u2019t let little San start the inheritance if his condition was off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the seven were preparing to set off, suddenly, Tang San frowned and raised his head to look into the forest ahead.</p><br/><p>In the forest, one figure after another slowly walked out. Seeing them appear, Tang San and his comrades couldn\u2019t help being shocked. Altogether seven people stepped out of the forest, the people that had once been their examiners, and moreover each guarded the Seagod Pillars, the seven Seagod guardian Douluo. They could be called the backbone of the entire Seagod Island\u2019s strength. Led by Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi, this power was enough to contend with any continental spirit master.</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo walked furthest ahead, the other six following behind him, slowly advancing together. Judging by their expressions, Tang San couldn\u2019t help frowning slightly, because he discovered that these seven Title Douluo weren\u2019t looking too well, frowning slightly and with a faint sorrow between their brows.</p><br/><p>Had something happened on Seagod Island? Tang San was inwardly shocked, and hurriedly went to meet them,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeniors, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo raised his spirits, squeezing out a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe knew your friends returned and came to meet you. Lord Bo Saixi is waiting for you in the Seagod Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the meaning of Seadragon Douluo\u2019s words, it\u2019d be a wonder if anything had happened on Seagod Island, but what was up with their expressions?</p><br/><p>Tang San said doubtfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Seadragon, has something happened on the island? Your expressions are so unsightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo\u2019s heart trembled, and he hurriedly controlled his mind, speaking deferentially:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nothing, we\u2019ve only waited for so many years, our guardian mission will finally come to an end with your inheritance, we\u2019re a bit at a loss, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San then understood. Yes! Once he inherited the Seagod\u2019s position, there would no longer be a need for these seven douluo to guard the sacred pillars. They would also be relieved of their mission. Always quietly devoting themselves to guarding the sacred pillars for so many years had already become habit, and now they would become idle. It was no wonder they would be discomforted and reluctant.</p><br/><p>Immediately, he couldn\u2019t help consoling them:</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven seniors, no matter what the future holds, you are all the cornerstones of Seagod Island, this place cannot do without you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seadragon Douluo smiled and nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, please follow us to the Seagod Palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already turning as he spoke, and as his gaze met the other Seven Seagod Sacred Pillar Guardian Douluo, the smile was gone, deep sadness flashing past the corners of his eyes. But by then his back was to Tang San, and Tang San didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>Everyone were powerful spirit masters, and when they put their backs to it, the Seagod Mountain was already in view again in an hour of effort. The mountain seemed no different from before. Tang San\u2019s eyesight was now much stronger than before, and surveying the top of the mountain, he caught sight of a figure in a deep blue dress, standing quietly at the peak and looking in their direction, Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi.</p><br/><p>Only, seeing Bo Saixi also shocked Tang San. The Bo Saixi Tang San remembered, or to say, from first glance Bo Saixi hadn\u2019t changed from the seemingly thirty years old beautiful woman, she had a noble, graceful, gentle, reserved moving temperament, giving people an unreachable feeling. Her beauty was one that thrilled the soul, yet wouldn\u2019t give people fanciful thoughts.</p><br/><p>Tang San still deeply remembered the first time he saw Bo Saixi, in a red gown holding a golden scepter, leaving him with an extremely deep impression. But what he saw now was a completely different Bo Saixi.</p><br/><p>Still in a red gown, still that golden scepter, even her azure eyes as deep as the ocean hadn\u2019t changed, but, her youthful complexion was gone. Wrinkled skin and greying hair, she seemed like one at the end of her years. Despite still having a kind of unapproachable, untouchable feeling as she stood before the Seagod Palace, her appearance still gave Tang An an enormous shock.</p><br/><p>If the presence she radiated wasn\u2019t still so powerful, Tang San really wouldn\u2019t dare believe this was the peak power of the Seagod Island, Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi. What happened? Why would she change like this? With Bo Saixi\u2019s strength, she could remain eternally youthful basically without any need to take care, until the moment she died. But, her cultivation hadn\u2019t changed now, but she was already old, as if she might be carried off by the wind at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, I\u2019ve waited a very long time. Come.\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint voice came from the Seagod mountain. Even though it was still such a distance, Bo Saixi\u2019s voice clearly reached the ears of the Shrek Seven Devils. Her voice was very calm, as if nothing had happened, only, from this calm Tang San heard some apathy.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Seadragon Douluo and the others, and Seadragon Douluo saw from his expression that Tang San had already seen Bo Saixi. He shook his head at him with a sigh, without saying anything. Speeding up, they headed towards the Seagod Mountain.</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned, catching up together with his comrades. They reached the ring shaped sea in a moment. The ring shaped sea was no longer a trial capable of stopping them. Tang San only soared up, six strands of Blue Silver Emperor shooting out and bringing his comrades to smoothly cross the two hundred meter wide sea, reaching the foot of the Seagod Mountain.</p><br/><p>The Seagod\u2019s Light on the Seagod Mountain was still so touching, all the scenery still exactly the same as when they left. The beautiful view made everyone feel carefree and relaxed. Unfortunately, right now Tang San wasn\u2019t of a mind to appreciate any of it. Without waiting for the seven Seagod sacred pillar guardian Douluo to lead the way, he sharply accelerated and headed directly up the mountain. In just a few leaps, he arrived before the Seagod Palace at the top.</p><br/><p>Tang San naturally didn\u2019t have bad eyesight, none of what he saw before had changed. Bo Saixi\u2019s aged, end of her life appearance made Tang San\u2019s heart ache. Why would this elder who had given all her life to the Seagod Island suddenly\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi quietly watched Tang San. Her crystal clear eyes seemed to see something, but she didn\u2019t say anything, as if searching for something in Tang San\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t speak either, letting her watch him. He wanted to ask questions, but watched by Bo Saixi\u2019s clear and flawless eyes, he couldn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>The others also arrived at the top of the mountain. As Dai Mubai and the rest saw Bo Saixi\u2019s appearance they couldn\u2019t help crying out. Especially Ning Rongrong and Zhu Zhuqing covered their mouths. Only Xiao Wu who hadn\u2019t directly met Bo Saixi was better off.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s kindly gaze swept across everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you very shocked? It\u2019s actually nothing, appearance is meaningless to me. You wait outside a while first. Tang San, follow me. I have some things to explain to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently, following behind Bo Saixi into the Seagod Palace.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi casually waved her hand, and soft spirit power slowly pulled close the two large gates, isolating everything outside. The lightless Seagod Palace was still dark, the seven platforms still exactly the same.</p><br/><p>After entering the palace, Bo Saixi didn\u2019t walk further inside, but rather stopped directly, stepping aside and sitting down crosslegged beside the door. She pointed opposite her, gesturing for Tang San to also sit.</p><br/><p>Tang San sat down as she asked. Looking at Bo Saixi, he drew a deep breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, your current appearance, is it related to my great grandfather? Don\u2019t tell me he didn\u2019t understand your intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the peak Douluo of the present world, no enemy could possibly cause Bo Saixi to change this much. With Bo Saixi\u2019s status, even if she really met a god level power, she would definitely sacrifice her life to protect the Seagod Island, but still definitely not turn so old as this. In Tang San\u2019s impression, Bo Saixi was an extremely proud person, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have used that kind of method to reject his great grandfather Tang Chen as well as Qian Daoliu back then.</p><br/><p>Therefore, there was only one explanation for her current appearance. That had to be related to his great grandfather coming here after they separated. Bo Saixi loved his great grandfather, the only man she had loved in her life. Tang San could also only think of that kind of explanation for Bo Saixi to change so much.</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang San, Bo Saixi\u2019s eyes revealed a slight smile, but this smile contained even more of a strange mood.</p><br/><p>Tang San, you\u2019re very intelligent, and I will moreover also thank you. You finally let me see him one last time. I really am grateful. Even Tang Chen might not have thought that you could guess I changed like this because of him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

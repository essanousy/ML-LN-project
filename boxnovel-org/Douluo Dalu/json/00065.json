Even Dugu Bo couldn\u2019t help frown in the heavy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Even if Dugo Bo had thought the trio\u2019s spirit fusion ability should be strong, he still hadn\u2019t expected them to actually summon such an enormous golden dragon.</p><br/><p>Line after line of golden lightning flashed around Luo San Pao, its body radiating golden light in all directions, hanging in the air like a golden sun.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me this is the dragon clan\u2019s legendary Saint Dragon?\u2019 Dugu Bo was secretly somewhat apprehensive. Even if there was nothing divine about Luo San Pao\u2019s body, Dugu Bo knew that the dragon clan\u2019s most powerful Saint Dragon would possess a golden body.</p><br/><p>Flender and Liu Erlong still had their eyes closed, completely unaware of their surroundings, the two had become like two golden spheres of light.</p><br/><p>What was a Saint Dragon?</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s arrogance was completely aroused when confronted by Luo San Pao, issuing an ear-piercing hiss, jade-like green light bursting forth from his body, spreading his arms like welcoming the wind, the first seven spirit rings brightened, and immediately afterward his tall and thin body started to expand within that jade light, shooting up.</p><br/><p>Equally rhombic emerald scales, like sheets of inlaid jade, Dugu Bo\u2019s human body had already disappeared, transformed into an immense jade green serpent. His transformation speed was clearly faster than Luo San Pao\u2019s, and in an eyeblink his body was bigger as well, more than thirty meters long, the thickness of a barrel.</p><br/><p>More than half of the serpent\u2019s body stood upright, directly confronting Luo San Pao.</p><br/><p>A pair of enormous snake eyes stared fixedly at Luo San Pao, a snake tongue flickering, dense green mist spreading all around.</p><br/><p>This was Dugu Bo\u2019s spirit avatar, Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor.</p><br/><p>Dugu Yan had inherited her Jade Phosphor Serpent spirit from Dugu Bo. But at the Title Douluo Level, Dugu Bo\u2019s spirit avatar couldn\u2019t be compared to what a mere Spirit Sage was capable of. The Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s was completely covered in scale armor, its cold eyes unwaveringly fixed on Luo San Pao.</p><br/><p>Luo San Pao\u2019s body seemed to have completed its transformation, facing upwards to roar at the sky, both wings unfurling, suddenly opening its mouth, a golden lightning bolt suddenly streaked towards Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo transformed into the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor didn\u2019t try to dodge, but gaped and sprayed out a thick green fog, the nine spirit rings revolving around that enormous body. Lowering his head, he unexpectedly used only his own body to resist Luo San Pao\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>With an enormous explosion, the golden lightning spread from the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s head to its tail, making its enormous body stiffen. But only stiffen.</p><br/><p>Luo San Pao stretched out its wings and silently leapt into the air, exhaling a golden breath that collided with the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s jade green fog.</p><br/><p>Right now Dugu Bo confronted Luo San Pao controlled by Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>With the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability started, the flying corner Flender contributed the ability to fly and his own spirit power, the slaughtering corner Liu Erlong provided the dragon form, while Grandmaster provided Luo San Pao\u2019s remote body, as well as his wisdom.</p><br/><p>To complete Luo San Pao\u2019s transformation, Flender and Liu Erlong had to focus entirely on merging their spirit power into the spirit fusion ability, but Luo San Pao was integrated with Grandmaster, and was naturally controlled by Grandmaster. Consequently, what Dugu Bo confronted was a Saint Dragon with Grandmaster\u2019s intellect. Of course, Luo San Pao wasn\u2019t truly a Saint Dragon, rather it should have the qualifier \u2018fake\u2019 in front.</p><br/><p>While Grandmaster\u2019s spirit variation had made him lose the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan\u2019s spirit, Luo San Pao\u2019s variation didn\u2019t just result in complete inferiority, rather it had a result even higher level variant dragon\u2019s lacked.</p><br/><p>Right now with the transformation of the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability, it was just with Luo San Pao\u2019s already enlarged veins that it was possible to temporarily possess the strength of a Saint Dragon.</p><br/><p>Even if Grandmaster wasn\u2019t strong, in theoretical knowledge he could be said to be unequalled. confronting the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s belch of fog, he didn\u2019t let Luo San Pao approach, and rather used the flapping of its wings to create a gale, dispersing the green fog.</p><br/><p>The enormous Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor suddenly moved, unexpectedly launching its seemingly cumbersome body into the air, chasing after Luo San Pao with a wide open mouth.</p><br/><p>Luo San Pao in midair, suddenly moved its equally enormous body to shift sideways, stretching out two claws to grab at the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s seventh cun[1]. One dragon and one serpent battled fiercely in the air.</p><br/><p>The more they fought the more Dugu Bo became apprehensive, he discovered that this golden dragon, seemingly like a Saint Dragon, could actually suppress him.</p><br/><p>Serpents were also a kind of dragon, and the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor was even close to a giant dragon, but Saint Dragons were kings among dragons, and even if Luo San Pao had limited energy, it was still capable of causing a certain suppressing effect on the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Saint Dragon was additionally golden, innately capable of destroying evil, and had a certain resistive effect against nefarious things like poison. As a result, despite the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s toxicity, it was still unable to infect it.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo clearly felt that this Golden Saint Dragon was weaker than him, but with its superior agility and resistance to poison, he seemed even more passive. Furthermore the Golden Saint Dragon was extremely nimble, and relying on its sharp dragon claws it was moving constantly as it attacked.</p><br/><p>The Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor didn\u2019t possess flying capability, so Luo San Pao clearly held the advantage in the air.</p><br/><p>Golden light unceasingly clashed with jade light, the entire mountain trembling repeatedly. One moment a cliff came crashing down, dazzlingly tremendous energy fluctuations scattering the spirit beasts around the mountain in all directions, no longer daring to stay nearby. Intimidating pressure as if released by the Titan Giant Ape or Skyblue Bull Python in Star Dou Great Forest.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was actually somewhat depressed. Of course he wasn\u2019t unable to beat Luo San Pao, but his abilities were excessively potent. Even he was unable to completely control his full strength, and this was his lair, and the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well was within. The destruction from unleashing his full ability would cost more than it gained him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Dugu Bo had a flash of inspiration: the spirit fusion ability still relied on its Spirit Masters. Even if the Saint Dragon was even more powerful, as long as he interrupted the trio\u2019s spirit fusion ability, the Saint Dragon would disappear automatically.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Dugu Bo\u2019s enormous snake body flickered, dodging Luo San Pao\u2019s next attack, simultaneously lashing out with his serpent tail, sweeping at the trio like the autumn wind cutting through grass.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even dodge Luo San Pao\u2019s next attacks.</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing scraping echoed, as Luo San Pao\u2019s dragon claws struck sparks on his body. However, a Title Douluo was after all a Title Douluo, and even Luo San Pao\u2019s fake Saint Dragon claws couldn\u2019t penetrate his defense.</p><br/><p>But Dugu Bo still didn\u2019t feel at ease, this Golden Saint Dragon\u2019s attacks contained both the properties of lightning and fire, and even if the claws didn\u2019t penetrate the hide, the violent elements contained within did. Violent pain sent the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s body swaying.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014, the thick as a water barrel serpent tail struck heavily on the four golden pillars of the Golden Iron Triangle. But those golden beams of light didn\u2019t shatter like Dugu Bo had imagined.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo just felt as if his tail had struck a mountain. Even if the golden light in the triangle fluctuated violently, the three people within completely lacked reaction.</p><br/><p>The Golden Saint Dragon Luo San Pao charged yet again, sharp claws flashing with golden light, at the same time golden lightning was generated by the two horns on its head, fusing together and shooting out at Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously alarmed and furious, Dugu Bo could only barely throw himself to the side, rolling away, at the same time spouting out a jade green pearl, releasing a half arc of jade green light to protect him within.</p><br/><p>Gold and jade clashed once again, intense light swirling in all directions, Golden Saint Dragon Luo San Pao\u2019s energy fluctuations were directly repelled, and the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s body twisted violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cJuniors, are you really looking to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was finally infuriated.</p><br/><p>The enormous serpent tail whipped at the mountainside. Withdrawing the green fog that pervaded the surroundings within itself, the muscles below the serpent\u2019s head began to flatten, raising half the serpent body, the originally jade green snake eyes had become a terrifying white, a layer of white light coloring the serpent head.</p><br/><p>Even if Dugu Bo couldn\u2019t use the enormous power of his last two spirit ring abilities to devastate this place, he had still been a Title Douluo for many years, and had countless consummate skills. Even if his title was poison, that absolutely wasn\u2019t his only ability.</p><br/><p>Two deathly pale rays of light simultaneously shot out from Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s white eyes, directly at Luo San Pao.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he saw that white ray of light. He clearly felt that this wasn\u2019t any of Dugu Bo\u2019s spirit ring abilities. With the change of the serpent\u2019s head, there was no doubt that this was the power of a spirit bone.</p><br/><p>Among the six regular spirit bones, the skull and breastbone were doubtless the most important. And what Dugu Bo used right now should be the ability of a cranial spirit bone.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Title Douluo sure enough were an existence of their own. While ordinary Spirit Masters might never see a spirit bone, it was only natural for them to have one.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster didn\u2019t dare let Luo San Pao get hit by that deathly white light, from the opponent\u2019s imposing attitude he could see these two white rays weren\u2019t an ordinary attack.</p><br/><p>Luo San Pao\u2019s dragon wings folded, its body plummeting towards the ground like a shooting star, at the same time the golden light all over its body brightened, and it suddenly turned its body in midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak wind like thunder, shake the Heavens and split the earth Luo San Pao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster loudly called out for what was originally San Pao\u2019s spirit ability, but as the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability Golden Saint Dragon, this was far from that weak technique even Tang San could easily resist.</p><br/><p>A golden fog rushed out from under Luo San Pao\u2019s dragon tail, forming a golden shield in midair to resist that white light.</p><br/><p>A buzzing sound made Luo San Pao and Grandmaster tremble simultaneously. The moment that golden light clashed with the deathly pale rays, the white light completely dispersed through it, and immediately afterward, an even more shocking scene appeared. That shield in the air changed fundamentally, nothing transforming into something as it dropped from the air as a big rock.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster finally understood what Dugu Bo\u2019s cranial spirit bone was, and couldn\u2019t help but draw in a breath. If he guessed correctly, then it should be one of the first rate serpent type spirit beasts, a spirit bone from the empress of serpents, Medusa[2]. With the Medusa\u2019s ability to turn whatever it looked at into stone, that spirit bone was from an at least ten thousand year Medusa.</p><br/><p>Although Luo San Pao\u2019s ability was able to block this attack, the energy drain clearly weakened the golden light around Luo San Pao a lot, and of the Golden Iron Triangle, whether it was Grandmaster, Flender or Liu Erlong, all of them shuddered violently.</p><br/><p>Their spirit fusion ability blended all the energy of all three into Luo San Pao, making Luo San Pao\u2019s body the same as their three bodies. But this ability\u2019s greatest advantage was that, after activation, the three of them entered an unparallelled state. Unless Luo San Pao perished, or unless their spirit power was depleted, any attacks would be rendered ineffective against them.</p><br/><p>It was because of this that the previous poison formation toxin and Dugu Bo\u2019s serpent tail attack were unable to harm them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you dodged once, can you still escape twice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s deathly pale eyes once again looked at Luo San Pao. Dugu Bo was experienced and knowledgeable, naturally he had guessed the effect of the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability. Even though this Golden Saint Dragon wasn\u2019t weak, Grandmaster\u2019s trio\u2019s spirit power was too far below his, and the current Luo San Pao wasn\u2019t enough to truly threaten him.</p><br/><p>If Title Douluo were so easy to defeat, how would they be known as the strongest on the Continent?</p><br/><p>A long dragon\u2019s roar rose from Luo San Pao. Grandmaster knew that if he didn\u2019t use their last technique now, then perhaps his trio might be unable to endure. Medusa\u2019s stare was truly terrifying, if it hit, perhaps San Pao would be critically injured.</p><br/><p>Golden light sparkled once again. Grandmaster, Flender and Liu Erlong\u2019s trio practically simultaneously spit out blood, falling at the ring in the center of the golden triangle. Their blood instantly blended in that ring, becoming a golden bolt of lightning striking Luo San Pao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Spreading its wings, this time Luo San Pao didn\u2019t dodge the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s attack, it\u2019s whole body igniting with golden light like flames, a dragon\u2019s call more elated than the first, those golden flames actually condensed into another it in front, becoming a transparent dragon image, heading straight for the Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor.</p><br/><p>Golden Saint Dragon\u2019s Esoterics, True Golden Dragon[3].</p><br/><p>Twenty years ago they had only completed half of this technique. Now that twenty years had passed, even though Grandmaster hadn\u2019t advanced at all, Flender and Liu Erlong had both reached Spirit Sage level Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>It was the first time this ability was used fully.</p><br/><p>When that golden dragon of light and shadow flew out, Luo San Pao shrank rapidly in midair, becoming a ray of bluish purple light flying back to Grandmaster and disappearing unseen. At the same time the light around the Golden Iron Triangle faded. As all the gold had vanished, the trio\u2019s complexions simultaneously became pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snarled.</p><br/><p>True Saint Dragon was one of the most powerful Esoterics of the Golden Saint Dragon, even if it was only a fake Golden Saint Dragon, this eruption of power was still the same. Medusa\u2019s stare was a terrifying beam that could transform substance or even energy, but it still had limits. This raging True Saint Dragon was clearly beyond the limits of the Medusa\u2019s stare.</p><br/><p>And what made Dugu Bo even more dispirited was that right now he couldn\u2019t dodge. With the True Saint Dragon\u2019s power, if he avoided it, then the mountain behind him would be levelled with the ground, and the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well behind him would collapse and disappear.</p><br/><p>Right now, despite his reluctance, he still had to rely on his own strength to block the attack.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eighth spirit ring brightened, black rays of light dyeing his serpent form, immediately turning the jade color into forest green. Dugu Bo\u2019s raised serpent head returned to normal, once again spitting out that dark green pearl.</p><br/><p>A bizarre scene appeared. Whether it was the pale trio of the Golden Iron Triangle, or the True Saint Dragon in the air, unexpectedly all of them instantly stood still in their places. Everything in the surroundings, even the wind itself paused in the air.</p><br/><p>Everything was frozen.</p><br/><p>The Jade Phosphor Serpent Emperor\u2019s enormous body became transparent and disappeared, leaving Dugu Bo hanging in the air. His right hand controlled that dark green pearl to slowly fly towards the True Saint Dragon.</p><br/><p>The eighth spirit ability, the one he was using now, was his eighth spirit ability Time Freeze[4]. The destructive power of this spirit ability together with his ninth spirit ability could even level a city.</p><br/><p>But the spirit power consumed to use this spirit ability was enormous. He absolutely wouldn\u2019t use it unless absolutely necessary.</p><br/><p>The green pearl flew directly inside the True Saint Dragon. A jade light flashed in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cMerge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The green light spread in a flash, completely rendering that golden True Saint Dragon green, actually as if it had become a jade dragon.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind a line of afterimages, Dugu Bo appeared before the jade green True Saint Dragon. His face was also somewhat pale, and in his heart he couldn\u2019t help rejoice, fortunately this was a fake Golden Saint Dragon.If this had been the True Saint Dragon of a real Golden Saint Dragon, then even his own Time Freeze might not have been able to restrain it.</p><br/><p>Raising his hand, he cautiously withdrew that jade green pearl, putting it in his mouth, his left hand pressing at the True Saint Dragon\u2019s head, the jade light in his eyes vanished as instead his left hand became jade green.</p><br/><p>The five fingers closing, Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes were like two cold stars as he shouted loudly, \u201cBreak.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp and clear cracking sound echoed, starting from the head of the jade-like True Saint Dragon, a series of cracks began to spread, in an eyeblink already extending all the way up and down its body.</p><br/><p>With a flicker, Dugu Bo had already returned to his position on the mountain, the light of the eighth spirit ring fading,</p><br/><p>\u201cResume.\u201d</p><br/><p>The frozen space once again returned to normal, only that True Saint Dragon was unable to move forward, all the cracks causing it to shatter like colored glass. With an explosive sound light radiated in all directions, a wave of energy surging out in a circle, but no longer with the attack power it had before.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster, Flender and Liu Erlong stood there, blood running from the corners of their mouths, their spirit power practically completely exhausted from the spirit fusion ability, but Dugu Bo still remained untouchable up high. A Title Douluo was after all still a Title Douluo, in the end it was still their loss.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes held a somewhat proper mood, indifferently looking at the Golden Iron Triangle without the ability to resist before him, but still standing straight backed and looking directly at him:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bad, able to cause me such inconvenience with that level of spirit power. This spirit fusion ability is indeed the most outstanding I\u2019ve ever seen. If you had fought a Spirit Douluo level Spirit Master instead, he might not have been your match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo very rarely praised people, but the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability had indeed left him with a deep impression.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what, you still won. Do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grabbing Liu Erlong\u2019s hand, he slowly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s \u2018death\u2019 was an enormous blow to Grandmaster, and with their True Saint Dragon broken, he knew it would be very difficult to leave here alive today.</p><br/><p>Their greatest asset, the spirit fusion ability, hadn\u2019t been able to harm this Title Douluo. At this moment Grandmaster no longer held any qualms about Liu Erlong. Holding his beloved\u2019s hand, his heart no longer trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll die so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a glimmering green light, Dugu Bo arrived in front of the trio.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster suddenly thought of something, once again opening his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cDugu Bo, Tang San was my disciple, this matter is unrelated to the two of them. Let them go, and do as you wish with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo disdainfully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you still qualified to make demands of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong smiled sweetly,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dugu, we indeed aren\u2019t qualified, we indeed don\u2019t have these qualifications. However, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re aware what our spirits are. Me and Xiao Gang, are both from the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan. Perhaps we aren\u2019t your opponents, but can you afford to offend our clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErlong, quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster snapped. His heart dropped. If Liu Erlong hadn\u2019t revealed her background perhaps she still might have had the chance to live, but now that she\u2019d spoken, how couldn\u2019t Dugu Bo pull the weeds with the roots to avoid later trouble?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, when Dugu Bo heard what Erlong said his expression changed slightly. Associating it with the trio\u2019s spirit fusion ability, he said with a frown:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually from the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan? Good, very good. Then so what? Even if I can\u2019t beat your clan\u2019s dragon, how will your clan have any evidence to justify revenge as long as I\u2019ve killed you? Getting rid of skeletons isn\u2019t any problem as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as senior says. As long as you kill me and Xiao Gang, even if our clan comes to find you, you can avoid them without problem. But Flender isn\u2019t related to our clan, even if he reveals it to our clan later, I suspect they still wouldn\u2019t believe him. Just he alone doesn\u2019t constitute evidence. Kill the two of us, but might senior let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you take me for an idiot? Releasing the tiger back into the mountain? Even if there is nothing in this world I fear, I will always cut weeds with the roots. Why wouldn\u2019t it be even safer to just kill all three of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold light expression in Liu Erlong\u2019s eyes, flipping over her hand to reveal a blue metal ball,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen try it. This is our clan\u2019s signaling device, even if you\u2019re more powerful than us, the moment you kill us, I will definitely set it off. This is your domain, when our clan\u2019s people come here, can you still deny relationship? As long as you let Flender go, you can kill us and I won\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dying together with her beloved didn\u2019t make Liu Erlong sad, but actually secretly a bit excited. She had never felt death was frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cErlong, what are you saying? Don\u2019t tell me that I, Flender, am a craven person? If there\u2019s killing, then kill. When we\u2019re in the ground I will still act as a go-between for you and Xiao Gang. What does it matter if our Golden Iron Triangle dies together? Set off that signaling device. Then at least someone will avenge us.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a flickering movement, Flender stood in front of Liu Erlong and Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong urgently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Fu, you\u2019re crazy. Go quickly, this isn\u2019t the time to show off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived for more than fifty years, dying now still won\u2019t be premature. Erlong, even though you don\u2019t love me, your place in my heart is like Xiao Gang\u2019s in yours. To you, dying with Xiao Gang is a blessing, then can I have any regrets over dying together with both of you? It\u2019s only a pity about little San. Dugu Bo, I\u2019m not worried to tell you. Little San\u2019s father is someone even you can\u2019t afford to offend. When we don\u2019t return, my people will immediately look for him. His existence is even more terrifying than the whole Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at the trio with interest,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that kid still had some kind of background? Someone even I don\u2019t dare offend? In this world there aren\u2019t many of those. Let me hear it, who is his father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t calculate age? Little San was thirteen years old this year, so his father naturally wouldn\u2019t be too old. Adding that he isn\u2019t someone you can\u2019t afford to offend, who does that leave on this Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo first stared blankly a moment. Very quickly he seemed to think of something, and his face immediately changed enormously,</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, Tang San, that one was also named Tang. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026 Impossible, that kid\u2019s spirit is just Blue Silver Grass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, you saw his spirit was only Blue Silver Grass, but what if he had two spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Believing that Tang San was already dead, he no longer worried about secrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was horrified beyond description,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that kid actually had twin spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes revealed an irresolute light, slowly raising his right hand, an ominous glint in his eyes. Right now he had already resolved not only to immediately kill these three, but that he also had to immediately get rid of Tang San. If Flender was right, that person, indeed was someone he couldn\u2019t afford to offend. But as long as he destroyed the corpses and removed all traces, then left immediately, it still wouldn\u2019t be easy for that person to find him.</p><br/><p>The moment Dugu Bo prepared to act, Suddenly a clear and melodious voice came from the distance,</p><br/><p>\u201cDugu Bo, you dare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked distracted a moment, turning his head to look in the direction of the voice he saw a figure head towards them extremely swiftly, the rugged mountain path unable to hinder him. Under the impetus of eight slender shadows he swiftly approached their side.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster and Flender said simultaneously with a stunned expression.</p><br/><p>It was indeed Tang San, with the effect of Eight Spider Lances he reached their side in just a moment.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San appeared a little different, the Eight Spider Lances on his back having undergone a bizarre change compared to before. They were still the same size, but the originally bluish purple Eight Spider Lances had now become a deep red, and on the deep red surface were arrays of white circular patterns, as if a white decorative design, making Eight Spider Lances appear brightly colored and dazzling.</p><br/><p>However, right now Flender, Grandmaster and Liu Erlong were all in a state of astonishment that Tang San wasn\u2019t dead, and hadn\u2019t noticed. But Dugu Bo wouldn\u2019t let such details slip by. He was secretly startled. Even if he didn\u2019t know just what had changed, as the king of poison he clearly understood that in the realm of poison, the brighter the colors, the more poisonous it was. This kid had clearly gained something by the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well.</p><br/><p>Originally, after Tang San had eaten the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot and submerged himself in the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, he had very quickly sunken into unconsciousness from being drowned in that powerful poison.</p><br/><p>The Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record\u2019s accounts hadn\u2019t been wrong. Even if the two kinds of immortal treasure poisonous plants were potent, after neutralizing each other they became a treasure that could be absorbed by the human body.</p><br/><p>With the boosting effect of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, they had been slowly absorbed into Tang San\u2019s body, settling in his energy channels and bones.</p><br/><p>However, the medicinal strength contained within these two kinds of herbs was just too powerful and couldn\u2019t be absorbed in just a short time. As Tang San woke up, he had discovered he was floating in the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, his spirit power already recovered to peak condition.</p><br/><p>Eating these two immortal treasure herbs didn\u2019t have any effect on his spirit power. Its most immediate benefit was to remove any sense of pain from the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well.</p><br/><p>To the present Tang San, the extremely cold yin spring was like cold water, and that red hot yang spring was like warm water, that\u2019s all. Not only wouldn\u2019t immersing himself within cause any injuries, on the contrary it was exceptionally relaxing. Tang San knew that the effectiveness of the two kinds of herbs in his body required relying on constant use of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well to absorb.</p><br/><p>By the accounts of the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record, the benefit eating these two immortal treasure herbs at the same time could bring could be described in three words: Ice Fire Protection[5].</p><br/><p>When Tang San was rejoicing in his success, the violent shaking and the golden light in the sky drew his attention.</p><br/><p>Even the thick steam in the air over the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well couldn\u2019t block the that intense radiance, and adding the potent energy fluctuations he immediately guessed that something was happening outside. Such violent spirit power collisions was probably someone acting against the old freak.</p><br/><p>Unable to determine the effects the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot gave him, he hastily released Eight Spider Lances and swiftly dashed over. The color change of the Eight Spider Lances was clearly some transformation from absorbing the ice and fire power contained within the two kinds of poisonous herbs.</p><br/><p>At a distance Tang San already used his Purple Demon Eye, clearly seeing the situation of the battle. When he hurried over was precisely when Dugu Bo used his formidable Time Freeze to completely locked down everything within a several thousand square meter area and destroyed the True Saint Dragon.</p><br/><p>Seeing Dugu Bo about to kill Grandmaster and the others, Tang San shouted loudly and swiftly hurried over.</p><br/><p>Seeing the transformed Eight Spider Lances on Tang San\u2019s back, Dugu Bo\u2019s killing plan was even easier, secretly thinking to himself that he had come over just in time, killing all four together would save him a trip.</p><br/><p>Right now he didn\u2019t even think about how Tang San could have survived near the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well. He just wanted to immediately settle his one pressing issue.</p><br/><p>Just when Dugu Bo\u2019s killing intent rushed up again, Tang San spoke up. He didn\u2019t speak to Grandmaster, Flender and Liu Erlong, but rather looked at Dugu Bo:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dugu, didn\u2019t you promise me three things? Then this is the first, no matter when hereafter, you can\u2019t harm anyone related to the Shrek Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo stared blankly. He hadn\u2019t expected Tang San to actually raise conditions at this moment.</p><br/><p>[1] It\u2019s been mentioned before, but Chinese folklore holds that the seventh cun from the head is a snake\u2019s weak point.</p><br/><p>[2] ()</p><br/><p>[3] () \u201cGolden Dragon Original Form\u201d</p><br/><p>[4] ()</p><br/><p>[5] () Literally \u201cIce Fire Not Invade\u201d, so \u201cunaffected by ice and fire\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

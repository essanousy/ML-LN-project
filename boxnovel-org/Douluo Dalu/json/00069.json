It\u2019s not too much. When you\u2019re eighteen, she will only be twenty five. Convenient for you kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said with great alarm,</p><br/><p>\u201cConvenient? Yeah right! I don\u2019t want that granddaughter of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grinned, grabbing Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think this is up to you? Even if you\u2019re well versed in poisons, can you dissolve aphrodisiacs? Later this old man will have you try some love teas and other such things, once the rice is cooked, I\u2019ll see what you do then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San saw the serious look on Dugu Bo\u2019s face. He, who hadn\u2019t even been afraid when confronting threats to his life, couldn\u2019t help turning pale with fright right now,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld\u2026\u2026 Eh, no, senior Dugu. I know I did wrong, please don\u2019t play with me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grandiosely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s playing with you? I spoke of facts, nothing more. Don\u2019t tell me my granddaughter doesn\u2019t suit a little devil like you? Even if you\u2019re a cunning little freak, your talent isn\u2019t an issue, and your future prospects are boundless. If my granddaughter could follow you, it would put me at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same if she follows Yu Tian-Heng? That Yu Tian-Heng still has the support of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan\u2019s whole school at his back. According to Teacher, Yu Tian-Heng will very possibly be the next leader of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan. How could I compare with that kind of power. Besides, who can say if your granddaughter has already cooked her rice with Yu Tian-Heng, cooked rice can\u2019t be cooked again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked distracted a moment, his complexion immediately becoming unsightly once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is actually possible. Enough, we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Dugu Bo had apparently dropped the notion, Tang San breathed out in relief. By now the two had already reached the Academy gate.</p><br/><p>The Blue Tyrant Academy signboard had already disappeared, replaced with an enormous horizontal board inscribed with golden letters, the words \u2018Shrek Academy\u2019 written in huge, glorious golden characters. It was signed by Flender.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Dugu Bo to step forward, Tang San hastily ran over. He couldn\u2019t dare let Dugu Bo walk first, if by any chance he came into conflict with the teacher at the gate house, it would be difficult to sort out.</p><br/><p>With Dugu Bo\u2019s temper, who knew when he might flare up?</p><br/><p>Tang San ran forward, exchanging a few words with the guard at the gatehouse. The guard hastily ran into the Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, let\u2019s wait here a moment. Don\u2019t forget what you promised me, you can\u2019t harm anyone from Shrek Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was a Title Douluo. Only Tang San had been at the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well, and at most he was the only one in danger, but here was different. If Dugu Bo hadn\u2019t promised not to harm anyone, he really wouldn\u2019t have dared bring him here.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo raised his head, looking down his nose at Tang San without saying a word.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the sound of activity within the Academy attracted Tang San\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Flender, Grandmaster, Liu Erlong as well as Zhao Wuji, Lu Ji-Bin, Shao Xin, and Li Yu-Song, altogether seven people quickly walked out from the Academy gate towards them.</p><br/><p>The assembly of these seven could be said to be the strongest lineup of the present Shrek Academy, clearly they weren\u2019t here to receive Tang San. Their target was naturally that one with the Spirit Master World\u2019s highest title, the Poison Douluo that once defeated the Golden Iron Triangle.</p><br/><p>These seven were all at least sixtieth rank Spirit Masters, adding a complete Spirit Master formation, further adding the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability, even if they couldn\u2019t quite stand up to Dugu Bo, they could still block him.</p><br/><p>When the Academy gate guard had reported that Tang San and an old man who seemed to be Dugu Bo had returned to the Academy, Flender, Grandmaster and the others understood that with Dugu Bo here, until they figured out his motive, this was necessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Grandmaster, hurriedly waving his hand at everyone.</p><br/><p>A moved radiance flickered in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes, but just as he stepped forward he was pulled back by Flender. Just this tiny action showed how cautious everyone were right now.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was no doubt the weakest of everyone here, but he was an absolutely necessary existence in the Golden Iron Triangle\u2019s spirit fusion ability. If he was attacked by Dugu Bo alone, there wouldn\u2019t be any chance of him returning alive, and the other six naturally also wouldn\u2019t be able to stop Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>As Dugu Bo saw Flender\u2019s actions, the corners of his mouth twitched, with difficulty keeping himself from showing a disdainful expression, thinking, \u2018who do you seven think you are? If this old man wanted to do something, even slaughtering this whole Heaven Dou imperial capital wouldn\u2019t be impossible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though Dugu Bo wasn\u2019t considered the most powerful among Title Douluo, there absolutely wasn\u2019t anyone who could compare to his poison in mass murder.</p><br/><p>Tang San naturally didn\u2019t have any misgivings, and quickly stepped forward to meet everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeachers, I\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked at Tang San with an inquiring gaze.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded to Grandmaster, indicating he was fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cDean Flender. I would like to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender constantly kept his gaze on Dugu Bo, only now hearing Tang San speaking to him made him turn his gaze back,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what is it? He hasn\u2019t made things troublesome for you has he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, senior Dugu has been very good to me. He\u2019s taught me a lot of poison related knowledge. Dean Flender, senior Dugu wants to be an advisor at our Academy, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not just Flender, including Grandmaster, everyone present cried out in surprise practically simultaneously, their gazes becoming strange. Everyone looked at each other, for a moment speechless.</p><br/><p>Who was Dugu Bo? A Title Douluo. Let alone this Shrek Academy, even the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s number one academy Heaven Dou Imperial Academy didn\u2019t have a Title Douluo present.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at everyone\u2019s astonished expressions, and probingly asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it no good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender swallowed,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs what you said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dugu promised, only he said he wouldn\u2019t always stay at the Academy. And only as an advisor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender and Liu Erlong simultaneously looked toward Grandmaster. Among the trio, Grandmaster was always the wise corner with a plan.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s rigid face twitched once,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is excellent. Even though Dugu Bo has only ever done as he wished, this person\u2019s reputation is excellent, if he promised something he would surely see it through. Flender.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Grandmaster spoke, he signaled to Flender with his eyes.</p><br/><p>The two had been brothers for so many years, how wouldn\u2019t Flender understand Grandmaster\u2019s meaning. Hastily waving his hand, he brought everyone forward to greet Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dugu, greetings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender, extremely enthusiastic, was the first to step towards Dugu Bo with a smile. Even though the smile seemed a bit sinister on his face, the light in his eyes was sincere.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded to Flender, something like returning the politeness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promised the little freak to be your advisor here, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo had never been a person fond of indirectness, and with his position it was also completely unnecessary. He immediately got right to the point with his purpose in coming.</p><br/><p>Promising Tang San to come here was admittedly because it was Tang San\u2019s condition, but at the same time the peculiar friendship he had with Tang San was an important factor.</p><br/><p>Flender said without the slightest hesitation:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we are. You coming to this Academy will simply bring light to our humble Shrek Academy. Let alone being an advisor, even if you wanted to be dean it would be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo clearly wasn\u2019t interested in Flender\u2019s cordiality. Waving his hand, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing dean doesn\u2019t suit me, I haven\u2019t the time to be teaching students. Moreover, my method of cultivation is unsuitable for the vast majority of Spirit Masters. Since you agreed, find me a quiet place to stay. I\u2019ve returned with that little freak Tang San. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender immediately agreed. Even if there was nothing prepared in advance, dealing with such ad hoc circumstances wasn\u2019t difficult,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen follow me, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he led the way ahead, bringing Dugu Bo into the Academy.</p><br/><p>When Dugu Bo passed by Tang San, his lips moved, saying something to Tang San. He then followed Flender away.</p><br/><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t really tired, only he always most disliked inconvenience, and didn\u2019t want to be chatting with everyone here.</p><br/><p>Watching Flender lead Dugu Bo away, Liu Erlong couldn\u2019t help but ask Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, how did you do it? This old freak agreeing to come to our Academy. It\u2019s really too inconceivable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because we\u2019re something of kindred spirits. I accidentally helped him with a matter. He said it was because of our friendship that he agreed to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how, this is excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, is everyone well?\u201d</p><br/><p>He naturally meant the other six of the Shrek Seven Devils. Being gone for half a year, Tang San had greatly missed his teachers and companions. Especially Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded with a smile, saying:\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all very well. I haven\u2019t told them what you\u2019ve been doing before, only saying you\u2019ve been cultivating in seclusion. If you had returned a few days later, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have been here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this past half year they have all made not inconsiderable progress. Ma Hongjun, Ning Rongrong, and Zhu Zhuqing have all broken through the thirtieth rank, and already possess their third spirit rings. Oscar\u2019s spirit power has also advanced two ranks, and Xiao Wu has even advanced three ranks. Dai Mubai is in seclusion, attacking the fortieth rank bottleneck. Attacking the bottleneck is a bit difficult, but he should succeed soon. Once he has broken through to the fortieth rank, we will go hunt spirit beasts together to obtain his fourth spirit ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Listening to Grandmaster, Tang San couldn\u2019t help secretly sigh in admiration. Even though he himself had progressed a lot, his companions hadn\u2019t stayed idle either. Each one\u2019s strength had increased a lot, and now they had all finally reached the thirtieth rank. The Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 fighting strength would no doubt increase significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was already somewhat impatient to see his comrades.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled and rubbed Tang San\u2019s head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only just returned, won\u2019t you rest a bit first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired. And I still have gifts for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen come on, I\u2019ll go with you. Erlong, all of you are busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San glanced at Grandmaster, then again at Liu Erlong. The two\u2019s expressions were like always, and no change could be seen on the surface. Even though they didn\u2019t seem intimate, he could feel that Grandmaster seemed to be able to calmly accept Liu Erlong\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong nodded, her gaze not resting on Grandmaster for long, and brought the teachers in the direction of the Academy\u2019s main building.</p><br/><p>Watching them gradually disappear in the distance, Tang San couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you and aunt Erlong\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster indifferently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t ask about adult matters. Let\u2019s go. Your comrades are all cultivating in mimicry environments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster didn\u2019t bring Tang San towards the teaching bloc, but rather directly towards the forest in the back.</p><br/><p>While walking, Grandmaster asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what did Dugu Bo teach you? What\u2019s actually going on with you and him?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question had been in Grandmaster\u2019s heart for a very long time, ever since Tang San showed up after the Golden Iron Triangle fought Dugu Bo, Grandmaster knew Dugu Bo wouldn\u2019t so easily take a shine to Tang San\u2019s character. In this past half year he had practically constantly been worrying about Tang San, after all, Tang San was his only disciple, and even more like a son to him.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDugu Bo kidnapping me was originally because of Dugu Yan. Dugu Yan should have told her grandpa about the time I defeated her, making Dugu Bo interested in my Eight Spider Lances. So he kidnapped me to research the poison in my Eight Spider Lances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happened after? From what Dugu Bo said, it seems you helped him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that. Dugu Bo\u2019s poison skills had some defects. I happened to discover a way to make up for those defects. So out of gratitude he taught me a lot of things relating to using poison. If it wasn\u2019t for that, perhaps I would\u2019ve been unable to return to see you alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t explain it in too much detail, he could never tell Grandmaster about him coming from Tang Sect. This time together with Dugu Bo not only increased his level of poison use, at the same time it also gave him the best excuse for the Tang Sect poison techniques. Dugu Bo would never tell people that Tang San\u2019s poison was his own. With the world\u2019s number one Poison Douluo as cover, nobody would ever doubt the origin of Tang San\u2019s poison techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster knew on an even deeper level that, originally, having told Dugu Bo about Tang San\u2019s history, the reason why Dugu Bo didn\u2019t dare kill Tang San and instead taught him poison, was greatly related to Tang San\u2019s past. Recalling this, he also felt more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, in this time you\u2019ve been constantly studying poison with Dugu Bo, but you mustn\u2019t neglect your spirit power cultivation. Your companions all have sky high talent, if you have fallen too far behind, you will perhaps never be able to catch up. How high is your current spirit power rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty seven.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster responded automatically, but he reacted very quickly, his footsteps immediately halting, his expression even stiffening a bit more,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? Your spirit power is already at the thirty seventh rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San earnestly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Last time at Heaven Dou Imperial Academy, under that board members pressure my spirit power reached the thirty fourth rank. Later cultivating at senior Dugu\u2019s place, I advanced three ranks. Senior Dugu\u2019s place had a lot of precious plants, perhaps it\u2019s because that kind of environment suits my cultivation. Therefore, my spirit power advanced very quickly, already reaching the thirty seventh rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster showed a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that my worries were completely unfounded. Even while learning poison under Dugu Bo, your spirit power growth was the fastest of everyone. I\u2019m relieved. In less than half a year the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Grand Spirit Fighting Competition will begin. If it continues like this, perhaps, at that time you will also have had the chance to rush to the fortieth rank. If it\u2019s truly like that, then, it might be impossible for you Shrek Seven Devils not to leave a mark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said this, Grandmaster stopped walking. Ahead was a shrubbery, almost as tall as a person, appearing extremely dense. Grandmaster smiled slightly, and yelled towards the shrubbery,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, take a break, come see who\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words \u2018Xiao Wu\u2019, the smile on Tang San\u2019s face immediately froze, his eyes revealing a deep and grateful mind. He knew that Grandmaster had first brought him to see Xiao Wu because he and Xiao Wu were the closest. Xiao Wu was precisely the person he was most urgent to see.</p><br/><p>With a flicker, a white silhouette flashed out of the shrubbery. A pink tender face brimming with childishness, that pair of exceptionally slender taut beautiful legs, further that unbeatably slender yet extremely agile little waist, as well as the scorpion braid hanging to the ground, could it be anyone but Xiao Wu?</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you\u2019ve come\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu didn\u2019t finish speaking, because in her eyes had already appeared that person she had waited for the most.</p><br/><p>Her pupils contracted practically instantly,</p><br/><p>\u201cGe\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Not caring about Grandmaster\u2019s presence, Xiao Wu threw herself into Tang San\u2019s embrace, her slender thighs as usual twisting around Tang San\u2019s waist, pulling him close. She nestled her pink tender young face deep in Tang San\u2019s shoulder, her own shoulders trembling fiercely.</p><br/><p>Tang San could clearly feel Xiao Wu\u2019s frantic heartbeats. Seeing Xiao Wu again, how couldn\u2019t he be moved?</p><br/><p>Wrapping his arms around Xiao Wu, the rims of his eyes were immediately somewhat red.</p><br/><p>Right now Xiao Wu was still a bit taller than Tang San, and her completely hanging on Tang San gave a somewhat strange impression.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster tactfully didn\u2019t look at them, his gaze instead turning into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Xiao Wu, don\u2019t cry. Haven\u2019t I come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San lightly stroked Xiao Wu\u2019s back, somewhat choked consoling her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWuuu\u2014\u2014 Ge, don\u2019t you want Xiao Wu? Why would you leave for so long\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that Xiao Wu was so moved, for the six or seven years since meeting Tang San the two had never been apart for more than a month. This time Tang San had been gone for half a year, and moreover she hadn\u2019t known where, Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t describe how much she had missed him. She had repeatedly asked Grandmaster where Tang San had gone, but Grandmaster naturally couldn\u2019t tell her Tang San was together with Dugu Bo, otherwise, what would be done if by any chance Xiao Wu rushed to the Sunset Forest?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I, how would I be willing to part with you? It\u2019s all my fault for letting you worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The front of Tang San\u2019s shoulder was already drenched through by Xiao Wu\u2019s tears. Her long slender legs wrapped tightly about Tang San\u2019s waist, seemingly afraid he would run away again.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu raised her head, and by now her eyes were already thoroughly red, pouting with her little mouth:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen in the future you can\u2019t leave me again. Even if you have to cultivate, you still have to bring me along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, I promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Tang San wiped Xiao Wu\u2019s tears, he repeatedly consoled her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s big eyes blinked and more tears flowed out, both hands grabbing Tang San\u2019s neck, she sobbed:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, you know I missed you so much, promise, promise never to leave me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San without the slightest hesitation said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise, unless I die, I will never leave Xiao Wu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s tears then turned to happiness, once again leaning against Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu also promises, she will never leave little San Ge, even if she dies she won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side Grandmaster helplessly shook his head, in his heart thinking, \u2018Today\u2019s youth, huh, really unrestrained. These two little fellows aren\u2019t even fourteen yet. Really precocious.\u2019 But he still didn\u2019t want to destroy their present mood, and only waited quietly.</p><br/><p>Tang San was after all more cool headed than Xiao Wu. Lightly swatting Xiao Wu\u2019s butt,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood girl, come down, Teacher is still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this Xiao Wu recalled Grandmaster\u2019s existence, and her charming face immediately blushed, letting go of Tang San\u2019s waist and dropping to the ground. But she still held on to Tang San\u2019s arm, and no matter what was said wouldn\u2019t agree to let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s go find the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster turned to look at the two. Even though they were still young, they could still be considered ready to be a couple. His eyes revealed a smiling expression, nodded, and continued walking into the depths of the forest.</p><br/><p>Mimicry environment cultivation locations were chosen differently according to each Spirit Master\u2019s spirit.</p><br/><p>Like Xiao Wu\u2019s rabbit spirit naturally was most suited to cultivating in a shrubbery, Dai Mubai was in an animal pen, while Oscar\u2019s was the easiest; as a food system Spirit Master, the kitchen was the place that could best draw out his spirit power. For Ma Hongjun it was a room spread through with stoves.</p><br/><p>Of course, these were all just comparatively common mimicry environments. Under even better conditions, the help in cultivation could still increase further.</p><br/><p>For instance, if Ma Hongjun could have cultivated in a volcanic crater, then the benefits to him would be even greater. Of course, at the same time the danger would increase substantially.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>In a little while, Grandmaster had already brought Tang San to find everyone except Dai Mubai, and the six Shrek Seven Devils gathered in a hall. Everyone were happy to see Tang San again, and Tang San again repeated what he had said to Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what did you say? That Dugu Bo came with you to the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu somewhat shocked looked at Tang San, her expression somewhat pale.</p><br/><p>Tang San thought Xiao Wu was frightened of Dugu Bo\u2019s strength and poison, and hastily comforted her:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, senior Dugu isn\u2019t a bad person. He also promised me that he wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone at the Shrek Academy. Nothing will happen. Besides, now he\u2019s also an advisor at our Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis really is excellent, with a Title Douluo as advisor, how couldn\u2019t our Shrek Academy\u2019s name spread through the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Academy doesn\u2019t rely on its teachers, but rather has to rely on you students.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar stuck out his tongue, but he was terrified of Grandmaster and naturally didn\u2019t dare retort.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t improved from Tang San\u2019s expression, and instead became even paler. Only because she kept her head down, the others didn\u2019t notice anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, where is Mubai secluded? I\u2019d like to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said to Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at a critical juncture of his cultivation, he mustn\u2019t be disturbed now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San pondered, and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I think I have a way for Mubai to break through the fortieth rank bottleneck. I\u2019ve brought back some gifts for each of us to use. Best would be for us seven to cultivate together, this would have a significant assistance to our cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster somewhat astonished looked at Tang San. Breaking through spirit power bottlenecks had always required relying on the Spirit Masters\u2019 own strength to accomplish via unceasing effort. Even someone as familiar with spirits as Grandmaster had never found a shortcut, how couldn\u2019t Tang San\u2019s words excite him?</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was an astute person. Very quickly he became aware of the meaning behind Tang San\u2019s words,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you want to give them, is drugs brought back from Dugu Bo\u2019s place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded.</p><br/><p>After Grandmaster had considered it for a moment, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing drugs to promote strength will inevitably have side effects. In the past there has been some Spirit Masters who cultivated like this, but they always met a bad end. You\u2019re already heaven spanning talents on your own. There\u2019s no need for this kind of shortcut. If by any chance you spoiled things with your enthusiasm, the result wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San prepared in advance said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. The things I want to give everyone have different properties and uses according to each person. There wouldn\u2019t be any side effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar, Ma Hongjun, Ning Rongrong, and even Zhu Zhuqing, all of them now had an inquisitive expression in their eyes. They all wanted to know what the things Tang San had brought back for them actually was.</p><br/><p>After Grandmaster pondered it deeply, in the end he reluctantly nodded and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. However, you have to be careful. You can\u2019t make any mistakes. Ma Hongjun. Go to the animal pen and call over Dai Mubai. Be careful, don\u2019t get injured by the beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun\u2019s spirit was the Evil Fire Phoenix, which had a powerful suppressive effect on any common wild animals. Moreover his strength already surpassed Grandmaster\u2019s, so having him go fetch Dai Mubai was naturally best.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster knew Tang San wasn\u2019t an impetuous person, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have easily agreed.</p><br/><p>Tang San pondered, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, we need a place where we won\u2019t be disturbed. Otherwise if the outside world interferes, it might affect everyone\u2019s ingestion of the medicinal properties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster thought about it and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go to Erlong\u2019s old place. It\u2019s certainly peaceful there, and nobody would go there lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Flender took over the running of the Academy, Liu Erlong had already gone to live in the school buildings. Of course she didn\u2019t feel the school buildings suited her better, but rather it was because Grandmaster lived there. The little wooden cottage she had lived in before was naturally empty.</p><br/><p>Before long, Ma Hongjun had brought back Dai Mubai. Before Dai Mubai had even arrived, his voice already echoed in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019ve come back. If you hadn\u2019t, Xiao Wu might have worried herself to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai wasn\u2019t much different from before, he only appeared a bit calmer. Having already passed his sixteenth birthday had somewhat increased his aggressiveness, but his overall imposing manner was a bit more restrained. The pair of evil eyes radiating health and vigor, his casual movements all had a kind of king among beasts elegance.</p><br/><p>Hearing Dai Mubai\u2019s words, Xiao Wu blushed and couldn\u2019t help making a spitting sound, but she didn\u2019t make any attempts to defend herself.</p><br/><p>Except for Xiao Wu, Dai Mubai was the first to meet Tang San among the Shrek Seven Devils, and meeting once again was especially familiar, holding out his hands to embrace Tang San\u2019s shoulders, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty said you brought back gifts for us that can even help me break through the bottleneck, get it out quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed, raising his hand to punch Dai Mubai in the chest,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll go somewhere quiet first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Led by Grandmaster, everyone stepped into that quiet log cottage. The sunlight brought the shadows of the trees through the windows, the fresh and clean air seeping through the gaps. Listening to the melodious birdsong and the soft wind, it was very difficult to imagine this place was in Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s capital city. Even Grandmaster who was naturally disposed to living a simple life couldn\u2019t help sighing in admiration over Liu Erlong\u2019s excellent choice.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said to Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin. I\u2019ll guard you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, and under everyone\u2019s inquisitive and attentive stares, his right hand stretched into the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse to pull out a kind of plant.</p><br/><p>That was a chrysanthemum with an enormous flower in an exceptionally beautiful violet. Bizarrely, each of the chrysanthemum\u2019s petals seemed to be adorably fluffy on the outside, making them blend into each other. It didn\u2019t release any fragrance, and the stamen rising from the center of the petals was more than half a chi[1] tall, the tip of the stamen glittering with a faint golden radiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was the first to ask, and the others were all also attracted by the plant Tang San pulled out.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled faintly, saying to Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Dai, I prepared this especially for you. It\u2019s called Singular Velvet Sky Chrysanthemum, a neutral immortal treasure herb, when eaten the energy will spread through the four limbs, blood clearing the eight meridians, and you can practice Vajra Strength Body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was shocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo awesome? Vajra strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough \u2018Vajra Strength Body\u2019 is a bit exaggerated, this herb is most compatible with your spirit. Your spirit power is neutral, overwhelmingly vast, and just fiercely potent. The efficacy is all in the limbs, so this will make your cultivation twice as fast for half the effort. Since you\u2019ve already reached the fortieth rank bottleneck, I think it will certainly help you break through the crisis. Once you\u2019ve obtained your spirit ring the medicine will continue taking effect, and should have even greater promoting effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gifts I\u2019ve chosen for everyone all attach most importance to strengthening foundations, they won\u2019t spoil things for enthusiasm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai solemnly accepted the Singular Velvet Sky Chrysanthemum Tang San held out, looking deeply at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re brothers, so I won\u2019t say thanks. How is this thing eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst eat that stamen, afterwards each of the petals, don\u2019t eat the stalk. After eating it immediately start cultivating, dissolving the medicinal strength to break the bottleneck.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai didn\u2019t say anything else, and immediately walked over to a corner to take the herb as Tang San instructed.</p><br/><p>For all this time the fortieth rank bottleneck had always bothered him. Now having the chance to break through, his heart was already burning, impatient to begin. Oscar asked in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what\u2019s an immortal treasure herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something from Heaven, that can only rarely be found in the human world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other, and including Xiao Wu, everyone\u2019s gazes became burning hot. Ning Rongrong giggled, delicately saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, don\u2019t be partial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone has a share. Little Ao, this is yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand stretched into the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse for a second time, this time pulling out a jade case and handing it to Oscar.</p><br/><p>Oscar sighed in admiration,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to even look, just the value of this case alone is considerable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was somewhat speechless:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, this is just common white jade. Two gold spirit coins will get you one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was part stunned, part embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the thing inside is indeed of considerable value. Open it and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar did as asked, and entirely different from Dai Mubai\u2019s Singular Velvet Sky Chrysanthemum, the instant the jade box opened, the whole room was filled with an odd fragrance. A strong orchid fragrance made everyone\u2019s hearts clear and souls brighten, the fragrance penetrating deep into the heart rousing everyone\u2019s spirits, involuntarily inhaling.</p><br/><p>In the jade case quietly lay an eight petaled orchid, the petals trembling minutely, entirely lustrous snow white, giving people a noble and virtuous feeling.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is called an Eight Petal Immortal Orchid, it\u2019s also an immortal treasure herb. It must be picked with gold and stored with jade, and as long as it\u2019s regulated in jade ware, it won\u2019t wither for a thousand years, or a hundred lifetimes. Among all the immortal treasure herbs I brought back with me this time, it\u2019s the one with the gentlest nature, one of the most mellow. Absorbing it is easy, but requires a very long time. Its effect is to strengthen foundations and drive out impurities, its effect should complement the slow cultivation speed you have as a food system Spirit Master. The medicinal effect should even continue until you\u2019ve cultivated to the seventieth rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar opened his eyes wide,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo good? Little San, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] \u00bd  = \u2159 m</p><br/>\n</div>"}

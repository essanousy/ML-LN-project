By the time he reacted, everything was too late. The attack which even he thought he could not block without preparing himself, vanished suddenly without any signs. Right at this moment, a golden \u2018KILL\u2019 appeared on the side of his golden spear without a hint of imposing manner.</p><br/><p>On the shore, Tang San\u2019s eyes finally let out a trace of smile and he said faintly, \u201cEntering the opponent\u2019s domain of unknown element is your entire battle\u2019s greatest failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>&lt;\u201dEntering the opponent\u2019s domain of unknown element is your entire battle\u2019s greatest failure\u201d&gt;</p><br/><p>Obviously, his words were meant for Sealance Douluo. Right when Sealance Douluo barged into Ning Rongrong\u2019s Fantasy Space, Tang San\u2019s spirit power also flew in, and sensed the changes energy to the greatest degree. Indeed, Sealance Douluo\u2019s judgement was correct. Although Tang San could determine his direction through spiritual force, he could not determine his spirit bone ability. But, when Sealance Douluo without hesitation chose to separate his body near the sacred pillar after launching an attack, Tang San deduced that he must\u2019ve had some scheme.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he intended to use the sacred pillar as a cover for his separation, but with his strength as Title Douluo, it was clear that he was still far from where he couldn\u2019t hold up his spirit avatar transformation, and doing this was moreover extremely dangerous. But Sealance Douluo also forgot that he was inside Ning Rongrong\u2019s Fantasy Space.</p><br/><p>Although Fantasy Space wasn\u2019t an innate domain so it couldn\u2019t be compared to Tang San\u2019s two great domains, as a spirit bone domain, its use did not simply end at letting the opponent become unable to search with spirit power. Fantasy Space had but one utility, and that was confusion. Sealance Douluo had exactly made the worst possible judgement under this domain\u2019s effect.</p><br/><p>The pressure from Dai Mubai\u2019s attack wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was a force brought on by a true attack. But the pressure was displaced under the effect of the phantasmal domain. The force and the actual attack were effectively separated. The force and the presence came from one direction, while the actual attack came from another. Because the force came straight towards the direction of Sealance Douluo and the sacred pillar, it completely matched the cunning of the opponent earlier so Sealance Douluo didn\u2019t harbor any suspicions. All of this was within Tang San\u2019s control. No matter what tricks you may use, if not on Dai Mubai himself, then what effect would they have? Dai Mubai\u2019s attack was launched from the side. Even Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi would have a traumatic impact if it was taken completely without defense.</p><br/><p>Because, before the attack was launched, what Tang San ordered Dai Mubai into his ears were: Pink stimulating sausage, limit break dark green sausage, erect golden fly, take them all. Full force with White Tiger transformation, added with Ning Rongrong\u2019s complete support, one could picture the attack power.</p><br/><p>If not for this, then how else would Sealance Douluo sense that Dai Mubai\u2019s attack power didn\u2019t pale in comparison to his eighth spirit skill? One should know that he was an existence liek a purely offensive spirit master!</p><br/><p>BOOM\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Shattered golden light exploded from the Fantasy Space, and at the same time, the space itself slowly dissipated. Ning Rongrong\u2019s domain wasn\u2019t an innate domain after all, and the effect could not be kept up any longer after displacing Dai Mubai\u2019s massive attack force. But how would it matter? The objective was achieved.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Ning Rongrong stood completely wet on the platform of Sea\u2019s Lance Sacred Pillar. Opposite of where they were, Sealance Douluo who separated from his spear was panting with deep heavy breaths. He didn\u2019t fall down on the ground because he barely supported himself with his hand grabbing on the cracked spear, but the clothes on his body were stained red by blood.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s words could be heard in his head. He mustered his strength and turned his head to face him, \u201cIt was you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded and spoke respectfully, \u201cSenior\u2019s strength was truly powerful. If faced head on, Mubai and Rongrong together would definitely not be a match for you. Senior has an incomparably powerful offensive strength. Although senior lost this battle, it was under the teamwork of four of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Oscar didn\u2019t act, his three sausages gave Dai Mubai a further buff, making the White Tiger Annihilating Drive\u2019s power multiply by an extra amount. Otherwise, Sealance Douluo who was one with his spear would not be taken down so easily.</p><br/><p>Sealance Douluo could not help from panting in large breaths, and each time he panted, his lips would leak blood. He was visibly and heavily wounded. He looked at Tang San unacceptably and asked, \u201cHow? How could you predict all of my attacks?\u201d The battle just now where he felt like he was led around by the nose, was one which he found hard to forget for life.</p><br/><p>Tang San made a calm smile, \u201cI\u2019m a control type spirit master. As for the reason why, you will soon understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Rongrong and Dai Mubai\u2019s foreheads underwent a change. Fragmented black light merged into Dai Mubai\u2019s forehead, while Ning Rongrong\u2019s red seven-pointed star shot out a red light on Dai Mubai, then retreated back into the body. It was a sign that the completion of the fifth trial had just reached 50 percent.</p><br/><p>Tiger roaring exploded fresh out of Dai Mubai\u2019s mouth. Although he borrowed Tang San and Oscar\u2019s powers with Ning Rongrong in this battle, he was facing Sealance Douluo with just the two of them, and they had faced him at his top condition. As the one with the fiercest attack power among the seven sacred pillar protectors, the reward he offered was definitely not scanty. Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit energy didn\u2019t just raise by half a level like Oscar\u2019s, but a whole level. With this, it would also help him reach the point of level 80. It was no wonder he could let out such an excited roar.</p><br/><p>Sealance Douluo now felt that his loss wasn\u2019t too unreasonable. From the angle of a fighting spirit, his Sea\u2019s Lance wasn\u2019t second to Dai Mubai\u2019s White Tiger. But no one would think that the guy who appeared to be White Tiger Spirit\u2019s possessor was now at a point where he would about to reach a stage beyond 80 levels. Although he lost this battle against the opponent\u2019s control, it was the same as losing to his own underestimation. If he were to attack hard from the start, then things might\u2019ve turned out differently.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Ning Rongrong bowed slightly to Sealance Douluo at the same time. White Tiger took Nine-Treasure Glazed Tile and soared by using the sea\u2019s surface to return to their companions.</p><br/><p>Just when they reached the shore, Tang San\u2019s shoulder shook and released faint energy waves which surrounded his body. In just an eye-blinking effort, he reached the Sea\u2019s Lance Sacred Pillar platform. This time he released Xiao Wu from his Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse directly, and he didn\u2019t even use Vast Sea Barrier to cloak her. In Sealance Douluo\u2019s current state, if he couldn\u2019t protect Xiao Wu then he wouldn\u2019t be Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t want to challenge senior under such circumstances, I have no other option in order to complete the fifth trial. Please understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sealance Douluo now knew what Tang San meant earlier. Even though he was now heavily injured, he didn\u2019t show any trace of admitting his loss when seeing Tang San\u2019s golden trident brand on the forehead. Taking in a deep breath and swallowing his own blood forcefully, he worked himself up and raised the spear horizontally in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Let me see if you have the qualifications to accept the glory of the Seagod Nine Trials.\u201d Sealance Douluo was obviously not as conversation friendly as Seahorse Douluo. He looked at Tang San in the eye with jealousy and disdain. Jealousy was due to Tang San\u2019s Seagod Nine Trials of course, while disdain was more because of Tang San\u2019s choice to take this challenge now of all times.</p><br/><p>Blue and gold light flowed, and blue light which looked like waved surged out of Tang San\u2019s body. Eight spirit rings came out in a neat fashion. When Sealance Douluo saw the three rings that symbolized the highest class of red, he was completely stunned. Now he truly understood that Tang San absolutely did not count on luck to take the Seagod Nine Trials. Although the opponent had one less spirit ring than his own and there was a sizeable difference between their spirit power, but would he be able to win against this guy in front of him who had three Hundred Thousand Year spirit rings while in top condition? Perhaps only that freak Sea Dragon would have the chance.</p><br/><p>Tang San raised his right hand to press on his own golden trident brand. At that instant, the spirit power took shape and blue light spread out, carrying not only the magnificence of Seagod\u2019s light, but also the intimidating waves of his own spirit.</p><br/><p>All the seawater near the Sea\u2019s Lance Sacred Pillar calmed instantaneously. As still as a blue mirror. The golden light which pierced the sky from the top of the pillar was then dimming until it vanished.</p><br/><p>Sealance Douluo swayed and took two steps back, stabilizing his own body with the spear in his hand again.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t actually use spirit shock to attack him, but it was just an instant release of spirit aura. It was already enough to make this Title Douluo unable to stand firmly.</p><br/><p>The golden trident brand shone brightly this time. Even without Sealance Douluo\u2019s approval, the Sea\u2019s Lance Sacred Pillar\u2019s brand lit up, and its light was fused together with the one from Tang San\u2019s golden trident brand. The notification moved inside his mind, \u201cSpear of the Sea\u2019s Sacred Pillar, trial passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s forehead also flashed a red light.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, are you satisfied with my answer now?\u201d Tang San looked at Sealance Douluo peaceful eyes.</p><br/><p>The corners of the lips turned bitterly. If there was a trace of luck in the heart earlier, then right now, Sealance Douluo didn\u2019t have any thoughts left. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to win against the youngster in front of him no matter what.</p><br/><p>Looking at Sealance Douluo\u2019s lifeless look, Tang San didn\u2019t disturb him and left behind a restoration sausage. He took Xiao Wu and flew, meeting up with his companions to head towards the location of the next sacred pillar.</p><br/><p>Some time after they left, Sealance Douluo sat collapsed on the ground, but the jealousy and disdain in his eyes were completely gone. What remained was just respect, as if he was regretting his arrogance earlier while he prayed to the sacred pillar before him.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils heard Dai Mubai before long, \u201cRongrong, up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai didn\u2019t revert from his spirit form, but called out to Ning Rongrong instead. He got down, hinting for her to get on his back.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong was startled, \u201cBoss, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai chuckled, \u201cMy test was over so there\u2019s nothing for me next. I wasn\u2019t too spent earlier. But you still have two tough battles to assist in. How are you fine with not recovering your spirit power quickly? You and Little Ao get up. I\u2019ll bring you. This will save Little San some time while also letting you recover more spirit power. Just keep up the good work. Although the fifth trial is an individual test, but we can still make use of group strength. Only with this, things won\u2019t be so difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun called it quits, \u201cBoss Dai, why don\u2019tcha let me up too? I\u2019m slow too! And I wanna save my stamina too in order to take part in the later trials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh. Stop dreaming, damn fatty.\u201d Dai Mubai spoke rudely, \u201cYou\u2019re a Spirit Saint so if you think taking a little more walk counts as consumption, then all these years were wasted on you. You wanna take advantage of me? No dice. My Zhuqing would suit the spot much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar glanced at Ma Hongjun a little gleefully. He got up on White Tiger\u2019s back without reservations. The more he looked at that expression, the merrier he felt. He grabbed Ning Rongrong and let her sit in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you wanna come up and rest too?\u201d Dai Mubai asked Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll pass. Even if it\u2019s walking, my spirit power will recover slowly as well. Next destination, Sea\u2019s Illusion Sacred Pillar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sea\u2019s Illusion Sacred Pillar only had Tang San\u2019s own test. Tang San had his own thoughts about choosing it as the third test. Due to his companions\u2019 help, his fifth trial\u2019s difficulty was considerably lowered. But during the battle at the Spear of the Sea Sacred Pillar earlier, Tang San had an inspiration. He realized that his spiritual force was more useful than expected after rising to the Boundless level. He must put it into good use. In the next test, the Title Douluos he must truly face was just three, and those were Sea Illusion Douluo, Seastar Douluo and Sea Dragon Douluo. If these three were defeated, then the fifth trial would be passed. With the fighting style of borrowing the support of companions, Zhu Zhuqing and Ma Hongjun\u2019s upcoming test shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.</p><br/><p>From challenging the fifth trial until now, the amount of time passed wasn\u2019t even more than 4 hours. A large part of it was used on travel. The time spent on actual battling wasn\u2019t that much. The time spent on the first obstacle was especially little.</p><br/><p>So far, The Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 spirit power levels were as follows:</p><br/><p>Evil Eyed White Tiger Dai Mubai, level 80 power attack type Battle Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Big Sausage Uncle Oscar, level 77 food system Tool Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Thousand Handed Asura Tang San, level 84 control type Battle Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Evil Flame Phoenix Ma Hongjun, level 77 power attack Battle Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Soft Bones Demon Rabbit Xiao Wu, spirit power unknown, body resistance increased, water battle ability increased greatly.</p><br/><p>Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Ning Rongrong, level 77 support type Tool Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Hell Civet Zhu Zhuqing, level 78 agility attack type Battle Spirit Saint.</p><br/><p>Among the seven, although Oscar passed the fifth trial with just half a level reward, he trained for some time while at level 76, and reached level 77 with this half level reward. The lowest of the Shrek Seven was also level 77. Besides Tang San and Dai Mubai who reached the stage of Spirit Douluo, the other five were also heading towards that stage as well.</p><br/><p>In just a few years\u2019 time, they withstood that much pain and trained in unbearably harsh conditions, but the results were just as great. Already from common 60 to 70 levels of strength, to the point of almost 80. For ordinary spirit masters, it would be a process that could only be done in several decades.</p><br/><p>Due to Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit avatar helping them rush, everyone\u2019s travelling speed hastened a lot. In just more than an hour, they reached the next destination. The sea within the sea of the Sea\u2019s Illusion Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>As if expecting their arrival, when everyone came, there were yellow and purple dressed class sea spirit masters waiting outside the edges of the sea within the sea\u2019s forest, leading them to the seaside.</p><br/><p>Sea\u2019s Illusion Sacred Pillar was different from the pillars they saw before at Sea\u2019s Lance and Seahorse. While the two pillars were different, the sacred pillar before them was remarkably unique in form.</p><br/><p>Illusionary blue light and shadow was drifted in the middle of the sea. Faint light illuminating the sea, it looked like everything was just a cloudy haze. Under the effect of this blue smoke, it was impossible to make out what was at the center of the sea, so it was naturally just as hard to make out the basic appearance of the sacred pillar and its platform. The golden light of the other pillars that were combined in the sky came from the blue smoke.</p><br/><p>It was a given that the guardian Douluo couldn\u2019t be seen when the pillar and its platform were unseen. For the Shrek Seven Devils, this was even more like an unknown opponent.</p><br/><p>Unknown things were often the scariest. Tang San knew that right when he truly got here, the reason why Dai Mubai and others\u2019 trials did not include this Douluo, was not because the Douluo\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t enough. It was very likely that his strength was too powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do, Little San?\u201d Dai Mubai turned into human form. His spirit power consumption was extremely huge, but eating Oscar\u2019s restoration sausage made him feel not as weakened. After all his fifth trial was already completed.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Tang San\u2019s reply, Oscar followed up, \u201cTo us, perhaps this Sea Illusion Douluo is the strongest. But to Little San, perhaps it\u2019s the easiest? The mist of light before us is similar to Rongrong\u2019s Fantasy Domain, but it counts as innate domain. However, you forgot Boss Dai, that Tang San\u2019s purple spirit eye is the bane of all illusionary domains. We can imagine that this Sea Illusion Douluo\u2019s strength is mainly in domains. If the domain is ineffective, he won\u2019t be stronger than Seahorse Douluo. Little San\u2019s victory is assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun snickered, \u201cGreat! Little Ao, you know how to analyze too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar spoke gleefully, \u201cOf course. Hearing Tang San\u2019s analysis every time would be educating. You think I\u2019m you, you pig brain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you calling pig brain?\u201d Ma Hongjun spoke angrily.</p><br/><p>Oscar snickered, \u201cWho asks me is who.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026..\u201d Ma Hongjun wanted to continue but he was interrupted by Dai Mubai. \u201cAlright, now\u2019s not the time for playing. Don\u2019t influence Little San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar passed a few more sausages to Tang San again, \u201cDon\u2019t save them. I still have spares. No problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded and took a deep breath, then adjusted his own condition. Leaping up, he went towards the blue colored smoke in flight. In mid-air, he already released his own blue silver spirit. Eight spirit rings around his body, he barged into the opponent\u2019s domain.</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s analysis sounded reasonable, but Tang San understood that in reality, this challenge wasn\u2019t as easy as Oscar made it out to be. Oscar\u2019s analysis had missed a point, and that was the level of Sea Illusion Douluo. Title Douluo class domain wasn\u2019t something that could be compared to the spirit avatar level. Innate domains would be used to the greatest effect by the level of Title Douluos, thus Tang San himself couldn\u2019t be sure if he could use his purple spirit eye to break the Sea Illusion Douluo\u2019s domain skill. But just like the previous battle where Dai Mubai and Ning Rongrong used Fantasy Space to win against their opponent, in order to challenge Sea Illusion Douluo, he must enter the domain. Otherwise, it would be a waste a time.</p><br/><p>Entering the smoke, Tang San felt immediate changes. This didn\u2019t seem to be a mist that lingered in the air, but was like an ocean. Deep into it, Tang San even felt that his speed was slowing down as the binding of the surroundings was even more like being in under ocean as breathing felt extremely difficult. The domain\u2019s effect already took hold.</p><br/><p>In order to hurry his way here, Tang San put Xiao Wu into his storage. When the test began, he naturally let Xiao Wu out again. But just like the time when he faced Sealance Douluo, he also didn\u2019t use the Vast Sea Barrier to cloak her. He just wrapped around her slender waist and floated there quietly.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t use his purple demon eye to break the domain in haste. He just spread out his own spiritual force like a giant net inside the smoke.</p><br/><p>When the spiritual force entered the smoke, Tang San immediately felt a massive pressure. Compared to detection in the air, the smoke in front of him posed more than ten times the resistance. The spiritual force spreading was slow, and the things detected were in a great blur.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Tang San\u2019s spiritual force was like it attracted the keys of the smoke. With the prodding of the spiritual force, the blue mist around him moved faster. Tang San only felt that the scenery in front of him changed as all the smoke disappeared, yet below his feet it felt like there was a solid ground. He was then in a large forest.</p><br/><p>A red light flashed, Xiao Wu\u2019s soul had returned to her body. Looking around, she spoke in shock, \u201cIs\u2026.. Isn\u2019t this the Star Dou Great Forest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was shaken, \u201cAre you sure?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu nodded and said, \u201cOf course. I lived for many years in Star Dou Great Forest, and I knew every grass and wood clearly.</p><br/><p>But this isn\u2019t just Star Dou Great Forest, and it\u2019s\u2026\u2026 \u201c</p><br/><p>Just when she said that, figures of people appeared suddenly, and it was nine of them in amazing speed. They surrounded Tang San and Xiao Wu in almost an instant.</p><br/><p>The first one\u2019s entire body was in roiling flames. His appearance was so familiar to Tang San and Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>He was one of the three in the Spirit Hall\u2019s golden generation. Coming with him, were eight powerful Spirit Saints who had seven spirit rings each.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! Why aren\u2019t you running?\u201d He stared at Tang San\u2019s face fiercely as he growled.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Xiao Wu were stunned. This scene was all too familiar to them. Wasn\u2019t this the very scene where Tang San was caught up while he had to rescue Xiao Wu inside Star Dou Great Forest? Because of the people in front of them, Tang San attempted to use his life to let Xiao Wu escape, but she sacrificed herself to save him instead, thus becoming Tang San\u2019s spirit ring and spirit bone.</p><br/><p>Even if he were to be turned to ashes, Tang San would never forget that scene carving on his bones and etched on his heart. His dull eyes turned colder and colder, uncontrollable killing intent surged like a raging torrent. Even when Tang San was calm and wise, when this scene played out before him once more, his world in his mind was going insane.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu shivered, for she clearly felt that Tang San was letting out an indescribably terrifying aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, don\u2019t be rash. This is an illusion.\u201d In comparison, Xiao Wu was much calmer.</p><br/><p>But for Tang San, so what if it was an illusion? Xiao Wu was his sore spot. Moreover, this scene before him was one he regretted for the rest of his life. If not because of being attacked by eight Spirit Saints, why else would Xiao Wu sacrifice herself? If not because of Yearning Heartbroken Red holding Xiao Wu\u2019s life force in place, then he and Xiao Wu would truly have been eternally separated.</p><br/><p>Bone piercing killing intent poured out from Tang San\u2019s heart like a torrent. The temperature around the realm plummeted rapidly as Tang San\u2019s eyes slowly turned blood red in color. He even pulled Xiao Wu into this embrace in a crude manner, holding her slender figure tightly. His lips clenched into a straight line. No one can hurt my XIao Wu again. Not even in illusion.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Tang San moved. His whole being lunged out like a whirlwind. His speed was so frightening, as the Eight Spider Lances broke out of his back, he went so fast he tore off the skin of his own back, spraying blood all over. But this didn\u2019t matter for Tang San. He wanted to tear everything in front of him apart.</p><br/><p>The eight Spirit Saints attacked Tang San almost at the same time, but in just an instant, their eyes lost Tang San\u2019s figure. He passed through their front in the flash of red light. Of the attacks made by eight Spirit Saints, six of them were evaded while two of them landed on Tang San\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The force of the attacks were actually the exact same as the situation back then, but Tang San remained on the ground and even maintained a stance.</p><br/><p>The next moment, sounds of shattering were made as he turned into dozens of fragments which flew in many directions. Behind his corpse, Tang San\u2019s left leg carried a blood colored aftershadow. Just a shine, he used his Hundred Thousand Year evil left leg spirit bone skill \u2018Orca Fang Buster\u2019 to cut apart the corpse.</p><br/><p>Without stopping, Tang San moved again. In this moment, his speed even exceeded that of same level agility attack type Spirit Masters. He didn\u2019t even seem to feel the attacks of the two Spirit Sages that hit him before. The Eight Spider Lances braced against the ground, and he shot forward.</p><br/><p>Countless Blue Silver Emperors surged out from the ground, Ten Thousand Year Spirit Skill, Blue Silver Prison, activated.</p><br/><p>The current Blue Silver Prison wasn\u2019t the same as the Blue Silver Prison back then. Under the effects of a level 84 Tang San\u2019s spirit power, every Blue Silver Emperor was so durable even spirit avatar Spirit Sages would not be able to guarantee an instant escape.</p><br/><p>Next, a circle of red light surrounded Tang San as it burst out, causing the air around to stop completely before turning into a solid crystal, locking everything in place. The eight Spirit Saints were stuck in a struggling state as they were locked inside the crystal body made of frozen air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE.\u201d Tang San growled with near insanity and an explosive sound came as it shattered.</p><br/><p>The bodies inside the crystal were shattered along with the crystal, turning into countless chunks of flesh which blew up in mid-air, dyeing this originally green forest red in almost an instant.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eighth spirit ability\u2019s first technique, crowd restraining certain kill move, Blue Silver, Evil Spirit, Mirror\u2019s Destruction.</p><br/><p>Even when he faced Xiao Bai, he didn\u2019t use this technique all the way as he just used the mirror part of it to lock Xiao Bai\u2019s movement in seawater. This eighth spirit skill\u2019s first technique could temporarily turn air, water, or any matter into a mirror-like crystal. Shatter the crystal body, and everything within the area of effect would shatter and perish. Unless the opponent was already strong enough to withstand the frightening tearing force of this technique, then otherwise, death would be guaranteed. It was an extremely brutal technique which resembled Evil Orca King\u2019s style in a great way.</p><br/><p>Though it was all an illusion before his eyes, but, even if the lives of the eight Spirit Saints were exchanged, the result wouldn\u2019t change. They would still be torn to pieces all the same.</p><br/><p>The mad attack demonstrated Tang San\u2019s true strength, and just like then, Xiao Wu buried her head into Tang San\u2019s embrace. Feeling Tang San\u2019s cold, brutal and terrifying killing intent only made her feel warm. She didn\u2019t remind her man that this was an illusion again. Because she knew Tang San\u2019s state of mind right now, that if he didn\u2019t vent, then it would be worse for him. At the same time she believed that her man would take control of this situation completely.</p><br/><p>Feeling the shattering of surroundings, Tang San\u2019s chest throbbed heavily. Using his spirit bone skill and eighth spirit skill consecutively was a pretty large consumption for him. The consumption which Hundred Thousand Year spirit ring skill could pose was undoubtedly terrifying.</p><br/><p>Along with all the shattering, the scenery changed again. This time, Tang San and Xiao Wu seemed to become bystanders, and appearing before them was a scene which raised the killing intent from his calm yet again.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, there was another Tang San and Xiao Wu, who appeared to be much greener than they were now. The nine people who were shredded were once again in the scene.</p><br/><p>The Xiao Wu in the scene was in mid-air, with a sharp sad ear piercing scream, \u201cAAAAAAHHH\u2014\u2014\u201d from her mouth. Her eyes were no longer shedding tears, but blood.</p><br/><p>The Tang San in the scene had lost his right leg, which disappeared in the air completely. But he himself was scarily calm. When he was spitting out blood, his right hand seized the shimmering blue leg bone from the mist of blood that came from his missing leg, while his spirit power was pouring out uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Turning around fiercely, he didn\u2019t even look at the three attacks that came from behind, and threw the leg bone straight at Xiao Wu in great force.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, spirit bone skill flight, RUN\u2014\u2014\u201d The Tang San in the scene had completely lost his voice, like it was torn apart. He put every ounce of strength in himself and put it all into this throw. At the same time, his left hand grabbed a fragment of the Eight Spider Spear, and stabbed it deep into his own heart.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this scene exactly the one where Tang San sacrificed himself in order to save Xiao Wu?</p><br/><p>Looking at this scene as an outsider, Xiao Wu\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but tremble. That moment when she was about to lose Tang San had once again spread throughout her body. Unable to control her own tears, she cried out while locking her hands on Tang San\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The scene did not end, and everything resumed. Xiao Wu in this scene let out an unbearably sharp cry, \u201cAAAAAAAHHH\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201d. The sharpness of the cry was like it could shake the entire Star Dou Great Forest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As far as I recall, there has never been anyone able to complete a seven spirit fusion ability. But even if it\u2019s not, it should still be a kind of fusion ability, even if it\u2019s not a true spirit fusion ability, it\u2019s still bound to be far more powerful than their own strength. This Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament truly lets me widen my horizons. The youths of today are indeed more formidable than we were.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the number one support Spirit Master on the Continent, his spirit knowledge was quite extensive, and he had especially studied this kind of gem spirit. After all, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was a kind of sublimation of gem class spirits, only sublimated in a support direction.</p><br/><p>Even though Ning Fengzhi wasn\u2019t sure how an ability so similar to seven spirit fusion ability would appear, but he vaguely guessed that this should be the result of a certain fit between the Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s seven members\u2019 spirits, managing to launch a combined group ability with special spirit abilities after obtaining their spirit rings.</p><br/><p>And at this time, perceptive people could also see the cultivation route of the Blue Sunshine Academy seven. And this also left a lot of people extremely stunned. Because, the Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s seven members were unexpectedly all control system Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>One team with seven controllers, this was the first time in all Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournaments that this had appeared.</p><br/><p>The pillar of condensed rainbow-colored light spread in a flash. In an eyeblink it had filled the whole arena, all kinds of gem light spreading from within. That dazzling light didn\u2019t seem to have any attack power, but the audience in the stands were already completely attracted, a dazzled and stunned feeling making a lot of ordinary people bewildered.</p><br/><p>Shrek Academy\u2019s team of seven still hadn\u2019t moved, because Tang San didn\u2019t let them.</p><br/><p>But they had also changed somewhat. Besides Tang San, the other six now all had their eyes closed. Their formation had also changed, unexpectedly somewhat imitating the opponents, six people standing in a circle with Tang San at the center, watching that seven colored light approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cShrek Academy fools, you should feel honored, because you will be the first opponents to taste our Seven Asura Dreamland. Die from your own pain. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>The seven colored light suddenly expanded, instantly covering the whole stage. The stage was round, as was that seven colored light pillar. At this moment, that soaring light practically lit up the whole stadium.</p><br/><p>The indistinct luster was brimming with a bizarre atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Academy team\u2019s seven had already been completely enveloped, or perhaps it should be called swallowed.</p><br/><p>The entire audience was absolutely mute, and the commentator in the VIP seats was even more unable to say a single word. From the start of the competition, who could have anticipated something like this? Even the four matches to the sides halted.</p><br/><p>That seven colored beam of light was really too dazzling. Not just these competing students, but even the coaching teachers were unable to hide their shock.</p><br/><p>Was this really a match between academies? Even Spirit Hall\u2019s Continental Spirit Master Ranking Competitions shouldn\u2019t have something like this?</p><br/><p>Not just emperor Xue Ye thought of the name \u2018seven spirit fusion ability\u2019, but the others who did lacked a Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master to explain it to them.</p><br/><p>With circumstances reversed, the seven colored pillar of light became a symbol, the symbol for the sudden rise of Blue Sunshine Academy.</p><br/><p>Even though the match still hadn\u2019t ended, those tremendous spirit power fluctuations changed the way all spectating Spirit Masters looked at the battle.</p><br/><p>And the audience\u2019s way of looking at it was even more direct. That tremendous and dazzling light was the most magnificent since the start of the competition. Even though a lot of people inwardly supported Shrek Academy, spectators were after all spectators, only figures of power could remain in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Right now, not only didn\u2019t anyone cheer for Shrek Academy, but a lot of people even silently contemplated Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>What was a seven spirit fusion ability? Wasn\u2019t it the formidable ability launched by the completely integrated spirits of seven people? This was a legendary formidable spirit ability. It was also a major reason why Ning Fengzhi said it had never been seen.</p><br/><p>Consider, Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing using the spirit fusion ability was already enough to completely reverse heaven and earth against an equally matched opponent. Grandmaster, Flender and Liu Erlong\u2019s trinity spirit fusion ability had made them world famous.</p><br/><p>And if it truly was a spirit fusion ability used by seven people?</p><br/><p>What kind of amplification would that be?</p><br/><p>Even if Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi launched his Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda effect with all his strength, he would still be inferior. Enough to kill any Title Douluo.</p><br/><p>If that truly was a seven spirit fusion ability, then, there would be no need to continue with this Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament. Let alone the participating academy teams, even veteran Spirit Masters wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><br/><p>Unless it was a team of three or more Title Douluo, who would dare say they could prevail over that kind of legendary spirit ability?</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was a divine ability. Seven spirit fusion ability was publicly recognized in the Spirit Master world as a divine ability.</p><br/><p>In the stands for the competing academies, Flender and Liu Erlong were already on their feet. Liu Erlong was somewhat better, but Flender anxiously wanted to rush out, even rush onto the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlender, calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster exerted himself to grab Flender\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Flender furiously said:</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down your farts! Don\u2019t you see that\u2019s a seven spirit fusion ability? This thing can\u2019t be controlled so easily. Don\u2019t tell me you want to let little San and the others die? At worst we\u2019ll give up on the tournament, but we have to save them first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster curled his lip,</p><br/><p>\u201cFlender, what do you take a seven spirit fusion ability for? If it could be casually used by seven people, how could it be called a divine ability? Even though Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s seven students are pretty good, it\u2019s still far from enough to use this kind of divine ability. What they\u2019re using is only a seven fusion ability. Blue Sunshine Academy really is lucky to find seven students whose spirits fit so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender looked distracted a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven fusion ability? Isn\u2019t that the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled calmly, pulling him back in his seat,</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Flender. Ignorance isn\u2019t scary, what\u2019s scary is not knowing your ignorance. Seven fusion ability and seven spirit fusion ability are as far apart as heaven and earth. One relies on the fit of each person\u2019s spirit ability to fuse, one is the complete fusion of spirits, a sublime divine ability. Could those be the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now Flender couldn\u2019t take Grandmaster teasing him, and questioned closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can little San and the others resist it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the seven fusion ability by far can\u2019t compare to the seven spirit fusion ability, it can still combine the strength of seven people to launch an omnidirectional attack. Even though it looks like seven against seven, as long as the control is enough, it will even give little San and the others the feeling of each fighting seven against one. Under ordinary circumstances, with the strength and teamwork of the seven on stage now, it would be very difficult to resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender cursed in rage,</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same result? Don\u2019t you know that little San and the others had a conflict with Blue Sunshine Academy? If those Blue Sunshine brats were allowed to do as they wished, do you think they would let little San and Mubai and the others off easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Grandmaster to speak up, Liu Erlong to the side also sat back down in her seat, embracing Grandmaster\u2019s arm, smiling:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Fu, don\u2019t you see? If there was danger, Xiao Gang would be even more anxious than you. He regards little San as a son. Look at his expression. He\u2019s clearly playing with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was called confused out of concern, Flender, always astute, came to his senses at Liu Erlong\u2019s reminder. Grabbing Grandmaster\u2019s neck, he said fiercely:</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me the truth quickly, will little San and the others be in any danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong swatted away Flender\u2019s hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will he speak if you\u2019re choking him, don\u2019t be impulsive. If you break him, I\u2019ll stake my life to beat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, she couldn\u2019t keep a giggle from escaping.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster held Liu Erlong\u2019s hand, leisurely saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was another seven fusion ability, perhaps it would be very difficult for little San and the others to resist, depending on how much fighting strength they could issue. But these seven Blue Sunshine Academy students still aren\u2019t capable of that. Flender, didn\u2019t you see their cultivation direction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I saw, they\u2019re all control system Spirit Masters. How\u2019s that related?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster indifferently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s greatly related. It\u2019s just because they\u2019re control system Spirit Masters that I can say they can\u2019t do it. Since you saw they followed the control system route, didn\u2019t you see what kind of control?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender finally came to himself,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026\u2026 But can little San and the others really resist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shot him a sideways glance,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must trust the professionals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender rolled his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I already know you\u2019re the symbol of Spirit Master world professionals. But if the little monsters have any accidents, I\u2019ll come looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Right now the situation at the center of the stage was invisible to everyone. All that could be seen was that dazzling seven-colored pillar of light.</p><br/><p>Tang San stood quietly in place as the opponent\u2019s voice echoed from all directions,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too naive, do you think closing your eyes can block our Seven Asura Dreamland? We\u2019ve already waited far, far too long for this day. Endure the filthiest world you can imagine. Your repressed feelings will leave you especially suffering, until you go insane, this is the price you pay for insulting us. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll go easy, we\u2019ll leave you alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apart from Tang San, the other Shrek Academy members still had their eyes closed. Tang San sighed lightly, indifferently saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe naive ones should be you. Do you believe such a simple illusion can trap us? Compared to Shi Nian\u2019s Nightmare, your seven fusion ability is still quite lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, even though this seven fusion ability would appear magnificently dazzling, and right now all kinds of illusions had already begun to rise from everyone's hearts, compared to when Shi Nian tried to assassinate Tang San, this dreamland spirit ability of theirs was too artless. Essentially lacking.</p><br/><p>The seven colored light shuddered once, and even the illusions at the depths of everyone\u2019s minds became somewhat vague. Clearly, Tang San\u2019s words had been a full hit to the opponents.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 Where is teacher Shi Nian?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he couldn\u2019t be seen, they could tell from the voice that Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s captain was anxious.</p><br/><p>Tang San said indifferently:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his students, want to find him? I won\u2019t give you the chance. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go easy. I\u2019ll leave you alive. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>At just about the same time, Tang San suddenly moved. His figure soared into the bright light, successively kicking six times, but not at the enemies, but rather at the backs of each of his companions.</p><br/><p>Six bodies simultaneously flew in six directions, spewing a mouthful of blood at the same time. And in the air, Tang San\u2019s eyes had already turned purple gold. Chi[1] long rays of purple golden light shot out, flashing in seven different directions.</p><br/><p>Miserable shrieks rose practically simultaneously. When Tang San fell from the air, he lightly swatted his stomach with a palm, and immediately afterward, a trickle of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>The bright light vanished, and everything in the surroundings became clear again. That enormous seven colored pillar of light had disappeared without warning, but of the originally fourteen people on the stage, only one still stood. That was Tang San.</p><br/><p>The appearance of the other six Shrek Academy team members spitting blood was just caught by the audience as the pillar of light disappeared. Seeing them fall to the ground one by one, they had clearly lost all fighting strength.</p><br/><p>But their opponents, the Blue Sunshine Academy team\u2019s seven members had long ago already left their previous positions, separating in seven directions on the stage. Right now these seven were also on the ground, but different from the Shrek Academy team, these seven were convulsing violently, spitting foam, eyes rolling.</p><br/><p>Just like an epileptic attack.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s face appeared very pale and his steps were unstable, swaying from time to time. But his gaze was still unyielding, seemingly telling everyone that he was the final victor.</p><br/><p>An uproar. Whether it was the audience or the VIP section, right now everyone were in disorder.</p><br/><p>Especially those Spirit Masters who had thought Blue Sunshine Academy had fully used a seven spirit fusion ability were even more unable to conceal their shock right now. When that brilliant light had enveloped the Shrek Academy group, they had all already though the match was over.</p><br/><p>But who could have guessed that Shrek Academy would surprise everyone once again. They hadn\u2019t lost even to Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s \u2018divine skill\u2019.</p><br/><p>When the referee declared the final result, he was trembling somewhat. After the participating members of Blue Sunshine Academy had been examined by qualified specialists of the Spirit Master world, the verdict was spirit ability backlash.</p><br/><p>Even though the rules of this Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament expressly stipulated that you couldn\u2019t cripple or kill your opponents, who could be blamed for spirit ability backlash?</p><br/><p>Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s participating members were brought from the stage by their own people, while on the Shrek Academy side, Oscar, Ning Rongrong, and Ma Hongjun swiftly ran over. When Ning Rongrong wanted to release her spirit to boost everyone regardless of being revealed, she was stopped by a look from Tang San.</p><br/><p>The four of them together managed to help the six on the ground off the stage.</p><br/><p>Meeting them was an audience cheering as if welcoming heroes. The Shrek team had yet again defended their position with their own strength. Twelve successive victories was a record to regard with pride.</p><br/><p>Just below the stage, being supported, Dai Mubai couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019re too ferocious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now Dai Mubai, helped by Ma Hongjun, could with difficulty manage to walk. Of course, the \u201cwith difficulty\u201d part was staged by himself. With his head lowered, nobody could see his expression.</p><br/><p>Next to Dai Mubai, Ning Rongrong helping Xiao Wu also lowered her head, unable to keep from saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Dai, what are you saying! Little San didn\u2019t use any strength, wasn\u2019t that blood forced on our own? Don\u2019t tell me he was especially attentive to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai inclined his head slightly, looking at the expressionless Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he was ferocious towards us, but rather to those seven Blue Sunshine students. Those seven are perhaps crippled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether the Shrek Seven Devils or the four substitutes headed by Tai Long, inwardly they couldn\u2019t keep from shivering simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Tang San used a voice only the others could hear:</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were destined to never become our friends. Since it was like that, how could I let these threats exist at our side? If someday I wasn\u2019t here and you ran into them, what would happen? Grass cut above the roots will grow with the spring wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was still another reason. With Tang San\u2019s intelligence, from the time these Blue Sunshine Academy members acted he understood that these seven very possibly were the direct disciples of the Brutal Dream Spirit Master Shi Nian he had killed. The impression Shi Nian had made on him really was too deep, and even though he had successfully killed him, he could never forget Xiao Wu\u2019s tragedy in that illusion. He couldn\u2019t allow that to happen for real.</p><br/><p>It might appear that he had easily destroyed Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s seven fusion ability, but if he hadn\u2019t had an ability that just restrained the opponents, the ending would have been completely different.</p><br/><p>The conflict between the two sides could no longer be resolved, and if by some chance these people learned Shi Nian had been killed by him and would never return, then they would definitely come take revenge for their teacher.</p><br/><p>Taking all this into consideration, Tang San then acted ferociously.</p><br/><p>One reason was to eliminate future trouble. The other was his belief that if he started off leniently, the Blue Sunshine Academy seven could figure out his close connection to Shi Nian\u2019s disappearance.</p><br/><p>But now, they would never be able to reveal this secret. Not even the other six Shrek Academy team members could completely understand just what had happened within that seven colored light.</p><br/><p>Naturally he wouldn\u2019t reveal this secret either.</p><br/><p>Just when Tang San saw their opponents\u2019 seven fusion ability he had also been extremely shocked. As Grandmaster\u2019s disciple, he had instantly determined that it wasn\u2019t a seven spirit fusion ability, but the seven fusion ability the opponents had used could still bring them enormous trouble.</p><br/><p>However, his heart had settled very quickly.</p><br/><p>Seven Asura Dreamland, in the end it was just an illusion. Purple Demon Eye\u2019s ability to eliminate all illusions left him completely certain of victory. That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t in any hurry to let his companions act.</p><br/><p>Compared to Shi Nian\u2019s Nightmare, the Seven Asura Dreamland the Blue Sunshine Academy seven used was still quite lacking. As a result of the enormous spirit power drain of this ability, they were unable to exhibit the kind of meticulous control Shi Nian had that even manipulated the feelings of the victims.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the dazzling seven colored light was the best screen to hide Tang San\u2019s Purple Demon Eye.</p><br/><p>When Tang San had his companions close their eyes, he had already quietly explained his tactics to them. His plan was very simple. He told each of his companions to force out a mouthful of blood when he kicked them away, assuming the appearance of serious injuries.</p><br/><p>That was after all a seven fusion ability. If he let outsiders see their side winning easily, wouldn\u2019t that expose everything they tried to hide? Showing weakness to their enemies, letting their opponents look down on them, that was the ideal choice.</p><br/><p>Everything after that was logical. Seventy second ranked Spirit Emperor Shi Nian had been made briefly despondent by Purple Demon Eye, let alone these Blue Sunshine Academy team whose highest member was only at the forty first rank.</p><br/><p>The instant Tang San set about it, Purple Demon Eye\u2019s attack power had reached an extraordinary degree. In that moment, he had clearly grasped the mental states of each of the Blue Sunshine Academy team members.</p><br/><p>Due to fully using Seven Asura Dreamland, the Blue Sunshine Academy seven had fully exported their spirit power to become mental strength, this was also their special ability. Under such circumstances, their mental defense could be said to be zero.</p><br/><p>Moreover they were even weaker than when they didn\u2019t use their spirits. After all, in the middle of such a powerful seven fusion ability, how could they have anticipated that the opponent could still launch a mental plane attack at them?</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Purple Demon Eye\u2019s mental attack directly pierced the brain, causing spirit power backlash. True, the seven Blue Sunshine Academy members weren\u2019t dead, but they had already become imbeciles. Certain neurological damage made them forever unable to recover. Even the best healing system Spirit Masters were helpless in front of the incomparably precise system that was the brain.</p><br/><p>Tang San had never been a good hearted person, and he was even less like as ordinary as on the surface. Tang Sect itself was both just and nefarious, starting off leniently when facing an opponent that might become a threat would only lead to disaster.</p><br/><p>From seeing the opponents\u2019 seven fusion ability, to the opponents launching their attack, Tang san had informed his team members of the method to defeat the enemies within the bright light. This process was completed with the speed of lightning. With the force of thunder, a single strike. The decisive ferocity within it amply revealed the heart of an Asura under Tang San\u2019s unremarkable surface.</p><br/><p>It was also because of this that Dai Mubai would say Tang San was ferocious. As the strongest of everyone, at that time, apart from Tang San, he had suffered the least influence. Therefore he had vaguely guessed Tang San\u2019s way of dealing with it. Regarding this companion, right now even this Evil Eye White Tiger couldn\u2019t help but inwardly feel some respect and fear.</p><br/><p>The first to express support of Tang San was unexpectedly Ma Hongjun. Fatty\u2019s hands supported Huang Yuan and Jing Ling,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, I support you, mercy to the enemy is cruelty to oneself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gazes of the Shrek Seven Devils flowed together, and nobody made any more doubtful noises. Even though Tang San\u2019s explanation was very simple, the feelings of brotherhood between them had no doubt manifested. They all thought of the same thing. If Blue Sunshine Academy had won, would they have gone easy on them?</p><br/><p>Returning to the rest area, several hundred gazes fell on them practically simultaneously. When someone outside had shouted the words \u2018seven spirit fusion ability\u2019, the competitors in the rest area had all run out, and also saw the final conclusion.</p><br/><p>Blazing Academy\u2019s Huo Wushuang and Huo Wu had seen it, and Godwind Academy\u2019s Feng Xiaotian had naturally also seen it.</p><br/><p>The match hadn\u2019t lasted long, and nobody had seen just how Shrek Academy had won. But they all saw the final result.</p><br/><p>Not everyone had the insight of Grandmaster and Ning Fengzhi. The shock a seven spirit fusion ability caused all the competitors was difficult to describe in words. However, Blue Sunshine Academy had still lost. After using a seven spirit fusion ability, they had still lost. Moreover, everyone had clearly seen that Shrek Academy hadn\u2019t even moved as Blue Sunshine Academy launched their fusion ability, just letting them store power.</p><br/><p>Even though only Tang San was left finally standing on the stage, that Shrek Academy had finally prevailed over Blue Sunshine Academy\u2019s seven spirit fusion ability was very difficult to accept for these competing academy members. Especially Huo Wu.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaotian looked at the somewhat staggering Tang San, and inwardly he couldn\u2019t help a burst of nervousness. \u2018Heavens, that was a seven spirit fusion ability. And that actually couldn\u2019t beat them? This Tang San is too abnormal. Is he really less than twenty five years old?\u2019</p><br/><p>Originally he had complete confidence in himself, believed that Huo Wu would definitely become his girlfriend this time, but after the battle outside just now he was completely without confidence. Looking at Tang San he couldn\u2019t help losing spirit.</p><br/><p>Tang San indicated Ma Hongjun\u2019s trio should release their \u2018seriously hurt\u2019 companions to the side, and let Jiang Zhu use her healing scepter. He himself turned to those hundreds of gazes, only calmly saying one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at us like that. That wasn\u2019t a seven spirit fusion ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring those stunned gazes, Tang San sat down next to his companions and closed his eyes to rest.</p><br/><p>Even though it was only a simple explanation, it still pulled him back from a godly position to the category of an ordinary person, and a lot of people had feeling of letting out a long breath.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Grandmaster, Liu Erlong and Flender had already rushed over. After Tang San had exchanged a few words in a low voice with Grandmaster, they quickly left the rest area under mutual support.</p><br/><p>Watching their disappearing silhouettes, countless competitors immediately started commenting. They all really wanted to believe Tang San\u2019s explanation. After all, prevailing over an opponent with a seven spirit fusion ability in a situation where level didn\u2019t differ much was impossible. What\u2019s more, that seven spirit fusion ability was only a legendary divine ability.</p><br/><p>The audience got a feast for their eyes, but the match today also left all sorts of different notions in peoples\u2019 hearts. Powers on all sides pondered over just how the Shrek Academy team had obtained victory today.</p><br/><p>Very soon, news came from the Blue Sunshine Academy side. All the seven students that participated in the fight had completely lost the ability to think. All had become imbeciles. They had moreover raised stern protests to the organizational committee, demanding severe punishments for Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>For this reason, Heaven Dou Empire and Spirit Hall jointly established a special investigative group, to separately make inquiries into both sides. At the same time, Heaven Dou City\u2019s Spirit Temple dispatched two Spirit Sage level healing system Spirit Masters to specially treat the Blue Sunshine Academy seven team members.</p><br/><p>But just like Tang San predicted, the brain was the most complex part of the human body. It wasn\u2019t something that could easily be restored by healing spirit abilities, and nobody had still truly seen through the mysteries of the mental world. Spirit Hall\u2019s treatment was naturally futile.</p><br/><p>Returning to Shrek Academy, the Golden Iron Triangle directly gathered the Shrek Academy team\u2019s all eleven members to a conference room.</p><br/><p>Right now there was no need for anyone to keep acting, and the originally \u2018seriously injured\u2019 six people all returned to normal.</p><br/><p>Flender\u2019s face was somewhat serious, his gaze first turning to Tang San, and afterwards sweeping across the other six who had participated in the match today.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, then in less than two hours, the tournament organizational committee will dispatch an investigative team to our Academy to conduct inquiries into the match today. I don\u2019t know how you did it, but Grandmaster told me just now that the opponents have completely become imbeciles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other, nobody uttering a word. Everyone\u2019s gazes finally concentrated on Tang San.</p><br/><p>Flender glared at Tang San, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little monster, looking for trouble for me. The seven of you who participated in the match, later immediately go quietly cultivate. I will use your healing process to explain to the other side. Eh, no, little San, you stay behind. We still need someone to be investigated. At least on the surface your injuries were the lightest, that makes you the most suitable candidate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe six of you leave now. Erlong, find them someplace hidden, have Zhao Wuji and Lu Ji Bin go there to guard them personally. Don\u2019t let anyone see them. Oh, right, call over Shao Bin as well. That Sweet Pea Spirit of his is suitable to cover up their injuries. Jiang Zhu, you go too. Appearance is important, more healing system Spirit Masters is better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now Flender fully revealed the poise of a dean. Liu Erlong stood, smiled at Tang San, praise in her eyes, then brought Dai Mubai and the others away. She was originally the slaughtering corner of the Golden Iron Triangle, so of course she quite liked Tang San\u2019s unwaveringly fierce way of dealing with things.</p><br/><p>Once Liu Erlong\u2019s group had left, only Flender, Grandmaster, Tang San, Oscar, Ma Hongjun and Ning Rongrong remained in the room.</p><br/><p>Flender pulled out a chair and sat, but didn\u2019t utter a word. He raised his hand to rhythmically tap the table, seemingly pondering something. Grandmaster sat to the side from the start, with a calm and easygoing appearance.</p><br/><p>Before long, Flender raised his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, if the investigators later ask you how you broke the opponents\u2019 seven spirit fusion ability, how will you answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sincerely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>In battle his insight was boundless, but in this kind of scheming, he could never catch up to Flender.</p><br/><p>Flender\u2019s eyes brightened, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, remember that answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked distracted a moment, but he reacted very quickly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer that I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, whatever they ask you, just say that you don\u2019t know. Tell the investigators that because you couldn\u2019t clearly see the outside at that time, you just constantly released your spirit abilities. Once the surroundings became clear again, everything was already over. You basically don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San blinked,</p><br/><p>\u201cWill that work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it? Those investigator fellows are just making the rounds. Nobody actually saw what happened that time. As long as you stick to the three words \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, they won\u2019t be able to extort a confession. As long as there\u2019s no proof, we\u2019ll say those Blue Sunshine Academy students lost control of their spirit ability, and were turned to vegetables by the backlash. What can they do? Everything needs proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun behind Tang San thought out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this villainous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughter escaped from Grandmaster to the side,</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know, in villainy, who can compare to the grandmaster of scoundrels, Flender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender unhappily shot Grandmaster a glare,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tear down my authority, ok? Little San, do you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hastily nodded, indicating he remembered. Wasn\u2019t it the three words \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019? Replying \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 whatever the question, wasn\u2019t that simple?</p><br/><p>[1] 1 = \u2153 m</p><br/>\n</div>"}

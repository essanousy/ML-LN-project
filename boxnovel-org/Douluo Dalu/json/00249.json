He stood there idly, and was completely unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>The inspector of the sixth trial had actually changed from the Seagod seven sacred pillars\u2019 Guardian Douluos... into Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi? To him, this news was just too shocking. The faces of his companions were unsightly, but they weren\u2019t as knowledgeable about Pinnacle Douluos as Tang San.</p><br/><p>Who was Bo Saixi? She was once one of the three strongest powers in the world, and on Seagod Island, even if Tang San\u2019s great grandfather, or Spirit Hall\u2019s Great Priest Qian Daoliu, were to come, neither would be able to win against her. It could be said that while on Seagod Island, Bo Saixi was currently the number one person in the world of spirit masters\u2014a true champion.</p><br/><p>If the Shrek Seven had all reached the Title Douluo class, perhaps Tang San would have some small amount of confidence towards challenging her. But when the only one who had an eighth spirit ring was him, how could this battle truly be fought?</p><br/><p>Obviously, Bo Saixi was just a single person, but she would be much more terrifying than the Seagod seven sacred pillars\u2019 Guardian Douluos. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine how things would unfold should she used her full strength. Forget about Tang San himself and the other five. Even the seven sacred pillar guardians together wouldn\u2019t be able to hold her! To them, a level 99 Title Douluo wouldn\u2019t be too different from a god. Don\u2019t talk about a single joss stick of time; whether or not they could withstand a single attack from Bo Saixi was a huge problem within itself. One would be afraid that if she just made a simple attack, the six of the Shrek Seven Devils would be obliterated.</p><br/><p>The face of Sea Dragon Douluo at the side also became extremely weird. He also knew of Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi\u2019s strength. To last a single joss stick\u2019s time under her attacks, how could this trial even be passed? If it were the seven Guardian Douluos themselves then there would be some slight chances. Provided that Bo Saixi didn\u2019t borrow Seagod Hall\u2019s power. On Seagod Island, Bo Saixi\u2019s title as the world\u2019s number one power was definitely not a baseless boast.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, is this real? Why giving us a mission that\u2019s impossible to complete?\u201d Tang San\u2019s eyes flared with anger. He wouldn\u2019t retreat, but could this trial really be passed?</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi smiled slightly, \u201cHold on for a moment. I haven\u2019t finished speaking. In the process of the trial, I cannot use the power of the sea and Seagod Hall to attack you. I cannot use the power of domains. Just my first six spirit skills. At the same time, if there is still one of you standing out of six after a joss stick finished burning, then you\u2019ll pass. But you only have one chance. Due to your fifth trial\u2019s difficulty drop, you only have three days to recover yourselves. After three days, you will immediately take my test.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Bo Saixi\u2019s explanation, some color then returned to Tang San\u2019s face. Indeed, if they faced Seagod Douluo at her full strength, they would absolutely not have any chances, but with these conditions, they wouldn\u2019t be in a complete disadvantage. Not being able to use the seventh, eighth and ninth spirit skills meant that Bo Saixi couldn\u2019t use spirit transformation\u2019s three strongest spirit skills, and thus the strength would be greatly reduced. Not using the powers of the sea and Seagod Hall was no doubt a good limitation. Most importantly, Seagod Douluo wouldn\u2019t use her domains.</p><br/><p>Tang San twisted his brains and thought quickly. Now, Dai Mubai behind him asked Bo Saixi, \u201cThen senior, can Zhuqing participate in the battle with us after those three days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi smiled calmly, \u201cSure. But those conditions imposed on me earlier would be cancelled. Take your pick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUrgh\u2026. Forget it.\u201d Even without a thought, with Zhu Zhuqing as an addition, even Phantom Nether White Tiger would definitely not be a match for the powers which Seagod Douluo would otherwise be restricted in their use.</p><br/><p>Tang San moaned, \u201cI have one last request, senior. Can you let us choose the location of the challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou can choose anywhere within Seagod Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San replied without hesitation, \u201cThen we choose the bottom of Seagod Mountain. We await senior\u2019s advice in three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi smiled as she held her chin, \u201cAfter three days, I\u2019ll wait for you Seagod Mountain.\u201d Red colored figure floated and then disappeared like red clouds without any additional movements.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi had left, but the Shrek Six Devils didn\u2019t even feel relaxed. They just passed the fifth trial and yet they had to face such a difficult sixth trial after three days. Of course they wouldn\u2019t think that Bo Saixi could be dealt with just because she would only use her former six spirit skills. One should know that her spirit power was level 99. No matter her battle experience, usage and control of skills, or her spirit power which far outclassed theirs, she wasn\u2019t someone they could deal with easily.</p><br/><p>Sea Dragon Douluo who stood at the side smiled helplessly, \u201cI really don\u2019t know if I should congratulate you or feel worried for you. Being able to receive Lady Bo Saixi\u2019s guidance would no doubt be a boon for your future training. You should all know by now that in us seven Seagod seven sacred pillars Guardian Douluos, other than me whose battle spirit wasn\u2019t bad, the others would only be slightly above average at most. The reason why we could become Title Douluos was actually because we received Lady Bo Saixi\u2019s guidance. You can say that without Lady Bo Saixi, there wouldn\u2019t be us of today. But in our eyes, Lady Bo Saixi is unpredictable, and the real vast sea. With her at Seagod Island, no matter if it\u2019s powerful hundred thousand year spirit beasts or land spirit masters, none dared to encroach on Lord Seagod\u2019s pride, and thus our blessed land can be protected. All of you should be mentally prepared. Lady Bo Saixi just needed to use half her spirit power, and I couldn\u2019t take any of her spirit skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Six Devils were already dejected. When they heard what Sea Dragon Douluo said, they just glanced at each other, and other than Tang San, their souls had all but completely left them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your reminder, senior. There is still three days\u2019s time left, and we will plan well. Farewell.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving Sea Dragon sacred pillar platform, everyone returned to the forest outside the Sea Witch sacred pillar to rest while waiting for Zhu Zhuqing to absorb the bestowed spirit ring. After Tang San picked the spot of resting, he immediately sat down with knees crossed and didn\u2019t speak a single word. Everyone who knew him would understand that this was his habit of entering deep thought. No one disturbed him as they just quietly sat down to train. The battle after the three days would be the finish line of this trial for Oscar, Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun. The outcome of the trial was at this point. If they were to fail, then according to Sea Horse Douluo, the result would be\u2026...</p><br/><p>And thus, it could be said that Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi would be the key to the survival of the six. She said that they only had one chance, so there was no room for carelessness. Since this trial was given, then it at least proved that should they pull it off flawlessly, they would still have a chance to complete the trial.</p><br/><p>What Tang San thought about was every single word that Bo Saixi just said, again and again and put together with Shrek Six\u2019s own strength in precise calculations. Bo Saixi\u2019s strength could be said to be unknown to them. Thus Tang San\u2019s calculations could only include how he should make use of all of his own to the best of ways. Achieving the best effects, using the rules, six against one. This isn\u2019t opportunism, but wisdom.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing finished the absorption of her bestowed spirit ring after two days, thus became the second of the Shrek Seven to reach Spirit Douluo status after Tang San. She also obtained a very powerful single target attack technique, which greatly increased her own strength. Unfortunately, her technique couldn\u2019t be used in the sixth trial at the next day.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Zhuqing finished absorbing the bestowed spirit ring, Tang San also stopped thinking. The final day was the time he arranged strategies and practice them.</p><br/><p>A single joss stick\u2019s time isn\u2019t short. If it burned normally, at most it would take an hour\u2019s work. For someone like Bo Saixi who\u2019s at the pinnacle, an hour was enough for her to do a lot of things.</p><br/><p>How to utilize Shrek Six\u2019s own strength to last for a single joss stick\u2019s time in all sorts of ways, was what Tang San had been thinking about in the past two days. In the final day, he wanted to discuss with his companions and pile up their thoughts, for a singular plan was surely unfeasible. Only with multiple preparations would there be a slightly greater chance.</p><br/><p>The sixth trial hasn\u2019t begun but the pressure was already on. Facing the moment of life or death, everyone\u2019s brains became more active and their potentials were also being stimulated subtly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, then I\u2019ll let Xiao Bai take me out to the sea once and simply find a ten thousand year spirit beast to increase my strength to Spirit Douluo stage. With one more spirit ring, our total strength would increase slightly.\u201d Dai Mubai spoke decisively.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tang San immediately objected his suggestion, \u201cThe sixth trial may be perilous, but we also can\u2019t gamble with your future. You should understand that for a spirit master, the eighth and ninth spirit skills has considerable importance. It\u2019s a direct contrast of strength in similar level confrontations.\u201d If the sixth trial were passed, Dai Mubai would surely get additional bestowed spirit rings as a reward, and then he would have the eighth spirit ring which suited him the most. How would it be the same as simply finding a ten thousand year spirit beast?</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai curled his brows, \u201cBut if we can\u2019t pass the sixth trial and perish here, what use would it be in talking about this? In the seven of us, I\u2019m the oldest. If I can let everyone overcome this ordeal by increasing my strength, then it\u2019s definitely worth it. And isn\u2019t your eighth spirit ring a sea spirit beast? It\u2019s also good! That isn\u2019t saying sea spirit beasts don\u2019t fit us. It just depends on what type it is. I\u2019ve thought about this very clearly in these two days. If the bestowed spirit ring isn\u2019t going to need me breaking my limits to absorb it, then the time in this final day is already enough for it. So don\u2019t stop me, Little San. Let me go for everyone\u2019s survival. It\u2019s all for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai had stood up as he said that, and he turned around to leave. Tang San kicked up fiercely and grabbed his shoulder, \u201cYou can\u2019t, boss! You\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else also stood up. Besides Zhu Zhuqing, Oscar, Ning Rongrong and Ma Hongjun all blocked Dai Mubai\u2019s way. Dai Mubai tapped on the hand that was grabbing on his shoulder, \u201cLittle San, Little Ao, Rongrong, Fatty, don\u2019t you all stop me now. As the group\u2019s boss, and the only one currently facing the bottleneck, this choice was made to ensure we can all live on. No matter how good the spirit skill, if people are dead then what\u2019s the use? At the same time I\u2019m doing this for Zhuqing as well. I don\u2019t want her to become a widow before she even gets married to me. Compared to death, what\u2019s it matter if the spirit skill ends up a little worse? Furthermore, Xiao Bai is a hundred thousand year spirit beast. As the overlord of the sea, you think she can\u2019t find me a suitable spirit ring? Under these circumstances, we can leave Seagod Island anytime we wish, yet with the restraints of the trial, we will just die if we don\u2019t participate in time. I\u2019ll ask you all then. If it\u2019s your own spirit powers reaching the bottleneck, will you make the same choice? If you are sure of your answers, then don\u2019t stop me. We are one. I\u2019m your big brother and no one can die. We have trained so hard on Seagod Island till this day, for what? It\u2019s for wiping out the Spirit Hall when we return to the continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon speaking to this point, Dai Mubai\u2019s eyes were flickering with majesty. An incomparable dominance and being the big brother of the group made Tang San and others stop getting in his way.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing smiled a little. Her beautiful eyes didn\u2019t contain the slightest worry, but they were filled with pride for his own man. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d She went and pulled Dai Mubai\u2019s hand as she said that. The two of them floated and disappeared in the depths of the woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Boss Dai should go if he has to. After all, if the trial is passed and our levels are enough, give me a bestowed spirit ring to save it for him. Let him use it as his ninth spirit ring.\u201d Ma Hongjun swung down his fist powerfully.</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s eyes went wide in a stare, \u201cDammit you fatty, how can you say what I wanted to say? You\u2019re the fourth, and I\u2019m your second brother. These matters aren\u2019t up to you. Tell you what. Don\u2019t cut my cue until it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. This is everyone\u2019s matter. Not something that can be taken by a single person. When we come across a more suitable spirit bone then we prioritize on letting Boss Dai choose it. If it doesn\u2019t fit him then we\u2019ll think up a way to switch a more suitable one. As for other ways to make up, they\u2019ll all have to wait until we pass all the trials. Well, let prepare for the battle tomorrow. Mubai made such a great sacrifice for us, so we have to give it our all.\u201d</p><br/><p>In just a moment\u2019s time, Zhu Zhuqing returned. She told everyone helplessly that because of having completed all the trials, she can\u2019t leave Seagod Island. Xiao Bai said to her that although everyone\u2019s relationship was good, she also can\u2019t disobey Lord Seagod\u2019s will. If Zhu Zhuqing insisted on leaving the island then she would be attacked by every Great White Spirit Sharks and incur the pursuit of the seven sacred pillars\u2019 Guardian Douluos. She could only return without a choice.</p><br/><p>Early morning, when the first glow of the morning sun hit the Seagod Island, it landed on Seagod Hall which stood monumentally on the peak of Seagod Mountain. The sacred golden colors covered the entire mountain, making all the plants around here seemingly let out a strong drive for life.</p><br/><p>The ring shaped sea was still clear, but it wasn\u2019t still. Seven water lines charged straight from the coast side towards Seagod Mountain. Seven people were standing on top of them without any visible movements, yet their figures were traversing the ring shaped sea in a shocking speed.</p><br/><p>Upon closer inspection, under the feet of the seven, each of them were standing on a giant white shark. These were the lords of the sea, Great White Spirit Sharks.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai was noted that today the Shrek Seven would have to challenge against Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi, so she led six of her clansmen to bring them on their way. Of course, in her words, this might be the last time. While she didn\u2019t give everyone encouragement, in her eyes, the Shrek Seven still had a lot of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back now. If you are still alive after this, remember to tell me about it as the seaside.\u201d Xiao Bai looked at everyone deeply and left with the six of her clansmen.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Bai\u2019s fading figure, Shrek Seven\u2019s eyes became extra firm. Bai Chenxiang descended from the skies and landed next to them.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai smiled towards Zhu Zhuqing, \u201cHoney, give me a little stimulation will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing blushed out, but amazingly she didn\u2019t retort. She went up to him and wrapped her hands around his thick neck, locking her hips with his. Her usually cold self actually displayed such a passionate side out of the blue, like ice has become water, melting Dai Mubai along completely.</p><br/><p>Oscar immediately turned and looked at Ning Rongrong amorously, \u201cHoney, I want it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong gave him a slap out of displeasure, \u201cWant your face! Wait until after this trial. If the last one standing is you, I will consider giving you a reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar spoke helplessly, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. Look at Zhuqing and Mubai\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong grumped, \u201cZhuqing doesn\u2019t need to participate, while I still do. If you mess up my concentration and doom everyone, will the responsibility be on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUrg\u2026.., then forget it. I\u2019ll hold myself back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Zhuqing kissed Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun\u2019s eyes then landed on Bai Chenxiang, \u201cXiangxiang, look\u2026., this\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang\u2019s face then had a shyness to it while she approached next to him slowly. Right when Fatty was excited about whether or not there would be a rosy scene coming up, Bai Chenxiang stopped and spoke in a low voice, \u201cAfter you pass this trial, I\u2019ll let you kiss me. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, of course\u2026..\u201d After hearing what Bai Chenxiang said, Fatty\u2019s voice trembled. It wasn\u2019t because of excitement, but because in his fit of happiness, Fatty felt that the phoenix flames were burning at that instant. It was like a beastly blood was boiling all over his body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu arrived next to Tang San nimbly and didn\u2019t say anything more. She just held his hand. For this sixth trial, Xiao Wu\u2019s soul had already returned to her body back at the coast. The duration of her soul habitation was enough to last her through this trial.</p><br/><p>Tang San pat on Xiao Wu\u2019s head and then touched on the neat scorpion tail. He kissed her forehead and instructed in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive and just do things according to plan. Just remember that if you run into problems again, what you take, I will take it harder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu seemed remarkably well mannered and nodded, \u201cI know.\u201d She suddenly stood on her toes and kissed on Tang San\u2019s lips. In her giggle she held onto Tang San\u2019s waist and rested her head on his warm chest, enjoying this last moment of peace before the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all ready?\u201d A voice like lofty clouds and clear winds came by, and the faces of the Shrek Seven became heavy. They formed a horizontal file, while Bai Chenxiang also stood next to Ma Hongjun, looking at the direction of Seagod Mountain.</p><br/><p>Red colored figure came from the sky, and no one knew how she appeared like always. Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi had already landed before them. Compared to usual, her face was now having more smiles yet more strictness to it as she looked at Shrek Seven. Her eyes looked from Tang San\u2019s face to Bai Chenxiang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you have only one chance, and I will not go easy. If you can\u2019t pass my trial, then you should be very clear what punishment Lord Seagod will give you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi said that, everyone instantly felt the air became heavy and their hearts seized up. The intense pressure felt like it was making them unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>Right now, Tang San suddenly stepped forward and raised his chest with a loud voice, \u201cWe\u2019re ready, and we will pass your trial!\u201d His voice was full of tremors coming from his soul, like a pendulum which broke through Bo Saixi\u2019s pressure, giving his companions\u2019 eyes their firmness.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi replied calmly, \u201cGood. Then unrelated people can just watch at the side. The trial will begin soon.\u201d She waved her sleeve, and Zhu Zhuqing and Bai Chenxiang only felt a massive irresistible energy coming from all sides and their bodies tightened. The next moment, they already flew like on the clouds, landing directly on the stairs leading to Seagod Hall. The height was over fifty steps.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s flipped her wrists like when she took out other items before, and amazingly a joss stick appeared. Even Tang San\u2019s Purple Magic Eye couldn\u2019t see how she did it. It was like the object appeared directly from her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I\u2019ll light it up for you.\u201d Ma Hongjun spoke suddenly, while he spat out lightly a seemingly insignificant thread of fire towards the joss stick above Bo Saixi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi smiled and let the phoenix flame land on the tip of the joss stick, \u201cThen I\u2019m not gonna hold back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon watching how the joss stick was successfully lit, the worries were rising like smoke, But Ma Hongjun\u2019s expression then took a turn and spoke in a suspecting tone, \u201cSenior, there\u2019s something wrong with your joss stick! Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s gonna burn longer than normal ones. If that\u2019s the case then it\u2019s not fair to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi glared at him for a bit. Ma Hongjun only felt that his own soul was like it had been seen through. He erred on the side of caution and subconsciously took a step backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying a qualified joss stick is one that can be turned to ashes instantly by your phoenix flames?\u201d Bo Saixi laughed while she didn\u2019t stick the joss stick at the side. She just held it with her left hand and blew the tip with her breath, \u201cYou all be careful now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the first trick having failed, Shrek Six\u2019s minds instantly became tense. They didn\u2019t count on the first trick to work, but just to delay a bit of time. For them, it would be advantageous for the joss stick to burn a little more.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Tang San shouted, and at that instant, the Shrek Six moved. When Bo Saixi was watching with a somewhat confused look, the six actually shifted their figures and each of their backs were forming faint white wings, giving them fast flight which was like a smoky haze. The directions they flew to were all different. In just a moment, they had already crossed the ring shaped sea at several hundreds of metres away, and their speeds were showing signs of increase.</p><br/><p>The sixth trial was about lasting through Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi\u2019s attacks for an hour, but it wasn\u2019t said that it had to involve a direct struggle. This was what Tang San discerned from the contents. Therefore, when Ma Hongjun was distracting Bo Saixi, they had eaten mirror image sausages. Bo Saixi couldn\u2019t possibly know what the sausages\u2019 effects were, but she also had no way of knowing that the effects turned out to be Sharp-tailed Rain Swallow battle spirit which came from Bai Chenxiang\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang only had five spirit rings while any of the Shrek Seven had seven and more. Using the mirror image sausages that had Bai Chenxiang\u2019s blood was equal to using their own spirit powers when they were level 70s and 80s but only at fifth spirit ring\u2019s degree, without even a spirit avatar transformation. However, this was no longer important to the Shrek Six. What\u2019s more important was how they could last for an hour under Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi\u2019s attacks, not the means.</p><br/><p>Tang San accurately calculated that after Bai Chenxiang broke through five spirit rings, her speed could increase again, even when considering Zhu Zhuqing who reached her eighth spirit ring. The agility could not be compared, but the point was that Zhu Zhuqing could not fly as her speed was only on the ground. Bai Chenxiang\u2019s speed could be used to fly like birds.</p><br/><p>Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi said it herself that day, that she would not use the powers of the sea and domains. This way, she couldn\u2019t use the ring shaped sea\u2019s waters to suppress everyone. With the flight of Bai Chenxiang\u2019s battle spirit, and in different directions, even if Bo Saixi wanted to attack, she could only do it on a single target. Attacking would cost time, and it was not an exception for a powerhouse like her. She wanted to eliminate them one at a time, but under the frantic escape of the Sharp-tailed Rain Swallow battle spirit, the loss of time would naturally be quick.</p><br/><p>The abilities of Bai Chenxiang\u2019s fifth spirit skill were simple. The first one was increasing speed, the second one was increasing speed, and the third one, was still increasing speed, and until the fourth one would be evasion. The fifth spirit ring from Evil Orca then gave her a search wave disruption ability.</p><br/><p>This fifth spirit skill could commence in area search and have the results of it fed back to herself, while disrupting every spirit power search from others at the same time. The disruption power was decided by how great the user\u2019s spirit power was. If Bai Chenxiang were to use it, she wouldn\u2019t be able to disrupt any single one of Shrek Seven, not to mention Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi. However, when Tang San and the others used this skill at the same time, the disruptive power reached an extremely terrifying extent.</p><br/><p>No one dared to have any reservations when it came to Bo Saixi. When they were flying, they already ate stimulant pink sausages and they almost simultaneously deployed Bai Chenxiang\u2019s fifth spirit skill and went full throttle to fly out irregularly while releasing strong search disrupting waves.</p><br/><p>The only visible things in mid-air were rings of grey waves colliding each other and covered the entire space. Especially Tang San\u2019s released waves which carried a layer of blue glow, like they had eyes which went straight towards Bo Saixi.</p><br/><p>Facing such a development, Bo Saixi couldn\u2019t help but feeling a bit startled. She didn\u2019t think that Shrek Seven would actually use such a way to counter her. According to her original assumption, she thought that Tang San would use the location of the trial, the bottom of Seagod Mountain, to use the myriad of plants on it to deploy his blue silver domain in order to achieve the best effect.</p><br/><p>Tang San and seven others had come to Seagod Island for nearly four years. Bo Saixi was watching them, especially Tang San in his Seagod Nine Trials. For all of Tang San\u2019s various abilities, she also knew them clearly. But the battle against Sea Dragon Douluo three days ago surprised her once more. Especially the final hidden weapon Tang San used, which was very marvellous. In a battle of same strengths, it definitely had the ability to turn everything around. But overall, Tang San\u2019s strongest means were still the two domains and his own various skills in fighting, also the synergy with his companions and accurate calculation. Unexpectedly, Tang San actually came up with such a dispersal tactic today. Although it appeared to be somewhat helter skelter, the effect was spot on. Even Bo Saixi couldn\u2019t help but praising it in her heart.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on the corners of Bo Saixi\u2019s lips, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll play with you.\u201d Faint blue glow appeared on her body, which immediately blocked the disruption waves whenever they touched her. In a flicker, she flew. Without chasing after anyone, she went straight towards the sky like she was climbing it. The speed of it was faster than the speed of the escaping Shrek Six. In a blink of an eye, she reached the altitude of several hundreds of metres.</p><br/><p>This was followed by Bo Saixi\u2019s self embrace. She rotated once, and in that instant, a blue turbulence was formed from her, expanding rapidly around her body. With a shake of her shoulders and the tremble of her arms, the blue light\u2019s expansion increased by several times. It appeared to be a gigantic whirlpool in mid-air, which somewhat resembled a hurricane on the surface, but it was definitely not a power of wind. Because within it were complete waves of water element.</p><br/><p>With Tang San as the lead, the disruption waves from everyone had indeed disrupted even Bo Saixi\u2019s spirit waves, making her unable to lock on to everyone. But was it really effective?</p><br/><p>Indeed. Bo Saixi said it herself that she wouldn\u2019t use the sea\u2019s power. But Seagod Island was a sea island after all, and in here, the water element energy molecules were more abundant than on land.</p><br/><p>The frantically flying Tang San suddenly felt a powerful pulling force from behind. His originally forward charging self was slowed instantly as the speed of flight dropped dramatically. It was like his own self was tied by a rope, pulling him backwards.</p><br/><p>In surprise, Tang San looked back and saw Bo Saixi in mid-air embracing herself and the conditions of his companions. His heart immediately sank.</p><br/><p>Tang San was no doubt the strongest of the Shrek Seven. If he could feel how great he was being held back by the pulling force, then it would be much more worse for others.</p><br/><p>The ones who felt it the strongest were Oscar and Ning Rongrong. Although they used the mirror image sausages made with Bai Chenxiang\u2019s blood, they were still support type spirit masters. The spirit power may be strong, but under the fearsome pulling force, the struggling appeared to be so powerless. They watched as they could no longer fly forward, and they were quickly pulled backwards.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun and Dai Mubai could at least stabilize their own selves. While flying forward had become very difficult, they could at least make sure that they wouldn\u2019t be pulled backwards. Xiao Wu\u2019s condition couldn\u2019t be compared to theirs. She wasn\u2019t being pulled backwards rapidly like Ning Rongrong and Oscar, but she was slowly going backwards.</p><br/><p>Bo Saixi\u2019s method of dealing with the escaping Shrek Six was very simple. \u2018Didn\u2019t you just seal my spirit search? Very well then. I\u2019ll just use an omni-directional attack to deal with you.\u2019 Although the Six were very dispersed, to the Seagod Douluo whose spirit power was as vast as the sea, this bit of distance wasn\u2019t even enough to escape from her grasp.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even if my big brother has always thought unfavorably of me, no matter what he\u2019s still my brother, and his wife\u2019s also Zhuqing\u2019s big sister. I don\u2019t want to experience the feeling of kindred butchering each other again. I might as well go missing, and let my big brother inherit the title. Little San, you\u2019ve also seen the circumstances of Heaven Dou Empire, being a monarch isn\u2019t that easy. Let alone dealing with ten thousand affairs, there\u2019s also countless pressures to undertake. I could never be as leisurely and relaxed as now. Even though Zhuqing always said I never improved, in fact, I like the feeling of being with my brothers like this. Me and Zhuqing talked it over, and finally might as well not go back. Leave everything for after big brother becomes emperor. We won\u2019t go back, so they\u2019ll naturally think we\u2019re already dead. So what if they discover us later? With my present strength, even if the imperial family wants do anything against us they might not be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat astonished looked at Dai Mubai, saying helplessly:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people want to become the ruler of a nation, but you toss it away like worn out shoes. Boss, perhaps only you can regard authority so lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I admire you. You put it succinctly, how could we be so leisurely and relaxed as emperor? You don\u2019t need to go back, I\u2019m simply even happier than knowing we can safely leave Seagod Island. Afterwards we brothers don\u2019t need to part again, us Shrek Seven Devils will always be together. Once little San resurrects Xiao Wu, and we\u2019ve all eliminated Spirit Hall, we can tour all over the continent together, wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe thought so. Rather than pursuing authority, it would be better to pursue the summit of spirit masters. We can\u2019t compare to third brother, but with our present circumstances, reaching the Title Douluo level wouldn\u2019t be a problem. My biggest dream as a child was to become a female Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjuns gaze was always curiously fixed on the Seagod Trident in Tang San\u2019s right hand. Now he couldn\u2019t help speaking up:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, your trident is all black. It doesn\u2019t look like anything! I still thought this thing should be dazzling. Can\u2019t you let me take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, turning the trident horizontally in his hand, holding it out to Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun reached out and wanted to grab the trident, but discovered Tang San didn\u2019t show any sign of letting go. He couldn\u2019t help glancing at him, thinking, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because it\u2019s a divine instrument, third brother doesn\u2019t want to let me look at it? No way! Third brother never thought of worldly possessions as important.</p><br/><p>Tang San saw Fatty\u2019s inwardly doubt,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I won\u2019t let you hold it, it\u2019s that I\u2019m worried you can\u2019t. This trident is very heavy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said somewhat doubtfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, you\u2019re underestimating me too much. I\u2019m still eighty first rank. No matter what I\u2019m at the Spirit Douluo level. Even if this thing is a divine instrument, I\u2019d still at least be able to lift it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San halted, smiling:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, then try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he bent his waist, placing the trident flat on the ground, then made an inviting gesture to Ma Hongjun. Without Tang San\u2019s hold, the Seagod Trident\u2019s wight immediately emerged. Even though Tang San had placed it on a rock, the rock immediately sank into the ground, only half of it still remaining visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks quite heavy! I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty stepped up with daredevil spirit, both hands grabbing the trident. With a sudden exertion, he wanted to raise it from the ground.</p><br/><p>The one hundred eight thousand jin heavy trident naturally didn\u2019t budge a hair. No matter how Fatty exerted himself, he couldn\u2019t move it in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally is heavy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty straightened his waist, giving a loud shout, releasing his spirit and grabbing the trident again.</p><br/><p>The result was of course no different. Even though he had reached rank eighty one spirit power, it was impossible for his strength to reach one hundred eight thousand jin.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Oscar were both a bit eager to give it a try, but Oscar was stopped by a glance from Ning Rongrong. She had personally seen Seagod Douluo Bo Saixi use all her strength and just managed to move the trident. These guys lacked far, far too much to compare to Bo Saixi, so how could they move the trident?</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai just wanted to try it as well, but Tang San stopped him. He didn\u2019t want to see his elder brother make a fool of himself. Fatty was younger, and also the first to try, so that was still fine, but Dai Mubai was after all everyone\u2019s boss, so if Tang San still didn\u2019t explain the circumstances of the trident, he\u2019d be letting his brother down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to try. In my hands the Seagod Trident weighs one hundred eight jin, but to others, it will be a thousand times that, reaching one hundred eight thousand. If you want to move it, you\u2019ll at least need ninety fifth rank spirit power to make it possible. And only boss Dai would have a chance with physical strength.</p><br/><p>Next, Tang San went over Bo Saixi\u2019s introduction of the Seagod Trident, hardly hiding anything.</p><br/><p>Listening to him, everyone looked at each other, then spit out the same word in unison,</p><br/><p>\u201cFreak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, didn\u2019t Tang San feel the same when he learned about the Seagod Trident\u2019s weight? What he was thinking about now was how he could make it his weapon in the future, how to use it. The Tang Sect had no polarm skills.</p><br/><p>Very soon, everyone arrived at the shore. Tang San found a gray cloth in his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, and wrapped it around the Seagod Trident. After all, even though the trident was completely black, its shape really was too garish. In the realm of the ocean, who didn\u2019t know the Seagod used a trident for a weapon? Even if they didn\u2019t suspect the weapon in Tang San\u2019s hand was a divine instrument, it wouldn\u2019t be any good thing if they thought he was faking it.</p><br/><p>Without need for Tang San\u2019s prompting, Ma Hongjun had already taken charge of the situation, releasing his Phoenix spirit to summon Xiao Bai.</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai arrived even faster than they expected. In just a moment, it appeared in their view with ten Devil Spirit Great White Sharks. Gray blue light flashed, and Xiao Bai\u2019s human form walked up on the beach.</p><br/><p>Even though they had already seen her transform into a human many times, when they saw her slender beautiful form again, Dai Mubai, Oscar and Ma Hongjun still couldn\u2019t help secretly swallowing. Only their hearts now now had a place they belonged, and they wouldn\u2019t show it too clearly, to keep the lionesses from roaring.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Tang San, was the manifestation in the sky a few days ago related to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai had just come ashore when she impatiently asked.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, this time we came to say goodbye. I already cleared the seventh trial, so we\u2019re leaving. The High Priest said that we just need to use the Seagod\u2019s Light for shelter, and we won\u2019t be restrained by the laws of Seagod Island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San still hadn\u2019t finished before Xiao Bai\u2019s gaze became burning hot, falling to one knee,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy respects, lord. Congratulations lord on drawing the Seagod Trident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San left Xiao Wu to Ning Rongrong, then hurriedly stepped forward to pull up Xiao Bai,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, don\u2019t be like this, we\u2019re friends since long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai firmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Tang San, it\u2019s different. To us ocean creatures, the lord Seagod is paramount. You\u2019re his successor, the future ruler of the oceans. Even if you currently still haven\u2019t passed all the Seagod Nine Trials, I believe that you will definitely succeed. At that time, you will be the joint ruler of the oceans. Naturally also our master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m your master, then I order you that there is no need for you to salute me hereafter. Can we always associate as friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai\u2019s eyes immediately brightened,</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, you\u2019ve got a golden mouth and jade tongue. Then we\u2019ll leave it at that. Heheh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar gathered over to the side:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Bai, was this premeditated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cPremeditated your face. Since you want to go, I\u2019ll give you a lift. It\u2019s faster this way. We are familiar with these waters, so wherever you want to go, it saves a lot of time by the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San spoke, \u201cWe want to return to Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s Heaven Dou City. Can it be reached from the sea as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Bai replied, \u201cWe can send you to the closest place, which can save at least half of the journey\u2019s time. Since you have Little Ao\u2019s sausages as food, let\u2019s take off now. It should take about three days time of cruising on the sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone took the offer and got on the backs of Xiao Bai\u2019s tribe mates. This wasn\u2019t the first time they rode sharks. With the Great White Spirit Sharks\u2019 speed, the time it took to return would naturally shorten by a large margin. Under Xiao Bai\u2019s serious request, Tang San could only bring Xiao Wu along with him to Xiao Bai\u2019s back. According to Xiao Bai, being able to carry Seagod\u2019s heir and the Seagod\u2019s Trident around made her the luckiest of all sea spirit beasts. Of course, the trident must be in Tang San\u2019s hand, or else she too wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand that horrifying weight.</p><br/><p>Basking in the Seagod\u2019s Light, the Great White Spirit Sharks began their voyage, finally leaving Seagod Island after four years of training.</p><br/><p>Due to the long duration cruising, everyone sat on the backs of the Great White Spirit Sharks. With their physical qualities, the long duration cruising didn\u2019t mean anything. Tang San held Xiao Wu with one hand, and Seagod\u2019s Trident with another. An unspeakable joy was in his mind as he felt the sea breeze.</p><br/><p>It was already more than four years since they left the continent. On the way back, the Shrek Seven all had an urgent desire to return home.</p><br/><p>Smelling Xiao Wu\u2019s faint fragrance, Tang San couldn\u2019t help but think about his disciple Ji Xiang. Ji Xiang had great medical skills. Tang San also thought about bringing him back to the continent together, but after deep consideration, Tang San still put away that thought. When the eight of them left Tian Dou City, Douluo Continent was already in turmoil. After four years, Spirit Hall would definitely not stand still, and the continent\u2019s circumstances were hard to speculate. Ji Xiang was kind in nature and pure like a piece of paper. Letting him get stained by the world\u2019s filth and darkness was not a good thing. Spirit Hall\u2019s forces were massive, and even if the strength of the eight of them had definitely soared, Tang San was still unconfident that they would be able to go head to head against Spirit Hall. Letting Ji Xiang stay on Purple Pearl Island and have him become a doctor would let him have a somewhat dull life, but at least it would be a peaceful and happy one.</p><br/><p>Tang San only had more than level 60 soul power when he arrived at Seagod Island, but when he left, everyone in Shrek Seven was at the level 80 notch besides Xiao Wu whose soul power was unclear. After the fight against Bo Saixi and the overexertion from the pulling of Seagod\u2019s Trident, Tang San\u2019s soul power had become extremely close to level 85. Breaking through would simply be in within a few days.</p><br/><p>Other than Tang San, Dai Mubai\u2019s soul power was the highest, which reached level 83, just a single level of difference. Other than him, the next highest would be Ning Rongrong. After the fifth trial involving Titled Douluos, her soul power went from level 77 to 78. After the sixth trial, it reached level 79. Finally, after the end of Top Class Seven Trials, she was rewarded three levels of increase. She not only broke through with her bestowed spirit ring to level 81, but also reached level 83, coming to a draw with Dai Mubai.</p><br/><p>From this, one could tell that the higher rank the trials, the greater the rewards would be. Ning Rongrong was merely a support type spirit master, but could catch up to Dai Mubai\u2019s soul power. The benefits could be discerned from this, especially when her spirit rings showed surprising power changes. Other than the first two spirit rings, they had all turned into rings above ten thousand years. A noteworthy point was that when Tang San was unconscious, Ning Rongrong used the bestowed spirit ring after her spirit rings improved her physical properties upon powering up, to finally break through the hundred thousand years limit, obtaining her first hundred thousand year spirit ring. If one was to look at it from the angle of spirit rings and soul power, she was now the strongest among Shrek Seven other than Tang San. Disregarding her level 83 power, there were frightening spirit ring ranks of two purples, five blacks, and one red</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong didn\u2019t disappoint her partners upon having the eighth spirit ring. Her eighth spirit ring not only had two powerful supporting powers, but also cause all her buffing skills\u2019 effects to increase to 90 percent, increasing the Shrek Seven\u2019s strength explosively.</p><br/><p>After Ning Rongrong, Oscar and Ma Hongjun had a single trial more than Zhu Zhuqing, which let them catch up to Phantom Nether Cat, and the three of them were now at level 81.</p><br/><p>Of course, the one with the largest gains was still Tang San. Even though Seagod Nine Trials didn\u2019t give him any spirit power rewards, his power was still the highest among everyone, and the greatest gains were no doubt the trident and Seagod\u2019s Light. Plus his Purple Magic Eyes had reached the Vast Sea level and he got two hundred thousand year spirit rings, a hundred thousand year spirit bone, and the evolution of his fifth spirit ring. He only had a strength of level 85, but even if he were to go up against a level 95 Title Douluo, he would have a way to fight and have even greater odds of winning.</p><br/><p>If it could be said that Shrek Seven were simply outstanding figures among young spirit masters, then now, they could be counted as a powerful group which could match up to many of their peers combined. As everyone rose to Spirit Douluo stage, Tang San with his two domain skills, Ning Rongrong\u2019s 90 percent buffs, Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s battle spirit fusion skill, Oscar\u2019s powerful buffing sausages, and Ma Hongjun with his seven headed flame phoenix, had no doubt become a near perfect group of powers. Even if they were to face Title Douluo of same quantities, they would definitely be able to fight back.</p><br/><p>Now, the only thing left was Xiao Wu\u2019s resurrection. Tang San could clearly feel that with Xiao Wu having the same Top Class Seven Trials as Ning Rongrong, her final rewards would definitely not be worse than Ning Rongrong. Perhaps they would even surpass Ning Rongrong due to stacking. Tang San decided that after returning to the continent, he would hurry and look for suitable spirit rings to add to his Clear Sky Hammer, increasing his own soul power in the process. When the hammer finished absorbing the spirit rings, he would also revive Xiao Wu by then. As for the events that took place in the continent, they would have to wait after Xiao Wu\u2019s resurrection. Using Clear Sky Hammer with eight rings as an insurance, his own Blue Silver Emperor being weakened by five rings wouldn\u2019t matter. Simply finding other suitable ones would do. The power of Clear Sky Hammer with eight rings, would definitely not be weaker than Blue Silver Emperor. After all, Tang San planned to give the hammer at least rings that were higher than ten thousand years in rank.</p><br/><p>Settling his thoughts, Tang San held Xiao Wu\u2019s hand tightly. Her waist was still slim and more flexible than before. He was satisfied when he kissed her hair. Xiao Wu was his most precious honey.</p><br/><p>The speed of the Great White Spirit Sharks in the sea was terrifying indeed, especially under Xiao Bai\u2019s lead. As the ruler of the sharks, Xiao Bai was one of the overlords of the sea. Although they had left own fiefs and kept crossing over the fiefs of other sea spirit beasts, none the sea spirit beasts fail to get out of the way as they feared angering the overlords of the sea.</p><br/><p>After the rushing of three days under the sea breeze, a black horizon finally appeared a distance away in the sights of the Shrek Seven. At this moment, everyone cheered. They finally returned after leaving the continent for four years.</p><br/><p>Tang San and others set foot on the continent once more. Before Xiao Bai left, he used the sea chart to verify their location and then parted ways. Xiao Bai told Tang San that if they wanted to go back, just release the light of Seagod\u2019s Trident, and she would be able to sense it and come within three days.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Bai circled in the sea three times, she left leading her tribe mates, eventually disappearing into the horizon.</p><br/><p>Setting foot on the continent again was something everyone was excited about, no doubt. But Xiao Bai\u2019s departure also left them with a forlorn feeling. After all, they also lived on Seagod Island for four years. For normal people, how many \u2018four years\u2019 are there?</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai stood next to Tang San, \u201cLittle San, what\u2019s our plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Heaven Dou City first. We left for so long after all. But I will not stay there for too long. I want to bring Xiao Wu to look for suitable spirit beasts to hunt and take their spirit rings. I will use the time to get past Title Douluo stage by putting spirit rings into the Clear Sky Hammer, to increase its power quickly and make it easier to revive Xiao Wu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you might as well not delay, but just directly bring Xiao Wu to hunt spirit beasts. With your present strength, you wouldn\u2019t even need to fear meeting hundred thousand year spirit beasts. We\u2019ll go back to Heaven Dou City to wait for you first, I don\u2019t know what the circumstances are over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, he unfolded the map, and everyone gathered round.</p><br/><p>Pointing on the map, Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our position, Xiao Bai was right, with their escort we\u2019ve cut down at least half the journey, it\u2019s straight east from here. It\u2019s about ten days journey to Star Dou Great Forest, there\u2019s lots of spirit beasts living there, so I\u2019m planning to bring Xiao Wu there. If it goes smoothly, I believe that in one year at the least, two years at most, I can resurret Xiao Wu. Afterwards I\u2019ll converge with everyone at Heaven Dou City. You head northeast from here, you\u2019ll find the way after you\u2019re on the official road, I estimate you can return to Heaven Dou City in around twenty days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun grinned:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, my brother. I won\u2019t be polite with you. Xiangxiang is young, and homesick from being away for so many years. I won\u2019t keep you company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang hit him lightly, her face red. Indeed, as a girl, she hadn\u2019t experienced the wind and rain like the Shrek Seven Devils. After so long, how couldn\u2019t she miss home?</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you believe in my strength? No need to keep me company, you all go back. Teacher presumably needs help there. Fatty, after going back, you\u2019re in charge of supervising the Tang Sect. Hurry up and organize your martial hall at the same time. With your present strength, nobody would refuse you as hall master. Rongrong, little Ao, after you get back, tell uncle Ning that if he can, find a place for the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School next to our Tang Sect. Watch out for each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong and little Ao nodded. They both knew that because of what happened back then, emperor Xue Ye should have doubts about Ning Fengzhi. Emperor Xue Ye should have passed away in these years, and they didn\u2019t know the sect\u2019s circumstances. Consequently they were also anxious to get back, and didn\u2019t propose going to Star Dou Great Forest with Tang San.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cMe and Zhuqing will go to the Academy. You don\u2019t need to worry with us there. Even though it\u2019s been four years, the Heaven Dou and Star Luo great empires are after all deeply rooted, Spirit Hall dealing with them isn\u2019t just a morning\u2019s work. Heaven Dou City is the capital as well, it wouldn\u2019t have changed too much. That kid Xue Beng schemes deeply, he\u2019s a clever guy, he\u2019s bound to rule wisely when facing a threat like Spirit Hall. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t you have five years for your eighth trial, finish it as quickly as possible. Later we\u2019ll go kill that hundred thousand year Deep Sea Demon Whale together, taking revenge and wiping out all grudges. Then once you\u2019ve inherited the position of Seagod, we\u2019ll put our cards on the table with Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen take care as you go, hide as much as possible. Even if we\u2019ve been gone for a few years, Spirit Hall is bound to have warrants of arrest out for us. Be careful on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dao Mubai waved his fist with complete confidence,</p><br/><p>\u201cThose Spirit Hall bastards, if one comes we\u2019ll kill one, if two comes then two. As long as we\u2019re not completely out of luck and surrounded by Spirit Hall elders, what can they do against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>They\u2019d already challenged Title Douluo without Spirit Douluo strength, let alone when they were now all on Spirit Douluo level, and also without restraints. Even lacking one Tang San, with the five devils\u2019 strength, two or three Title Douluo didn\u2019t count.</p><br/><p>Tang San temporarily left Xiao Wu to Ning Rongrong, and took two steps forward. Reaching out with his left arm he hugged Dai Mubai, his left hand holding the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said in Tang San\u2019s ear:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, once we meet again, I want to see a complete Xiao Wu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San clapped Dai Mubai\u2019s back,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, boss, you definitely will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Releasing his arm, he also separately hugged Oscar and Ma Hongjun once. They had been partners for so many years, even if they wouldn\u2019t part for too long this time, the feeling of leaving wasn\u2019t wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, you can\u2019t discriminate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong gave Xiao Wu to Zhu Zhuqing, taking the initiative to step forward spreading her arms, giving Tang San a big bearhug.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be afraid certain people will be jealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar to the side crooked his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, who asked us to be brothers, I\u2019m temporarily blinded. En, Rongrong, that should do it, I\u2019ll really become jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong paid no attention to Oscar, looking at Tang San with red rimmed eyes:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, look after yourself on the way, take care of Xiao Wu. We\u2019re all praying for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will. Unless I die, nobody can harm her again. I will take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong let go and took Xiao Wu from Zhu Zhuqing. She turned her head, but tears still fell. She\u2019d just left, when Zhu Zhuqing stepped up, equally hugging Tang San hard,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, we\u2019ll all miss you. Come back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled and nodded, rubbing the head of this youngest seven devil,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf boss Dai bullies you after you get back, go find Rongrong and have her help you. She can definitely beat the teeth out of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s eyes were originally already red. Hearing what Tang San said, she couldn\u2019t help giggling. Wiping the tears from her eyes, she still nodded cutely.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if she doesn\u2019t bully me. Me bully her? I don\u2019t have the skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Zhu Zhuqing and Dai Mubai really showed that everything could be bested. That overbearing Dai Mubai couldn\u2019t raise any temper when facing Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, can I hug you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang\u2019s voice was timid.</p><br/><p>Tang San took the initiative to spread his arms, smiling:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you can. You\u2019re my little cousin! Even if Fatty sometimes is a bit jumpy, a bit lazy, he sincerely likes you. I also believe that he will focus wholeheartedly on you hereafter. Only that guy is the kind who\u2019ll take the roof off if he doesn\u2019t get a beating every three days, so you can\u2019t give him too much face. Just go ahead and beat him. Also, keep him close.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he hugged Bai Chenxiang.</p><br/><p>When Ma Hongjun heard the first half of what Tang San said he was originally extremely proud, but once it got to the latter half, he couldn\u2019t help making a bitter face. He wanted to argue, but saw the warning glance Tang San shot him, clearly warning him not to bully Bai Chenxiang, and that he wasn\u2019t allowed to go sleep around anymore.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai rubbed his fist, grinning:</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave that damned Fatty to me. If he has any errant behaviour or bullies Xiangxiang, as the elder brother, I\u2019ll sort him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girls all had red rimmed eyes. Tang San didn\u2019t let Xiao Wu\u2019s soul out, since he was afraid her soul would go unstable from emotions.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai clapped Tang San\u2019s shoulder hard, and said to everyone:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and go. If it goes on like this, we won\u2019t be able to part. A temporary separation is the beginning of meeting next time. Go, go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, he pulled along Zhu Zhuqing and led the way northeast. Zhu Zhuqing clearly saw that Dai Mubai\u2019s eyes were also a bit red.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San struck the Seagod Trident on the ground, the one hundred eight thousand jin weight making the ground shudder. Taking Xiao Wu from Ning Rongrong\u2019s embrace, he no longer paused, but leapt up and headed east.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai halted, turning his head to look along with Zhu Zhuqing. Everyone watched Tang San and Xiao Wu disappear, then gradually returned to their senses, quietly leaving with the sadness of farewell.</p><br/><p>Tang San brought Xiao Wu along for a full two hours before his mood gradually restored. Looking at Xiao Wu in his arms with a lifeless look in her eyes, firm conviction replaced sadness. No matter how, this time he had to completely resurrect Xiao Wu. This place was remote, so he might as well not travel on foot. The Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone flight ability launched, and he brought Xiao Wu up to fly through the air, meeting the morning sun.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils had once again set foot on Douluo Continent. It seemed, the beacons had lit once again.</p><br/><p>After flying for close to four hours, Tang San distantly saw the wide official road. Opening up the map to take a look, this was within the borders of a subordinate kingdom on the edge of Heaven Dou Empire, H\u00e4agen-Dazs[1]. This kingdom was in the northwest of Heaven Dou Empire, sharing part of its border with Star Luo Empire. By following the official road from here, passing through H\u00e4agen-Dazs Kingdom and then Balack Kingdom, you could reach Star Dou Great Forest. And around two hundred li east from here was one of the H\u00e4agen-Dazs kingdom\u2019s strategic points, West Lu City.</p><br/><p>Days of travel plus previously passing the Seagod sixth and seventh trials, Tang San was a bit weary. Even if his spirit power had already recovered, he still decided to bring Xiao Wu to rest a while in West Lu City. After he\u2019d again travel by flight for Star Luo Great Forest. Travelling by air was at least twice as fast as on foot, he could reach his destination in at most five days.</p><br/><p>Two hundred li was to Tang San a very short distance since long ago. He brought Xiao Wu the whole way to around ten li away from West Lu City before landing. Due to his and Xiao Wu\u2019s appearance really being too conspicuous, he took out two veiled bamboo hats from Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, and they each wore one.</p><br/><p>Arriving outside West Lu City, this place was considered a main city, but slightly smaller than an ordinary main city. Outside the gates were roughly twenty soldiers inspecting the travellers. It seemed the inspection was quite strict. Each and every one of the soldiers looked ferocious, lined up in a neat formation, without the slightest show of slacking due to only guarding the gates.</p><br/><p>What made Tang San most curious was these soldiers\u2019 uniform. Each soldier had the two characters for \u2018Spirit\u2019 in yellow on the left side of their chest. It also seemed like their equipment was quite good, each soldier wearing leather armor. Quite rare for soldiers patrolling a city gate.</p><br/><p>What was the meaning of this? Why did the soldiers wear the spirit mark?</p><br/><p>Tang San wondered, only, judging by these circumstances he clearly couldn\u2019t pass through the gate with Xiao Wu. First let alone that he didn\u2019t want to show his or Xiao Wu\u2019s appearance to these soldiers, he absolutely couldn\u2019t let them inspect the Seagod Trident. Juding by the rigorous inspection, entering the city armed clearly wasn\u2019t easy. And the trident was so enormous.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, the Seagod Trident brand on Tang San\u2019s forehead flashed once, and enveloped by pale blue light, he and Xiao Wu quietly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Even though the Vast Sea Ocean Shroud had turned back into the Seagod\u2019s Heart and completely merged with the Seagod Trident, after experimentation, Tang San had discovered that as long as he held the Seagod Trident, he could still use the original Vast Sea Ocean Shroud abilities, as if those four abilities had all been branded on his skull bone.</p><br/><p>Relying on the Vast Sea Ocean Shroud\u2019s stealth ability, Tang San brought Xiao Wu to fly high, passing above the city walls and landing in West lu City. Finding a remote unobserved corner, he showed himself again.</p><br/><p>[1] H\u00e4agen-Dazs - () Seriously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even just half of a kilometer long iron cable was still astonishingly heavy, and there were still three people on top of that. But in his hands it was all like nothing, and the iron cable swiftly brought the trio up.</p><br/><p>At last reaching the mountaintop, Tang San didn\u2019t feel anything, but those two grey clothed men he saved both had pale faces.</p><br/><p>Returning from struggling at the edge of life and death, nobody would feel any better than them.</p><br/><p>That leading grey clothed man also loosed a large breath, his gaze fixed on the still gracefully calm Tang San, and suddenly struck at his shoulder with a fist.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s shoulders shifted slightly, then stopped. He didn\u2019t block, because he clearly sensed that the grey clothed man\u2019s fist didn\u2019t hold any malice.</p><br/><p>The fist landed on Tang San\u2019s shoulder with a thump, and the leading grey clothed man laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood brother, many thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, go a bit easier next time, your fist is really heavy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The grey clothed man forcefully clapped Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a break, it\u2019s clearly your bones that hurt my hand. I really don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve trained. I\u2019m Tang Long[1]. It\u2019s fine if you call me big brother. In our generation, I\u2019m the oldest. These two are Tang Tian[2] and Tang Yu[3], they\u2019re also our directly related brothers. This time you saved their lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Tian and Tang Yu\u2019s faces were long since filled with gratitude, and the two nodded to Tang San. Tang Tian said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, your favor can\u2019t be repaid in words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San valiantly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all brothers, don\u2019t mention it. If you were in my place, you\u2019d also have saved me just the same, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yu had a bitter expression:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe would if we had that ability! I heard you had twin spirits. Was that just now your main spirit Blue Silver Grass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded.</p><br/><p>Tang Long smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond aunt\u2019s boasted about you like a deluge of heavenly flowers, I didn\u2019t believe it before, but I do now. Being able to have your present cultivation at your age, really isn\u2019t easy. You seem to have broken through the fiftieth rank. Not any less than these two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Tian and Tang Yu looked face to face. Even though they didn\u2019t say anything, in their hearts they thought, \u2018How is it just \u2018no less\u2019, previously he could even spare spirit power to help us speed up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Without speaking of anything else, as three people fell simultaneously, he could react to save others and himself, this reaction speed wasn\u2019t something average people could compare to.</p><br/><p>Tang Long looked over the broken iron cable, and said unhappily:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis worn out thing should have been changed. Today really was unlucky, we actually ran into a bird. We can only blame my carelessness, if I paid a bit of attention and discovered it a bit ahead of time, there wouldn\u2019t have been such a careless mistake. I\u2019ll definitely be scolded back at the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him dispiritedly hanging his head, Tang San couldn\u2019t help smiling a bit. This seemingly somewhat forthright sect brother really was straightforward.</p><br/><p>Tang Tian said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, let\u2019s go back quickly. Don\u2019t keep the sect master waiting. This cable breaking also can\u2019t be blamed at you. We were just unlucky. If the sect master punishes anyone, we\u2019ll bear it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Long grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood kids. The next time there\u2019s good wine, I\u2019ll invite you to drink. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>This fifth peak was also the final one to enter the Clear Sky School. The secluded sect was located on this mountain.</p><br/><p>Even though there were no pavilions and kiosks, there was still a castle-like building. It was entirely grey, appearing as if part of the mountain. It occupied practically the entire mountaintop.</p><br/><p>Somewhat more familiar with the three people, Tang San also no longer kept his distance from them like before, and couldn\u2019t keep from asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Tang Long, with our Clear Sky School in this kind of rugged terrain, how are the necessary supplies brought in? Is it also via these iron cables?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Long nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a special training method of the sect. Every sect disciple over sixteen will participate in moving supplies. Of course, ordinarily the safeguards used aren\u2019t just like what we use today. Then there\u2019s a kind of safety rope, so even if the iron cable breaks, it can at least guarantee your safety. Who could have thought that we\u2019d be so unlucky today. I remember the first time Tang Tian was going to cross the iron cable. He was so scared he was crying and his nose leaking. Haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Tian embarrassed looked at Tang Long, unhappily saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was so many years ago. Why are you still bringing up my embarrassing past in front of brother Tang San? Let\u2019s return to the sect quickly, don\u2019t keep the sect master waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San understood that them bringing him via the iron chain without giving him that safety was perhaps in order to test his strength. He smiled wryly at the same time, \u2018Aunt, what did you tell people to cause such hostility?\u2019 But now it seemed that these blood related brothers were very straightforward.</p><br/><p>As the four set out once again, their relationship had clearly became a lot more harmonious, especially the leader Tang Long who clearly had a very direct character. His original assumed arrogance was now completely obliterated, and affectionately pulled Tang San towards the sect by the shoulder.</p><br/><p>The enormous stone building was just like a fort. The main gate was five meters tall, and even though it couldn\u2019t compare to Spirit City, this stony edifice was extremely stocky. Above the gate, three words were boldly carved into the rock, with a grandness that could oppose the surrounding mountains \u2014\u2014 Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>Before the gate, two equally grey clothed youths hastily bowed in salute as they saw the four approaching, but one of them still blocked Tang San\u2019s path,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease display your sect credentials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCredentials?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment. He of course didn\u2019t know what these so-called credentials were, and couldn\u2019t help somewhat puzzled looking to Tang long.</p><br/><p>Tang long smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Clear Sky Hammer! Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s anything that could better prove that we\u2019re directly related sect disciples than the Clear Sky Hammer? They\u2019re not familiar with you, so just show them. Those are the rules. Let them have a look. Only us directly related sect disciples can enter here. The sect\u2019s subordinates and outer sect disciples are all in that village outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, his mood fell somewhat, his gaze at Tang San also held something. Indeed, judging by the appearance of the village one could tell there were just a few hundred people. The subordinates of the Clear Sky School were already so few, it clearly showed how difficult the sect\u2019s situation was now.</p><br/><p>The expression in Tang San\u2019s eyes darkened somewhat. He of course understood the reason why these brothers\u2019 looks at him changed. Even though it couldn\u2019t be said that the Clear Sky School\u2019s present situation could be completely blamed on his father, it was still inextricably linked to him.</p><br/><p>Turning over his left hand, black light surging, the chi long Clear Sky Hammer appeared in his palm.</p><br/><p>Tang Long\u2019s trio had already heard from Tang Yue-Hua that Tang San had twin spirits, and his current main spirit really wasn\u2019t the Clear Sky Hammer, and so it was nothing to them. But those two gatekeeper disciples didn\u2019t see it that way. Since Tang San was together with Tang long\u2019s trio, they originally believed Tang San\u2019s strength should be fairly high.</p><br/><p>But he unexpectedly didn\u2019t even have one spirit ring on his Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Their originally respectful gazes immediately turned a bit indifferent.</p><br/><p>In the Spirit Master world, especially the Spirit Master sects, strength often represented a great many things. Despite not saying anything, their gazes had already become strange.</p><br/><p>Tang Long unhappily clapped one of them,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at, still not getting out of the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two disciples then stepped aside, but inwardly thought that it was no wonder they\u2019d never seen him before, he was a silver coated wax spear. His appearance was pretty good, but he didn\u2019t have any strength.</p><br/><p>Past the gate, the first thing inside was a spacious courtyard, followed by a tall stone building. Tang Long gave Tang San an introduction:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are about four generations of the directly related sect disciples, adding up to over two hundred people. We\u2019re considered the third generation. We also boast the largest number of people, not far short of a hundred. This is the front courtyard, used when the sect master gathers everyone. The rear courtyard is even bigger, that\u2019s our training area. The sect emphasizes actual combat, and each month the third and fourth generation children will conduct real combat drills under the elders\u2019 supervision. That sets the strength ranking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngest, Tang yu, smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss has already been the representative of our third generation several years in a row. He\u2019s afraid you\u2019ve come to fight over his position, that\u2019s why he had that face before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Long laughed out loud, forcefully clapping Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hide it from you, that\u2019s really what I thought. Brother, we\u2019ll exchange pointers later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I be big brother\u2019s match, there\u2019s no need to compete.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Tang San\u2019s intelligence, his mind was like a mirror. He knew that the position of third generation chief was definitely related to the sect master succession. He had never had any interest in the position of Clear Sky School sect master, and only hoped to be able to help the sect by relying on his own strength.</p><br/><p>Even more, he\u2019d come to know his ancestors and sect and even more importantly for his father\u2019s forgiveness, he couldn\u2019t be ambitious and competitive.</p><br/><p>Tang Long\u2019s expression changed, gravely saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, don\u2019t be so modest. You\u2019ll understand later. Come, we\u2019ll quickly go see the sect master. I reckon we\u2019ve kept him waiting. Tang Yu, you go speak to fourth uncle, the matter of the iron cable outside can\u2019t be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yu turned around and left, while Tang Long and Tang Tian brought Tang San into the Clear Sky School\u2019s main building.</p><br/><p>The Clear Sky School\u2019s buildings didn\u2019t give the slightest impression of lavishness, but neither were they plain. their overall greatest characteristic was the word massive.</p><br/><p>Entering the main building, also that castle-like place, passing through wide hallways, they ascended to the second floor via stairs inside.</p><br/><p>On the way they saw a lot of Clear Sky School disciples, all dressed in grey clothing. The Tang Long brothers brought Tang San to a halt before an arched door in the innermost part of the second floor.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Tang long raised his hand and knocked twice,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, we\u2019ve brought Tang San.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep rich voice echoed from within the room. To Tang San\u2019s ears, it was extraordinarily familiar, because this voice was eighty percent similar to his father Tang Hao\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Tang Long pushed open the door and signaled Tang San with his eyes, then took the lead to go inside. Tang Tian didn\u2019t follow, but rather stood by the door.</p><br/><p>This room was more than a hundred square meters, the interior decorated very simply, a wide table, bookcases covering both walls, as well as two long sofas.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua sat gracefully on a sofa. Seeing the white dressed Tang San follow Tang Long inside, the smile on her face instantly grew wider.</p><br/><p>Tang San naturally glanced at his aunt, but his attention was still drawn by the stalwart figure behind the table.</p><br/><p>More than two meters tall, the back of a tiger and waist of a bear, a chiseled face and short grizzled hair.</p><br/><p>He was equally dressed in grey, but sitting there, he was like the core of this castle.</p><br/><p>Two meters was perhaps not very tall, but if Tang San had to describe this person in words, perhaps he could only call him \u2018towering\u2019.</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s eyes were muddy, caused by those old injuries, and this man who was seventy or eighty percent similar to his father seemed even a bit younger. His bright and full of expression eyes were like torches. In a short while of staring at Tang San, a vast and wild aura covered the sky and hid the earth, without any attempt at restraint, the enormous pressure enveloped Tang San all at once.</p><br/><p>But ingeniously, this pressure completely bypassed Tang Long, without subjecting him to a bit of its effect.</p><br/><p>Tang Long wasn\u2019t weak, and his complexion swiftly changed. As he looked at Tang San again, his gaze couldn\u2019t help being somewhat anxious.</p><br/><p>But astonishing Tang Long was that Tang San stepped into the room, confronting that assault of pressure without his expression changing in the slightest. His feet standing in a faint T-shape, his waist and back perfectly straight. The graceful expression faded away, replaced by respect.</p><br/><p>Both knees bending, two vague layers of blue and white light could be faintly distinguished around Tang San. Kneeling on the ground with a putong sound, he saluted the man behind the table releasing the vast pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San pays his respects to sect master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a few words, but each syllable was pronounced extremely distinctly, and also exceptionally coherently.</p><br/><p>The pupils of Tang Long\u2019s eyes enlarged somewhat. Was this fellow really human? Confronting the sect master\u2019s powerful pressure, he could actually still move into a kneeling salute, and even speak.</p><br/><p>\u2018Could his strength really be greater than mine? But, second aunt said he was only twenty.\u2019</p><br/><p>In fact, he couldn\u2019t know how immense the pressure Tang San endured right now was.</p><br/><p>That immense pressure was like a cloud piercing mountain, pressuring him until he was unable to breathe. Tang San appeared very calm right now, but in fact he had already released both his great domains.</p><br/><p>The Deathgod Domain made up the inner layer, covered by the Blue Silver Domain outside, making the outside world unable to sense the aura he released.</p><br/><p>Moreover, his body was also already completely taut.</p><br/><p>That was after all a physique that had passed the forging of two great immortal herbs and countless experiences. The pressure Tang San endured right now was like when he trained his hammer under the waterfall.</p><br/><p>Each of his movements actually looked for the weakest area in the pressure that confronted him, and by these movements he could reduce the stress the pressure caused him.</p><br/><p>As for the words he spoke, they were spat out with inner strength.</p><br/><p>The man behind the table withdrew his gaze, and all the pressure instantly disappeared. Tang San only felt his surroundings empty, as if all his strength had been spent. If not for his steady balance practiced under the waterfall for a long time, perhaps he would\u2019ve made a fool of himself and toppled over. But he was in the end still able to stabilize himself, his upper body swayed once, but he still maintained the salute.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deep voice came from that man. That\u2019s right, this person was the Clear Sky School\u2019s current sect master, Tang Hao\u2019s elder brother, Tang Xiao[4]. One of Clear Sky School\u2019s twin Douluo. His title was Howling Sky.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t get up immediately, but rather kowtowed three times to Tang Xiao, three dong dong dong sounds echoing as his forehead impacted the floor.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua\u2019s brows wrinkled, hastily stepping forward to pull up Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Your father\u2019s matters from back then can\u2019t be left to you to undertake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether her or Tang Xiao, both naturally understood that Tang San made these three headbumps for Tang Hao to Tang Xiao.</p><br/><p>Tang San hung his head and got up,</p><br/><p>\u201cA father\u2019s debts pass to the son, this is Heaven\u2019s law and earth\u2019s principle. Sect master, I hope to assume responsibility for everything on behalf of my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Tang San stepped through the door, Tang Xiao\u2019s expression had been somewhat indeterminate. Hearing these words, Tang Xiao fiercely slapped the stone table in front of him with a palm, furiously shouting:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can you assume?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a soft chi sound, the table in front of Tang Xiao quietly collapsed, unexpectedly turning into fine powder just like that, against expectations without influencing anything in the surroundings. Imperceptibly, he had already revealed his profound and frightful cultivation.</p><br/><p>Tang Long standing to the side was inwardly speechless. That was a two ton table carved from the most solid granite. Breaking it wasn\u2019t difficult, but noiselessly turning it into dust was.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao shot Tang long a glare,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you sticking your tongue out at? Get out, go to the back mountain and make a table. No food until it\u2019s done properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Long\u2019s expression turned painful, looking at Tang Xiao without daring to retort.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao glared,</p><br/><p>\u201cWant me to repeat myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Long appeared very impressive in front of third generation disciples, but in front of Tang Xiao he was like a meek kitten, and hastily ran off.</p><br/><p>Tang San knelt once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I can assume it, but I hope to use this life for the sake of the sect, to exhaust all my abilities on the command of the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao turned around, pushing open the window behind him. With a pull of his right hand, the stone powder on the floor was unexpectedly drawn out just like that, quickly flying into the air outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually lets a child assume his own matters. Oh, Tang Hao, will you really always keep shirking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang Xiao\u2019s words, Tang San couldn\u2019t help having his father\u2019s one armed one legged melancholy appear before his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, father isn\u2019t shirking. He said, he was unable to face the sect. That he wasn\u2019t qualified to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao couldn\u2019t keep his voice from trembling,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently,</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2019s very well, he\u2019s keeping company at mother\u2019s side every day. He\u2019s prepared to pass his remaining days like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeeping company at your mother\u2019s side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao sharply turned his head, and Tang San clearly saw that the rims of his eyes were already somewhat red.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter mother passed away, she incarnated as blue silver grass. Father\u2019s always accompanied her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang XIao stared blankly a moment, then drew a deep breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, that\u2019s the best ending for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time he seemed a lot older, his gaze at Tang San also gradually softening.</p><br/><p>With a flash of light, Tang San held that long black box, supporting it in both hands,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, this is what father had me bring. He said that this was the only thing he could do for the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao waved an upraised hand, effortlessly making a pulling motion in empty air, and that heavy black box fell into his palm as if it was nothing.</p><br/><p>Lightly flicking a finger, the black box opened. As that tremendous energy filled the room, as the two spirit bones within appeared before Tang Xiao\u2019s eyes, he couldn\u2019t keep his expression from changing greatly, his hair and beard all trembling.</p><br/><p>Tang San only saw a blur before his eyes, before Tang Xiao already stood in front of him, one hand grasping the front of his jacket, pulling him close in front of him. Tang Xiao said in an almost trembling voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Hao, brother Hao, he\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua had by now also seen the two spirit bones in the long black box. Her mind went blank white, standing there stupidly, tears flowing uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather said that if he didn\u2019t do this, he would be unable to keep mother company at peace for the rest of his life. Father\u2019s old wounds were also settled by severing his limbs. Originally, he already did this after he left me at aunt\u2019s place. Sect master, you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me uncle[5].\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao shouted angrily, the shock numbing Tang San\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, as Tang San was in contact with Tang Xiao, he could clearly sense Tang Xiao\u2019s violently fluctuating mood. Even though they hadn\u2019t met for decades, his feelings for his little brother hadn\u2019t lessened a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, second brother, he\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua was now sobbing, unable to speak. Looking at those two spirit bones, her whole body trembled violently.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao closed the black box with a pa sound, simultaneously releasing his grip on Tang San\u2019s lapels,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, that\u2019s what your father calls you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded.</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao\u2019s gaze gradually calmed,</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know, in fact, I never thought your father did anything wrong. If Ah Yin had chosen me, perhaps I would have done the same as him, and even more violently than he did. Therefore, no matter what others say hereafter, I don\u2019t want Tang Hao\u2019s matters to become your burden. Working hard for the sect is something you must do, but not because of your father, but rather because you\u2019re a member of the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San felt as if something was choked in his stomach. Lowering his head, he said especially sincerely:</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao looked at Tang San, his gaze changing somewhat,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look a lot like your mom, but your character is like your dad\u2019s. Yue-Hua, don\u2019t cry, perhaps brother Hao\u2019s mind will be a bit more comfortable like this. Tomorrow will be little San\u2019s ceremony for recognizing his ancestors and clan. You arrange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua wiped her tears, her brows wrinkling slightly, she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, don\u2019t you need to inform the sect elders first? After all, they\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Xiao waved his hand to her,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go arrange it, I know what to do. Rather than notifying them in private it would be better to keep it above the table. You first bring little San to rest. Little San, in tomorrow\u2019s ceremony for recognizing your ancestors and clan tomorrow, remember that the Clear Sky School is different from the outside world. You can\u2019t use the etiquette you learnt at your aunt\u2019s school to find your place in the sect. I\u2019ll leave you with one word, unyielding. Here, strength is the authority to speak. If you want to replace your father in sect affairs, you must first use your strength to prove yourself to the sect. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she brought Tang San from the sect master\u2019s room, Tang Yue-Hua still hadn\u2019t recovered from her sadness. Just think, the second brother who was so brave and prosperous back then, the Douluo Continent\u2019s youngest Spirit Douluo, whose feat of striking down and killing the Supreme Pontiff while under siege brought unprecedented humiliation to Spirit Hall. But now he had ruined his body, no longer the hero of those days, only able to wait for the day his life would end between the mountains and fields. What kind of dismal ending was this?</p><br/><p>The ones living in the Clear Sky School castle were the sect\u2019s second generation as well as the first generation elders. The third and fourth generation all lived in stone houses behind the castle.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua arranged a residence for Tang san, then carefully asked Tang San about his trip back to see Tang Hao. While listening to Tang San finish his story and heard that there was hope for Tang San\u2019s mother\u2019s recovery, her mood calmed somewhat.</p><br/><p>The rooms arranged for Tang San were very simple. A very small room for receiving visitors, only around seven or eight square meters, a ten square meter bedroom, as well as a very small bathroom with all the amenities to live. This was the standard provided for the Clear Sky School\u2019s third generation children.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, I really want to go see your dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua sobbed.</p><br/><p>Tang San sighed lightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust when I saw dad had cut off his limbs, I was also very distraught. But I came around later. Perhaps now he will be able to be together with mom every day without worrying about future trouble, it\u2019s what\u2019s best for him. You can go when you have the time. It\u2019s after all quite far.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about your father\u2019s matters for now. Tell me, what\u2019s your plan, returning to the sect this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDad hoped I could pay my respects to grandfather, then help the sect as much as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation in the sect is very complicated right now. If we see it from your father\u2019s point of view, the sect is internally split into two camps. One faction led by your uncle believes the matters back then wasn\u2019t your father\u2019s fault, but rather a conflict caused by Spirit Hall being overbearing. Even if Spirit Hall\u2019s Supreme Pontiff died, your mother also passed away. Spirit Hall relying on its formidable influence to suppress the Clear Sky School was harmful to the sect, so we had no choice but to draw a clear line between us and your father. But in fact, your father didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The other faction is lead by a few still living first generation elders. The believe that your father\u2019s actions were ill conceived, that marrying a spirit beast caused the later conflict, and almost led to the sect colliding with Spirit Hall head on, producing irreparable consequences. Moreover, it still caused your grandfather to die from anger, an unpardonable sin. Tang Long and the others you met today are all on your uncle\u2019s side, your uncle adopted Tang Long as a son from a junior. He\u2019s the number one in the third generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes displayed a deeply pondering light,</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, you\u2019re telling me that my matter of recognizing my ancestors and clan will be obstructed by the sect elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust so. I fear tomorrow\u2019s business won\u2019t go over too smoothly. Even if your father has returned the two spirit bones, I\u2019m afraid it will still be very difficult for them to forgive him. Second brother also separated himself from the sect, drawing a clear line. I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t easily allow you to recognize your ancestors and sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s brows wrinkled,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the elders don\u2019t consent, what will the result be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua\u2019s face turned gloomy,</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the worst case, you\u2019ll be expelled from the sect, your spirit crippled. Even so much that they would use you as bait to find your father, investigating his guilt from back then. Of course, this is practically impossible, big brother is after all the sect master, and the elders will still give him some face. If I don\u2019t guess too much, the elders will compromise in the end, driving you away from the sect, not recognizing you as a child of the Clear Sky School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Tang Yue-Hua and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should I do? Since you agreed to let me return, you should already have thought of a countermeasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yye-Hua nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the elders are outdated, they always attach most importance to the sect. In order to gain their recognition, you must first do as your uncle said, prove your own strength in front of them. Use strength to conquer them. Afterwards make some contributions to the sect. Like that they\u2019ll be unable to oppose you recognizing your ancestors and clan. The reason your uncle\u2019s hint was \u2018unyielding\u2019 was in order to tell you that in our Clear Sky School, the strong eat the soft. Originally your uncle and your dad\u2019s position in the strength was completely gained by fighting. Whoever refused got a beating, that\u2019s how they established their authority. When your uncle returned to the sect to take over as sect master, the elders also called him into question, since he was always together with your father. Your uncle relied on his strength to defeat all the elders, thereby gaining their approval, becoming the new generation\u2019s Clear Sky School sect master. Therefore, the process of your recognizing your ancestors and sect tomorrow won\u2019t be effortless, there\u2019s no harm in being a bit unyielding, use strength to prove you have the capability to help return the sect to its glory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded slowly,</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua stood up, touching Tang San\u2019s head,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen rest well. Preserve and nurture your spirit. I still have some matters to prepare. The sect general assembly will begin tomorrow morning, aunt will watch your performance then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, Tang Yue-Hua told Tang San that someone would specially deliver his meal, letting him rest properly.</p><br/><p>With Tang Yue-Hua gone, Tang San sat crosslegged on his bed, recalling his return to the sect today. His uncle and aunt were clearly partial to his father\u2019s side. He had seen that when uncle mentioned his father he was always constraining his emotions, and as he said he looked like his mother, his eyes revealed a gentleness that couldn\u2019t be concealed. Apparently, even though his father suffered, he was at least together with his mother. Even though his uncle had become the sect master, the suffering he bore wasn\u2019t any less than his father\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Whether he could smoothly accomplish his father\u2019s wishes, would perhaps have to be seen tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Thinking thus, Tang San drew a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes, entering a cultivating state. Even though his improvement speed had slowed somewhat in his year at the Moon Pavilion, he had had instead mastered the subjects of his study. Especially after now having completely connected all eight extraordinary meridians, even though his overall strength hadn\u2019t improved much, his inner strength was like a great river, deep and unending, far from something opponents of the same level could compare to.</p><br/><p>In the evening.</p><br/><p>Soft knocks echoed from the door.</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly opened his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened, and first to stretch inside was a head. That was a young lady, her hair combed into two adorable little pigtails, appearing around thirteen or fourteen years old.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you uncle San?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp and clear voice was very pleasant, a pair of spirited big eyes looked curiously at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl pushed open the door, holding a box of food,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me if you\u2019re uncle San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re bringing food for Tang San, then that\u2019s right. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl giggled, big eyes curiously studying Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle San, you really look pretty. Much better looking than my dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl said:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s called Tang Hu[6], he\u2019s the third generation chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the third generation chief big brother Tang Long?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl shook her head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third generation chief is my dad, not uncle Tang Long. Dad always say that uncle Tang Long can\u2019t beat him. Losing to uncle Tang Long last time was just bad luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she placed the food on a table next to Tang San\u2019s bed, her big eyes looking somewhat resentfully at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wider, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cOver time, luck is also a part of strength. I still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Tang Tiantian[7]. Uncle San, you can call me Tiantian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thank you, Tiantian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this cleareyed pure little lady in front of him, Tang San couldn\u2019t help recalling when he was her age. At that time, he had already met Xiao Wu, met the other Shrek Seven Devils. Everyone were putting all their effort into cultivating together.</p><br/><p>Tiantian smiled at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle San, then I\u2019ll leave. Goodbye. Your smile is really pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, the young girl ran out, bouncing and vivacious.</p><br/><p>The meal was very simple, one dish of beef, four steamed rolls, one stir fried cabbage, as well as a big bowl of egg soup. Tang San ate with good appetite, this was his first meal back at the sect. No matter what was said, this place was also considered his home in this world.</p><br/><p>After an uneventful night, early the next morning, Tang San customarily got up at dawn and stepped outside.</p><br/><p>[1] Tang Long - () \u201cTang Dragon\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Tang Tian - () \u201cTang Heaven\u201d</p><br/><p>[3] Tang Yu - () \u201cTang Jade\u201d</p><br/><p>[4] Tang Xiao - () \u201cTang Howl\u201d, could also be hiss, whistle, or any number of similar sounds.</p><br/><p>[5] Uncle - He asks Tang San to use a rather informal way of addressing an uncle ()</p><br/><p>[6] Tang Hu - () \u201cTang Tiger\u201d</p><br/><p>[7] Tang Tiantian - () \u201cTang Sweetie\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

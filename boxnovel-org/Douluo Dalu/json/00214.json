He took the initiative to ask to help Tang San feed all the Shrek Seven Devils. Tang San held them up, he fed them, letting everyone eat a bowl of gruel. Just like when he brought back Tang San before, everyone still weren\u2019t suited to eating too much.</p><br/><p>After everyone finished eating, Tang San also ate a bit. Xiao Wu slept in the only bed in the room. Tang San walked over to Purple Pearl.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to eat something? I\u2019ll release you temporarily, but please keep your mouth in order. I\u2019m Tang San, you can call me by my name. If you agree, blink once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San\u2019s words, Purple Pearl blinked once as expected.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t touch Purple Pearl, she was after all a woman. Blue Silver Emperor stretched out, opening Purple Pearl\u2019s numbing and muting acupoints.</p><br/><p>Acupoints unblocked, Purple Pearl\u2019s body softened, almost falling to the ground. Pushing herself up, she glared hatefully at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know sorcery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled faintly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should understand that this is a kind of skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl snorted coldly, and didn\u2019t keep speaking, instead walking over to the remaining food with large steps. Heedless of the food already being cold, she ate with large gulps. Her table manners were unsightly, comparable to Ma Hongjun before. She didn\u2019t even seem like a woman. Tang San frowned as he watched.</p><br/><p>In just a short while, Purple Pearl finished the food like wind scattering clouds. Without even glancing at Tang San, she stalked back to sit in her corner, closing her eyes and falling asleep.</p><br/><p>The corners of Tang San\u2019s mouth revealed a trace of a smile. He could tell that this captain really was very depressed. He didn\u2019t say anything either, his gaze slightly sweeping outside, and a few pirates sticking their heads out quickly hid. He seemed like he didn\u2019t see anything, sitting cross legged in the center of the room with his eyes closed to cultivate.</p><br/><p>The seabreeze brushed the trees on the island, generating rustling sounds. Winter was already approaching, and there were few leaves in the forest. Only, the temperature at sea was a bit higher than inland, and the ocean climate meant it wasn\u2019t too cold here.</p><br/><p>The night gradually deepened. Tang San quietly cultivated, and the Shrek Six Devils were all deep asleep. This room lacking a wall on one side seemed very quiet.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, leaning in the corner, Purple Pearl quietly opened her eyes. Looking at Tang San, her eyes expressed ferocity, and she pulled a grimace in his direction. Looking all around, she quietly shifted her body. She didn\u2019t move far, only one meter or so, where there was a table. Purple Pearl directly crawled under the table, stretching her hand to softly push under the table. The floor beneath the table immediately flipped over, and she instantly disappeared. The whole process unexpectedly didn\u2019t cause any noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to watch. Keep cultivating.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few seconds after Purple Pearl disappeared, Tang San\u2019s faint voice echoed.</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang opened his eyes, looking puzzled at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you let her leave on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe she could leave otherwise? Very soon she will be able to feel her strength recover. In half an hour, she will definitely bring a large number of pirates to storm this place. Do you believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang looked at Tang San, his eyes filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cI only want to tell her that, no matter what she does, there\u2019s basically no way for her to constitute a threat to me. I let her go for this reason. It will take at least five days for my comrades to heal. I don\u2019t want to be on guard against these pirates all day long, so it would be better to convince them once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang seemed to understand somewhat, blinking, he asked Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, your sixth spirit ring really is of the hundred thousand year level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s brows wrinkled, but he still nodded softly,</p><br/><p>\u201cLater master will let you see another type of our sect\u2019s secret skills. Your spirit is a Needle, it\u2019s quite suited to this kind of skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Tang San said, in less than half an hour, the outside was already growing noisy. Purple Pearl\u2019s arrogant voice resounded,</p><br/><p>\u201cSurround it, don\u2019t let even a housefly get out. Fucker, that bastard, if I don\u2019t make him drink two basins of foot bath water, he won\u2019t know how fearsome Purple Pearl is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Purple Pearl\u2019s voice, Tang San couldn\u2019t help smiling, but he remained as motionless as a mountain. Ji Xiang always sat to the side watching Tang San. Tang San\u2019s calm gave people a sense of relief, as if he didn\u2019t need to have the slightest concern about whatever was happening outside. Tang San seemed like a solid rampart that could protect them all.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, you son of a bitch, get out her. Fuck, in all my years I\u2019ve never been so humiliated. I want to see how you alone will face thousands of us. I won\u2019t push you, just drink two basins of my foot washing water and I\u2019ll let you go. Of course, that little girl has to stay to be my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, Purple Pearl\u2019s house was already surrounded by densely packed pirates, torches held high for illumination, leaving the village brightly lit. Practically all the spirit masters were concentrated in the inner circle, each and every one cautiously watching the wooden house.</p><br/><p>That old pirate who talked to Tang San in daytime now stood next to Purple Pearl, talking to her in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, that person isn\u2019t easy to deal with. I think we should let it be. Anyway, they\u2019ll just rest here and then leave. Since you\u2019ve already escaped, as long as they don\u2019t do anything to jeopardize us Purple Pearl pirates, it\u2019s best not to antagonize them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d </p><br/><p>Because of Purple Pearl\u2019s anger, her extremely ample chest heaved forcefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen have I ever been this angry, I said I\u2019d have him drink two basins of foot washing water, so I\u2019ll definitely have him drink it. Tang San, you son of a bitch, get the fuck out here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a graceful voice disseminated from the house,</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Pearl, have you heard that expression? The sins of Heaven can be forgiven, the sins of oneself, cannot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl stared blankly a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cAt a fucking time like this, and you\u2019re still playing with words. Kid, you listen to me. I won\u2019t bother your companions, but I\u2019ll have you account for what you did today. There\u2019s thousands of us here, if each of us spits once, we could drown you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Distantly, she could see the circumstances in the room through the broken wall. Tang San all along sat in the same place, without a bit of alarm over her presence outside, to the extent that he even sat there with his eyes closed. Even though she wouldn\u2019t admit it herself, Tang San\u2019s manner secretly made even her enchanted.</p><br/><p>The pirates closed in step by step, pushing in towards the wooden house. But Tang San\u2019s display during the day still had a tremendous awing effect, and even though they constantly pushed forward, they didn\u2019t dare rush. The stronger the spirit master, the better they understood the strength Tang San displayed when he contained Purple Pearl. Especially that hundred thousand year spirit ring had an enormous force of impact to these pirate spirit masters. Who knew how frightful the abilities of that sixth spirit ability was?</p><br/><p>Slowly getting up, Tang San patted Ji Xiang\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best to experience my skills. No need to try to see it clearly, for this consummate skill you first of all need to view the general situation. As for everything else, it can all be cultivated after hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Faint light flickered, and Tang San\u2019s face displayed a faint smile. His comrades were all well, and moreover gathered together again, so by now his mood had already completely recovered to normal, he naturally didn\u2019t have any killing intent towards the pirates outside.</p><br/><p>The moment Tang San appeared in the doorway, all the pirates subconsciously halted, each and everyone nervously watching at Tang San. The spirit master pirates all released their spirits without a moment of hesitation, but they were still showing signs of trembling with fear.</p><br/><p>As captain, Purple Pearl immediately discovered the issue with her subordinates, and angrily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cowards, we have more than two hundred spirit masters, he\u2019s alone. If we each throw out one spirit ability, we can still dismember that kid\u2019s corpse in ten thousand pieces. What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled calmly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Purple Pearl. How about we make a bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl looked distracted a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cBet? Kid, you like betting too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this word, Purple Pearl\u2019s eyes were radiant. Ordinarily, gambling could be called the greatest pleasure of pirates. Even though both sides were currently hostile, Tang San\u2019s mention of betting was still attractive enough.</p><br/><p>Tang San hadn\u2019t thought Purple Pearl would react like this, but this was even better for his plans,</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumably you aren\u2019t quite convinced of my capturing you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl furiously said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat dogfart capturing? That was a sneak attack, if not for that, could you have caught me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t pay any attention to her fury,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, if we fight one on one, are you sure of beating me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl was immediately at a loss, but argued strenuously:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I fight you one on one? This is my domain. As long as I give the order, you will be torn to pieces alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll bet. For the time of one stick of incense, I won\u2019t use any spirit abilities, and you can have any comrades help you. In this time, I will capture you again, and moreover return to the house. If I succeed, it\u2019s my win. If I can\u2019t catch you, it\u2019s my loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl stared blankly a moment, then entered a state of anger close to berserk,</p><br/><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, are you dreaming? You want to catch me without using spirit abilities? Come on, I\u2019ll bet with you. What are we betting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I win, you will recognize me as your master, and listen to any of my orders. If I lose, you assign the punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl sized up Tang San a few times. Being capable of becoming the ruler of a gang, she absolutely wasn\u2019t an impulsive person. Even if her temper was a bit violent, at her core she was meticulous. But she wouldn\u2019t believe that Tang San could catch her among an army of ten thousand without really using spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll bet on it. If you lose, I won\u2019t bother you. Drink two basins of my foot washing water, and crawl under my legs. Then I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she gracelessly raised her left leg, pointing underneath.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change,</p><br/><p>\u201cWait until you defeat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang san flicked his wrist while speaking, already holding a stock of incense. Fingers twirling, the stick flew out, passing through a pirate\u2019s torch, then travelling in an arc and lightly pinning onto the wall of a wooden house.</p><br/><p>This trick immediately awed the heartily laughing pirates. Letting a stick of incense ignite by passing through a fire wasn\u2019t difficult, the difficult part lay in making it fly in an arc, and moreover making it stick on the wall with its weak body. What kind of clever soft force could achieve this?</p><br/><p>When Ji Xiang inside the house saw this move his eyes immediately brightened, vaguely already understanding what secret skill Tang San wanted to teach him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe incense is already burning. Purple Pearl, I will begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wasn\u2019t anxious to start, instead first warning Purple Pearl. This time he would convince her in heart and by word.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl saw that calm gaze in Tang San\u2019s eyes, without any emotion, and secretly shivered in her heart. At the same time as she released her spirit, she slid, slipping into the crowd. I can\u2019t defeat you, but don\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t hide? Besides, you\u2019re not using your spirit. If all I have to do is dodge and not get caught, then how will you make me recognize you as master? With such thoughts, the bet between Purple Pearl and Tang San officially began.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl\u2019s subordinates were all quite clever. Seeing the captain swiftly retreat, the pirates immediately formed a human wall. Tang San never said they couldn\u2019t attack, so these pirates naturally didn\u2019t hesitate to launch their own spirit abilities. Not looking for achievements, just avoiding mistakes. Each and every one naturally started their defensive abilities, hoping to block Tang San. Not attacking was the intelligent choice, because they didn\u2019t want to infuriate Tang San. Even the captain couldn\u2019t defeat this kid, let alone these universally twenty or thirty ranked spirit masters.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Tang San basically had no intention of relying on movement to catch Purple Pearl. Both his hands brushed the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges at his waist, a sparkling radiance already floating in the air. In the firelight, those crystalline lights immediately flew up, rushing into the pirate group with sharp whistling sounds.</p><br/><p>This was the Tang Sect hidden weapons technique Goddess Scattering Flowers.</p><br/><p>Goddess Scattering Flowers was in itself a fairly common technique among Tang Sect hidden weapons, but it was a foundation for a large number of hidden weapons techniques, like Tang Sect\u2019s fourth ranked Thousand And One Nights, which was based on Goddess Scattering Flowers. Having been immersed in hidden weapons for so many years, Tang San was naturally so familiar with this Goddess Scattering Flowers technique that he couldn\u2019t be more familiar. All the hidden weapons he threw were needle types, and each needle scattered as if it had grown eyes. In one move Tang San used no less than fifty silver needles.</p><br/><p>In practically the blink of an eye, the pirates in front of him collapsed like cut wheat. The collapsed pirates, without exception, were all Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Watching their comrades fall, the next line of pirates immediately looked distracted. They basically hadn\u2019t even seen how Tang San did it. Immediately afterward, Tang San\u2019s second wave of silver needles appeared.</p><br/><p>The forte of Tang Sect disciples was chaotic group fights, especially after reaching grandmaster level, as long as they had enough hidden weapons, they basically didn\u2019t fear enemy numbers.</p><br/><p>These pirates had no mortal enmity, and even more wouldn\u2019t go threaten everyone in the house, so Tang San would naturally hold back. At the same time as the second wave of silver needles shot out, he himself also floated forward, rushing among the pirates alone.</p><br/><p>Due to silver needles, large numbers of pirates fell to the ground. None of these collapsed Spirit Masters were above fortieth rank. For fortieth rank and below Spirit Masters, Tang San\u2019s silver needles were enough to break their defensive spirit abilities.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl had now already dodged into the pirate group, and still hadn\u2019t discovered what happened outside, but she still heard the cries of alarm. Just as she wondered what had happened, suddenly, a warm feeling rushed into her body. At the same time she vaguely saw a faint blue light from the ground.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl Island also possessed blue silver grass, just not all that much. Relying on the guidance of the Blue Silver Domain, let alone a few thousand, even among tens of thousands, Tang San would still easily be able to locate Purple Pearl.</p><br/><p>Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step launched. The pirates had already begun to attack Tang San, but he seemed to have grown a thousand arms, each time he raised his hands pirates would collapse. Those nearby with sealed acupoints, some more distant greeted by hidden weapons.</p><br/><p>Among these pirates, there were also dozens of fortieth rank or above Spirit Masters, who started encircling Tang San. Unfortunately, faced with the marvellous Ghost Shadow Perplexing Step, even the pure speed Bai Chenxiang had no way to deal with it, let alone these sea Spirit Masters who could only reveal their full strength in the ocean.</p><br/><p>With the strength of one person, moving unhindered among thousands of pirates, yet nobody could bar Tang San\u2019s path, his white shadow could be seen weaving unhindered back and forth through the pirates, large numbers of pirates constantly collapsing. The hidden weapons gradually did not only stick to silver needles, Tang San after all had a limited amount. Various kinds of hidden weapons started to appear, but these hidden weapons didn\u2019t reveal any killing power, guided by Tang San\u2019s ten dextrous fingers, they found the pirates\u2019 acupoints.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl finally discovered what was going on, and she also saw Tang San only a few dozen meters away. Seeing numerous group members collapsing, her mind had already turned blank.</p><br/><p>Was, was he still human? She clearly saw that Tang San complied with his promise, and didn\u2019t use any spirit abilities, so much that he hadn\u2019t even released that blue golden spirit. But even like this, nobody could block his path forward.</p><br/><p>The incense had already burned by half. But there were already several hundred pirates on the ground. In the eyes of the pirates, Tang San\u2019s completely emotionless gaze was half like the descent of a death god.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Tang San\u2019s gaze met Purple Pearl\u2019s. Purple Pearl saw the faint smile on his face, it didn\u2019t hold any contempt, but was full of confidence, absolute confidence.</p><br/><p>Completely suppressed by such imposing manner, Purple Pearl couldn\u2019t even display seventy percent of her strength. All she wanted to do now was run, run to the ocean as fast as possible. She believed that, as a landlubber Spirit Master, Tang San wouldn\u2019t have any way of catching her in the sea.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Purple Pearl couldn\u2019t help somewhat hate that she had placed this village at the center of the island. If it was at the seaside, maybe she could already have rushed into the sea.</p><br/><p>The only thing she was still grateful for, was that she could see that Tang San\u2019 hadn\u2019t killed anyone, those collapsed pirates had just temporarily lost the ability to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock him, block him for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl shouted loudly, her fourth spirit ring abruptly brightening, suddenly crawling on the ground, the dark grey scales all over her body became even darker, she swiftly moved in the direction of the sea, leaving behind a faint afterimage.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart shivered. Through the Blue Silver Domain, he clearly felt Purple Pearl now moving forward with extreme speed. When passing through her subordinates, her speed wasn\u2019t influenced at all. This spirit ability should be mainly for dodging attacks. According to her present speed, even though the pirates blocking him were insignificant, they were still numerous, and by the time he caught up to Purple Pearl, time would have run out, or she would have escaped into the ocean.</p><br/><p>Just as Purple Pearl surmised, if she really entered the ocean, Tang San would have no way of dealing with her.</p><br/><p>A loud resonant cry issued from Tang San\u2019s mouth. No longer hiding his strength, an instant movement, and Tang San appeared fifty meters away. He started using teleportation. Each time Tang San flashed through the pirate crowd, there would inevitably be a batch of pirates collapsing to the ground. The distance to Purple Pearl grew closer and closer.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl did her utmost to escape, and soon, the shore was already in sight. However, at the same time she also felt an aura quickly approaching behind her.</p><br/><p>A flash of light, and Tang San appeared in front of Purple Pearl out of nowhere, watching her with a smile.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl suddenly stopped,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all, I only said I wouldn\u2019t use spirit abilities, I never said anything about spirit bone abilities. You should have seen very clearly that I didn\u2019t even release my spirit. No need to stall for time, it\u2019s useless. Concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrop dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl\u2019s dark gray scales brightened, an immense coiling image appearing behind her back. That illusion gradually took shape, and moreover quickly split, unexpectedly separating into nine more than ten meter long giant serpents, pouncing at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Sixth spirit ability? Tang San\u2019s gaze still didn\u2019t change, he could sense that Purple Pearl was now just making a show of strength. She basically didn\u2019t have the determination to bet her life. At the same time as she released the spirit ability, this lord captain used the cover of the illusion to quietly crawl sideways, heading directly for the sea. Her sixth spirit ability was more to confuse Tang San, to block him.</p><br/><p>Of course, the might of this sixth spirit ability was still quite fearsome. Tang San believed that if this spirit ability was used at sea, its strength would definitely be even greater.</p><br/><p>The nine giant serpents simultaneously rammed Tang San. Tang San opened his arms, his eyes closed, receiving the attack of the nine giant serpents as if enjoying it.</p><br/><p>All the pirates that could still move saw this scene clearly, Tang San\u2019s body brightened with a golden light, and the nine giant serpents that abruptly struck his body were smashed to fragments, basically not causing Tang San any harm. And at this moment, a blue light shot out from between Tang San\u2019s eyebrows, catching up to Purple Pearl in the blink of an eye. The blue light flashed and stilled, and Purple Pearl was no longer able to move a single step. It was the Vast Sea Cosmic Shroud\u2019s additional ability, Cosmic Stasis Barrier. Tang San firmly believed that Purple Pearl, with spirit power level roughly equal to his own, absolutely wouldn\u2019t be able to break through the Cosmic Stasis Barrier. And at this moment, Purple Pearl was only one step away from the sea.</p><br/><p>Quiet, several thousand assembled pirates were quiet. Tang San waved his left hand, and that Cosmic Stasis Barrier enveloping Purple Pearl flew back. A bizarre scene played out. That pyramidal light barrier shrunk in midair, and by the time it reached Tang San\u2019s left hand, it was only thirty centimeters high, resting in Tang San\u2019s palm. And inside, Purple Pearl had also shrunken, sitting there with a disappointed expression.</p><br/><p>Turning around, Tang San walked step by step in the direction of the pirate village, and the at least two thousand pirates still able to move quietly opened up a passage. Blankly staring at Tang San walking past in front of them, not one dared to block him. Each time Tang San\u2019s toes touched the ground, he would slide forward several dozen meters, floating in the air like an immortal.</p><br/><p>In front of absolute strength, they could only keep quiet. Resolute people nodded slightly, shocked to discover that in less time than it took a stick of incense to burn, there were actually more than five hundred pirates on the ground unable to move, and they included a hundred relatively weaker Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>What kind of strength was this!</p><br/><p>In the daytime, Tang San had once threateningly told Purple Pearl with killing everything down to the chickens and dogs here. At that time the pirates had only treated it as bluster, but at this moment, the strength Tang San had displayed made them tremble from their souls. If this man wanted to kill people, who could stop him? Maybe he couldn\u2019t kill everyone in an instant, but if given enough time, this could absolutely be accomplished.</p><br/><p>As Tang San returned to the wooden house, that stick of incense was just burning to an end, still not extinguished.</p><br/><p>When Ji Xiang saw Purple Pearl inside that blue pyramid in Tang San\u2019s hand, his pupils contracted. Even though he hadn\u2019t seen how Tang San accomplished it in the end, he was already completely convinced by Tang San\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>At the same level, without using his spirit, catching someone and coming back from among thousands of pirates as easy as reaching into his pocket, and still leaving hundreds of pirates without the strength to move. What kind of strength was this? If this teacher of his truly began a slaughter, then how many people here could survive?</p><br/><p>With a flick of his wrist, Tang San withdrew his Vast Sea Cosmic Shroud. Purple Pearl\u2019s body spun once in midair, growing larger, and by the time she hit the ground she was already restored to her original size.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s voice was still calm, as if this victory was inevitable.</p><br/><p>Slowly standing up, Purple Pearl\u2019s eyes revealed a difficult to express mood. This time, she no longer cursed, only looking at Tang San, her expression somewhat strange. After a long time she still didn\u2019t speak a word. And behind her, all the pirates watching Tang San had nothing but fear in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Tang San called over Ji Xiang, telling him:</p><br/><p>\u201cI sealed the acupoints of the people on the ground, you go remove it for each of them, use the Mysterious Heaven Skill you just learned, concentrating it in your palm, then smack this place on their chest. Control your strength properly, use about a tenth of your current spirit power. Take back the silver needles or other hidden weapons piercing them, they will all be at their shoulders. Go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San softly poked a position on Ji Xiang\u2019s chest, telling him the location of the acupoint.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang knew that this was a training his master had for him, and quickly left.</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang hurriedly walked away, and Tang San\u2019s gaze turned back to Purple Pearl. He didn\u2019t rush her, only looked at her calmly.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl fiercely clenched her teeth,</p><br/><p>\u201cA loss is a loss, I admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, she kneeled in front of Tang San with a thump, loudly calling out:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, hereafter I am yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s originally calm expression showed a fraction of shock, helplessly shaking his head.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl then turned around,</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, what are you still standing around for, I\u2019m kneeling, and you\u2019re still standing? He\u2019s my master, hereafter he\u2019s also the master of our Purple Pearl pirates.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pirates now returned to themselves. Immediately, the crowd grew shorter,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Their shouting wasn\u2019t force, on the contrary it had a feeling of cheerfully submitting. Tang San had relied on his own strength to convince these pirates. Even though they might not be loyal to him, they absolutely admired Tang San\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll rise. It\u2019s late, go home and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San waved his hand, turning and walking into the wooden house.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl looked distracted a moment. First to stand, she called out:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, is this it? You\u2019re not planning on having me do something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San halted, turning his head to her,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do? We have no past hatred. Go rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinished speaking, he walked into the house once again.</p><br/><p>Purple Pearl unexpectedly revealed a shy expression;</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I suddenly find myself starting to like men. You don\u2019t want sexual services?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just stepping into the room, Tang San staggered, his rear view also seeming a bit rigid at this words. Seeing this appearance, Purple Pearl couldn\u2019t help laughing heartily without any misgivings. Being suppressed by Tang San for a day and a night, she finally had her revenge. At least in her opinion.</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang was busy opening pirate acupoints for a whole night. Due to having to operate his Mysterious Heaven Skill each time he did, even though he ran out of spirit power several times and had to rest and recover, his control of the Mysterious Heaven Skill also increased a lot.</p><br/><p>The more pirate acupoints he unsealed, the deeper Ji Xiang\u2019s veneration of Tang San became. So many pirates collapsed in just the time of one stick of incense, and every single pirate had been attacked in the same place. Even though Ji Xiang didn\u2019t look at those who had their acupoints pressed, he believed that those pirates had definitely been struck in the shoulder.</p><br/><p>As Ji Xiang dragged his weary body back to the wooden house with an excited mind, the Shrek Six Devils and Bai Chenxiang were already awake.</p><br/><p>With a new lease of life after calamity, everyone couldn\u2019t help sighing as they saw Tang San once again, recounting what had happened once again.</p><br/><p>After Ji Xiang entered, he sat honestly to the side. Tang San glanced at him saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sleep, cultivate according to the method I taught you. It will be beneficial to use this method in place of sleep in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang took everything Tang San said at his word. Hastily sitting cross legged, he began to cultivate according to the Mysterious Heaven Skill circulation route he remembered. According to Grandmaster\u2019s Ten Great Core Competences, even without obtaining a spirit ring, spirit power would still constantly grow through cultivation. He just had to wait until after getting a spirit ring before it showed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you took a disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was just sitting, somewhat astonished looking at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Everyone of the Shrek Seven Devils had quite resilient bodies, having eaten the immortal grade herbs Tang San gave them back then. After a night of rest, even though they still hadn\u2019t recovered, they still wouldn\u2019t be that weak. Only Bai Chenxiang\u2019s circumstances were a bit worse, her body wasn\u2019t at the level of the Shrek Seven Devils, and still needed some time to recover.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately Ji Xiang saved me. Otherwise, you might not have seen me again. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t know how I escaped the Deep Sea Demon Whale. When I fell unconscious, I already felt my body being crushed by the falling seawater. That I could survive this time can only be described as luck. At least on the surface I\u2019ve captured the Purple Pearl pirates here. Once you\u2019re well, we\u2019ll leave for Seagod island. I trust Purple Pearl should know the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re going to Seagod Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang, just entering cultivation state, suddenly opened his eyes, looking at Tang San with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the circumstances of Seagod Island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Xiang\u2019s expression revealed a trace of sadness, softly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I come from there.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If it hadn\u2019t been for the pressure he released making the air distort, causing a certain degree of refraction in Tang San\u2019s gaze, his circumstances would be even worse.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan gave Tang San strength energy pressure, but what Tang San now gave him was a mental attack. At this moment Tang San finally knew what had changed in his Purple Demon Eye after taking the Full Moon Wearing Autumn Dew. The true form of that gaze had become an attack. The condensed Purple Demon Eye had become a kind of unconventional mental attack, and at this crucial moment when he was about to collapse, it displayed to immense effect.</p><br/><p>His mind suffering an attack, Tai Tan was naturally unable to further control the pressure he released, and with a muffled groan he actually retreated a step.</p><br/><p>The pressure in the air suddenly gone, Tang San only felt an emptiness around him. As the tremendous pressure vanished, he couldn\u2019t keep from swaying, and if it hadn\u2019t been for four of the Eight Spider Lances on his back being thrust into the ground, perhaps he would have fallen the instant the weight was gone.</p><br/><p>Once again belching up a mouthful of blood, Tang San\u2019s complexion was deathly pale. Completely tottering on the verge of collapse, he might fall to the ground at any moment. But it was also at this moment that he felt the rupturing sound of the Yang Linking Meridian among the Eight Extraordinary Meridians breaking through, the shock of the quickly circulating Mysterious Heaven Skill breaking open this meridian a crack. Even though it hadn\u2019t been completely connected, just like a thousand li dike being destroyed by an ant tunnel, with this crack he wasn\u2019t far from breaking through.</p><br/><p>However, right now Tang San couldn\u2019t be excited, that stick of incense still had a fifth left, and now he completely lacked the strength to reissue the Purple Demon Eye\u2019s mental attack, and even less able to rely on inner strength to support his body. Even if Tai Tan launched another attack with a third of the pressure, his only fate was to fall.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he would truly become another\u2019s slave, joining his clan? Tang San understood that this wasn\u2019t because of his carelessness, but because of the absolute gap in strength. A humiliated feeling struck his mind hard, and he stuck out his chest. No matter how, he had to persevere to the last moment, as long as he still hadn\u2019t fallen, this fight still wasn\u2019t over.</p><br/><p>Making an effort to shake his head, Vigorous God Tai Tan could once again see everything clearly after the dizziness. That youngster still stood there unyielding, and even though he cut a sorry figure, his eyes were still resolute. What was that just now? His spirit ability?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still want to continue? You should know that if you do, it might cause you permanent harm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan spoke in a low voice. He didn\u2019t want to destroy a genius, he had to recruit talent. How would he fail to see the the state Tang San was in?</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji\u2019s voice also impatiently cut in at this moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, concede. You mustn\u2019t destroy your future. Others can sort this out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San only spoke this one word, but blood again ran from the corner of his mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say much, but at this moment all the teachers and students from the Academy watching the battle were moved. How persistent and unyielding to be able to support his words like this.</p><br/><p>Even Tai Tan showed an alarmed expression. This youngster was really too outstanding. Precisely because of this, he absolutely couldn\u2019t let him off. If he couldn\u2019t recruit him, then, he could only destroy him.</p><br/><p>With this in mind, Tai Tan\u2019s gaze gradually focused, the atmosphere around him once again fluctuating.</p><br/><p>The Blue Silver Grass withdrew completely. Slowly and resolutely, Tang San gently raised his left hand. Five fingers spreading, he didn\u2019t look at Tai Tan, his gaze was completely focused on his own left hand. \u2018Whether or not I can withstand this final moment, you watch and see.\u2019</p><br/><p>Intense black rays of light bubbled out of his hand, gradually condensing into a shape.</p><br/><p>A small black hammer quietly appeared in Tang San\u2019s palm. The hammer wasn\u2019t large, and covered by faint decorative patterns.</p><br/><p>But the moment it appeared, Tang San seemed to recover a bit of his strength. A grave atmosphere appeared around him.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s body suddenly trembled violently once. The pressure already charging at Tang San instantly weakened, Tang San\u2019s body rocking once. Holding the hammer at his chest, rigidly warding off this weakened pressure, an unyielding radiance glittering in his determined expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Tai Tan who turned pale with fright, Tai Nuo at his side also stared wide eyed and exclaimed in alarm.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, seven rays of dazzlingly beautiful light shone down from the sky, enveloping Tang San\u2019s body within just like a seven colored rainbow.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Tang San\u2019s body shuddered fiercely, his skin recovering its lost gloss, and with a low moan he slowly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>At the same time a profoundly bold voice echoed from all directions at once,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld orangutan, what skill is bullying children. Long time no see, let us take a turn next.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the flickering light and shadow, including Zhao Wuji, no one saw clearly until three people stood in the middle of the fight.</p><br/><p>Standing in the middle was an old man, his right and left hand separately supporting the arms of the two people at his side. To his left was an extremely beautiful young lady, apparently fourteen or fifteen years old. When her feet touched ground she immediately turned and ran over to Tang San.</p><br/><p>To his right was a scholarly middle aged man. Right now in that middle aged man\u2019s palm was a seven colored dizzyingly glittering dazzlingly beautiful pagoda.</p><br/><p>The seven colored light that appeared over Tang San was connected to the pagoda in his palm.</p><br/><p>Seeing these three appear, the pupils of Vigorous God Tai Tan\u2019s eyes immediately contracted. Even though his nature was always to never fear anything in heaven or earth, confronting these three he still had no choice but to restrain his character.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wondered who it was, so it\u2019s Bone Douluo and school master Ning. Let this old man pay his respects.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three arrivals were precisely Ning Fengzhi, Ning Rongrong and Bone Douluo Gu Rong.</p><br/><p>When the school master left, of the two resident Douluo at Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, one would go along and the other would stay at the school to keep watch. Last time it was Sword Douluo Chen Xin who followed Ning Fengzhi, so this time it was the Bone Douluo\u2019s turn.</p><br/><p>For this reason the Sword Douluo and Bone Douluo had argued for ages. Both of them wanted to see what kind of person the genius youngster Ning Rongrong had talked about was.</p><br/><p>Actually, Ning Fengzhi\u2019s trio had already arrived as early as when Tang San and Tai Tan made their bet. Ning Rongrong had strongly asked her father to intervene, but had been refused by Ning Fengzhi. Concealed in a secret place, Ning Fengzhi\u2019s goal was to have a look at just how outstanding this youngster actually was. With him there, naturally there was no fear that the bet would conclude. Now that Tang San seemed unable to endure, Ning Fenzhi acted immediately, blocking the fight.</p><br/><p>The Bone Douluo appeared in front of Tai Tan with a whoosh,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld orangutan, give a brother some face, let this fight pass. Our school also have our eyes on this kid. Don\u2019t go fighting over him with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the backing of formidable strength, Gu Rong basically didn\u2019t need to talk in circles, and directly stated the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s intentions to Tai Tan. Even though Tai Tan\u2019s Strength Clan wasn\u2019t small, compared to the seven great schools it was still far too lacking.</p><br/><p>Bone Douluo Gu Rong had complete confidence in being able to suppress him in strength.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Master world always spoke with strength. Wrecking an agreed upon bet was admittedly violating the rules of the game, but if the wrecker himself was a person who made the rules, who would say anything?</p><br/><p>According to Gu Rong\u2019s understanding of Tai Tan, this fearless old fogey wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. Even if confronted by the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, with his fiery temper he would still be spoiling for a battle. Not fighting was impossible.</p><br/><p>But Gu Rong hadn\u2019t expected that when he heard his words, Tai Tan actually smiled. Even though a smiling expression clearly looked somewhat strange on his stiff face, Gu Rong was certain that Tai Tan was smiling, and moreover that the smiling expression held a sarcastic overtone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld orangutan, what are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan snorted, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to give you face? Fine, I\u2019ll give it. We\u2019ll drop this bet, I don\u2019t lose, and he doesn\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong stared blankly,</p><br/><p>\u201cGiving face like this? Old orangutan, this isn\u2019t your style!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Tai Tan\u2019s mouth twitched, and he raised his hand to point to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Bone, take a good look at what\u2019s in his hand. Luckily you\u2019re still a Title Douluo, could it be you don\u2019t have even this much eyesight?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this Gu Rong\u2019s gaze fell on Tang San, following Tai Tan\u2019s finger, he could just see the black little hammer in Tang San\u2019s left hand. In that instant his expression also changed immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually Clear Sky\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan smiled without smiling:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know it. For me this is flooding the dragon king temple[1], for you it might be only be inviting a rejection. Haha, hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>While laughing, he walked over towards Tang San with big steps like a shooting star.</p><br/><p>Gu Rong had seen the little black hammer in Tang San\u2019s hand, and Ning Fengzhi had naturally also seen it. His expression was slightly artificial, but very quickly recovered to normal. A school master\u2019s bearing wasn\u2019t something Gu Rong could compare to.</p><br/><p>Gu Rong moved over to Ning Fengzhi\u2019s side, somewhat impatiently saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSchool master, in his hand\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi interrupted him, saying with a nod:</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s no wonder that he\u2019s so outstanding, I didn\u2019t expect him to come from Clear Sky. His family name is Tang, I should have realized it long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>The brilliance of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda in his hand was unceasing, still covering Tang San\u2019s body, rippling into him from the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San already felt as if he had gone from hell to heaven. A comfortably warm air, extremely mild humidity rapidly recovering his energy, agility, strength, mind, and even something Tang San couldn\u2019t define.</p><br/><p>The previous feeling of absolute emptiness within him as well as the injuries caused by the tremendous pressure all gradually faded in this gentle energy. The Mysterious Heaven Skill within him also seemed to strengthen under this humidity, circulating all over, the crack in the Yang Linking Meridian constantly widening under the unceasing attack of the Mysterious Heaven Skill.</p><br/><p>Tang San hadn\u2019t seen who helped him, but soaked in that seven colored radiance, what he had lost gradually returned, and even became stronger. The Blue Silver Grass recovered its lost luster, the red and white light from the Eight Spider Lances glinting with an even more threatening gem like light, and even the black little hammer flickered with a crow black light.</p><br/><p>How could the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s name as the first auxiliary system spirit be a false reputation? As school master, Ning Fengzhi had even more brilliant skill with this emblematic auxiliary system spirit.</p><br/><p>In a few short minutes when Tang San once again opened his eyes, his expression was already energetic, as if he had been reborn. If it wasn\u2019t for the torn clothes and not yet dried sweat, right now it would seem as if he had never experienced that dangerous bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong asked with deep concern.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu and Ning Rongrong as well as Oscar had all already run over to Tang San.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing and Ma Hongjun had also separated from the crowd, encircling Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San\u2019s gazed in the direction that seven colored radiance drifted from, just in time to meet Ning Fengzhi\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled, and the radiance of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda in his hand faded. As he lowered his hand, that miraculous spirit also vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come it\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help say in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s really you. It seems we really are brought together by fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s big eyes blinked:</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, you know each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even without Ning Rongrong\u2019s words, Tang San already vaguely guessed Ning Fengzhi\u2019s identity. The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s seven treasures appearing simultaneously, how many people could manage that? Quickly taking a few steps forward, he bowed to ning Fengzhi in salute,</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, school master Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly, raising his hand to pull Tang San up,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re Rongrong\u2019s friend, and she calls you third brother, its suitable if you call me uncle Ning. I would hope to hear you call me this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi saying this could be considered a public expression of goodwill. In fact, with his position, on the entire Douluo Continent he only had to stomp his feet to make the four seas tremble, even an imperial prince like Xue Xing wouldn\u2019t dare offend him.</p><br/><p>The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School didn\u2019t just have robust strength as a sect with two Douluo. At the same time, their financial resources had always been number one among the seven great schools.</p><br/><p>Obtaining the recognition of school master Ning Fengzhi would be a gargantuan occasion to the vast majority of Spirit masters.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s attitude didn\u2019t change because of learning Ning Fengzhi\u2019s identity, only bowing once again and saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, uncle Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi laughed out loud, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Good. we\u2019ll talk again later. First settle the present business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression became serious, From the terms of the bet, even though he hadn\u2019t fallen, he knew it would have been very difficult for him to resist Tai Tan\u2019s next attack until the stick of incense burned out.</p><br/><p>Even though the incense on the gate had burned out, his heart was still heavy.</p><br/><p>Tang San was a person who would absolutely abide by promises, but he also understood that with his current strength it would be far, far too difficult to resist the pressure Tai Tan could release. He didn\u2019t know how much of his pressure Tai Tan had released before, but judging by that last steep pressure increase, the opponent hadn\u2019t gone all out from the start.</p><br/><p>His gaze slowly turning, Tang San looked towards that not distant Tai Tan. Vigorous God Tai Tan was also looking at him, meeting his gaze expectantly, and with a slight wave of his hand brought his son and grandson towards Tang San in big strides. His expression was filled with emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, senior, our bet was interrupted, but we can do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Breaking open the Yang Linking Meridian increased Tang San\u2019s ability to resist pressure somewhat, and as long as he didn\u2019t truly fall before the opponent, he also wouldn\u2019t easily concede.</p><br/><p>But Tang San hadn\u2019t expected Tai Tan to only solemnly gaze at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour name is Tang San, what is your father\u2019s name? Is it Tang Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at the pure strength type formidable Spirit Master in front of him with astonishment,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were without doubt an acknowledgement of what Tai Tan had said.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s aged face flushed red with agitation, and under Tang San\u2019s inconceivable gaze, that majestic like a mountain frame abruptly knelt with one knee on the ground with a putong sound, completely moved speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San jumped with fright at Tai Tan\u2019s movement and hastily got out of the way, not daring to receive Tai Tan\u2019s courtesy.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tai Tan kneel, both Tai Nuo and Tai Long hastily followed his example. Tai Long was even more astonished than Tang San, he couldn\u2019t understand why his grandfather\u2019s attitude would suddenly make an enormous one hundred eighty degree turn.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan suppressed his strongly surging heart,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old slave Tai Tan, pays his respects to young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master?\u201d</p><br/><p>As these two words came out, apart from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi and the Bone Douluo who had unvarying expression, made practically everyone around turn pale with fright. Especially those teachers and students who had vaguely guessed Tai Tan\u2019s strength were even more unable to hide their shock.</p><br/><p>Tang San was stupefied, a person who had previously been oppressing him until he was unable to breathe was actually kneeling in front of him, for a while he couldn\u2019t adapt to the enormous contrast.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, won\u2019t you explain it clearly first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stepped forward to lend an arm to Tai Tan, but this old fellow was determined to kneel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, this old slave has finally met you. Do you know master\u2019s current whereabouts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the meaning behind Tai Tan\u2019s words, Tang San could naturally hear that what he indicated with \u2018master\u2019 should be his father.</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s mien flashed through his mind. Tang San was unable to believe that his father, every day soaked in shoddy alcohol, would actually be called \u2018master\u2019 by a Spirit Douluo level power.</p><br/><p>The intense shock and sudden news momentarily put Tang San\u2019s heart in disorder. Supporting himself on Tai Tan\u2019s imposing body, for a moment he just stood there rigidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai hai. I think it would be better if you first found somewhere quiet, and then continued chatting about your master and servant situation, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just what is called \u2018the participant is baffled, but the onlooker sees clearly\u2019, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi standing to the side broke the awkwardness.</p><br/><p>Tang San came to himself at this, and hastily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust so, senior you get up first, if there are any matters we\u2019ll first find a place quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan somewhat vigilantly looked at Ning Fengzhi to the side, then stood up,</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, please follow to this old slave\u2019s home to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San glanced at the Shrek Seven Devils next to him as well as Ning Fengzhi, and immediately felt embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Even though he was anxious to know just why Tai Tan had addressed him like that, Ning Fengzhi saved him just now and was moreover Ning Rongrong\u2019s father, his coming here seemed to be in order to find him, if he left it would clearly be grounds for discord.</p><br/><p>What kind of person was Ning Fengzhi, how wouldn\u2019t he see Tang San\u2019s current awkwardness, with a slight smile he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it would be better like this, since we\u2019ve already come to the Shrek Academy we should tour the place. Vigorous God should also be the guardian of a student here, so why don\u2019t we all enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Tai Tan was inwardly unwilling, as he also saw Tang San\u2019s current awkwardness he forced himself to nod, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Who is in charge of this Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>His last words were immensely loud, shocking the ears of the watching students so they rang.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Wuji wasn\u2019t too willing to confront Tai Tan, right now he also didn\u2019t have a choice. Quickly stepping forward, with a forced smile saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld brother Tai Tan, long time no see, have you been well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhao Wuji, Tai Tan looked distracted a moment, a cold light flickering in his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s you kid. I couldn\u2019t find you for all these years, but you\u2019ve actually been hiding here. We\u2019ll think about it under cover, find us a quiet place, I want to have a careful talk with the young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was Tai Tan or Ning Fengzhi, neither was someone Zhao Wuji could afford to offend. Right now Flender, Grandmaster, and Liu Erlong\u2019s trio, as well as Dugu Bo, who might suppress an incident were all gone. He couldn\u2019t wish to be ripped apart by this Vigorous God here. Hastily he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone have come from afar, please come inside. All students return to class, who allowed you to gather here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were quickly but gently returned to school by the teachers, while Zhao Wuji personally brought Tai Tan\u2019s family, the people from Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, as well as Tang San into the Academy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji gave Tang San a meaningful look, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you go clean up first and change your clothes, afterwards come to the fourth floor meeting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San currently wore little more than sweat and bloodstains, and even though his body had recovered under the assistance of Ning Fengzhi\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, his appearance was clearly too unsuitable. Together with the Shrek Seven Devils he headed for the dorms.</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu pulled at Tang San\u2019s arm, gripping his right hand, slowly infusing her own spirit power into Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San hurriedly declined her good intentions,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Xiao Wu, I\u2019m already fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong to the side hit her chest, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, don\u2019t worry. My daddy\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda has already reached the ideal seven treasure realm, not only can it assist, it also has powerful treatment capabilities. Before when the seven treasures came out simultaneously, even if third brother had stopped breathing he could still recover. There wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong. But what was all that about just now? How does third brother and that old fogey fit together? That old fogey isn\u2019t weak, my grandpa Bone said his strength was on the Spirit Douluo level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Xiao Wu could speak up, Oscar already swiftly recounted the events. Seeing Ning Rongrong return, originally he was very happy, but as he saw Ning Rongrong\u2019s father and that tyrannical grandpa Bone, he couldn\u2019t help feel a bit apprehensive. It goes without saying that he had to restrain his original intentions of speaking his mind to Ning Rongrong as soon as she returned.</p><br/><p>Listening to Oscar\u2019s explanation, Ning Rongrong couldn\u2019t help laughing:</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat the son and the father comes, beat the father and the grandfather comes. Does it keep going? Nevermind, third brother, next time they come looking for trouble, we\u2019ll go together. Even though boss Dai isn\u2019t here, with our combined battle strength we can hold them off for a while. If my daddy lends a hand, with his assistance we can hold them down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s current mood was very complicated. Tai Tan\u2019s display just now had shocked him, and he vaguely felt that what he had said was related to his father\u2019s disappearance. Could it be his father wasn\u2019t just a drunkard? Was he a person that could make a Spirit Douluo address himself as a slave? Another step up, was perhaps only Title Douluo.</p><br/><p>Returning to the dorm, Tang San first sent back the others, including Xiao Wu. He quickly washed of the dirt and changed his clothes before swiftly running to the fourth floor of the school building.</p><br/><p>To him right now, Ning Fengzhi\u2019s purpose in coming wasn\u2019t important, what he most wanted to know about was what Tai Tan called him.</p><br/><p>Reaching the fourth floor, Tang San just saw Zhao Wuji stepping out from a meeting room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji made a silencing gesture to Tang San, hurriedly pulling him over to a corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, no matter what they tell you later, you must stay calm. That old fellow Tai Tan and Ning Fengzhi don\u2019t get along, so I arranged them in two rooms. Who you see first is your decision. However, no matter what you mustn\u2019t easily make any promises, if you can\u2019t, you can ask to wait until Grandmaster and Flender returns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was always calm, and after listening nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, don\u2019t worry, I know what I should do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji smiled wryly, right now he was only a foil. With this gap in strength, whether it was the Golden Iron Triangle or the Poison Douluo, as long as one of them was here the Academy wouldn\u2019t be as passive as now.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan wasn\u2019t bad, even though his Strength Clan wasn\u2019t weak, with so many teachers at the Shrek Academy, Zhao Wuji still wasn\u2019t worried about him.</p><br/><p>But Ning Fengzhi was different, that leader of one of the seven great clans, those two resident Douluo alone were enough to make the four oceans tremble.</p><br/><p>Among all the seven great clans, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School was ranked second, considered one of the upper three, above even Grandmaster\u2019s Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji wasn\u2019t at all worried about Tang San, he was even a bit happy that Tang San had revealed his hammer just now. Even though he was shocked to learn Tang San had twin spirits, these twin spirits had now also become something that made even the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School apprehensive.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Wuji had pointed out the two rooms, Tang San without the slightest hesitation first chose Tai Tan\u2019s family, pushing open the door and entering.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan ranked higher, but when he saw Tang San entering he hastily stood up from where he sat thinking, and without waiting for Tang San to react, this Vigorous God once again fell to one knee,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old slave injured young master, young master please choose a punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Tai Nuo and his son follow Tai Tan\u2019s example, Tang San\u2019s face revealed a wry smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, get up first. We\u2019ll talk properly. Right now I don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on. Why don\u2019t you explain it all to me first. Perhaps you\u2019ve mistaken me for someone else, I\u2019m not someone you\u2019d call young master, my background is only as the most ordinary commoner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan looked distracted a moment. Standing up, he sized up Tang San and immediately asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your father called Tang Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s name is indeed Tang Hao, but he\u2019s not someone you\u2019d call master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan lowered his voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your father is Tang Hao, then there\u2019s no mistake. Young master, how did you and master live for all these years? How come you would use that Blue Silver Grass spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat impatiently halted Tai Tan\u2019s words,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, can\u2019t you first tell me what sort of person my father really is, how come you would call him master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Master didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a pondering light in Tai Tan\u2019s fierce eyes, and he paced back and forth within the room,</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, why don\u2019t you first tell this worthless elder[2] how you lived with master for all these years. If master didn\u2019t say anything, this worthless elder also daren\u2019t speak out of turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San felt a burst of dejection, and inwardly couldn\u2019t help feel more and more perplexed,</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom childhood I lived with father in Holy Spirit Village, father was the village\u2019s sole blacksmith, and every day besides working, his only hobby was drinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlacksmith?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan stared wide eyed, an expression of inconceivability in his eyes. For a moment his hair and beard quivered, and for a long time he couldn\u2019t control himself,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, how could you be reduced to such a state, at that time, you were\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Here Tai Tan\u2019s face was covered with tears, already unable to stop his sobs.</p><br/><p>Tang San was confused, he had already explained how miserably he had lived with his father, why would this formidable Spirit Douluo still believe his father was the one he called master?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I think, you really have the wrong person. My father is only a common blacksmith.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t keep from emphasizing it once again.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan wiped his tears,</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, even if I don\u2019t know why master wouldn\u2019t tell you about his identity, I can be certain I\u2019m not mistaking you for someone else. Other things can be mistakes, but can spirits be wrong? Let me ask you, who did you inherit your Blue Silver Grass spirit from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be inherited from my mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan questioned closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen your other spirit? That little black hammer you held in your left hand before, who was it passed down from? Blue Silver Grass belongs to your mother, then that hammer can only belong to your father. I can make mistakes in other things, but if I couldn\u2019t even recognize master\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer[3], then I wouldn\u2019t have the face to keep living in this world. The Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s pattern is unique and unmatched, in those days I always followed at master\u2019s side, how couldn\u2019t I recognize it? This is a unique spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s words in the end revealed a gap, and hearing the words \u2018Clear Sky Hammer\u2019, Tang San\u2019s whole body trembled. Grandmaster had taught him for so many years, of course he had told him about the seven great schools of the present age. Among the seven great schools were the three upper and four lower sects.</p><br/><p>The three upper sects were separately the Clear Sky School, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon School. The reason they were called the three upper sects was of course because these three great schools each had at least one Title Douluo guardian. Even though the four lower schools were quite powerful, they still didn\u2019t have a power like those Title Douluo.</p><br/><p>Among them, the Clear Sky School was no doubt the most formidable existence of the three upper sects, in Grandmaster\u2019s assessment, both the Clear Sky School and Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School had two resident Douluo, but even with the support of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s strongest Support Spirit, those two Title Douluo still wouldn\u2019t stand a great chance of winning against the two resident Douluo of the Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>As a result, this Clear Sky School could be said to be ranked first among the seven great schools, the first school in the whole Douluo Continent.</p><br/><p>And Clear Sky School\u2019s inherited spirit was a kind of tool spirit, called: Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster had never said much about the Clear Sky School\u2019s circumstances, this was all Tang San knew. Now hearing Vigorous God Tai Tan in front of him actually say that hammer of his was actually the Clear Sky Hammer, how couldn\u2019t he be shocked?</p><br/><p>Raising his left hand, black light coalescing, the Clear Sky Hammer once again appeared in Tang San\u2019s palm,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really the Clear Sky Hammer?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time the distance was even shorter, and Tai Tan could observe the black little hammer in Tang San\u2019s hand even more clearly. As soon as the little hammer appeared, he nodded without the slightest hesitation,</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the direct blood relations can possess it. And among the direct blood relations of the school, only master has been away for a number of years straight, also only master\u2019s name is Tang Hao, there\u2019s no mistake. Young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t say so in detail, this moment was already enough to tell Tang San that he was from the Clear Sky School.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are saying, my father is directly blood related to the Clear Sky School, and I as well? No, that\u2019s impossible. If father was from the Clear Sky School, why, why would he be reduced to a blacksmith?\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of position did the Clear Sky School hold in the Spirit Master world? It was a formidable existence even Spirit Hall wouldn\u2019t lightly dare offend, in overall strength being capable of competing equally with Spirit Hall, were only the seven great schools.</p><br/><p>Especially the five Title Douluo of the upper three sects. Among the seven great schools, the Clear Sky School was very mysterious, it was rare for people to even know its location.</p><br/><p>But the Clear Sky School\u2019s dignity wasn\u2019t something anyone dared offend lightly. Even the current Spirit Hall Supreme pontiff would still be extremely respectful to it.</p><br/><p>If his father was born from the Clear Sky School, and was directly blood related, then\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>[1] Idiom: People on the same side ending up fighting when not recognizing each other.

What use is there to senselessly make trouble like this? Work hard, we still have a chance in the ranking competition. To face an opponent that restrains us completely, we\u2019ll have to think of some new methods. Even though he\u2019s immune to fire, he can\u2019t be immune to energy attacks, or did you forget what Shui Bing-Er did?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, there\u2019s still me. Little sister Huo Wu, I didn\u2019t encounter him in the qualifiers, but once we\u2019ve reached the ranking competition, I\u2019ll definitely help you beat him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaotian had come over from somewhere without anyone noticing, speaking with a face full of righteous indignation.</p><br/><p>Returning directly to the Academy from Heaven Dou Great Spirit Arena, Tang San\u2019s mind was still constantly replaying the whole process of today\u2019s confrontation with Skywater Academy.</p><br/><p>To him, this wasn\u2019t just a simple tie. This was the most difficult challenge in the whole qualifiers. It was admittedly because the opponents\u2019 spirit fusion ability was especially familiar, but at the same time, this difficulty was also because they were restrained from the start.</p><br/><p>Tang San clearly saw that it was because of him that the whole team had been at a disadvantage. Shui Bing-Er taking the control had destroyed his original plans. At the same time it had also finally let him experience the formidability of other control system Spirit Masters. Next was the ranking competition, which was a stage for people to show off. But, after that came the finals, and that was still a team battle.</p><br/><p>Any Spirit Master had flaws, and he was no exception. Only by a team complementing each other could a Spirit Master\u2019s strength be revealed to its greatest degree, this had always been a natural law of the Spirit Master world. That was also an important reason why this Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament relied mainly on team battles.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think much of emperor Xue Ye\u2019s olive branch, that wasn\u2019t a question he should consider yet. What he needed to think about right now was how he could help his team even more, how to let his own strength grow even more powerful.</p><br/><p>Tang San had always been a stubborn person, it was true in his previous life at Tang Sect, and it was still true in this world.</p><br/><p>Consequently, after returning to the Academy he immediately went to Grandmaster to propose he go into closed door cultivation for a time, in order to think about some things.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was understanding, and also understood that this was an important phase to Tang San. As long as he could pierce through this barrier in his heart, he would mature even more, and also become even more formidable. At this time there was nobody that could help him, the only one he could rely on was himself. Only his own understanding, comprehension, could he solve his own problems. Even a wise man like Grandmaster couldn\u2019t reply with anything that would have any better effect right now.</p><br/><p>That wall within was different for each person, and nobody could know what problems others faced. Tang San\u2019s problems could only be settled by Tang San himself.</p><br/><p>Watching Tang San\u2019s gradually disappearing back, the other six Shrek Seven Devils couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat lonely. They also understood Tang San\u2019s current feelings. Ever since the formation of the team, even though today\u2019s match wasn\u2019t their most challenging, to Tang San it was still truly a suppressed battle. They could completely understand Tang San\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu wanted to catch up to and comfort Tang San, but was held back by Liu Erlong,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t go disturb him right now. It\u2019s better if he can understand on his own. Believe in him. Give him a little space.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu looked at Liu Erlong. Liu Erlong softly pulled her into her embrace, gently stroking her long braid.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster coughed once, attracting everyone\u2019s attention,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Tang San has gone into seclusion. The next month is also a time for you to get into shape. This past month of high density matches has had different degrees of benefit for each of you. But this is still far from enough. I think you\u2019ve all seen that you\u2019re not the only talents in this world. Tang San has met an opponent that restrains him, and you will also do the same. You\u2019re all as one, in order to help prevail and obtain the ultimate victory, you will have to pay even more. Therefore, I\u2019ve decided that in the next month\u2019s recuperation interlude, I will once again conduct a period of strengthening training for you. What are those faces for? Stand up properly. If anyone has any objections, I don\u2019t mind doubling the training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood curdling screams echoed simultaneously in the hearts of the Shrek Six Devils. Right now they suddenly envied Tang San. At least, in seclusion Tang San didn\u2019t need to undergo anymore hell training\u2026... </p><br/><p>The place Tang San chose for his seclusion was still that log cabin in the middle of the forest. The secluded surroundings, the quiet world, was most suitable for his cultivation.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019d already spent two days here, Tang San still sat vacantly. He didn\u2019t cultivate, his mind always enveloped in a dense fog. He couldn\u2019t find any way out of his problems, and he also didn\u2019t understand in what direction he should grow. He even doubted whether the control system route he\u2019d walked until now wasn\u2019t a mistake.</p><br/><p>In two days Tang San had thought a lot, but the more he thought, the more confused he became.</p><br/><p>Two days and two nights had passed, he didn\u2019t even rest, not eating anything, completely passing the time in this kind of hazy condition. This kind of painful feeling wreaked havoc in his heart. He didn\u2019t even know why he was in pain.</p><br/><p>Ever since the day he became a Spirit Master, he had always stood at the summit of his peers. Blue Silver Grass wasn\u2019t any formidable spirit, it was even a trash spirit, but cultivating under Grandmaster guidance, his strength had never been below those Spirit Masters of his age who possessed more formidable spirits. He was even ahead of everyone. As time had passed, Tang San had even already forgotten about the issues of his Blue Silver Grass, he\u2019d always stood on equal footing with Spirit Masters with formidable spirits, he\u2019d even felt somewhat superior.</p><br/><p>However, now that he calmed down and thought it over, he discovered that if it wasn\u2019t for having the external spirit bone Eight Spider Lances, if it wasn\u2019t for always having the support of his comrades at his side and his luck in obtaining those spirit rings, perhaps, he wouldn\u2019t be much of anything.</p><br/><p>Each of his spirit rings were of better quality than other peoples\u2019, but in his previous confrontation with Shui Bing-Er, it couldn\u2019t be said his spirit abilities held any advantage. Perhaps these kinds of circumstances should have appeared before, only in previous matches and fights, he had always used tactics to cover up this gap. But after Blue Silver Grass\u2019s own defects were revealed, Tang San immediately discovered his problem.</p><br/><p>A truly formidable control system Spirit Master needed not only control, but also spirit abilities with a certain attack capability. Shui Bing-Er\u2019s spirit fusion ability was even better quality. However, could his Blue Silver Grass do that? No. Even if he already possessed a ten thousand year spirit ring at fortieth rank, without really using his external spirit bone he didn\u2019t have any advantage of Shui Bing-Er.</p><br/><p>Rather than saying that his previous opponents had lost in strength, it would be better to say they had lost in tactics. Once an opponent appeared who wasn\u2019t below him in planning, then the flaws of his control would immediately be exposed. This was still when he had taken the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot. If he didn\u2019t have these two immortal treasure herbs, perhaps his weakness would have been exposed even earlier, even Huo Wu could have easily beaten him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Why, why is it like this? Don\u2019t tell me all these years of effort have been a waste?\u2019 Tang San very clearly understood that the innate flaws of a spirit would gradually appear along with the growth of spirit power.</p><br/><p>\u2018No, it can\u2019t go on like this. Blue Silver Grass basically isn\u2019t a good spirit, I\u2019m still young, there\u2019s still time to give it up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t hold back the thoughts of his other spirit, Clear Sky Hammer. The hereditary spirit of one of the Spirit Master world\u2019s seven great schools, Clear Sky School. If he had chosen to cultivate the Clear Sky Hammer from the start, then his current strength wouldn\u2019t just be like this. He could only become more formidable.</p><br/><p>The more he thought, the lower Tang San\u2019s confidence in Blue Silver Grass became. His heart was just like a raging sea, all kinds of chaotic thoughts making him feel somewhat crazy.</p><br/><p>Two days had passed, without any cultivation. In the past this was something Tang San couldn\u2019t even have imagined, that was how diligent he was. However, right now he didn\u2019t have a trace of desire to cultivate.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak.\u201d</p><br/><p>A green silhouette appeared in the yard outside, the sudden voice snapping Tang San out of his whirlpool of suffering.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because these two days had consumed too much mental strength, but even though that voice sounded familiar, Tang San still couldn\u2019t make out who it belonged to.</p><br/><p>Standing, Tang San walked out of the cabin. After sitting too long, as the glaring sunshine hit him, he couldn\u2019t keep from swaying a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>In practically the next moment, the green silhouette was already in front of Tang San, one powerful hand directly clasping Tang San\u2019s shoulder, mellow spirit power somewhat overbearing and somewhat coarsely penetrating his body, rousing Tang San\u2019s mind somewhat. Then he clearly saw who it was.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a stranger, but rather Shrek Academy\u2019s honorary dean, one of the formidable Title Douluo, Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked doubtfully at Tang San. Right now Tang San\u2019s appearance was somewhat scary, his hair in a mess, his facial hair unkempt, both eyes bloodshot, a completely dispirited appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Managing to squeeze out a smile, the spirit power within Tang San\u2019s body operated automatically, clearing his rigid blood vessels, letting him stand upright.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo doubtfully said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, what\u2019s going on? Weren\u2019t you still well when I left, how would you become like this in a few days? Come on, let\u2019s go inside first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dragging Tang San into the log cabin, Dugu Bo\u2019s expression was somewhat serious. He could of course see how lacking Tan San\u2019s mental state was right now. As a formidable Title Douluo, he was only too clear on the cultivation circumstances of Spirit Masters, and Tang San\u2019s current condition was extremely dangerous. In case of a nervous breakdown, he would either go insane or be totally ruined.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, tell me, what actually happened to strike you into this kind of appearance. In my memory, you little freak was always a freak among freaks. Don\u2019t tell me you met someone even more freakish than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Dugu Bo, the rims of Tang San\u2019s eyes suddenly reddened somewhat. Grandmaster absolutely hadn\u2019t expected his current condition. After all, nobody knew Tang San was a person of two lives, his mind was far beyond his peers, but it was also because of this that it was even easier for him to get stuck bashing his head against a brick wall.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s appearance made Tang San recover somewhat. Especially his mind had a somewhat hopeful feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, can you tell me, if I cultivate my spirit power beyond the seventieth rank, will I still be as far ahead as I am now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s brows puckered,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you ask that? Little freak, what happened to your confidence? What\u2019s actually gotten into you? You should understand how important confidence is to a Spirit Master, If you don\u2019t have the most elementary confidence, if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, then later you won\u2019t make even a centimeter of progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I don\u2019t know what I should do. The spirit I\u2019m cultivating is just Blue Silver Grass. Even though I\u2019ve already reached the fortieth rank, as my level increases, Blue Silver Grass\u2019s weaknesses will be revealed more and more clearly. In the future, can I really rely on this spirit to contend with other Spirit Masters?\u201d</p><br/><p>A jade light flickered in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes, staring at Tang San with a burning gaze,</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m considered powerful among my peers right now isn\u2019t because of the strength of my spirit, but rather because I have better spirit rings than ordinary Spirit Masters, and even have the external spirit bone Eight Spider Lances. You should also have seen my second spirit before. I don\u2019t need to hide anything from you, my second spirit is Clear Sky School\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer. Right now I\u2019m thinking that if I cultivated the Clear Sky Hammer instead, then wouldn\u2019t the circumstances be different? Right now I have fortieth level spirit power. I only need four spirit rings that suit me to be able to bring out the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s strength. It\u2019s far more formidable than Blue Silver Grass. Even though I\u2019m still not fifteen, I\u2019ve already spent far too much effort on cultivating, I don\u2019t want to waste my later effort on a trash spirit like Blue Silver Grass. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was Dugu Bo? Anyone who could become a Title Douluo power was highly intelligent. From Tang San\u2019s simpler and agitated words, he had already gradually understood the problem Tang San faced right now.</p><br/><p>Waving his hand, he didn\u2019t let Tang San speak further. Dugu Bo looked Tang San in the eyes, sternly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, do you know why I\u2019ve always considered you a freak among freaks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of my knowledge in using poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only a small part. Even more significant is your Blue Silver Grass.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pupils of Tang San\u2019s eyes contracted violently. Looking at Dugu Bo, his eyes revealed deep doubt.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo indifferently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Blue Silver Grass is a trash spirit. Moreover it\u2019s the best known trash spirit. In the past, it was basically impossible for anyone who possessed Blue Silver Grass as spirit to have the chance to cultivate. But. You? Tell me. What were the circumstances when your spirit awakened? I heard Grandmaster say it was full innate spirit power, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does full innate spirit power signify? It signifies the foundation of the spirit. Even my own granddaughter who inherited by Jade Phosphor Serpent Spirit only had seventh ranked innate spirit power. And you had tenth ranked. And moreover, you still cultivate Blue Silver Grass. What does this signify? It means your Blue Silver Grass is different from the masses. That\u2019s not simple Blue Silver Grass. You can also guess who your father is. Think, with your father\u2019s background and strength, would he be together with a woman who only possessed common Blue Silver Grass? If it really was common Blue Silver Grass, how would it produce a little freak with twin spirits like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was naturally deaf to Dugu Bo\u2019s explanation of full innate spirit power, because he always believed that it was the result of his own diligently cultivated Mysterious Heaven Skill, and not bestowed by Blue Silver Grass. Even more, at the time he awakened he also had a Clear Sky Hammer, even if the spirit truly had assigned him some spirit power, that should also be from Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>However, Dugu Bo\u2019s later words made him somewhat startled. Yes, his Blue Silver Grass really was somewhat uncommon, especially not long ago when he had the feeling of being in contact with the natural wild blue silver grass. That throbbing came from his spirit itself. Just that no one had ever cultivated Blue Silver Grass to his present degree, Tang San also didn\u2019t know whether this was something that Blue Silver Grass should be doing. But it was Dugu Bo\u2019s last words that touched him the most. It was also an important question he\u2019d always had.</p><br/><p>His father was a directly related disciple of Clear Sky School, and also one of their greatest powers, would a woman who only possessed the a waste Blue Silver Grass Spirit be with him?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, is there any relation between the strength of the parents\u2019 spirits and twin spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s breathing had clearly become hurried.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this field, perhaps that teacher of yours doesn\u2019t even know. Even though his spirit research is very thorough, you\u2019re after all the first person he\u2019s met who has twin spirits. Before, I once read some top secret information in Spirit Hall. It was a written account of twin spirits. Spirits are hereditary, generally coming from the parents, so tell me, what\u2019s the relation between inheriting the parents\u2019 spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having followed Grandmaster for so many years, this kind of question naturally wasn\u2019t difficult for Tang San, and he answered without the slightest hesitation:</p><br/><p>\u201cGenerally speaking, the spirit inherited is the relatively more powerful one of the parents\u2019 spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo went on:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when there\u2019s hardly any difference in strength between the spirits, or even when they\u2019re identical, what will happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder such circumstances, it will be inherited randomly, but under such circumstances there\u2019s also a higher chance of spirit variation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthy of being Grandmaster\u2019s disciple, your explanation is quite right. But, do you know, what are the odds of twin spirits appearing under such circumstances? The reason twin spirits are so rare, is because the conditions are so harsh. This is what\u2019s written in Spirit Hall\u2019s records. The birth of twin spirits mainly has two preconditions, first, the parents\u2019 spirits can\u2019t be identical, the more they differ, the higher the odds of bringing about twin spirits. At the same time, the closer the quality of both sides\u2019 spirits, the higher the odds of bringing about twin spirits. In other words, if there\u2019s a gap in quality between the spirits, it\u2019s basically impossible to birth a child with twin spirits. Even if these conditions are met, the probability of issue with twin spirits is only one in a thousand, or even one in ten thousand. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was clever, even though his mental state wasn\u2019t very good right now, he still very quickly caught on to what Dugu Bo meant. Dugu Bo was using this example to tell him his Blue Silver Grass Spirit absolutely wasn\u2019t simple. Capable of possessing qualitative parity with Clear Sky Hammer, what kind of Blue Silver Grass was that?</p><br/><p>According to Grandmaster\u2019s research, twin spirits was a kind of spirit variation, only the circumstances in which it arose were really too rare, and therefore so very few had appeared on the Continent. Dugu Bo\u2019s analysis wasn\u2019t bad, and Tang San immediately recalled the other two cases of twin spirits Grandmaster had talked about. Sure enough, the quality of the twin spirits really was extremely similar.</p><br/><p>The originally vacant heart once again became burning hot. Tang San\u2019s eyes finally began to focus again.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo unhappily glared at him, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if your Blue Silver Grass\u2019s quality wasn\u2019t good, do you think that really matters? How old are you this year? Still not even fifteen, but already fortieth rank. Your present worries are matters for later. Since you could obtain formidable spirit rings and spirit bones to pull open the distance with equally ranked Spirit Masters before, don\u2019t tell me you couldn\u2019t do it again? No effort is wasted. If you don\u2019t have even this much confidence, then you\u2019re not freakish, but rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, if you cultivated Clear Sky Hammer now, your strength would indeed start rising again in a short time. As long as you have suitable spirit rings, you will immediately become powerful, even more powerful than fifty or sixtieth ranked Spirit Masters. But, haven\u2019t you considered, if you began cultivating Clear Sky Hammer at ninetieth rank, getting nine spirit rings, what quality would they be? At that time, even if getting nine hundred thousand year spirit rings at the same time wouldn\u2019t be impossible. Even if Blue Silver Grass was no good, it would still be enough to push you to that level, it wouldn\u2019t be too late to prepare at that time. With your present cultivation speed, perhaps you will break your father\u2019s record of becoming the youngest Title Douluo. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo clearly didn\u2019t know about the deadliness of twin spirits, but his arguments were clear and easy to see.</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes, I could obtain external strength before, why couldn\u2019t I do it later? When others have ten thousand year spirit rings, I have a twenty thousand year spirit ring, when others have fiffty thousand year spirit rings, I\u2019ll get a hundred thousand year. Relying on the effect of spirit rings can also pull closer the gap between me and the quality of others\u2019 spirits. What\u2019s more, right now I still have a spirit bone to trade. Aren\u2019t these also my own advantages?\u2019</p><br/><p>The disorder in his mind gradually left, and the fog in his heart quietly dissipated. Right now, the only question that still remained was how to make himself stronger.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Tang San\u2019s changing expression and knew this little freak had already figured out a lot from his pointer. Leaning back in his chair, he smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, do you know where I went this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I know what an old freak like you is up to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with his mood recovering, he clearly became a lot more relaxed.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to exchange pointers with an old friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Win or lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked.</p><br/><p>The green light in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes became agitated,</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t win, and I didn\u2019t lose, it was at least a draw. Haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San mocked:</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly a draw, what\u2019s there to be proud about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo curled his lip, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know farts. Every time I fought that fellow before I would be beaten into the dirt, battered and exhausted, if I didn\u2019t rely on poison, I would be dead long ago. But this time he was the dirty one, were it not for this old man being compassionate and merciful, perhaps I\u2019d have killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San started, if Dugu Bo said this, then his opponent was definitely a Title Douluo. Otherwise, how could Dugu Bo be beaten ragged?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour strength progressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said with immense pride:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. This fellow\u2019s spirit power has reached ninety sixth rank, considered an expert among Title Douluo, with even more astonishing power behind him. This time he almost fell, you tell me how I couldn\u2019t be excited. Of course, this was also thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? How is it related to me? That was a ninety sixth ranked Title Douluo, I\u2019m forty something ranked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grinned:</p><br/><p>\u201cStill remember those Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls you gave me? Really can\u2019t know without using, but they scared me out of my skin. This time it should have been me who lost. At that time, I was already forced back and prepared to run, but I suddenly remembered that nice thing you gave me. So I pulled it out and used it. I didn\u2019t expect that thing to really be so scarily powerful. That idiot ate at least seven or eight poison darts, and all of a sudden it let me turn the tables. In the end he had no choice but to take to his heels and run. Hahahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back at the happy sight, Dugu Bo couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls? Tang San hadn\u2019t used them since he made these hidden weapons. Suddenly, a great flash of divine light lit up his mind, his brain suddenly becoming sharp. \u2018Hidden weapons. Hidden weapons, I\u2019m from Tang Sect, I have hidden weapons.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right, Blue Silver Grass might not be a formidable spirit, but just like Teacher said, its plasticity is still extraordinarily formidable. If, if I can combine ny Blue Silver Grass with the hidden weapons I inherited from Tang Sect, then, what will the result be?\u2019</p><br/><p>His heart suddenly throbbed breathlessly. Tang San swallowed a big gulp of saliva. His mind was already impatiently reflecting on how he should combine Blue Silver Grass with the mysteries of his hidden weapon secret lore.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo saw Tang San suddenly tremble after hearing about him using the Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls. He immediately became lifeless, and also couldn\u2019t help start.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? It\u2019s nothing. Old freak, thank you for enlightening me, I\u2019ve already figured it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo assumed the appearance of a capable person,</p><br/><p>\u201cMe saving you can\u2019t be free of charge. I already used up those Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls. Don\u2019t you still have some? Give me another two. I can trade for something. Or pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared at Dugu Bo,</p><br/><p>\u201cTrade farts, take them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four dark green spheres flew straight at Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was so scared he jumped, flustered catching the four Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls, grumbling:</p><br/><p>\u201cStinking brat, are you after my old life! What if they exploded? Are you after my old life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have even this much confidence, how could I even make them. Moreover, with my spirit power, even if they really exploded, could they injure an old freak like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo cautiously loaded the four Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls into a spirit tool, satisfied saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThese things of yours, not only is the attack range great, but the penetrating power is great. Especially after colliding. The more violently they collide, the more spirit power I use, the greater the piercing power. It\u2019s a pity they\u2019re not poisonous enough. Otherwise, they would be even scarier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San reminded Dugu Bo:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, don\u2019t depend on them too much. Even though the Cluster Soul Chasing Life Taking Balls have great power, as hidden weapons, what\u2019s most important is surprise. When confronting an opponent on the same level, if you lose the element of surprise, their effect won\u2019t be so good. As for the poison, originally when I made them I didn\u2019t have suitable drugs on hand, and even though I\u2019ve gained some later, it\u2019s very difficult to reinforce the poison after they\u2019ve already been formed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo grinned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good. Make some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re candy? It\u2019s easier said than done. It requires a great amount of time. Right now I\u2019m participating in the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament, spare time must all be used for cultivating, how could I make them. Let\u2019s talk about it once the tournament is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you already passed the qualifiers. Next should be the ranking competition. With a little freak like you overseeing it, you should be able to get a good place, perhaps you\u2019ll even enter the top three.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not champions? Don\u2019t you have that much confidence in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shrugged, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a question of confidence. In front of absolute strength, what use is confidence? If you can enter the top three, that\u2019s already a good achievement. There was never any doubt about who would win this tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Dugu Bo say this, Tang San couldn\u2019t keep his heart from twitching,</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Since you say as much, do you know some team that\u2019s especially strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo sighed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is Spirit Hall so powerful? It\u2019s because they recruit so many Spirit Master experts. Apart from the seven great schools, practically all formidable Spirit Masters belong to Spirit Hall. No one can possess more information about Spirit Masters and factors for cultivation than Spirit Hall. Under Spirit Hall\u2019s careful fostering, a group of elite Spirit Masters will emerge with each generation. This time is no different. I\u2019ve heard that Spirit Hall has a few little juniors with astonishing talent, even the Supreme Pontiff praises them as Spirit Hall\u2019s Golden Generation, the masters of the future. And it\u2019s precisely them that are representing Spirit Hall in this year\u2019s Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament. They\u2019re all barely more than twenty, and there\u2019s no need to doubt their strength. Spirit Hall provided them with cultivation resources and outfitting in all areas, how could common advanced Spirit Master academies compare. Even you couldn\u2019t do it. You\u2019re after all still too young, perhaps you can catch up to them in another ten years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was a Title Douluo, naturally he wouldn\u2019t talk without thinking. Hearing him say this, Tang San\u2019s mood immediately turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you say this, Spirit Hall is determined to win this tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know what the prize is for the final champions in this Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San blankly shook his head.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally Spirit Hall was preparing to give those things directly to those geniuses of the Golden Generation, but were opposed by the elders of Elder Palace. As a result, the Supreme Pontiff compromised and decided to give them some training, and that\u2019s this tournament. And Spirit Hall took out those things that were originally going to them as rewards for the champions. Tell me, how couldn\u2019t they be determined to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San curiously asked.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo retorted:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Spirit Masters, what\u2019s most precious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a spirit bone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not one, but three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San turned pale with fright. Three spirit bones? What kind of concept was that? Something like spirit bones was a divine existence to Spirit Masters. Any one spirit bone could give a Spirit Master an enormous boost. Three spirit bones, that wasn\u2019t something that could be weighed with money.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThese three spirit bones were set aside by Spirit Hall, left behind by their passed away elders. Since the Supreme Pontiff dares take them out as reward for the champions, you can imagine their confidence in their athletes. Do you still have thoughts of being lucky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said without the slightest hesitation,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they\u2019ve taken them out, there\u2019s no need for them to take them back again. Old freak, do you know the levels of Spirit Hall\u2019s athletes in the tournament, and what their spirits are?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

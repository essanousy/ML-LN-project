He could sense Grandmaster\u2019s complex feelings.</p><br/><p>At this moment, letting his Teacher calm down a bit should be the best option.</p><br/><p>Walking into the forest, the temperature clearly dropped compared to outside, the fresh and cool atmosphere rousing Grandmaster\u2019s spirit and it seemed even his mood eased a bit.</p><br/><p>Stopping, Grandmaster turned to Tang San, calmly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, aren\u2019t you very curious about my relationship with Erlong, why it is like this right now, why I would evade her for twenty years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you a story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty years ago, a youth born from a prestigious clan, because of a variant spirit, couldn\u2019t inherit the school\u2019s spirit and was exiled. In order to prove himself, he studied everything about Spirit Masters, researching even deeper meanings, hoping to one day be able to gain the approval of the world. As he travelled outside, he met a like minded young Spirit Master and the two decided to travel the Spirit Master world together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne day, when they hunted spirit beasts in a spirit beast forest, they encountered a beautiful young lady. The young lady was alone, and her lively and straightforward nature very quickly attracted these two youths. The three became fast friends, and two companions increased to three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the passing of time, the two youths both grew to like that young lady with the Fire Dragon Spirit, but because they thought of each other as brothers, they were unwilling to state it clearly. Especially that youth unable to possess strength because of his variant spirit, buried this affection even deeper in his heart. As a result of the three unexpectedly discovering that between the three of them they were able to use a kind of formidable spirit fusion ability, relying on this formidable strength, they gradually became known in the Spirit Master world as the Golden Iron Triangle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Here Grandmaster sighed once again,</p><br/><p>\u201cThings like feelings accumulate over time, and the deeper they are buried, sometimes they will instead grow even more intense. As the three grew older their feelings also grew more profound. At last one day, that powerful youth was unable to hold back the torment of his feelings and confessed them to that young lady. But, the result was extremely unexpected to the two youths. The young lady always knew the two youths cared for her, and it was precisely because of this that she was afraid to speak out her own choice and hurt the other. Now confronted with the strong youth\u2019s confession, she was finally unable to conceal it further and called it out in front of both youths. She told them that the one she liked was the youth whose strength was inferior due to a variant spirit, but through perseverance and great effort gained superb theoretical understanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should already have guessed that the young lady was Erlong, and the two youths were me and Flender. Even now I still clearly remember Flender\u2019s disappointed expression that time, and still the sound of my own heartbeat. At that time I suddenly felt a happiness I had never had in my whole life. However, me and Erlong were both unwilling to harm Flender, for a while there was silence between the three of us. Like that, a long time passed with a stifling mood over us. Finally, Flender stood up. He was the oldest of us and said that he wanted me to be his brother, and Erlong to be his brother\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDean Flender really is a good person. Perhaps this is the best conclusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a lifetime I will never forget Flender\u2019s words. He said that he had already lost his love, and he absolutely didn\u2019t want to lose his brother and sister. He blessed us from his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it was like this, you and Erlong should have been able to marry, then why would\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf everything had gone smoothly, there wouldn\u2019t be a story. Perhaps our children would already be older than you. But, I don\u2019t know if it was Heaven\u2019s joke on us, but everything we had was destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember that day very clearly. The stars were especially bright in the night sky, with Flender presiding for us, me and Erlong were finally married. Even if at that time we didn\u2019t have anything, didn\u2019t have the blessings of family or friends, didn\u2019t have a grand ceremony, at that time we all felt incomparably happy. As long as we were able to be together with those we loved, what did other people matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three of us were drinking together, Flender intending to say goodbye to us and go out to travel on his own. Suddenly several people appeared. And these were people I was familiar with. The person in the lead was my uncle, the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon clan\u2019s present second master, Yu Luomian[1]. At that time his arrival made me extremely startled, but since that day was my day of exaltation, and since he was family, me and Erlong could still relate to this second uncle, and we immediately happily invited him into our house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Here Grandmaster\u2019s mood clearly became agitated,</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, who would have thought that my second uncle wasn\u2019t looking for me. His target was actually Erlong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San startled asked.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we married, as me, Erlong and Flender travelled the Continent, we never asked each other about our backgrounds, those were our private matters. Since I wasn\u2019t allowed to speak about my family, Flender was born from a poor household, and Erlong never spontaneously mentioned it. My second uncle\u2019s purpose in finding us, was unexpectedly to recognize blood relations. Erlong, Erlong was actually his illegitimate daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared wide eyed with shock, the Will of Heaven toyed with people, no wonder, no wonder Teacher would chose to leave, all of this was truly too unfair to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Erlong heard me address him as second uncle her face already paled. As I asked her, not daring to believe it, seeing her nod, I felt as if I\u2019d been struck by thunder from a clear sky. How I hadn\u2019t expected, my affectionate wife, was actually my cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teardrops, escaping control rolled down Grandmaster\u2019s face. Even if twenty years had passed, that scene would never fade from his mind.</p><br/><p>The joy of marrying his beloved, abruptly becoming great grief, what suffering was that.</p><br/><p>His voice choked with emotion, Grandmaster\u2019s expression was hard to make out,</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, second uncle looking at our clothing clearly understood what was going on. His first words were, \u2018how can you marry this useless trash\u2019. Originally I\u2019d always thought second uncle was good to me, not looking at me like the others of the clan. Until that time when I learned my mistake, in fact, even he thought of me as trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI later learned that Erlong was born from my second uncle and a prostitute. Because of Erlong\u2019s mother\u2019s background he didn\u2019t dare bring her back home. When Erlong left to travel the world, her mother had already passed away from illness. She was always brought up by second uncle in the outer territories. He also let her follow matrilineally. Her mother chose the name Erlong after her father. My second uncle\u2019s infant name was precisely Erlong[2].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Teacher, if senior Erlong is your patrilineal cousin, then her spirit should be inherited from your clan, Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon. Don\u2019t tell me, don\u2019t tell me that senior Erlong\u2019s spirit is actually also\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Erlong also has a variant spirit, only hers didn\u2019t become weak. Although it didn\u2019t become formidable, in the end it\u2019s still extremely strong. Thunder variation has similarities to flame, this is the origin of her Fire Dragon Spirit. It was this kind of coincidence that formed this tragedy between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I ran like mad. At that time I wanted to die. I already had no one else. Erlong wanted to chase after me, but second uncle stopped her. If it wasn\u2019t for Flender catching up to me, stopping me from suicide, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t be a Grandmaster now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t say anything else, right now even he was inundated in the sorrowful world of Grandmaster\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Neither of them knew that not far behind them another person equally had a face streaming with tears, helplessly gazing attentively in their direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could I do? Although afterwards I lost the desire to die, at that time Erlong was my whole life. You\u2019ve also seen that I\u2019m not considered handsome or strong. But she rejected Flender who was stronger than me, and chose me. I loved her so, but spouse changed into little sister. That kind of pain is unimaginable to most people. In the end, discouraged, I could only choose to run. I didn\u2019t let Flender follow, only quietly leaving on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterwards, I heard from Flender that Erlong and my second uncle had a big falling out after returning to the clan, searching for me everywhere like mad. I wanted to see her so much, but I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t destroy her reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSiblings marrying isn\u2019t tolerated by the world. Even if I didn\u2019t care, Erlong is a woman, how could I let her endure that? Even more, what my second uncle said was right, I\u2019m only trash, a useless trash, that\u2019s all. Erlong and me together, I don\u2019t even have the ability to protect her. She shouldn\u2019t be with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYear after year passed, I didn\u2019t even dare listen to rumors about Erlong. I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep from going to find her. In my confusion, I could only throw my heart and soul into spirit research. Only when I met you could I reveal my heart again. I entrusted my heart to you. These years have been a bit easier. I know Flender definitely knew Erlong was here, he\u2019s not a careless person, if he didn\u2019t know in advance, after being provoked at Heaven Dou Imperial Academy just before, how would he have again gone looking for an academy? Only I thought nothing of it at the time. Meeting Erlong again can only bring me more pain. Erlong is far stronger than me. This time, even if I wanted to escape this vortex of pain it would perhaps already be impossible for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Grandmaster, the edges of his eyes already somewhat moist. Yes, Heaven was unjust to Teacher, even if he had already been deprived of the powerful spirit he should have inherited, unexpectedly even his marriage had to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, are worldly opinions really so important? Who says you are trash? To me, you are the most formidable Spirit Master. Knowledge is power. Who dares say they are stronger than you in spirit lore? Nobody. Teacher, you are the strongest. Aunt Erlong waited for you for so many years without choosing someone else, how deep are her feelings for you? Running away like this again will only bring more suffering to the two of you. Even if you truly care about worldly opinions, you can still bring her to run away along with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster painfully shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s too unfair to Erlong. Little San, loving someone doesn\u2019t necessarily mean insisting on having them. I want even more for her to be able to live cheerfully, happily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San had already forgotten he was a student. Seeing Grandmaster\u2019s melancholy, he couldn\u2019t help but defiantly say:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will running away like this make aunt Erlong happy? If she was happy, would she sing that kind of sorrowful song? Would she weep from one look at you? She didn\u2019t even dare use words to try you out, afraid to upset you. Teacher, your heart is too weak. What are worldly opinions? Aunt Erlong is fearless, but you\u2019re afraid. You should be together with her, bravely going out to confront all this, cutting open all barriers to walk together. Whatever your family, whatever others think, you being together is no mistake. Even if your bloodlines are close, is there truly no room for this kind of match? Teacher, you\u2019re not only afraid aunt Erlong will suffer if she\u2019s together with you, at the same time you don\u2019t dare accept this reality, you have an inferiority complex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster looked stupidly at Tang San, lips moving but already speechless. Although he and Flender were equally proud, he who possessed an inferior spirit, deep in his heart always had an inferiority complex. Flender and Erlong had never dared say what they really thought, but the agitated Tang San had hit the key point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. Why must you have an inferiority complex, what if ten million people call you trash? As long as I, Liu Erlong, believe you are the strongest it\u2019s enough. Xiao Gang, do you truly not understand? If I cared about the family relation between us, would I always search for you like this? Would I always be in such pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong slowly walked out in the distance behind Xiao Gang and Tang San, teardrops constantly rolling down her face, looking at Grandmaster, firmly approaching step by step with a brilliantly tender countenance.</p><br/><p>This time, Grandmaster at last didn\u2019t once again try to escape Liu Erlong\u2019s gaze. Watching her approach step by step, Grandmaster\u2019s heartbeat clearly sped up. The obstruction in his heart gradually fractured under the surges of emotion. The protective barrier of twenty years was already unable to further suppress the love deep in his heart.</p><br/><p>Tang San very quietly retreated, gradually moving into the forest. He knew that at this moment nobody should disturb them. Inwardly he wished the best for Grandmaster. How would he not have seen the loneliness his Teacher often displayed.</p><br/><p>Now the source had finally been found. If it could be dispelled, letting Grandmaster and Liu Erlong truly walk together, then it would be the best conclusion for all sides.</p><br/><p>The forest was dark and tranquil and Tang San was in no hurry to return, only quietly walking in the woods. For some reason, hearing the story of Grandmaster and Liu Erlong, his mind suddenly recalled Xiao Wu. His state of mind wasn\u2019t that of a thirteen year old child, but that of a middle aged man.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was his little sister, what was really her place in his heart? Ever since getting to know Xiao Wu, Tang San deep inside pondered on this question for the first time.</p><br/><p>If, Grandmaster and Liu Erlong\u2019s story had been his and Xiao Wu\u2019s, how would he have settled it? Tang San discovered that right now he was somewhat perplexed, at a loss.</p><br/><p>The surrounding atmosphere suddenly chilled somewhat, making Tang San shiver. He couldn\u2019t help but frown in bafflement.</p><br/><p>With his spirit power breaking through the thirtieth rank, his Mysterious Heaven Skill had already reached the fourth tier, heat and cold shouldn\u2019t affect him, much less in the summer, so how did he feel cold?</p><br/><p>But at this moment Tang San suddenly stopped in shock. Three meters in front of him a man had appeared at some unknown time. A green man.</p><br/><p>Green hair, green eyes, green fingernails, eyes as ice cold and vicious as a viper. This person who suddenly appeared in front of Tang San was someone he had met during the day, that Title Douluo with the title of Poison: Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Tang San almost reflexively released his spirit, but in the next instant Dugu Bo had already arrived in front of him, without being seen to move. Tang San only felt a spell of dizziness, then he didn\u2019t feel anything at all.</p><br/><p>But at this moment a spirit power fluctuation roused the not distant Erlong who had just melted into Grandmaster\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong\u2019s eyes flashed, sharply moving out of Grandmaster\u2019s embrace, her gaze shifting in the direction of that spirit power fluctuation. She clearly felt that while the spirit power fluctuation wasn\u2019t strong it contained a terrifying energy, figure flickering, she instantly covered Grandmaster behind her.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was first startled, then immediately following his expression changed greatly,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, it might be related to little San. Quickly go look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong very naturally grabbed Grandmaster\u2019s hand, abruptly accelerating, relying on spirit power to swiftly reach the location. But besides a chill in the air they didn\u2019t find any clues. Liu Erlong pushed her spirit power to search with all her strength, but she was still unable to find Tang San again.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster promptly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, let\u2019s first find Flender. This cold air is somewhat familiar. If it\u2019s that person, I\u2019m afraid it will be difficult to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Grandmaster wasn\u2019t strong, his powers of observation and ability to make snap judgements were far beyond that of ordinary people.</p><br/><p>This trace of cold air immediately made him recall meeting Dugu Bo during the day at Heaven Dou Imperial Academy as well as Dugu Bo later meeting his granddaughter Jade Phosphor Serpent Spirit Master Dugu Yan.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Head spinning, as Tang San awoke from unconsciousness he discovered his surroundings were completely painted black.</p><br/><p>There were only two points of green light that glittered eerily in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Silently urging Mysterious Heaven Skill, spirit power gradually condensed within Tang San\u2019s body, his strength once again returning, but he still didn\u2019t move. Grandmaster had taught him that the more dangerous the circumstances the more you had to keep calm, he absolutely couldn\u2019t let himself end up in a crisis because of acting blindly without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving woken up there\u2019s no need keep pretending. Are you really only thirteen? Your mentality resembles someone more experienced.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hoarse voice came from the side. Along with his eyes adapting to the darkness, Tang San with the help of the two points of dim light could make out Dugu Bo sitting not far to his side, and that those two points of green light were actually Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Turning over and sitting up, Tang San still didn\u2019t speak up, only coldly looking at Dugu Bo. His heart was already ice cold. No need to ask, he already knew Dugu Bo\u2019s reason for kidnapping him: clearly it was Dugu Yan\u2019s revenge. Remaining in the hands of this Poison titled Title Douluo, how could there still be a good ending?</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re called Tang San?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo leaned on the stone wall behind him, calmly asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San replied very simply. He naturally wasn\u2019t resigned to waiting for death, and sitting there he was quietly amassing his spirit power.</p><br/><p>Although he knew that a thirtieth level Spirit Master confronting a more than ninetieth ranked Title Douluo basically didn\u2019t have a chance, if he didn\u2019t at least struggle, how could he be resigned to the result?</p><br/><p>Green light flickered in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard, you broke my granddaughter\u2019s third spirit ring, and even used poison to restrain her. How did you dissolve her snake venom? Just alcohol isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAn old freak like you is known as the Poison Douluo, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t even understand the effect of realgar on snake venom? Realgar mixed into alcohol can completely show the effects of realgar, further adding flame for heat. Even though your granddaughter\u2019s third spirit ring is very poisonous, it\u2019s still unable to resist all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo suddenly made a strange chuckle,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many years, how many years has it been since someone dared talk to me like that? Kid, aren\u2019t you afraid to die? You actually dare doubt an old man\u2019s poison? Don\u2019t you know that even other Title Douluo would change color when talking about my poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San snorted disdainfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour poison? It\u2019s just trash, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Green light suddenly set off in Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes, with just a flick of his hand, Tang San was flung away by an irresistibly powerful force, heavily smashing into the rock wall behind him and almost losing consciousness again from the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, if you dare wag your tongue like that in front of me again, even if your poison interests me, I\u2019ll still immediately kill you. My poison is trash? I can instantly affect every living creature within a kilometer, not even a blade of grass would grow. If I want to kill you I don\u2019t even need to use my hands, I can kill you with poison at once. In this world, there is still no Spirit Master who has been able to compare to me in the poison attribute. You actually dare doubt my poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San struggled to stand up, resisting the pain and straightening his back,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to wag my tongue in front of you? As far as I\u2019m concerned, what\u2019s even the point of that? Your poison is indeed ferocious, but it\u2019s still trash. A poisoner uses poison on his enemies, but you\u2019ve even poisoned yourself, don\u2019t tell me your poison isn\u2019t trash?\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked distracted a moment, he waved his right hand and the entire surrounding cavern immediately lit up with a dark green flames.</p><br/><p>Under the illumination of the green fire, Tang San clearly saw that he was in a round thousand square meter cave. Dugu Bo was dressed the same as during the day, right now simply standing ten meters in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly laughable. I would poison myself? This year I\u2019m seventy eight, and I\u2019ve always only poisoned others, and still never been poisoned by others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked coldly at Tang San. Strangely, this time he didn\u2019t attack.</p><br/><p>Tang San snorted disdainfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then let me ask you, when the sky is overcast and raining, isn\u2019t there an ache over two of your ribs, moreover one that gradually grows stronger, flaring up around noon and midnight? In your current condition, it should persist for two hours or more each time. Also, late every night, approximately around midnight, on top of your head and your heart should have a pricking pain like a pincushion. Your whole body spasming for at least an hour. That kind of pain that makes you wish you were dead doesn\u2019t need my description. If you\u2019re not poisoned, then would you have symptoms like these? You\u2019re not just poisoned, the poisoned has even entered your bone marrow. But what baffles me is how you still haven\u2019t died. The poison within you isn\u2019t something that can be suppressed with spirit power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow-, how do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo no longer held back his shock, speaking subconsciously.</p><br/><p>Tang San described it as if he\u2019d seen it himself, and this could be said to be Dugu Bo\u2019s biggest secret. Even his closest granddaughter didn\u2019t know, so how couldn\u2019t he be startled when now hearing it from Tang San\u2019s mouth? Killing intent flared in his eyes, seeming to pierce Tang San.</p><br/><p>A Title Douluo\u2019s strength really was too powerful, the murderous aura released from Dugu Bo was essentially the same as a strike at Tang San\u2019s chest. Tang San made a retching sound, spouting a mouthful of blood, retreating three steps before with difficulty standing firm. Blue Silver Grass abruptly appeared under the pressure of Dugu Bo\u2019s killing intent, even his external spirit bone Eight Spider Lances immediately unfolded from his back, releasing its terrifying energy to protect Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo had already calmed down, he believed that by relying on his already substantial murderous aura, hitting and killing a mere thirtieth ranked Spirit Master was easily done, he had killed people to silence them more times than he could remember. But he hadn\u2019t expected Tang San would actually be able to stand up to his attack. Even though he spit blood he didn\u2019t seem to have suffered any serious injury. This kind of physique clearly wasn\u2019t something a thirtieth level Spirit Master should possess.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see. This is the spirit that injured my granddaughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s figure flickered, already appearing in front of Tang San as he raised a hand to grab him.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Grass acted automatically. Tang San\u2019s first spirit ring abruptly flared, and the first spirit ability, Binding, activated.</p><br/><p>Tenacious Blue Silver Grass frantically wound around Dugu Bo with all of Tang San\u2019s strength, in just a moment wrapping him up entirely.</p><br/><p>But terrifyingly, those Blue Silver Grass that just now wound about Dugu Bo suddenly melted away like ice and snow.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, they were melting, like snow in a fire, without even pausing. Even to the extent that they didn\u2019t even slow Dugu Bo\u2019s rising hand. The next moment, Dugu Bo\u2019s large hand had already grabbed Tang San\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s hand was firm, holding on to the shoulder like an iron hoop. The Eight Spider Lances on Tang San\u2019s back thrust out practically simultaneously, with sharp sounds of splitting the air piercing at Dugu Bo. Purple light broke out, toxin already activating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo was surprised. At his level of strength, without even meeting the attack, his aura alone was enough to sense that the Eight Spider Lances attack power was far beyond that of Blue Silver Grass. Green light spread from Dugu Bo in a flash, but his spirit still couldn\u2019t be seen. Eight Spider Lances thrust at the green light, but could only cause eight ripples in the dark green light and were unable to penetrate deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that. It was actually an external spirit bone. No wonder, no wonder Yan-yan wasn\u2019t your match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo had a flash of insight, looking at Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances his eyes had an avaricious light.</p><br/><p>An ice cold spirit power transmitted from the big hand on Tang San\u2019s shoulder. Tang San suddenly felt his whole body going numb, unable to amass his spirit power.</p><br/><p>That ice cold stream spread through his body in a moment, just like he had fallen into an ice cellar. Despite Tang San\u2019s astonishing gifts, his strength outstanding among his peers, as well as battle experience and cool head, these were all useless before the absolute gap in strength. Before Dugu Bo\u2019s spirit power, let alone resisting, right now he was even unable to move his little finger.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo clearly also didn\u2019t consider Tang San to be a threat, with a casual motion he threw him to the ground, somewhat disappointed saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s already fused. Otherwise this kid would have brought me a great gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo stared at Tang San with the green light burning in his eyes, as if he was looking at a rare treasure, the greedy light flickered in and out,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to admit that you are much stronger than my granddaughter, and even stronger than that kid Yu Tian-Heng. Thirteen years old, more than thirtieth ranked spirit power, external spirit bone, strong poison. It\u2019s a pity, truly a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the immense gap in strength, Dugu Bo didn\u2019t bother with sealing Tang San\u2019s spirit power, and Tang San once again struggled to crawl up from the floor, coldly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect I would actually die at the hands of an old freak using trash poison. It\u2019s a pity, truly a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes emitted a viper-like ice cold light,</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to kill you on the spot? As far as I\u2019m concerned, killing you is as easy as crushing an ant. However, I won\u2019t be in a hurry to kill you. I\u2019m a bit interested in a spirit bone from a Man Faced Demon Spider, I\u2019ll drain all the poison from your spirit bone, and then I\u2019ll kill you slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes displayed a strong unwillingness. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t have the slightest chance against this old freak even if he used his latest hidden weapons. Going up against an opponent like this was only possible if he could master the top three hidden weapons in Hidden Weapons Hundred Separation, otherwise the outcome would only be death.</p><br/><p>He was unwilling to see Tang Sect\u2019s knowledge die without even mastering it, and even more without transferring Tang Sect poison to this world. He was unwilling because he hadn\u2019t even had the chance to cultivate his second spirit. He was even more reluctant to leave this brightly colorful world than that time at Tang Sect.</p><br/><p>Since coming to this world he had at last come into contact with the outside, and gained far, far too many attachments.</p><br/><p>Seeing the unwillingness in Tang San\u2019s eyes, the old freak couldn\u2019t help but laugh heartily,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot reconciled to it? I\u2019ve seen this kind of expression in countless eyes. What I like the most is strangling this kind of reluctance. Perhaps in a few more decades you truly would be able to surpass me. However, now you won\u2019t have the chance. You say my poison is trash? But you\u2019re still going to die by my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San coolly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my greatest regret. If I had time, even without using my spirit, I could still threaten you. A trash poisoner like you basically isn\u2019t equal to farts. Not only did your own skills put you in misery, but you\u2019ll still leave behind calamity for later generations. Trash among trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo suddenly became agitated, unexpectedly extending an arm in an instant, grabbing Tang San\u2019s neck and pulling him close.</p><br/><p>This time Tang San didn\u2019t even resist at all, only looked coldly at Dugu Bo. Even though it was difficult to even breathe, he still forced out the words:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you will have a good ending? Your symptoms will constantly worsen, even though I still don\u2019t know just how you\u2019ve restrained this toxicity from flaring up, it\u2019s probably by eating some heavenly treasure material. But that heavenly treasure won\u2019t help you forever. Within a few years, even if you\u2019re not killed by poison, the torment of the poison backlash will still torture you to death. You\u2019ll die even more miserably than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Dugu Bo\u2019s eyes flickered a gloomy uncertain light, what Tang San had described were precisely all his greatest pains right now. Behind the formidable strength he endured torment beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Each time that torment made him unable to choose between life and death, that kind of pain basically couldn\u2019t be described with words.</p><br/><p>[1] ()</p><br/><p>[2] An infant name refers to a nickname used before a proper name has been decided on. \u201cErlong\u201d () means \u201cSecond Dragon\u201d, probably used since Luomian is the second son of the dragon clan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

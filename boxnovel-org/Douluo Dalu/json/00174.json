I still have to think it over carefully. As for that, even though this thing of yours is attractive, it\u2019s still not that powerful. After all, we rely on defensive power to protect ourselves. However, to the Speed Clan, this thing is quite useful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s words were like a meticulous jab at Tang San. Tang San was intelligent, and immediately understood his meaning. The Speed Clan\u2019s main ability was speed, there was no need to doubt their superiority in speed. But at the same time, because of the single attribute, even if they had speed, they really were rather weak in other areas. With speed, they could dodge instead of block, but what about attacking? Even though speed and force were directly related, the boost to attack power was still limited.</p><br/><p>If the Speed Clan\u2019s speed was matched with the attack power of hidden weapons, it would undoubtedly substantially increase their overall strength. Moreover, among all the four single attribute clans, it was the Speed Clan whose fortunes were worst. Niu Gao\u2019s meaning seemed to be, rather than roping in their Defense Clan, it would be better to make plans for the Speed Clan.</p><br/><p>Just when Tang San was pondering the deep meaning within Niu Gao\u2019s words, a Defense Clan clansman hastily entered from outside, quickly stepping over to Niu Gao, leaning over to whisper a few words by his ear.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Niu Gao couldn\u2019t keep his expression fro changing,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did they come to do? Old orangutan, the Elephant Armored School\u2019s people came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao stood, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Elephant Huyan Zhen came personally. I have to give him some face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fine. I\u2019ll go with you to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the two both getting up, the younger generation naturally followed. Tang San wasn\u2019t conceited about his own position, following the two clan chiefs alongside Tai Long and Ma Hongjun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at the courtyard, everyone\u2019s gazes were immediately drawn to those five enormous bodies. The leader was past his seventh decade, and at a visual estimate, he was at least two and a half meters tall. He stood there like a mountain of meat. Dark skin, a pair of large eyes like copper bells. His dark skin seemed to have a particular luster. This was the Elephant Armored School master, Heavenly Elephant Huyan Zhen.</p><br/><p>The four people following behind Huyan Zhen also seemed past sixty, their builds only slightly inferior to Huyan Zhen. Each and every one were reserved, and the five people standing there were like five large mountains, their might impressive.</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen was clearly familiar with Niu Gao from before, and seeing Niu Gao lead everyone out, he immediately laughed loudly, stepping forward to meet them with large strides,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Niu, we haven\u2019t met for some time. How is it, have you been well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao returned the politeness with a somewhat skin deep smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to luck, my body is still healthy. I don\u2019t know for what errand the noble Heavenly Elephant graces us with his presence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen laughed loudly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Niu, this definitely isn\u2019t right, don\u2019t tell me you won\u2019t invite a brother to sit and chat? Oh, this old brother\u2019s stature is so robust, I don\u2019t know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze fell on Tai Tan.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao said calmly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my big brother Tai Tan. We\u2019ll go speak in the drawing room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen\u2019s eyes displayed a trace of astonishment,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s the Strength Clan\u2019s boss, old brother Tai Tan. Just in time, this saves me another trip to Heaven Dou City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San coolly watched from the side, inwardly he had some speculations as to the reasons for Huyan Zhen\u2019s visit.</p><br/><p>Entering the drawing room, everyone separately sat as hosts and guests. Tang San very naturally stood behind Tai Tan, without sitting down. In front of the Elephant Armored School, he still didn\u2019t want to reveal his identity. Consequently, only the two clan chiefs and that Heavenly Elephant were qualified to sit in the drawing room.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao ordered people to serve tea. With difficulty squeezing out a smile, he asked Heavenly Elephant Huyan Zhen:</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Huyan, say it straight. Everyone are aching to get on with it. You wouldn\u2019t visit the temple without cause!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen wasn\u2019t particularly polite either. Even though Tai Tan\u2019s appearance ruined his plans to some extent, that still couldn\u2019t block him from reaching his purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou old brothers should have heard it. The Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan was destroyed, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School seriously injured. The three upper sects of the seven great sects only exist in name. And the current Spirit Hall Supreme Pontiff has already issued a decree, to hold an assembly to select a new seven great sects in one year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that related to us? My tiny Defense Clan naturally doesn\u2019t have the strength to go fight over this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen laughed loudly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide it old brother, little brother has some plans for this reselection assembly. What I\u2019m talking about this time, is to seize a position among the three upper sects. That\u2019s the reason for this visit, I hope to obtain big brother\u2019s support! If our Elephant Armored School joined hands with your Defense Clan, in the Spirit Master world, who could contend with us? At least it would be an invincible position. At that time, at Spirit Hall, our position would naturally also rise like the boat with the tide, becoming the overlords of a faction wouldn\u2019t be a problem. As long as brother agrees, the position of Elephant Armored School\u2019s vice school master is yours. Little brother would be on an equal footing with you, how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he heard Huyan Zhen say, the gloomier Niu Gao\u2019s expression became. What he said might sound grand, but the implication was that he would annex the Defense Clan. This was already offending Niu Gao\u2019s bottom line.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld brother Huyan, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten who originally forced us to become like stray dogs? Almost didn\u2019t leave us with room to stand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Niu, that\u2019s already so many years in the past, as they say, there are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests. Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t clearly see Spirit Hall\u2019s strength? In the present world, who can contend with Spirit Hall? With your strength as well as the Defense Clan\u2019s features, as long as we walk the same road, the Defense Clan\u2019s prospects are boundless! You can raise any conditions, as long as little brother can satisfy them, I definitely won\u2019t decline, and even if I can\u2019t satisfy them, there\u2019s still Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s temper finally couldn\u2019t be suppressed, fiercely slapping the table, standing up, angrily saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHuyan Zhen, when did you become such a loyal dog to Spirit Hall? If you want to lick Spirit Hall\u2019s ass, that\u2019s your matter, don\u2019t bring me into it. Our Defense Clan doesn\u2019t have the slightest interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s fury first made Huyan Zhen stare blankly, then his face immediately changed. No matter what was said, he was still one of the seven great sect masters, being cursed at by Niu Gao like this, where did he still have any face left? While standing up, forceful light flashed in his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cNiu Gao, I called you big brother out of respect, that\u2019s giving you face. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t see the fall of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan? Do you believe your Defense Clan is stronger than them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s voice was called:</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter a broken jade than an intact roof tile. Even if the Clear Sky School let our four single attribute clans down back then, no matter what is said, we still relied on the Clear Sky School to grow. We separated from them, but it\u2019s still impossible to cooperate with Spirit Hall. I, Niu Gao, won\u2019t be the dog of Spirit Hall. If you have the skill, you come destroy us, but don\u2019t mouthfart in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen\u2019s face fell like water, a pair of big eyes glinting ominously,</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying so, you won\u2019t give me face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao snorted coldly, imposing manner flourishing all over his body. Equally Spirit Douluo, even if his strength was inferior to Huyan Zhen, in terms of defense, he was even above Diamond Mammoth Spirit Huyan Zhen, only his attack fell far short.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan also slowly stood up to the side, equally overbearing imposing manner erupting from him. In spirit power, he wasn\u2019t inferior to Huyan Zhen. Just that his spirit\u2019s innate talents were lacking.</p><br/><p>In front of the simultaneous pressure of two great Spirit Douluo, even Huyan Zhen\u2019s imposing body couldn\u2019t help swaying a moment. Those four old men who came with him quickly stood behind him, instantly, heavy imposing manner immediately counterattacked. Those four elders were unexpectedly all Spirit Sage level experts, each with strength surpassing the seventieth rank.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao disdainfully curled his lip,</p><br/><p>\u201cHuyan Zhen. If you want to deal with me, I advise you to first bring along the Elephant Armored School\u2019s army, relying on the few of you, still seems insufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huyan Zhen was inwardly gloomy. Before coming, he by far hadn\u2019t expected Great Strength God Tai Tan to be here, otherwise he and the subordinates he brought would have been enough to suppress the Defense Clan. Even though their imposing manner wasn\u2019t weaker than Niu Gao\u2019s side, this was still the Defense Clan\u2019s territory, and it would be very difficult to get the outcome he desired.</p><br/><p>Malicious light flashing in his eyes, Huyan Zhen coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Niu Gao, our blue mountains don\u2019t change. As green water flows, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll meet again. I hope you\u2019ll still be able to speak to me with such confidence when we meet next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Huyan Zhen turned and brought his four clansmen away.</p><br/><p>Along with the departure of the Elephant Armored School\u2019s five people, Niu Gao and Tai Tan\u2019s chilling demeanors gradually faded. Niu Gao\u2019s face had already turned extremely unsightly. Fiercely swinging a hand, with a loud explosion, the wooden table next to him turned to splinters.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always hidden in such a remote place as Rising Dragon City, but they still won\u2019t let us off. Those Spirit Hall bastards, what are they all up to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deterrence. Every person with eyes knows who was behind what happened to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan. But, who can do anything about them? Spirit Hall also paid an enormous price to attack these two great sects, and from their point of view, there actually aren\u2019t that many advantages. But what\u2019s important is the deterring effect. The Clear Sky School is sealed, the other two of the upper three sects destroyed. Spirit Hall\u2019s intention is to tell everyone that there is none who can oppose them. Even if doing so raises the vigilance of the two great empires. However, Spirit Hall\u2019s own strength has also already matured. With so many kingdoms and duchies as their puppets, they wouldn\u2019t even fear an actual war. Under the effect of such deterrence, some small sects that originally intended to keep watch and wait basically don\u2019t have any choice, and can only attach themselves to Spirit Hall to exist. Like this, as long as Spirit Hall\u2019s seven great sects reselection assembly ends smoothly in one year, the seven great sects will all be under their control. Then, the Continent will perhaps really be the world of Spirit Hall in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s current mood was very calm, clearly analysing the situation,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many are like senior Niu, fearless of force? Very, very few. When the seven great sect struggle ends, Spirit Hall will no longer be low key, they\u2019re bound to stand in front to challenge the two great empires. Even to the extent that they will take the initiative to invade. With the number of powers held by Spirit Hall, if there\u2019s war, the two great empires will inevitably be at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, Tang San changed the subject,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to establish the Tang Sect, besides my own selfish motives, is in the hopes of as far as possible stopping such a situation from appearing. Even though there are a lot of high level Spirit Masters in the world, the absolute majority are still low level Spirit Masters. Spirit Hall controls tens of thousands of low level Spirit Masters, so the greatest threat to the two great empires is as a mob. That\u2019s an almost unparallelled army. You\u2019ve seen our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapons. If we mass produced them, providing enough to the two imperial governments, at least the two great empires would still have the strength to fight on the true battlefield. Spirit Hall is after all a religious organisation, and the two great empires haven\u2019t existed for just a day or two. Who will win and who will lose is still very difficult to tell. Even though I know senior can\u2019t forget about the Clear Sky School abandoning you back then, you can\u2019t deny the Clear Sky School\u2019s reputation as first under heaven. If there\u2019s a deadlock between Spirit Hall and the two great empires, do you believe the Clear Sky School wouldn\u2019t use such an opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can tell you a secret. The Clear Sky School\u2019s twenty year seal hasn\u2019t been wasted. Even if there aren\u2019t a lot of people, they\u2019re all experts. There are more than six powers of the Title Douluo level. You should understand the meaning of Title Douluo with the Clear Sky Hammer spirit. As for who can obtain the final victory with the Continent in chaos, I believe the Clear Sky School\u2019s existence will be an enormous influence. If our plan can succeed, then our Tang Sect\u2019s influence absolutely won\u2019t be less than the Clear Sky School. I can guarantee senior in advance, the Tang Sect will never be incorporated into the Clear Sky School. Tang Sect is Tang Sect. Independent of any Spirit Master groups. We only gather together, produce hidden weapons. A group defending our autonomy. So much that we won\u2019t even be a Spirit Master sect. Senior Niu Gao, junior sincerely invites you to join the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect absolutely won\u2019t restrict the Defense Clan, all the Defense Clan clansmen will still be under your control. If the time comes that you believe the Tang Sect doesn\u2019t suit you, then you can lead the Defense Clan to depart at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hide it from you, right now only the Strength Clan has joined the Tang Sect, as well as me, Fatty as well as two other comrades. Even if you can\u2019t trust me, don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t trust senior Tai Tan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Tang San started to speak, his words had drawn Niu Gao\u2019s interest. Thoroughly analysing, using true words as invitation, without many promises, but each of his words sounded very true to Niu Gao\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>This was all the capability Tang San had learned from his aunt in the Moon Pavilion. That year might have seemed a waste, but in fact, Tang San had learned a lot of principles for dealing with people from there. Tang Yue-Hua always said that strength wasn\u2019t everything in the current world. Wielding existing strength, and further adding the ability to handle people, that was a true power.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan also listened carefully to Tang San\u2019s words, the smile on his face gradually growing stronger. He was of course very familiar with Niu Gao\u2019s character, and Tang San\u2019s choice of timing to speak was just perfect. Even though Niu Gao had shown a strong front to Huyan Zhen, that was only because Hyan Zhen had offended his bottom line. As a clan chief, would he really not care about the survival of the clan? The answer was inevitably negative.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s expression was somewhat uncertain, studying Tang San for a long time without speaking. Right now not just they were in the great hall. Ma Hongjun, Tai long, Niu Ben were also here. Niu Ben now understood Tang San\u2019s true purpose in coming here. Hearing him speak, he also simultaneously sank into contemplation, clearly weighing the pros and cons.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan patted Niu Gao\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore coming here, I already had Tai Nuo start buying up some surrounding properties. Preparing to expand the mansion. I remember in those days I still had your help when building the mansion, this time I will perhaps still have to trouble you. Us brothers have always been separated in two different empires these years, I truly cherish the memories of those days when we every day drank wine and ate meat. I\u2019m not urging you to join the Tang Sect because of that, only, old rhino, do you want to make this gamble along with me? If our gamble fails, big brother can absolutely tell you, my Strength Clan will definitely be ruined before your Defense Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao looked at Tai Tan, their eyes meeting, and he sharply waved his hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Hall\u2019s bullying is intolerable, fine, old orangutan, I\u2019ll follow you for this bet. Tang San, remember your words today, no matter what happens in the future, us and the Clear Sky School will never have any relation again. This is our bottom line. As long as what you do is to everyone\u2019s benefit, my Defense Clan will support you unconditionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wore a smile, watching Niu Gao with a steadfast gaze, without saying anything, only forcefully nodding to him.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan laughed out loud, spreading both arms to Niu Gao,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy good brother, welcome to the Tang Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao also smiled simultaneously, forcefully hugging Tai Tan,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll continue drinking. Just now we let that old brat Huyan Zhen bother us, we can\u2019t let that ruin our mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again seated at the table, the atmosphere had clearly changed. The slight hostility hidden in Niu Gao\u2019s gaze as he looked at Tang San had vanished completely. He was always an optimistic person. Since it was already decided, he wouldn\u2019t regret it.</p><br/><p>The wine made three rounds, and Tai Tan slightly intoxicated said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld rhino, do you know why I promised young master to establish this Tang Sect with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao\u2019s capacity for wine was about the same as Tai Tan\u2019s. Tai Tan was somewhat drunk, naturally he wasn\u2019t much better of.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides those hidden weapons making my heart beat, even more important is the young master. Young master\u2019s twenty, how can he possess his present accomplishments? Now I can tell you too. Five years ago. Do you know about the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI seem to have heard of it. Our clan also have some children that followed some academy to participate, their achievement wasn\u2019t up to much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan laughed out loud, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this you aren\u2019t my equal. Tai Long, this brat, was a member of the final champion team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao was inwardly alarmed, even his tipsy feeling retreating a bit, looking at Tai Tan;</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat was so outstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>The status of the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament was fairly high in the Spirit Master world. It was the best stage for the young generation of Spirit Masters to reveal themselves. Each academy member that could obtain an outstanding achievement were all targets that great sects tripped over each other to recruit.</p><br/><p>Niu Ben forcefully clapped Tai Long\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, kid! Uncle didn\u2019t see you were so tremendous. I heard that the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament that time was the most epic in the last several decades. The level of the competing Spirit Masters were all considerably high. Especially Spirit Hall, who sent that trio of youths called the Golden Generation to lead their team. But in the end they were defeated by a dark horse. I didn\u2019t expect you would be a member of that team. let me think, ah, right, it was called something like Shrek Academy, yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Long somewhat embarrassed said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Niu Ben, don\u2019t exaggerate. Even if I counted as a member of the team, I was only a substitute. In the last key competition, I didn\u2019t take the field. The reason our team could defeat Spirit Hall\u2019s Golden Generation, is all young master\u2019s contribution. Young master was not only the vice captain, but also the soul of the team. In the final battle, it was he who single handedly blocked the spirit fusion ability of the Golden Generation siblings, creating the conditions for victory. Finally pulling strongly against the tide, making us the champions. At that time young master\u2019s spirit power was forty something ranked, Spirit Hall\u2019s Golden Generation all over fiftieth ranked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of that battle back then, Tai Long couldn\u2019t help revealing an intense worship in his eyes. He had personally seen the entire fight, and even now he couldn\u2019t forget Tang San\u2019s heroism on the field.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun wasn\u2019t as calm as Tang San. Grinning, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI was also in the main force! Tai Long, why don\u2019t you praise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Long laughed out loud, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Fatty was also in the main force. He was also stronger than me. Your spirit is the phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>When father and son Niu Gao and Niu Ben heard Tai Long\u2019s words, they couldn\u2019t keep their expressions from changing somewhat. Tai Tan smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you understand my meaning. Young master\u2019s excellence even makes Spirit Hall jealous. His future prospects are boundless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao frowned, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe win will definitely break the tallest tree, don\u2019t tell me Spirit Hall wouldn\u2019t have such thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan grinned:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry about that. First not speaking about whether Spirit Hall could find young master, along with young master\u2019s strength rising, he had one spirit awaken a second time, leading to huge changes in his appearance and demeanor. People who knew him before don\u2019t recognize him when face to face. Moreover, in Heaven Dou City, even if someone wished young master harm, that still wouldn\u2019t be so easy. Our Tang Sect is established in secret, and also won\u2019t go join the struggles between Spirit Master sects, we\u2019re only secretly building our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what is said, afterwards we\u2019re also a grasshopper on a string. After this gathering is over, I\u2019ll go eat your food and drink your wine. Humph humph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish, there\u2019s enough. Anyway, hereafter the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School will support the Tang Sect financially. With the skill you eat until they\u2019re poor. Their sect is broken, but their wealth hasn\u2019t waned. That is indeed the richest sect under heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao stared blankly a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel more and more like this Tang Sect of ours has some prospects. Since it\u2019s like this, it would be better if we also pulled the Speed Clan along. Their days have been very sad. Always receiving our material assistance. Since the finances aren\u2019t a problem, and Tang San can even talk me into it, I think the old whitebird wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow most dislikes other people calling him old bird, be careful about his temper! Only, we can consider how to lure him. The two of us are both in the Tang Sect, with him it\u2019ll be even more lively.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two wicked old men immediately began to excitedly talk in low voices. Tang San could naturally hear what they said, and for a moment he couldn\u2019t help feeling a chill down his back. So when people got old, they wouldn\u2019t be disturbed by sinister thoughts. Of course, their purpose was still benevolent.</p><br/><p>Judging by how it had gone so far, everything was better than anticipated. Only one area made somewhat worried, the Breaking Clan. Judging by how Tai Tan and Niu Gao hadn\u2019t mentioned them at all, clearly that wasn\u2019t an easily convinced clansman. Due to losing more than half the clan from Spirit Hall\u2019s attack, their hatred for the Clear Sky Clan was naturally the strongest. Moreover, they were also the one clan of the four single attribute clans that made the best living. What ways could move them in the end?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Next evening, still one day from the time of the four single attribute clan gathering, the Speed Clan arrived.</p><br/><p>The Speed Clan fully brought more than ten people. Niu Gai and Tai Tan went out to meet them together, and Tang San, Ma Hongjun and Tai Long also followed behind.</p><br/><p>Counting carefully, Tang San discovered that the Speed Clan had brought altogether twelve people, the old man leading them was slim, but seemed extremely well proportioned. His long hair hung across his back, but it was already snow white. If not for his face being as rosy as an infant\u2019s, he would seem even older than Tai Tan and Niu Gao. But Tang San knew that he was really a year younger than Niu Gao. His spirit power was also around the eighty first or eight second rank. That was also the Speed Clan\u2019s clan chief, Bai He[1].</p><br/><p>Actually, the Speed Clan\u2019s spirit wasn\u2019t a crane, crane\u2019s didn\u2019t fly fast. The reason why they walked the road of speed was also greatly related to their spirit. Because the Speed Clan\u2019s spirit was a bird with the fastest flight speed, called the Needle-Tailed Swift[2]. It was possessing such a spirit that led the Speed Clan down their cultivation route.</p><br/><p>Following next to Bai He was a young woman about the same age as Tang San and Ma Hongjun. The young woman was tall and well proportioned, extremely beautiful. Even if she was a bit thin, her appearance was only slightly inferior to Xiao Wu, Zhu Zhuqing and the others. The expression in her eyes seemed somewhat proud, holding Bai He\u2019s arm, her beautiful eyes looked around hopefully, seemingly very interested in everything around her.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun took one look at this young woman, and his eyes immediately straightened. He never had any resistance to beautiful women. Secretly swallowing, he stared fixedly at her without blinking, as if about to eat her.</p><br/><p>The young woman very soon sensed Ma Hongjun\u2019s gaze, shooting him a look. Turning her head, her beautiful eyes just fell on Tang San. However, what she looked at wasn\u2019t Tang San\u2019s handsome appearance, but rather Xiao Wu in his arms. Xiao Wu\u2019s fur shone like silver, even starting to turn gold at the roots, further with the power she spread, her chubby body seeming extremely cute, she was a fatal killing blow at least to young women.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, old orangutan, I knew you\u2019d definitely be here long ago. It really is so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He laughed loudly and went to greet them, the three elders forcefully hugging.</p><br/><p>However, Bai He clearly felt that Tai Tan and Niu Gao\u2019s expressions were somewhat awkward. It seemed as if they meticulously kept their distance, and when hugging he didn\u2019t get the feeling they were honestly happy.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao looked at the young woman next to Bai He,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiangxiang came too. Let\u2019s go, we\u2019ll speak inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s subordinates naturally had the Defense Clan\u2019s people\u2019s arrangements, and he brought the charming young woman to follow Tai Tan and Niu Gao into the drawing room with doubts in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cTea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao shouted, his expression appearing a bit more unsightly. To the side, Tai Tan also hung his head without speaking.</p><br/><p>Bai He frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you two old fellows? Such anxious expressions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao smiled bitterly:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only just arrived, we shouldn\u2019t speak to you about it. But you also know I can\u2019t keep words to myself. Old whitebird, in the future we might not be able to help you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s heart shivered, him bringing so many people this time wasn\u2019t just for prestige. The Speed Clan\u2019s days really weren\u2019t easy. The entire clan, from clan chief Bai He and down, everyone were proud, they always believed their Swift Spirit was extremely noble. That\u2019s why they never agreed to join any sect. Coming this time, he originally planned to accept some assistance of the other three clans, supporting his clan. This had also become a tradition among the four clans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s heart steadied a bit, and asked.</p><br/><p>Niu Gao sighed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the Elephant Armored School. Yesterday Huyan Zhen that fellow came. He came to enlist my clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOn behalf of Spirit hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now he couldn\u2019t even pay attention to Niu Gao calling him that name he disliked.</p><br/><p>Noi Gao nodded wordlessly.</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s brows wrinkled,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld rhino, you wouldn\u2019t have agreed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Gao snorted coldly,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would that be possible? Even if my Defense Clan was destroyed, I still wouldn\u2019t be Spirit Hall\u2019s dog. Only, I refused them, I\u2019m afraid the Elephant Armored School will retaliate. As for when, nobody can say. Therefore, I\u2019ve decided to migrate the clan. Leave for Heaven Dou City, mixing with old orangutan. You also know, going to the old orangutan\u2019s place, reopening business there, raising income, it\u2019ll take time. Even the Strength Clan\u2019s support is like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood for our two clans. Not enough. Therefore, this time, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He\u2019s expression clearly seemed a bit artificial. Shaking his head, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Over these years, without your support, I\u2019m afraid our Speed Clan would long since have ceased to exist. Now that your Defense Clan is in difficulties, I\u2019m already very sorry I can\u2019t help. How can I still ask for resources. I\u2019ll think of a way myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the drawing room became somewhat depressed, the three clan chiefs didn\u2019t speak up again. Niu Gao and Tai Tan glanced at each other and both saw the smile at the corners of each others\u2019 eyes, and hastily rearranged their own facial expressions.</p><br/><p>After a long silence, Tai Tan said to Bai He:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld whitebird, I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Tang San\u2019s turn.</p><br/><p>Bai He looked somewhat blankly at Tai Tan. Tai Tan indicated Tang San to the side, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little brother is a swiftly rising genius of a generation in the world of forging. He\u2019s made some hidden weapons, I\u2019ve taken a look, and they seem very suitable for your Speed Clan. I let him follow me so you could take a look. Little San.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San petted the already fast asleep Xiao Wu, first putting her inside the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, then once again pulled out the heroic workhorse Godly Zhuge Crossbow from his chest, walking over and handing it to Bai He with both hands.</p><br/><p>Bai He took it with several questions, and the eyes of the young woman at his side were immediately filled with curiosity as she looked at the unassuming black box.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t wait for him to ask, taking the initiative to say:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is called Godly Zhuge Crossbow, forty eight crossbow bolts are hidden inside, including the crossbow bolts, all of it is made from refined iron. Each time the mechanism on top is wound, it can instantly shoot sixteen crossbow bolts from the holes in front, tyrannically powerful. It can break defensive spirit abilities of the fortieth rank and below, and the crossbow bolts are furthermore poisoned. If used to sneak attack before the opponent raises his defense, even fiftieth and sixtieth level Spirit Masters will find it very difficult to escape. If matched with your noble clan\u2019s speed, it\u2019s might can inevitably increase enormously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai He was shocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying this thing can break defensive spirit abilities of the fortieth rank and below? You\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sitting at the head, Niu Gao said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI already tried it last night. What he says isn\u2019t a bit exaggerated. I heard that this thing is still only the basic version Godly Zhuge Crossbow, and it can still be provided with even stronger crossbow bolts. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] Bai He - () \u201cWhite Crane\u201d, thus all the references to white birds.</p><br/><p>[2] Needle-Tailed Swift - () literally \u201cneedle tailed rain swallow\u201d or white-throated needle tail, while other raptors might beat them in diving speed, the needle-tailed swift holds the record in vertical flight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

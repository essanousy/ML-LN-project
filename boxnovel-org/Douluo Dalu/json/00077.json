One of you is captain and the other the director, you think of something. Actually, I feel level isn\u2019t a major issue, the crux is that our team has two Support Spirit Masters. This might improve you others\u2019 strength as a whole, but at the same time we have one less fighter than other teams. We\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might not be at a disadvantage, you\u2019re forgetting about Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, eh, no, now it should be Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. She already has her third three spirit ability, that\u2019s another ten percent support for us overall, furthermore there\u2019s still a type of amplification, enough to counteract the gap in numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>While listening to Xiao Wu mention Ning Rongrong, Oscar couldn\u2019t help but show a strange expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong left yesterday morning, I don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back. I fear her family won\u2019t let her return. She\u2019s after all a girl, and so young at that, I\u2019m afraid her father won\u2019t be at ease. Rongrong\u2019s father has a daughter like her, perhaps she will be the heir of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Oscar, Tang San and Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t help looking distracted a moment. Xiao Wu said:</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlikely. If Rongrong doesn\u2019t return, then won\u2019t our Shrek Seven Devils be one person short?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said with a wry smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cWho can say for sure? Of course I also want her back. Xiao Wu, you and Rongrong have always shared a room. Do you think I have any chance when chasing her? If there isn\u2019t a bit of hope I\u2019d cut short my own notions as soon as possible to save greater pain later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu stuck out her tongue, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go talking to me about this. Rongrong also never talked to me about it. However, I think she definitely has a good impression of you. But I still can\u2019t talk about feelings. You\u2019ll have to ask her yourself! You\u2019re a big boy, there\u2019s nothing to be scared of. Won\u2019t it be alright if you ask clearly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If she returns this time, I\u2019ll definitely ask her. I\u2019ll take advantage of us being young to possess her. Otherwise, once we\u2019ve left the Academy I might have even less of a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you calling \u2018possessing\u2019? Sounds really unpleasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu snapped at him with a glare.</p><br/><p>Oscar had recovered his customary smile by now, and it had to be said that after he\u2019d shaved, his appearance was unequalled. Even Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t help go stupid, inwardly cursing, \u2018Die sissy\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you calling unpleasant to hear? Even if you won\u2019t say it, you\u2019ve already done it yourself long ago! Don\u2019t tell me you dare say you haven\u2019t taken possession of Tang San?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu furtively glanced at Tang San at her side, just in time to meet Tang San\u2019s gaze. Hurriedly she turned her eyes away,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t talk nonsense, let\u2019s go eat quickly, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Academy naturally shared one dining hall, and even though the three were very early, there were already some early students eating breakfast.</p><br/><p>When Tang San entered the dining hall he clearly felt the atmosphere was somewhat odd. All the gazes of the students looking at him were extremely strange. Some reverent, some envious, some admiring, and still a lot of other things.</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San seemed very unremarkable standing next to Oscar, the students in the dining hall didn\u2019t pay Oscar any attention. Especially the female students. If Xiao Wu had to describe it, these female students were clearly making eyes.</p><br/><p>After all, this was an Advanced Spirit Master Academy. Each student was a Spirit Master. Moreover they were at least twenty years old. A Spirit Master\u2019s target for spouse would for the most part be a Spirit Master. In the Spirit Master world, strength was the source of everything. Appearance basically didn\u2019t count for anything in comparison. Appearance was only innate, but formidable strength was in the end very rare, requiring constant effort as well as innate talent.</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San had depended a lot on luck in yesterday\u2019s battle, he had still defeated a fifty eighth rank Spirit King. His own strength had also reached the thirty seventh ranked, making him a well known figure in the entire Academy. How couldn\u2019t he arouse the attention of other students?</p><br/><p>Right now, if it wasn\u2019t for Xiao Wu at Tang San\u2019s side being too beautiful, as well as her fiercely warning gaze at her peers, perhaps there would already be female students hitting on him.</p><br/><p>Tang San simply swept his eyes across their surroundings, his expression very quickly recovering to normal. His attitude wasn\u2019t just that of a thirteen or fourteen year old child, so naturally he wouldn\u2019t be influenced by the outside world. The three bought breakfast and sat down in a corner facing the windows.</p><br/><p>While Oscar ate he lowered his voice to say to Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t eat breakfast together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar didn\u2019t hide his envy a bit,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed all the schoolgirls are looking at you? As if they\u2019re itching to eat you. You should know that when you aren\u2019t here, these gazes are all on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu pouted,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou skirt-chaser, turn your head and I\u2019ll tell Rongrong. Eating from the pan and still gazing at the pot. Don\u2019t tell me you still want to seduce women?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s face twitched, and he hastily adopted a deadpan expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, don\u2019t do something that can\u2019t be taken back, if you talk drivel in front of Rongrong, take care big brother doesn\u2019t talk drivel about you. How am I seducing women? I only look at girls with a certain appreciation. Besides, they can\u2019t compare to my Rongrong. My Rongrong is a heavenly beauty. Only, everyone has vanity, as a man how can\u2019t I hope for the attention of women my age?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu snorted unhappily, poking Tang San at her side,</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, do you hope for the attention of other girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San basically didn\u2019t seem to notice the signals Oscar gave him, and immediately shook his head saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to go looking for trouble for myself. Just take a look at Mubai and Zhuqing. If it wasn\u2019t for Mubai having all those girlfriends, maybe Zhuqing wouldn\u2019t always act like that towards him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San say this, Xiao Wu was immediately proud of herself, looking down her nose in Oscar\u2019s direction,</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, my Ge isn\u2019t as filthy as you. You\u2019re a vulgar Big Sausage Uncle, my Ge is a clear as ice and clean as jade Thousand Hands Asura.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 Xiao Wu, just eat breakfast, don\u2019t make me spit out my food, alright. Is \u2018clear as ice and clean as jade\u2019 used to describe men?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu giggled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what description should be used? Untainted by even a speck of dust?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar immediately raised the rice bowl in his hands,</p><br/><p>\u201cReally can\u2019t stand it, shouldn\u2019t I change places. Xiao Wu, you really are your Ge\u2019s most fanatic worshipper. Perhaps you\u2019d even say his farts are fragrant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu angrily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fart, some people are trying to eat. Watch it or I\u2019ll give you a Waist Bow, send you flying through the window.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, you scare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar again put down the rice bowl on the table, asking Tang San in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, little San, how did you train Xiao Wu to be so hell bent on you? Teach me a bit, alright? If Rongrong could be like this with me, I could truly die happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shot him a glance, swallowing a mouthful of food,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one word: Sincerity. If you let others feel you treat them with sincerity, then others might treat you the same way. Actually, little Ao, you might not think so, but I can see that Rongrong treats you a bit differently than us. I discovered that when we left Star Dou Great Forest. You must work much harder. Chasing after Rongrong can\u2019t be so simple, behind her is after all the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Besides having her treat you well, you still have to increase your own strength as far as possible, this way you can gain the approval of Rongrong\u2019s family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar nodded earnestly,</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, this is a very constructive suggestion. I will consider it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, is Tang San here?\u201d</p><br/><p>While the three were eating and chatting, suddenly several Shrek Academy students came running in from the outside, shouting and screaming as they entered the dining hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly, he definitely didn\u2019t know these students. To be precise, at the Shrek Academy, besides the other Shrek Seven Devils, he only knew Tai Long who had fought with him yesterday.</p><br/><p>The students running into the hall very quickly caught sight of Tang San and immediately ran over without hesitating, the student in front yelling loudly:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, quick, go see quickly. Tai Long and the others are back again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked distracted a moment, unable to keep a trace of anger from rising within,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? They\u2019re still not done? Tai Long\u2019s father came here again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was resigned to another battle, he was himself afraid he would be able to win over Vigorous King Tai Nuo. But don\u2019t forget that now he had Oscar at his side, he only needed Oscar to provide him with flying mushrooms to be able to utilize the greatest advantage of his hidden weapons. Once Tai Nuo was poisoned, then victory was still his. The greatest flaw of strength type Spirit Masters was speed and attack range, as long as he could grasp this part they weren\u2019t scary. To be precise, strength type Spirit Masters could best display their power in large scale battles.</p><br/><p>The students came running over to Tang San, their expressions extremely grotesque. The leader said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Tai Long\u2019s father that came, this time even his grandfather is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu and Oscar cried out in one voice.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Tai Long\u2019s duel was after all only an internal conflict between two Academy students, even though Tai Long hadn\u2019t been lightly beaten, Tang San had still started off leniently, at least not causing him any permanent injury. After defeating Tai Nuo yesterday he had also immediately helped with detoxification. Even though Tai Nuo\u2019s loss wasn\u2019t small, it still wasn\u2019t a matter of deep hatred and great regret.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched slightly, and he turned to Xiao Wu at his side:</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, go find vice dean Zhao Wuji. Little Ao, let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender and Liu Erlong had both followed Grandmaster and Dai Mubai to hunt spirit beasts. With them gone, the Academy affairs would naturally fall on the vice dean from Shrek Academy, and also presently the strongest at the Academy, Motionless Bright King Zhao Wuji.</p><br/><p>Even though a Spirit Master\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t necessarily proportional to their age, from Tai Long\u2019s family\u2019s inherited spirit Tang San guessed that Tai Long\u2019s grandfather very possibly was a power, possibly even surpassing the seventieth rank. He wouldn\u2019t stand any chance against a seventieth ranked opponent. This had to be settled by the teachers. At the same time Tang San also wanted to see just what Tai Long\u2019s family was up to. Could it really be that their actions were directed at him?</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu left swiftly, while Tang San and Oscar left the dining hall in a crowd of students, quickly leaving together in the direction of the Academy gate. In the dining hall was a lot of students who still hadn\u2019t finished their breakfast but couldn\u2019t stand eating, thinking that watching the event was even more important.</p><br/><p>Outside of the Shrek Academy gate, Tai Long and Tai Nuo stood to either side of an old man. This elder had grizzled hair and beard, the short hair standing out like steel needles at the top of his head. His stature appeared about the same as Vigorous King Tai Nuo, only his expression was even more abstruse. Standing there he gave people a kind of not angry but forceful impression. From the reverence in Tai Long and Tai Nuo\u2019s eyes as they looked at him, could be seen just what kind of position this old man had in their family.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, I beg of you, go back. If it goes on like this I really won\u2019t be able to show myself at the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Long entreated his grandfather with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>That old man standing there between him and Tai Nuo was indeed his grandfather, Tai Tan[1]. He was also the clan head.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan held his hands behind his back, shooting a cold glance at his grandson,</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>With just these two words he had completely forced down Tai Long.</p><br/><p>Let alone Tai Long, even Tai Nuo didn\u2019t understand why this grandfather absolutely insisted on following them to Shrek Academy today. After returning yesterday Tai Nuo hadn\u2019t dared conceal anything and explained the whole matter. The result he had obtained was a slap to the face from grandfather Tai Tan and loss of face.</p><br/><p>At first light this morning, Tai Long and Tai Nuo had both prepared to sleep a while since their injuries hadn\u2019t fully recovered, but had been dragged up by grandfather and directly brought to the Academy. Grandfather hadn\u2019t told them what he was up to, but even Tai Nuo could only keep quiet in front of his overbearing manner.</p><br/><p>Tai Nuo understood very clearly that this father of his wasn\u2019t someone with a good temper, that nature of shielding one\u2019s mistakes was even more difficult to deal with than his own. It was very possible he would do something impulsive. Originally, if it weren\u2019t for this, then his clan wouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u2026 Thinking of this, Tai Nuo couldn\u2019t help secretly sighing, in his heart praying that grandfather wouldn\u2019t be too rash. After all, that Tang San was only a teenaged child. Grandfather wouldn\u2019t be too serious with him.</p><br/><p>Right then was when Tang San and Oscar walked out from the Academy in a crowd of other students.</p><br/><p>The moment Tang San first saw grandfather Tai Tan, he couldn\u2019t keep his heart from contracting. Purple Demon Eye upgrading to the mustard seed level allowed him to see not only what was on the surface, in one glance he could see that this grandfather was perhaps even more difficult to deal with than he had imagined. Even though he was alone, standing there he resembled a towering mountain, immovable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Tang San?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan asked indifferently. Even though his voice was somewhat aged, it still gave people a kind of sonorous feeling. That wording brimming with force seemed to make even the air in the surroundings vibrate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San unhurriedly stepped forward, at the same time pushing the spirit power within his body to its peak condition, prepared to adapt to any situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday it was you who injured my son and grandson?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded once,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to explain more. From his point of view, when such a formidable Spirit Master as this came to look for him over such a matter, his explanations wouldn\u2019t hold any significance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>A light suddenly flashed in Tai Tan\u2019s eyes, and an incomparably forceful feeling abruptly erupted from his body. Tai Nuo and Tai Long standing at his side couldn\u2019t endure and were both simultaneously pushed back four or five steps before they could stand steady. Including Tang San and Oscar, all the Shrek Academy students collectively recoiled a step. The atmosphere became thick like liquid in this instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou injuring my son and grandson is all because of their lack of skill. But my One Strength Clan[2] isn\u2019t so incompetent. As the big I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of the small, so how about we make a bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked straight at the counterpart,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan casually waved his hand, and a stick of incense flew out from his sleeve, flying ten meters straight like an arrow to nail into the not distant Academy gate, the stick of incense simultaneously igniting.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, the Shrek students couldn\u2019t help simultaneously cry out in alarm, even Oscar couldn\u2019t keep from cursing inwardly, \u2018Fuck me.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Academy gate was actually cast from pure iron, how much more frail was a stick of incense? Relying only on strength throwing a stick of incense more than ten meters to pierce the gate, without any damage to the stick of incense, what kind of strength was this?</p><br/><p>Tang San saw even more than others. The reason that stick of incense ignited wasn\u2019t because it had been lit in advance, but because it had travelled too fast and ignited from the friction with the air, but only his Purple Demon Eye was keen enough to catch this minute detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t attack, I also won\u2019t release my spirit. As long as you can endure the pressure I release until this stick of incense has burnt out, it will be your win. I\u2019ll have Tai Nuo and Tai Long kowtow to you in apology. If not, I want you to become a member of our One Strength Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tang San could speak up, Oscar hurried to talk. He knew Tang San\u2019s character was even more resolute than Dai Mubai, if by any chance he agreed, he would be unable to take it back. Glaring at Tai Tan he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lose, your son and grandson only have to kowtow in apology. Even though they\u2019ll lose a bit of face, it\u2019s still no great loss to them. But if little San loses he will have to join your clan, bound for a lifetime. How is this fair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar deliberately lowered the pace of his speech so that the stick of incense on the gate could burn a bit more. In petty cleverness, even Tang San couldn\u2019t compare to him.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you think it should be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words weren\u2019t directed at Oscar, but rather directly asked Tang San.</p><br/><p>Oscar hastily interfered:</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple. If you lose, you\u2019ll have them join Tang San\u2019s clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You also have a clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan looked at Tang San, his eyes revealing a trace of doubt.</p><br/><p>This time, Tang San spoke up himself,</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, my clan is called Tang Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Sect? Tai Tan searched his brain for a moment, but didn\u2019t have any memory of such a school. let alone a formidable one. Immediately he believed that this was just a small unremarkable little school. He immediately nodded without hesitation, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s agreed. If I lose my son and grandson will join your Tang Sect. If you are unable to endure, you need only withdraw beyond a twenty meter range from me or fall to the ground. I will withdraw my force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s eyes displayed a cunning light, quietly placing a recovery sausage in Tang San\u2019s hand, then quickly withdrew. He was very clear about Tang San\u2019s resistance, originally at Heaven Dou Imperial Academy he had withstood a Spirit Douluo\u2019s pressure for a very long time, not just that of a stick of incense. This old fogey also couldn\u2019t be a Title Douluo. Even if he also was a Spirit Douluo, Tang San could absolutely stand it. Besides, he still had his recovery sausage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard little San, getting two slaves isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the person involved, Tang San didn\u2019t have Oscar\u2019s light mood. Even though he had once at the thirty third rank endured the powerful pressure a Title Douluo could produce, and furthermore at this opportunity broken open his Penetrating Meridian, he was certain that the pressure this old man would give him would only be even greater. Because, he was also a Spirit Douluo. At that time Spirit Douluo Zhi Lin[3] had been a control system Spirit Master, and hadn\u2019t had such potent spirit power. But Tai Tan\u2019s whole family was pure strength type Spirit Masters, the pressure he could produce couldn\u2019t be mentioned in the same breath.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan didn\u2019t seem to care a whit about the stick of incense burning a bit during their previous discussion. After once again indicating that Tang San should be careful, the surroundings began to change.</p><br/><p>The students standing around watching the fight could all see the air between Tang San and Tai Tan distort, rippling like a water surface, but nothing could be felt. But in that instant Tang San\u2019s expression suddenly changed, completely withdrawing a step. At the same time he immediately released his spirit.</p><br/><p>If speaking of the pressure Spirit Douluo Zhi Lin gave him as an endless large river, then the pressure this Tai Tan gave him was more like raging waves and swelling seas. Violently surging berserk oppressive force filling every part of Tang San\u2019s body in an instant, Tang San could even hear his bones start to make slight noises under the pressure.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s fierce eyes displayed astonishment. In order to win this bet he had released about sixty percent of his pressure from the start. To him, the other party was just a thirty seventh ranked Spirit Elder. This alone should already be enough to suppress the enemy.</p><br/><p>On the surface Tai Tan appeared extremely bold and powerful, but in fact his mind was extremely meticulous. Since coming here, even in the previous discussion and the proposal of the bet, he hadn\u2019t said anything about what level of Spirit Master he was. But he knew the rank of Tang San\u2019s spirit power.</p><br/><p>Yesterday after Tai Nuo and Tai Long had returned and described their battles with Tang San, Tai Tan immediately realized that Tang San definitely was a genius among geniuses. Therefore he had come personally, regardless of his status. One reason was to have a look at what kind of youngster Tang San was after all, the other was also in the hopes of being able to recruit him as a future power of his clan. His clan had already begun to decline, to Tai Tan this was something that had to be done.</p><br/><p>Tai Nuo\u2019s nickname was Vigorous King, and Tai Tan\u2019s title was subsequently Vigorous God[4]. His spirit was also a pure strength type. At the same time, just like Tang San had determined, his spirit power had already reached the eightieth level, he was a formidable Spirit Douluo. His precise level was eighty sixth rank.</p><br/><p>Spirit Master cultivation all had their tendencies, just with power attack system, defense system, control system, agility attack system, food system, auxiliary system and so on had differentiating aspects.</p><br/><p>But, no matter the tendency of that class, it was extremely difficult to obtain spirit rings that all had only the one additional attribute. Using Tang San as an example, although the spirit rings for his Blue Silver Grass Spirit for the most part aimed at increasing the resilience of his Blue Silver Grass, following the route of the control system, the abilities that appeared after adding spirit rings were all somewhat different. This was caused by the diverse nature of spirit rings. Besides resilience, Blue Silver Grass still had thorns, poison, spider web and all kinds of abilities centering on toughness. Even though they had a complementary effect, it couldn\u2019t be denied that his spirit rings didn\u2019t follow one attribute.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, adding such spirit rings was the best choice, it could grant a comprehensive growth within this system. The spirit rings Tang San chose could be said to be the result of undergoing Grandmaster\u2019s careful calculations.</p><br/><p>If one wanted to have spirit rings that all followed only one additional attribute, there was only one possibility. That was to obtain spirit rings from the same kind of spirit beast each time. Finding a ten year strength type spirit beast wasn\u2019t difficult. Finding a hundred year spirit beast of the same type wasn\u2019t challenging. Even a thousand year level spirit beast of the same type could be found. But, as this went on, finding successive spirit beasts of the same type would become geometrically more difficult.</p><br/><p>Even more, following only one narrow path when adding spirit rings would cause an extreme weakness. That was singular capability. When confronting different opponents, one\u2019s adaptability would be short of ordinary spirit masters. One would be powerful only in some respects.</p><br/><p>However, following such a narrow path when adding spirit rings would also grant the greatest advantage, to maximize this one attribute.</p><br/><p>Walking the route of strength type alone like the Tai family trio, this was also precisely the meaning of the Strength Clan. Tai Tan was eighty sixth rank, but even among Title Douluo there weren\u2019t many who could surpass him in strength. Just like fifty eighth ranked Tai Nuo held the advantage over seventy sixth ranked Zhao Wuji if one counted strength alone.</p><br/><p>As a pure strength type Spirit Master, the pressure Tai Tan released was naturally also based on strength. Even though it would appear he didn\u2019t use his spirit or any abilities, it seemed to give Tang San a bit of respite. At the same time he gave himself a time restriction. But in fact, facing a pure attribute Spirit Master\u2019s pressure was an extremely terrifying matter.</p><br/><p>Each time the air distorted, Tang San felt as if his body would be pulverized by this immense pressure. This kind of feeling hadn\u2019t even appeared when he was confronting Dugu Bo. Even though the pressure Dugu Bo gave Tang San was large, it was mostly mental. But now facing Vigorous God Tai Tan, the pressure was pure force.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Grass gushed out from Tang San. Just like last time it covered his body in a large cocoon that undulated rhythmically. Relying on his Controlling Crane Catching Dragon technique, he did his utmost to limit the harm the pressure caused him.</p><br/><p>But Tang San very quickly discovered that as the pressure grew, Blue Silver Grass\u2019 effect grew less and less. It was already very difficult to move the Blue Silver Grass in front.</p><br/><p>The incense burned slowly as Tai Tan and Tang San confronted each other, silently battling extremely dangerously. The stick of incense still hadn\u2019t even burned one third, but Tang San\u2019s clothes were already drenched through. Gritting his teeth, he endured bitterly.</p><br/><p>As time passed, Tai Tan\u2019s grew more and more astonished. The power he used had already increased from sixty percent of his full strength to seventy, let alone a thirty seventh ranked, even a forty seventh ranked Spirit Master might not be able to endure. This youth was unexpectedly even more outstanding than he had imagined. It seemed he really had been right to come here.</p><br/><p>By now, Zhao Wuji and a crowd of teachers had already come to the Academy gate led by Xiao Wu, and very quickly learned the circumstances from the surrounding students.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, quickly go stop them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu somewhat impatiently said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji\u2019s gaze fell on Tai Tan, and his expression clearly grew heavy. Shaking his head, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already made a bet, anything else has to wait until their bet ends. Bets between Spirit Masters are sacred. If we stopped them now, the when Tang San later joins the Spirit Master world he would have no trust or standing. Only, why would his opponent be this old fellow. I\u2019m afraid this time will be troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him? Isn\u2019t that Tai Long\u2019s grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji gravely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know this old fellow. Originally it was because I accidentally injured his clansman, and was chased after him all over the place, that I went with Flender to manage the Shrek Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s even more ferocious than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Wu heard Zhao Wuji say this she was immediately somewhat panicked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji nodded with an ugly expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old fellow is extremely frightful, his strength is over the eightieth rank, a Spirit Douluo. If it was some other Spirit Douluo I would still have some confidence in risking it. But confronting him, I wouldn\u2019t have a chance. He\u2019s a pure strength type Spirit Master, and the terror of his strength surpasses even most Title Douluo. If I, as another follower of the strength path, met him, I wouldn\u2019t even have the ability to hit back. The strength pressure he emits is even comparable to a Title Douluo. It\u2019s hardly possible to resist without sixtieth ranked spirit power. That\u2019s why I said little San is in a great deal of trouble this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s to be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s charming little face was red with anxiety. Right now she couldn\u2019t help recalling Da Ming and Er Ming. If the two of them were here, would there be any need to fear that old fellow\u2019s strength? But, distant water wouldn\u2019t help nearby thirst, Zhao Wuji said a bet couldn\u2019t be interrupted, so what could be done? No good, no matter how she still couldn\u2019t let little San be injured.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t help loudly shouting:</p><br/><p>\u201cGe, if you can\u2019t endure then concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was naturally unable to reply to her, but when he heard Xiao Wu\u2019s voice his attention shifted slightly, and the tremendous pressure immediately took advantage of the gap. Tang San made a belching sound, spitting out a mouthful of blood. Using his fastest speed to stuff the big sausage into his mouth, he chewed and swallowed. Relying on this spreading heat of the recovery sausage, he just managed to endure without collapsing.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Wuji heard Xiao Wu\u2019s shout he immediately knew it was far from helping and hastily covered her mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disturb him. At this moment any external disturbance will influence his attention. Little San is a clever child, he certainly knows what to do. He still hasn\u2019t hit the limit yet. If a danger he truly is unable to endure appears, then he will act without being told.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jacket rupturing, Eight Spider Lances rapidly extended from Tang San\u2019s back with their muted cold light. The lower four spider lances thrust straight into the newly dug earth, supporting his body. The upper four spider lances swayed slightly, their red and white light becoming especially dazzling.</p><br/><p>His Mysterious Heaven Skill was completely contained within Tang San\u2019s body by the pressure. Under these circumstances Tang San discovered that the medical effects of the Octagonal Mysterious Ice Grass and Infernal Precious Apricot within him were actually fusing swiftly, making his body even more resilient. Mysterious Heaven Skill also circulated frantically, dissolving wave after wave of pressure.</p><br/><p>The stick of incense inserted in the Shrek Academy gate had already burned more than halfway. Sweat constantly dripped down the front of Tang San\u2019s jacket. All his clothes already stuck to the skin, completely as if he had just been fished out of the water.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan was already somewhat impatient. When the Eight Spider Lances on Tang San\u2019s back came out he immediately saw a prediction of the end. Relying on Eight Spider Lances releasing, Tang San\u2019s ability to resist the pressure clearly increased. Could it be that was a spirit bone? Even more one outside of the regular six spirit bones, an external spirit bone?</p><br/><p>His mind surging, Tai Tan made the firm resolution to recruit this youth no matter how he had to do it. If that truly was an external spirit bone, then it was no wonder even his fifty eighth ranked spirit power son had lost. This youth\u2019s prospects were boundless.</p><br/><p>Tang San himself wasn\u2019t aware that along with his gradually stood out as exceptionally brilliant, relying on his own natural gifts and his talent in Tang Sect\u2019s secret lore, he gradually attracted the interest of every great power.</p><br/><p>To quickly bring the battle to an end, Tai Tan decided not to exercise any more restraint. Despite the existence of Tang San\u2019s external spirit bone, he knew that it was impossible for this youth to resist the pressure he could give. The spirit power gap was really too large, and moreover his strength was on the Title Douluo level. Even if he had to injure him a bit, he would beat him first and consider it later.</p><br/><p>With this in mind, Tai Tan directly increased the pressure he exerted on Tang San from seventy percent to ninety percent. The originally rhythmical distortions in the air instantly became faster, the ripples becoming like waves milling towards Tang San.</p><br/><p>Pu\u2014\u2014, again a mouthful of blood spewed out. With the pressure suddenly increasing by close to a third, Tang San was unable to endure further. Even though he already had an extremely high estimation of the opponent\u2019s strength, he still hadn\u2019t seen it all.</p><br/><p>Would he lose? Would he really lose? No.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Tai Tan across from him. That old man still had a serene expression, his clothes not even shifting. Brimming with an insufferably arrogant dignity. In that instant Tai Tan suddenly saw Tang San\u2019s eyes brighten without any warning, two golden purple rays of light shot out from Tang San\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>[1] () This is also the transliteration for \u201cTitan\u201d used in the name of the Titan Giant Ape.</p><br/><p>[2] () Not sure if this should even be the name of the clan, or even \u201cone of the strengths of the clan\u201d since there are various ways to interpret it, but will go with this for now.</p><br/><p>[3] The Heaven Dou Imperial Academy board member who used his pressure on Tang San.</p><br/><p>[4] His title () can be read literally as \u201cgreat strength god\u201d, which can also be translated as \u201ctitan\u201d.

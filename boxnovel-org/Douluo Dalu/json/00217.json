Intense light-like flames soared around him, as he instantly released his six spirit rings.</p><br/><p>Muscles suddenly swelling, the surface of his skin suddenly revealing black and white striped fur, the tyrannical influence of the king among beasts abruptly exploded in all directions. Waves spread outward in the sand below his feet, as those evil eyes radiating domineering power made even the Seahorse Douluo more than two hundred meters away feel somewhat moved.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo waved his right hand, and the waves in front immediately began to churn, reaching ten meters high, unexpectedly and directly sealing all avenues forward. The practically boiling seawater thundered with a heaven shaking power, but didn\u2019t spill over the confines of the sea within the sea even a hair.</p><br/><p>Facing such circumstances, Dai Mubai didn\u2019t show even a hint of fear. His third spirit ring abruptly flashed, fully using his thousand year spirit ring ability, White Tiger Vajra Transformation.</p><br/><p>His originally already tall and sturdy body expanded once again, the white fur turning golden in a flash, the king character on his forehead becoming even more clear, as each muscle seemed to burst with explosive force.</p><br/><p>Under the amplification of the White Tiger Vajra Transformation, Dai Mubai roared, intense golden light filling the air in front of him, White Tiger Light Wave shooting out and turning into an intense white light shooting directly at the waves.</p><br/><p>Amidst the explosive noise, a large hole was unexpectedly blasted open through that wave. At the same time, Dai Mubai\u2019s majestic body shot forward, charging straight at the waves with an incomparable aggressiveness.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014 Thirty or so meters where the White Tiger Light Wave attacked completely burst open, those sky reaching waves splashing in all directions like flowers scattered by a goddess. But even more formidable waves met Dai Mubai, heavily striking his majestic body. It seemed like Dai Mubai\u2019s golden figure would be swallowed by those terrifying waves.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s heart thumped, and she couldn\u2019t help rushing a step forward, but was blocked by Tang San. Tang San said in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Since boss Dai dares charge into the sea like this, naturally he has confidence. We\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Dai Mubai swallowed by the waves with much thunder but little rain, the yellow clothed sea Spirit Masters on the shore couldn\u2019t help being stunned, in their hearts all thinking that land Spirit Masters were mediocre. Even though the sea within the sea wasn\u2019t a true ocean, under Seahorse Douluo\u2019s control, this place would be even more dangerous than the real ocean.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, suddenly, along with a rumble, a five meters or so long giant seahorse suddenly flew out of the ocean, turning in the air, emanating blue light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes revealed a trace of admiring light,</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Dai is using the method we used to land on Seagod Island. He can\u2019t swim, but with his strength, walking on the bottom of the sea for a short while isn\u2019t a problem. This sea within the sea won\u2019t be as deep as the real ocean, he can walk across the bottom by relying on White Tiger Barrier.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s words just fell when, along with an explosion, one enormous Seahorse after another whirled out of the sea. Clearly, these were the sea spirit beasts of the sea within the see. They seemed to have the strength of thousand year spirit beasts. Each seahorse breaking through the waves seemed to be just unconscious, with no apparent injuries.</p><br/><p>Before long, just five meters away from the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, the waves abruptly rolled back, an immense stream of water soaring up, fiercely striking the light screen overhead. That body glittering with golden light soared up within this wave. Drawing a deep breath, both hands swatting backward, using the impulse from striking the wave, he stably landed in front of Seahorse Douluo.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo\u2019s eyes revealed a bit of praise, nodding to Dai Mubai,</p><br/><p>\u201cPossessing tyrannical spirit power with the energy of the king, the king among beasts spirit, relying on the third spirit ability to break through my trial. Among land Spirit Masters, you can also be considered an outstanding figure at the spirit emperor level. Even more at such a young age. No wonder you would be confident in coming here. Fine, you are qualified to accept the trials of the lord Seagod.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai replied with only two simple words. Finished speaking, he directly turned aside, looking at the others still on the shore. Using his gaze to transmit some kind of information. The others might not be able to see it, but he believed Tang San definitely could.</p><br/><p>The praise in Seahorse Douluo\u2019s eyes wasn\u2019t just because of Dai Mubai\u2019s strength, but rather because he didn\u2019t kill any sea spirit beasts in the sea. Tang San could guess Dai Mubai\u2019s method for reaching the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, as the real controller here, how couldn\u2019t he know?</p><br/><p>Tang San really did see Dai Mubai\u2019s gaze, and from within also understood what Dai Mubai wanted to tell them. Immediately he turned to the others,</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing over to the Seahorse Sacred Pillar actually isn\u2019t Seahorse Douluo\u2019s trial for us. Dai Mubai told us that it\u2019s not completely difficult. Within this sea within the sea, there\u2019s just seahorses with that kind of strength. Without even stronger sea spirit beasts. Zhuqing, you\u2019re second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing replied. She didn\u2019t go through the motions of preparation like Dai Mubai did, her body soared as she released her spirit, her first spirit ability Hell Rush Stab unleashing in midair, and she suddenly accelerated, heading straight for the waves.</p><br/><p>Compared to Dai Mubai, she was even faster, moving forward unhindered like a specter. In a flash she had already soared more than ten meters, when she was only half a meter from to the light screen emanating from the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, she suddenly changed direction in midair and shot straight for the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>The violent waves of course wouldn\u2019t let her pass like that, and the surging sea charged towards Zhu Zhuqing. Her style when confronting the waves was completely different from Dai Mubai, just seeing purple light flash around her, equally releasing the radiance of her third spirit ability, a black empty shadow seemed to emanate from her body, quietly chopping at the wave. It was Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s third spirit ability, Hell Chop.</p><br/><p>The violent seawater, when on the verge of striking her body, swept past on either side of her, the Hell Chop directly cutting open the wave in front of. By now, Zhu Zhuqing had already charged close to thirty meters.</p><br/><p>Of course she wouldn\u2019t pick the same style as Dai Mubai, submerging in the water. She didn\u2019t have Dai Mubai\u2019s tyrannical physique, but as an agility attack type Spirit Master, she had her own ways.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to fall into the wave, Hell Chop appeared once again, only this time it wasn\u2019t aimed at splitting the wave ahead, but rather bizarrely cut out a triangle. When her momentum was on the verge of being exhausted, the tips of her toes touched the wave cut by her Hell Chop, her first spirit ability Hell Rush Stab launching once again, and she charged forward.</p><br/><p>Even though the buoyancy of seawater is a lot higher than potable water, by how much? But this tiny difference in buoyancy was enough to carry Zhu Zhuqing. Hell Chop opened up the way, Hell Rush Stab carried her forward. The two spirit abilities merged together had a remarkable effect in passing this sea.</p><br/><p>In a flash, after approximately ten accelerations, Zhu Zhuqing finally broke through the restrictions of the waves, landing noiselessly next to Dai Mubai, without being hit by a single drop of water, without a red face, without hurried breathing, she withdrew her spirit, nodding slightly to Seahorse Douluo.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo\u2019s originally tight face showed a hint of a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. I can describe your display as stunning. Agility attack type Spirit Master, cat type spirit, equally focused on speed and attack. Your strength might not be equal to his, but you did even better than him. It seems even younger than him. Six ring spirit emperor, apparently my understanding of land Spirit Masters really is a bit lacking. You are equally qualified to accept the lord Seagod\u2019s trial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing once again saluted Seahorse Douluo and walked over next to Dai Mubai, gripping his still wet big hand, standing there quietly. In their eyes wasn\u2019t a trace of concern, because they believed in their comrades\u2019 strength.</p><br/><p>Ashore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, Rongrong, up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar laughed out loud, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Rongrong, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar swiftly ate one of the clone mirror sausages produced by his sixth spirit ability. With a flicker of silvery light, his eyes suddenly brightened, and another Oscar immediately appeared next to him.</p><br/><p>He not only ate his sixth spirit ability, but also simultaneously used his spirit bone ability, Clone.</p><br/><p>The clone Oscar that appeared stooped, carrying Ning Rongrong on his back and, led by Oscar\u2019s main body, simultaneously dashed towards the sea within the sea.</p><br/><p>Black light simultaneously appeared on Oscar\u2019s main body and the clone. His two bodies simultaneously used Hell Rush Stab. That\u2019s right, the clone mirror sausage Oscar ate was made from a drop of Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>However, his cloned ability had considerable flaws compared to when Zhu Zhuqing used it, and his body control naturally couldn\u2019t compare to Zhu Zhuqing either.</p><br/><p>However, don\u2019t forget that Oscar wasn\u2019t alone in stepping into the sea within the sea right now.</p><br/><p>Gorgeous dazzling light flashed behind the back of Oscar\u2019s clone, the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda appearing over Ning Rongrong\u2019s palm. The first three floors of the pagoda blossomed with light simultaneously, and Ning Rongrong\u2019s first spirit ability strength amplification, second spirit ability agility amplification, and third spirit ability spirit power amplification, simultaneously fell on Oscar.</p><br/><p>Just what is called pure strength subdues ten schemes, while Oscar\u2019s use of the Hell Civet\u2019s abilities naturally didn\u2019t compare to Zhu Zhuqing, right now he had Ning Rongrong\u2019s seventy percent ability boost, capable of using eighty percent of Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s abilities, while his spirit power, agility and strength all surpassed Zhu Zhuqing by far.</p><br/><p>A Hell Chop equally shot out, even though Oscar\u2019s application wasn\u2019t as ingenious, the Hell Chop\u2019s strength was substantially increased, and the gap cut in the seawater was even larger, enough to give him enough time to respond.</p><br/><p>And the clone body\u2019s ability changed along with the abilities of Oscar\u2019s main body, therefore Ning Rongrong\u2019s amplification to Oscar equally affected the clone. Even though the clone body only had seventy percent or so of Oscar\u2019s strength, it didn\u2019t have to launch the Hell Chop, just carrying Ning Rongrong to follow behind Oscar was enough.</p><br/><p>An extraordinary scene appeared over the sea within the sea. One person ahead, black light continuously flickering in his hands, constantly leaping forward, two people behind, one carrying the other on his back, and in the hands of the person being carried a glorious pagoda shot out three radiant lines of light to the person in front, just like a bridge linking them together. As they arrived at the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, the time it took them was actually even shorter than Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>Seeing Oscar and Ning Rongrong\u2019s equally ideal spirit ring configuration of six spirit rings gradually vanish, Seahorse Douluo gradually stood, first looking at Ning Rongrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour spirit is the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was in this ocean, he still knew the seven great sects of land Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong smiled slightly, neither servile nor overbearing saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. But junior really is from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo\u2019s eyes revealed a pensive light,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, a good Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda.\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning to Oscar, this Seahorse Douluo\u2019s gaze grew a bit hesitant,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery difficult to imagine. I actually can\u2019t see what your spirit is. It seems you possess the same ability as that young miss, but I still know it isn\u2019t. From how unfamiliar with the use of the ability you are, that really isn\u2019t your original ability. Can you tell me what your spirit is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I told you what my spirit is, would the lord Seagod\u2019s trial be a bit easier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t up to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar looked at this Title Douluo level sea Spirit Master\u2019s burning gaze, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy spirit is Sausage, or to be precise, I\u2019m a food system spirit emperor. As for why I could use that ability just now, I\u2019m sure you can guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Food system Spirit Master? Seahorse Douluo stared blankly a moment. Right now he felt a bit like the opponents who saw the Shrek Seven Devils participate back in the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament.</p><br/><p>The first to arrive at the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, Dai Mubai, had actually already brought this Seahorse Douluo an enormous shock, but the next three were still equally alarming. What made him most shocked was the couple who just came here. One food system Spirit Master, one support system Spirit Master. They could actually pass the trial of the waves, steadily reaching the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>Especially crucial was that these Douluo Continent Spirit Masters were all so young, apparently just twenty years old. But these four in front of him were still all Spirit Emperors with ideal spirit ring configurations. Through these four, Seahorse Douluo already clearly recognized how the land spirit masters that came this time fitted together. In time, these youths\u2019 future could only be described as limitless.</p><br/><p>While Seahorse Douluo was thinking deeply on his side, on the shore an argument had risen.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiangxiang, let me bring you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun persuaded.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang stubbornly shook her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I can do it on my own. I can\u2019t always cause all of you trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Hongjun wanted to speak again, Bai Chenxiang had already thrown herself out without the slightest hesitation. Figure flashing, she spread nimble wings like a white shadow, flying straight for the sea within the sea.</p><br/><p>Tang San signaled Ma Hongjun with his eyes, and Fatty hastily chased after. The Phoenix Spirit releasing, the third spirit ability Phoenix Ascension formed two giant wings of flame, dashing after Bai Chenxiang. If Bai Chenxiang met danger, he would also look after her from behind.</p><br/><p>Their actions naturally drew Seahorse Douluo\u2019s attention. As he saw Bai Chenxiang\u2019s four spirit rings and Ma Hongjun\u2019s five spirit rings, inwardly he couldn\u2019t help sighing a bit. Finally some youngsters who weren\u2019t at the Spirit Emperor level. Actually, even he didn\u2019t understand why his mind, ordinarily calm as a dried out old well, would ripple like this over some kids.</p><br/><p>However, Seahorse Douluo\u2019s mind didn\u2019t relax for long before his eyes again revealed astonishment.</p><br/><p>Bai Chenxiang\u2019s white silhouette bore through the waves like a wisp of smoke. Even if the waves were crowded close, they still rose and fell with the tide, and Bai Chenxiang seemed to see the eye of a needle that appeared along with the movement of the waves. Even in places that seemed devoid of any cracks, she could still easily find a few chinks to pass through. More than two hundred meter distance, in practically just a few eyeblinks, her white mist like silhouette already fell from the air, stably standing on the Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform. In terms of speed, even until now, Bai Chenxiang was number one.</p><br/><p>Close behind Bai Chenxiang, Fatty moved forward even more directly. Without any dodging, he directly charged through the waves. Using both the two great spirit abilities Bathing Fire Phoenix and Phoenix Ascension, this time he had learned the lesson from last time at the Vast Sea Great Spirit Arena. When he knocked against the waves, he pulled in his wings as close as possible, using momentum to crash through. And once he appeared on the other side, the wings immediately unfolded, accelerating once again, charging at the next wave.</p><br/><p>Large clouds of white steam rose in the air above the sea within the sea. Ma Hongjun used this direct, close to barbarian way to break through the obstruction of one wave after another, becoming the sixth to land on the Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, you should be a pure speed type Spirit Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo looked at Bai Chenxiang.</p><br/><p>Bai CHenxiang nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting, really interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze turned to Ma Hongjun who had just landed on the platform, equally unstained by half a drop of water,</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh temperature flame, Phoenix spirit. Just from the spirit, on dry land, you should be a top quality Spirit Master. Unfortunately, your spirit power still lags behind a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun blushed. Even though he had also reached the sixtieth ranked, compared to the others, he really was behind.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Tang San on the shore brought Xiao Wu to be the last to move.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo at first didn\u2019t notice, however, the sea within the sea before them was under his control, and every soon he discovered something wrong. Subconsciously he turned to look, and was immediately stupefied.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s right hand tightly held Xiao Wu\u2019s slender waist to soar in the air. Xiao Wu seemed to be without perception of anything in the outside world, her long scorpion braid hanging across her chest, she nestled against Tang San\u2019s shoulder with a vacant gaze in her beautiful eyes.</p><br/><p>Blue hair, blue eyes, graceful temperament, handsome appearance. Soaring in the air, Tang San and Xiao Wu didn\u2019t cause any smoke and fire, just like a pair of immortal companions.</p><br/><p>About to be hit by a charging wave, in Tang San\u2019s left hand appeared a black hammer, one and a half meters long, large hammerhead. With just a light shake of his wrist, without taking any stance, the giant wave before them scattered with an explosion, and be brought Xiao Wu to fly forward through the air. He wasn\u2019t particularly fast, but he seemed so graceful and natural, as if the giant waves reaching towards the sky before him was just a simple matter.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer was forged under the waterfall. No matter how large the waves, but they were still far from comparable to the several hundred meters tall waterfall, and his current spirit power was higher by far than at that time. Using the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone to fly, with the Clear Sky Hammer to open up the way, even though the waves surged, how could they stop his path forward?</p><br/><p>Under the impact of the Clear Sky Hammer, rumbling sound spread rhythmically. Those giant waves seemed to open up a path to greet them, and in a flash, Tang San had already brought Xiao Wu as the last to land on the Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform.</p><br/><p>If Oscar\u2019s strength could be said to puzzle Seahorse Douluo, then Tang San before him was even more incomprehensible. From Tang San\u2019s body, he clearly didn\u2019t see a spirit ring, so much that he couldn\u2019t even sense what level he had reached from the spirit power he released, but he still moved forward so unhurriedly. In fact, the giant waves Seahorse Douluo raised, to land Spirit Masters, were extremely difficult to pass without at least fiftieth rank cultivation. Bai Chenxiang\u2019s special circumstances couldn\u2019t be seen just anywhere.</p><br/><p>Looking Tang San up and down, Seahorse Douluo\u2019s gaze suddenly turned cold,</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the sequence just now it is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, his hands formed seals, and everyone felt an energy quietly disperse. That boiling sea immediately calmed down, and the light screen emanating from the top of the Seahorse Sacred Pillar also quietly dissipated.</p><br/><p>Seeing Seahorse Douluo\u2019s eyes hold such a cold gaze, Tang San was somewhat puzzled. When he looked at the other Shrek Seven Devils, everyone also revealed vacant expressions.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s evil eyes suddenly radiated light, as if thinking of something, saying to Seahorse Douluo:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, there\u2019s something I think I should first make clear. We\u2019re not from Spirit Hall. You should also have seen that Rongrong\u2019s spirit is the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, she comes from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Little San is from the Clear Sky School. Me and Zhuqing are from the Star Luo Imperial family. Xiangxiang is a disciple of the Clear Sky School\u2019s subordinate Speed Clan. As for little Ao and Fatty, they\u2019re free Spirit Masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he spoke of each person, he pointed to them.</p><br/><p>Hearing Dai Mubai\u2019s words, Tang San was the first to come to a realization. As land Spirit Masters, and moreover all so young and this powerful, this Seahorse Douluo would very easily regard them as coming from Spirit Hall. And back then with Spirit Hall\u2019s attack on Seagod Island, this Seahorse Douluo naturally wouldn\u2019t have any good impression. Dai Mubai suddenly explaining everyone\u2019s history was to negate Seahorse Douluo\u2019s conjecture.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t to say that Tang San\u2019s ability to reflect wasn\u2019t equal to Dai Mubai, but rather because Dai Mubai was the first to step onto the Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform, and clearly saw Seahorse Douluo\u2019s gentle manner towards everyone. But as the last one to reach the platform, Tang San\u2019s line of sight was previously cut off by the raging waves, and naturally didn\u2019t see what happened here, and was only vaguely able to see what happened.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, along with Dai Mubai\u2019s explanation, Seahorse Douluo\u2019s expression relaxed, and he casually asked,</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re from different backgrounds, from between the southern sky and the northern sea, how come you\u2019re all gathered together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we went to school together. You might not have heard of it, but we graduated from Shrek Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar added:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still once represented Shrek Academy to participate in the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament, and moreover took the ultimate victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seagod Douluo\u2019s deep like the ocean gaze swept across everyone,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is to say, your purpose in coming to Seagod Island isn\u2019t so simple as just joining the island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s heart\u2019s chilled, subconsciously their gazes gathered on Tang San. In a few simple sentences, even though they\u2019d made clear they weren\u2019t related to Spirit Hall, their purpose in coming had still caught Seahorse Douluo\u2019s doubt.</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTo learn through experience, that\u2019s why we came. Senior, begin the lord Seagod\u2019s trial for us. If we can pass it, it won\u2019t be too late for you to investigate our goals.\u201d</p><br/><p>The unspoken meaning of his words was, if we can pass it, it won\u2019t be too late to doubt our purposes. If we can\u2019t pass it, we\u2019d be directly banished from the island, and any goals would be impossible to achieve. Avoiding the important and focusing on the trivial in order to dispel Seahorse Douluo\u2019s questions.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo slowly walked over to the Seahorse Sacred Pillar. Facing the sacred pillar, his eyes revealed a pious light,</p><br/><p>\u201cOne person step forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hearts of the Shrek Seven Devils tightened. They knew that the true trial was about to begin, but this was also what they were looking forward to. This trip to the Seagod Island, wasn\u2019t it in order to progress their strength under pressure?</p><br/><p>No need to speak, the first to step forward was Dai Mubai, standing one step behind Seahorse Douluo.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo slowly raised his hands, his face filled with a pious expression. Both hands held in front of his chest, his palms facing each other half a chi apart, faint blue light slowly appearing between his hands. Along with the blue light gradually growing stronger, Tang San suddenly had a kind of familiar feeling.</p><br/><p>When the blue light filled the palms of Seahorse Douluo, rays of light suddenly blossomed, making the whole Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform filled with a clear blue light. Immediately afterward, light flashed below the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, a line of blue light spreading upward along the pillar pattern. In practically the blink of an eye, it climbed to the peak.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo turned, facing Dai Mubai, right hand pointing towards him.</p><br/><p>A light blue beam of light fell from the sky, enveloping Dai Mubai. Bathed in that beam of light, Dai Mubai was a bit bewildered. Clearly he didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><br/><p>The color of the light began to change, from blue turning to white. Immediately afterward, it again changed from white to yellow, and practically without pause again changed to purple. The purple gradually deepened, this time the transformation speed was a bit slow, but it still kept changing.</p><br/><p>Seeing the light around Dai Mubai change, Seahorse Douluo seemed a bit shocked. Before long, that purple light had already completely turned black, almost completely hiding Dai Mubai within the beam. And on the Seahorse Sacred Pillar behind Seahorse Douluo, the lowest part of the pattern also became black, and the color slowly started to clamber upward.</p><br/><p>Tang San and the others didn\u2019t notice, but those yellow clothed sea Spirit Masters who previously brought them here saw the Seahorse Sacred Pillar change, and each of their faces displayed overwhelming shock. Especially that middle aged Spirit Master, who even showed a bit of pity. Sighing softly, he said to himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t let them come take the trial, but unfortunately they wanted to. The lord Seagod\u2019s trials for land Spirit Masters really are\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The black lines of light directly clambered up to a third of the Seahorse Divine Pillar before stopping. But very soon, it once again kept spreading upward, this time climbing even faster, in a moment\u2019s work, the black lines were already covering the whole Seahorse Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>Immediately afterward, altogether six lines of black light shot out, simultaneously arriving in front of Dai Mubai, turning into six square light screens. On each light screen flickered some special golden characters. Among them, the light characters on the first screen were brilliant, while the other five were a lot duller.</p><br/><p>The corner of Seahorse Douluo\u2019s mouth rose slightly, affecting a wry smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack level six tests. Two more tests than me back then. Lord Seagod, don\u2019t tell me these people are sinners?\u201d</p><br/><p>The six light screens vanished, turning into six specks of black light that simultaneously entered Dai Mubai\u2019s forehead. On his forehead appeared a black hexagram, its color like ink.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai seemed to sense something, the blankness in his eyes replaced by hidden depths. Without a word, he quickly retreated a few steps, sitting cross legged and closing his eyes, his brows wrinkling, apparently thinking about something.</p><br/><p>The Seahorse Sacred Pillar\u2019s light gradually faded, everything returning to normal. But Seahorse Douluo looked at Dai Mubai with a somewhat complex gaze, from Tang San\u2019s point of view, this Seahorse Douluo seemed to be looking at a dead person.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, what\u2019s black level six tests? Can you explain it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo nodded slowly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe trials given by the lord Seagod are separated by level. At different levels, the difficulty will also be different. Just like the colors of spirit rings, from lowest to highest, they\u2019re each white level trial, yellow level trial, purple level trial, black level trial and red peak trials. The lord Seagod will give different trials to different people. And the contents of the trial appeared in the light screen just now, visible to the examinee and examiner. I\u2019m your examiner. Through different level trials, you will obtain corresponding authority on Seagod Island. The trials are not only according to the examinee\u2019s strength, but at the same time also potential. This is the lord Seagod\u2019s decree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmong these, white trials and yellow trials will only have one trial. Passing it counts as succeeding. Starting at the purple trial, there will start appearing differentiations. Purple trials will have one to three tests. In other words, if the light shooting from the sacred pillar in front of you is one, then, you will experience one purple level trial. If there are three, then you will undergo three trials in order to pass. Naturally, the more trials there are, the greater the difficulty, and after passing the greater the authority. And finally at the black level trials, there will be at least four trials, at most six. That\u2019s also the black level six tests I mentioned just now. Black level six tests, that can be said to be the most difficult of the black level trials. What I can tell you is that in the recent one hundred years, the black level trial has appeared altogether thirty one times, among those, seven passed, twenty four failed. I am one of those seven. The seven who passed are currently the Seagod Island\u2019s seven sacred pillars\u2019 protectors. And among the seven of us, only Seadragon Sacred Pillar\u2019s guardian, Seadragon Douluo, passed the black level six tests. He is also the strongest among us, his spirit power has already broken through the ninety fifth rank.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo\u2019s explanation was very detailed, but its purpose was only one, to tell these youngsters in front of him how difficult the black level six tests were. By passing it, you would have authority equal to the sacred pillars protectors. If you failed, there would only be one conclusion, death.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils looked at each other for a moment, already without words.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo added:</p><br/><p>\u201cBy accepting the lord Seagod\u2019s trial, then, it will begin immediately. The black level trial\u2019s time limit for you land Spirit Masters is that you must pass one trial each year. After completing one, the next trial will begin. If you exceed the time limit, or try to run, then the Seagod seal that entered his forehead before will explode, erasing the examinee. The black level trials have never before had losers, only those who passed and the dead. Therefore, it\u2019s also known as paradise and hell. I don\u2019t know why the lord Seagod\u2019s trials for you land Spirit Masters are so difficult either. You others still have time to regret. Otherwise, if there is another black level trial, you will also be like him. Seeing as you aren\u2019t from spirit hall, I can honestly tell you that with his sixtieth ranked strength, there is basically no chance of him passing the black level six tests. He will definitely die.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, in the daytime you will learn these with me. Until I\u2019m satisfied. Do you know what the Moon Pavilion does?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled calmly,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy place here is the Heaven Dou Imperial school of courtly etiquette, specialized in teaching all kinds of noble etiquette. You should have felt my Domain. My innate domain is called Noble Circle. And my spirit power, at present, is ninth rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked stupidly at Tang Yue-Hua. He could never have imagined that she, as a directly related Clear Sky School disciple, would actually only have nine ranks of spirit power,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, variant spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled and nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps you would think of me as the most useless disciple of the Clear Sky School, but I can tell you that if your father could possess everything I am skilled in, the result of the events twenty years ago would be completely different. At times, strength doesn\u2019t mean everything. You must learn to protect yourself even without relying on power. You must further learn how to exploit the art of language, and still how to walk between powers of all sides as well as how to control authority. I can see that you\u2019re outstanding, however, you still have many, many things you must learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San finally nodded with some difficulty. Even if he didn\u2019t want to admit it, he still had no choice but to compromise with this graceful woman. After all, she was his aunt.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled faintly,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so embarrassed. I think that before long, you will understand the importance of everything I teach. Walking out of Slaughter City, what you need most right now isn\u2019t strenuous cultivation, but rather to let all that you possess grow more stable. I already know about your father\u2019s condition. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t push him again later. The sect won\u2019t either. Even if he\u2019s no longer at the sect, the sect has never forgotten him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing, Tang Yue-Hua looked deeply at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want your father to be troubled again, you must become even stronger. The responsibility of everything he should accomplish, will fall on your shoulders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>One year later. Heaven Dou City, Moon pavilion.</p><br/><p>Heaven Dou City\u2019s night scene was very beautiful. This was deeply related to the highly developed commerce here. As the capital of Heaven Dou Empire, in the entire Douluo Continent, perhaps only Star Luo City could manage to compare.</p><br/><p>The beauty of Star Luo City lay mainly in the exquisiteness of the south, while Heaven Dou City was brimming with the northern generous atmosphere, both victors in their own ways.</p><br/><p>Graceful and quiet light spread from the several lower floors of the Moon Pavilion, a continuous stream of people constantly presenting their invitations and entering.</p><br/><p>As the Heaven Dou imperial school of courtly etiquette, in order to be able to enroll in the Moon Pavilion, one had to at least have a title of nobility, and one\u2019s age couldn\u2019t surpass thirty. This was undoubtedly the place where the new generation of Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s nobility was cultivated.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even though the Moon Pavilion itself didn\u2019t count as much, there was still no power that dared meddle with it. Not even the imperial family.</p><br/><p>Reportedly, Emperor Xue Ye and the Moon Pavilion\u2019s master Madam Yue-Hua had a somewhat intimate relationship. Of course, this was just a rumor.</p><br/><p>This evening was the annual graduation ceremony.</p><br/><p>With each batch of students graduating, all these students\u2019 parents and elders were invited. These were undoubtedly the most influential characters of Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s capital.</p><br/><p>In fact, the Moon Pavilion only admitted one hundred students per year. In order for these one hundred places, the nobility of the entire Heaven Dou Empire practically racked their brains. Everyone knew that to be able to smoothly graduate from the Moon Pavilion, was equivalent to being plated with gold. The graduates from here were considered true nobility.</p><br/><p>Before anything else, in marriages between noble families, the stronger side would frequently ask the weaker side whether their child had passed the education of Moon Pavilion. This alone showed the influence of the Moon Pavilion in the entire upper layer of the Heaven Dou Empire.</p><br/><p>Of course, nobody knew that the master of the Moon Pavilion without the strength to truss a chicken, Madam Yue, was actually from the world\u2019s first Spirit Master sect.</p><br/><p>The graduation ceremony was held on the third floor of the Moon Pavilion, where numerous high ranking officials and nobles had already arranged their seating. They all wanted to see how their children had improved through the cultivation of the Moon Pavilion.</p><br/><p>As the master of the Moon Pavilion, Tang Yue-Hua still wore silver adorned courtly dress, standing to the side of the reception hall with a smile on her face. Subordinates told her everyone was present. She nodded an indication. The graduation ceremony formally began.</p><br/><p>A line of silver dressed young men and women began to enter through doors on two sides. The one hundred people didn\u2019t make the hall noisy. Each person\u2019s face revealed equally graceful smiles, the pace between each harmonious, with casual ease. The faint grandeur didn\u2019t give people an impression of arrogance, but could still surprise.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a door opened to the side of the hall, and a white dressed youth slowly walked out, holding an exquisite and elegant golden harp to his chest.</p><br/><p>Blue eyes so clear the bottom could be seen, a head of deep blue hair draped across the shoulders and back without giving people the slightest impression of lacking manners, all over a spirited quality, handsome, noble, graceful.</p><br/><p>Against expectations there was also a particular quiet contentment. When he walked out from the door, he became the focus of everyone present in practically an instant.</p><br/><p>Even the graduating students stepping into the hall with graceful smiles before, for the most part couldn\u2019t help throwing their gazes in his direction.</p><br/><p>Especially the female students had no lack of intoxicated expressions.</p><br/><p>The white clothed youth carefully arranged the prize harp on a table, sitting straight backed on a special stool, first facing the audience with a smile and a nod, then slowly raising both slender hands to lightly start playing.</p><br/><p>Elegant, pure like the sparkling translucence of precious stones, ephemeral limpid tones flowed from that exquisite golden harp. The hall immediately calmed, the beautiful sound of the harp making the listeners\u2019 hearts untroubled. A marvellous aesthetic just like a fountain rushing under moonlight, filling the air with a poetic atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Let alone others, only looking at outward appearances, this white clothed youth undoubtedly made all the graduating students present turn pale. The aloof quiet contentment he carried was no doubt what gave people the most favorable impression.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua stood there quietly, listening to the beautiful sound of the harp. To her ears, this harp music naturally sounded different to what other people heard. She heard whether the sound of this harp truly was as quiet and contented as the surface of the white clothed youth.</p><br/><p>One year, a whole year had passed. He had indeed changed a lot. Perhaps, this was his natural instinct.</p><br/><p>The youth bent over the harp was Tang San. Compared to one year ago, the current Tang San had undergone a heaven and earth revolving change. That was a change in temperament. There was no longer any murderous aura spreading from him. That didn\u2019t mean that the killing intent he had obtained from Slaughter City had disappeared, but rather that it was truly contained.</p><br/><p>When Tang Yue-Hua gave Tang San his first lesson, she had told him that a true power first had to learn to control everything about himself. Especially his mood and aura.</p><br/><p>Tang San had undoubtedly done very well in this year. Well to the extent that even an exacting lady like Tang Yue-Hua couldn\u2019t pick out any flaw. What others would need three years to learn, he had completed in one, and moreover done it better than anyone.</p><br/><p>To be able to represent the graduating class to play the harp was an honor that had always by tradition in Moon Pavilion only been awarded to the most outstanding student. That Tang San was able to sit there really wasn\u2019t because he was Tang Yue-Hua\u2019s nephew, but because of his own accomplishments.</p><br/><p>The graduation ceremony advanced in sequence amidst this graceful music. The high ranking officials and nobles had already begun to stealthily ask about Tang San\u2019s background, but nobody could obtain any results. Even their children couldn\u2019t tell them where Tang San was from.</p><br/><p>To the other students, Tang San was like a riddle. When he had just appeared here, nobody had wanted to approach his ice chill, and nobody was optimistic about his chances of fitting in.</p><br/><p>Even if he was handsome, how could there be any lack of handsome people here in the capital?</p><br/><p>However, after a few months, everyone looked at him with different eyes. In the study of all kinds of etiquette and music, Tang San had displayed a learning ability far exceeding that of ordinary people. Most notable was that the ice chill that surrounded him had gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, he only very rarely interacted with people, and spoke even less, only quietly studied.</p><br/><p>In the audience, the most illustrious of all the nobles was a young person, his age appearing to be where youth and middle age flowed together. He was the Heaven Dou imperial crown prince, Xue Qinghe.</p><br/><p>This time Xue Qinghe was here for his little sister\u2019s graduation ceremony.</p><br/><p>And his little sister, should originally have sat in the position Tang San now held.</p><br/><p>His little sister had told him not long ago, that the choice of person playing the harp had changed at the last moment, but she wasn\u2019t the least bit upset, because she cheerfully and committedly admired that youth called Tang Yin, resigned to falling short of him in all areas.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe knew that his little sister, as an imperial princess, as well as being doted on by their imperial father, always was proud and unyielding, very rarely believing others. Even this older brother didn\u2019t have any power to deter her.</p><br/><p>Sending her to study at the Moon Pavilion was undoubtedly in order to properly foster his little sister\u2019s courtly etiquette, and being eighteen, it was also about time for her to marry.</p><br/><p>No matter how, he was unable to understand why his always haughty little sister would think so highly of anyone. Even to the extent that when that person was mentioned, she displayed a faint bashfulness.</p><br/><p>As Xue Qinghe saw Tang San sitting there playing, he was also stunned. He unexpectedly couldn\u2019t find the slightest flaw in that youth.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Even more astonishing was that the youth unexpectedly gave him a familiar feeling. He couldn\u2019t say why, it wasn\u2019t because of aura, but rather a kind of natural intuition.</p><br/><p>When simply asking the surrounding nobles about that white clothed youth didn\u2019t yield any answers, Xue Qinghe was even more determined to build a relationship with this youth. Not because of his little sister\u2019s begging yesterday, but rather because that might be a talent capable of becoming a future pillar of the Empire.</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly plucked the harp, his heart very calm, perfectly in accordance with what he revealed on the surface.</p><br/><p>One year\u2019s time had passed. One year ago he couldn\u2019t have thought that he would be playing an instrument in front of everyone today. When he had just started to learn from his aunt, he had been brimming with scepticism.</p><br/><p>However, after one month had passed, Tang San discovered that the direction his father had set him on was correct.</p><br/><p>Cultivating in Slaughter City was in order to train the heart. The Moon Pavilion was the same.</p><br/><p>As he gradually calmed here, recalling everything that had happened in the past four years, as well as his entire process of maturing, he discovered that his mind was exhausted.</p><br/><p>This one year had been the best rest for his mind and body. Even though he didn\u2019t cultivate strenuously, he had gradually internalized everything he had learned in these past several years in this peace. Even the final redoubt of the eight extraordinary meridians, the Governing Vessel, had also gradually opened.</p><br/><p>Fifty seven ranks, this was Tang San\u2019s present spirit power level.</p><br/><p>Rising from forty second or third level to fifty seventh rank in five years was an average of three ranks per year. It didn\u2019t seem comparable to his cultivation speed in the more than two years and the Shrek Academy, but in fact, after passing the fortieth rank, how could the requirements to rise each rank of spirit power compare to before?</p><br/><p>Twenty years old, fifty seventh rank. Tang San had undoubtedly already substantially surpassed Spirit Hall\u2019s Golden Generation. Most importantly was that right now all the abilities he possessed no longer needed Tang San\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Rather, all his capabilities had been harmonized. Tang San had taken the most crucial step to become a power.</p><br/><p>From the hardly concealed praise in his aunt\u2019s eyes these last few months, Tang San knew that it was almost time for him to leave. It was also only thinking of seeing his father that would raise ripples in his calmed heart.</p><br/><p>He had already waited far, far too long for that unknown truth. Despite already having guessed some, how could he be certain without hearing it from his father\u2019s own mouth?</p><br/><p>Tang San knew that his own future road was very long, but this year in the Moon Pavilion was undoubtedly the most transformative of his life. He had already stepped out of his time as a youngster, his twentieth birthday was coming, he was already an adult.</p><br/><p>The graduation ceremony ended smoothly, and each student had received their graduation certificate from Tang Yue-Hua\u2019s hand, delightedly throwing themselves into the arms of their family.</p><br/><p>When Tang Yue-Hua had finished all this, Tang San\u2019s task for the day was also complete. She walked over next to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s performance was pretty good. Outside and inside as one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, lightly caressing the strings, a final pleasant tune drifting out,</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a clear voice resounded,</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie Yue-Hua. Can you give me an introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua turned her head to look, finding a casually dressed crown prince Xue Qinghe gracefully walking over, accompanied by the graduating student Xue Ke.</p><br/><p>She of course knew Xue Ke\u2019s status from long ago, and the majority of students also knew. She even saw Xue Ke look differently at Tang San than at others. Even when Tang San snatched away her original right to perform, this princess still didn\u2019t have a trace of resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua saluted.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe hastily returned the salute,</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie Yue-Hua, what are you doing? Junior can\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua laughed in spite of herself:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t always go calling me \u2018auntie, auntie\u2019, am I so old?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side Xue Ke smartly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course teacher isn\u2019t old, you\u2019re like my older sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled.:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something you would say, girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she shifted slightly, allowing the siblings to clearly see Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you an introduction, This is my nephew, Tang Yin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the word \u2018nephew\u2019, Xue Qinghe couldn\u2019t keep a radiance from flashing through his eyes. Tang San all along calmly observed this crown prince that had once previously given him a good impression.</p><br/><p>In the five years since they met, this crown prince had become even steadier. His appearance hadn\u2019t changed much, but his reserved scholarly temperament still gave people a very good impression.</p><br/><p>His casual ease was somewhat similar to Ning Fengzhi, though whether that was because of deliberate imitation was unknown.</p><br/><p>But from the change in his expression when he heard his aunt\u2019s introduction, it could be assumed that he knew his aunt\u2019s true identity. And that his aunt also didn\u2019t hide anything for him should be because she had a great deal of trust in the crown prince.</p><br/><p>Without batting an eyelid on the surface, Tang San had already analysed a great many things in his mind. He pondered over whether to reveal his identity to the crown prince.</p><br/><p>This thought only flashed through his mind, and was very soon suppressed by Tang San. He knew that even if Xue Qinghe was worthy of trust, right now still wasn\u2019t the time. He needed to go seek confirmation of his conjecture from his father. If he really needed the support of the crown prince\u2019s strength to help defend against mutual aggressors later, it wouldn\u2019t be too late to be honest then. In any case, he wouldn\u2019t be recognized with his current appearance.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe equally observed Tang San. Close up, he couldn\u2019t help being even more attracted by the quiet elegance Tang San displayed. Especially when he heard Tang Yue-Hua say he was her nephew was even more startling. As crown prince, just like Tang San judged, he was one of a small number of people who knew Tang Yue-Hua\u2019s true identity. The gossip in the outside world about Tang Yue-Hua and Emperor Xue Ye was only laughable.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Yin, this is Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s present crown prince, his Highness Xue Qinghe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua also introduced for Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San showed a smile, slightly saluting Xue Qinghe,</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>He also smiled and nodded to Xue Ke next to Xue Qinghe\u2019s side, counting as a greeting. The two were after all classmates, and didn\u2019t need excessive courtesy.</p><br/><p>If it was the previous Tang San, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have faked an expression for a miss like Xue Ke who constantly tried to get close to him, but after studying with his aunt for a year, he had already come to understand how to bury his true mood deeply.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve long ago heard my little sister talk about an eminently talented youth at the Moon Pavilion, today I see the reputation truly isn\u2019t in vain. Brother Tang Yin, if there\u2019s time we should sit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the status of crown prince, for him to use the tone of commoners to communicate with Tang San, Xue Qinghe absolutely considered it respect for the lower ranked. Xue Ke to the side couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, you definitely have to call me then. I still have a lot of things I want to ask Tang Yin about the harp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf brother Tang Yin doesn\u2019t object, I won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a few simple words, he amply displayed his respect for Tang San. It was undoubtedly very easy for him to obtain a favorable impression.</p><br/><p>Tang San still wore a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must disappoint your Highness. Now that I\u2019ve graduated, I must make a trip. If fate wills it, I will definitely make a visit on my return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe looked distracted a moment. He hadn\u2019t thought Tang San would still reject him without the slightest hesitation under circumstances like these, but he immediately understood when Tang San looked at him sincerely. The counterpart wasn\u2019t evading, but was rather truly occupied.</p><br/><p>With a faint laugh, Xue Qinghe said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will await your return. We won\u2019t trouble you, little sister, we should go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Xue Qinghe took the initiative to raise his hand to Tang San. Shaking hands was the simplest and most casual etiquette between nobles.</p><br/><p>Tang San raised his hand and clasped Xue Qinghe\u2019s. Immediately, a trace of gentle spirit power transmitted from Xue Qinghe\u2019s palm. Tang San\u2019s heart twitched. Judging by the counterpart\u2019s spirit power, this crown prince wasn\u2019t weak! In their acquaintance before, he had never seen Xue Qinghe act.</p><br/><p>If Tang San could be described as slightly shocked, then Xue Qinghe was astonished. The spirit power he sent into Tang San\u2019s hand was very gentle, even if Tang San wasn\u2019t a Spirit Master, it still wouldn\u2019t have hurt him. But he was shocked to discover that the spirit power he sent into Tang San unexpectedly disappeared without a sound.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t encounter any existence, nor any other sensation. It was as if after that spirit power had entered Tang San\u2019s body, it no longer had any relation to him.</p><br/><p>How did he do it? This youth seemed to truly be a directly related disiciple of the Clear Sky School, and should moreover be an extremely outstanding elite. This was Xue Qinghe\u2019s first thought. He of course wouldn\u2019t probe Tang San again, and very naturally let go of his hand, pulling his little sister away with a smile.</p><br/><p>When Xue Ke left, there was still a reluctant light in her big eyes. If not for long ago having known of Tang San\u2019s identity as a commoner, perhaps she would have revealed her love for him in spite of everything. For a girl of her age, who wouldn\u2019t like a young talent so handsome and confident, and also with such a perfect temperament?</p><br/><p>With the visitors gone, Tang Yue-Hua looked at Tang San putting away the harp next to her and couldn\u2019t help but giggle,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that Xue Ke girl really is passionate about you. Last time she even asked me what level of lord a commoner would have to obtain to marry a princess. Her target was quite clearly you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Raising his head to look at his aunt\u2019s bantering smile, Tang San somewhat helplessly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, you know, I basically won\u2019t consider this right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hesitated a moment, but still nodded.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua somewhat shocked looked at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, you really are a precocious brat. I remember you told me that you were fourteen when you started following your father to cultivate. Don\u2019t tell me you already knew that girlfriend before then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, as a noble lady, making inquiries about others\u2019 private business is rather lacking in manners. That\u2019s what you taught me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I some other person? I\u2019m your aunt. Since your dad isn\u2019t present, I\u2019m your elder. Confess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help shaking his head. At this moment, an enormous longing suddenly rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s been five years, Xiao Wu, are you well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Seeing the loneliness in the corners of Tang San\u2019s eyes, Tang Yue-Hua didn\u2019t ask further. Raising her hand to rub Tang San\u2019s head, looking at this a head taller than her nephew, her beautiful eyes displayed a tender doting love,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, what are you thinking? One can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re still quite emotional. You\u2019re the same as your dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San attentively watched Tang Yue-Hua,</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, can I graduate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua looked distracted a moment, somewhat disappointed saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you in such a hurry to leave me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though they\u2019d only been together a year, Tang Yue-Hua truly liked her highly intelligent blood related nephew. In their generation, the most outstanding and most successful were undoubtedly her eldest brother the sect master, Tang Hao, and her. Even though she wasn\u2019t a formidable Spirit Master, the power grasped in her hand was enough to make anyone feel dread.</p><br/><p>However, among the direct relations of the Tang family, those not quite as outstanding disciples had all opened their branches and scattered their leaves, producing the next generation, even so much that the generation after that had already appeared. But as the once pride of the Tang family, the sect master was a bachelor, she was unmarried, and Tang Hao had ended up like that.</p><br/><p>One might say that Tang San was the only issue of the three siblings, and she regarded this nephew as a son.</p><br/><p>Tang San equally respected Tang Yue-Hua. He truly had received maternal care from this apparently graceful and beautiful aunt. Even if Tang Yue-Hua was somewhat long-winded, Tang San discovered that he actually rather liked her kind of deeply concerned wordiness. What Tang Yue-Hua gave him was a kind of affection that Tang Hao and Grandmaster never could.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Tang San respected this aunt especially much. He was also especially close to her. That he didn\u2019t tell Tang Yue-Hua about Xiao Wu was because he didn\u2019t want his aunt to worry for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt. You know I\u2019m not. But I have to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua sighed lightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. After you\u2019ve seen your father, he will let you return to the sect to acknowledge your ancestors and clan. Child, you\u2019re even more outstanding than your dad was in those days. Even if aunt doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019ve gone through before, aunt believes that you will definitely be able to surpass your father. Remember, no matter when, you mustn\u2019t be impulsive. You must gamble with your life even less. Your father is just too emotional. The reason why he had you study under me, had you learn from me, was mainly in order to temper your temperament, so you won\u2019t make the same mistakes he did. In theory, I shouldn\u2019t be worried about you, you\u2019ve already done very well. But in you still flows the same blood as your dad. Promise aunt that you will always put your own safety first, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded silently. Seeing the kindly gaze in his aunt\u2019s eyes, he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes from turning faintly red.</p><br/><p>Tang Yue-Hua smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go back and get your things in order. I know you\u2019re anxious to see him. Leave tomorrow. In two days I\u2019ll also prepare to go back and take a look at the sect. It\u2019s been a while. If I don\u2019t go back, I reckon eldest brother will scold me. We\u2019ll meet there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart was moved. Of course he understood that Tang Yue-Hua was returning to Clear Sky School for his sake. He wasn\u2019t familiar with the sect\u2019s circumstances, and Tang Yue-Hua hadn\u2019t told him anything.</p><br/><p>But from the Clear Sky School always fading away, one could see that the days of the world\u2019s first sect of his clan hadn\u2019t been easy.</p><br/><p>Tang San originally didn\u2019t have anything to put in order, and even if there were some articles of daily use, he could store them directly in Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. That evening Tang Yue-Hua personally cooked, sitting down to eat several small dishes with Tang San. Before Tang San went to bed, Tang Yue-Hua told him that there was no need to say goodbye when he left tomorrow. That moment, Tang San clearly saw something sparkling and translucent shine in his aunt\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>How could Tang San know that Tang Yue-Hua had once fallen in love with someone, someone she should never have loved. After seeing things clearly, she was never again able to hold any feelings of romance in her heart, and therefore never married. She had once dreamt of having a child, so when Tang Hao brought Tang San, it was like having her dream fulfilled, and consequently Tang Yue-Hua thought of Tang San as her own.</p><br/><p>One year wasn\u2019t a very long time, but Tang Yue-Hua felt as if she had been reborn. In Tang San she saw the future hope of the Clear Sky School. How could she spare any effort in helping this nephew?</p><br/><p>Early morning, after Tang San habitually finished cultivating Purple Demon Eye, he quietly left the Moon Pavilion, without alerting anyone. Right now was just as the sky held the first glimmers of dawn.</p><br/><p>A window on the top floor opened, and Tang Yue-Hua quietly stood there, watching that gradually disappearing white silhouette. A faint smile appeared at the corners of her mouth,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, I\u2019ll wait for you at the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving Heaven Dou City, Tang San no longer held back his speed. Extending his legs, he rushed with all his strength. He had long since committed everything on the sheepskin map Tang Hao gave him to memory. He could easily find the right direction basically without looking at it again.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, five years time had already passed. Five years ago Tang San had been impatient to know the answer. And today, he finally had the right to learn it. Just as his father said, he had already cleansed himself.</p><br/><p>Speeding into the mountains, all bumpy roads were like stepping on flat ground for Tang San. Eight Spider Lances brought him along like a bolt of lightning, finally returning to the mountain range where he once cultivated, how could he still maintain that calm? He only wanted to see his father as soon as possible, to hear him talk about everything in the past.</p><br/><p>Still encircled by the mountains, ten thousand peaks and blue-green folds, in front the rippling sapphire, and still that vast waterfall connecting heaven and earth. Even though he once lived here for two years, when Tang San returned here once again, that feeling of an untroubled heart and pleased spirit hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><br/><p>In the valley, apart from the rumbling of the waterfall, everything was quiet, peaceful.</p><br/><p>Looking at that waterfall that had accompanied him as he grew, Tang San\u2019s gaze roamed, searching for the silhouette of his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deep voice seemed to echo in his hears. Tang San suddenly turned around. That instant, it was as if he froze in place, and his originally excited gaze now turned completely lifeless.</p><br/><p>At the edge of the pool was a familiar figure. But when Tang San saw him once again, there was an unsuppressable tremble in his heart. The changes in temper over the past year seemed to shatter in this instant. The pain in his heart making it hard to breathe.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao stood quietly by the side of the pool, but there was only one leg supporting his body. His entire left leg was cut off at the base. Equally missing was also his right arm. Standing there right now, was unexpectedly a one armed old man.</p><br/><p>His messy hair had even more been rendered snow white.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San practically shuddered as he called out. In a flash, his trembling lower jaw fell in front of Tang Hao.</p><br/><p>Having lost an arm and a leg, Tang Hao seemed very calm. The expression on his face wasn\u2019t as grave and rigid as before, and unexpectedly held a faint smile as he looked at the son who thought him a hero.</p><br/><p>Raising his hand, rubbing Tang San\u2019s head,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019ve come, I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of familiar action was something he had never done before. But right now Tang San\u2019s heart felt like a pincushion.</p><br/><p>Incomparably intense anger agitatedly burst out,</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it, dad, who injured you like this\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of his extreme fury, Tang San\u2019s Deathgod Domain forcefully burst out, the surrounding atmosphere turning ice cold in an instant.</p><br/><p>The smile on Tang Hao\u2019s face didn\u2019t fade,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, what are you doing? Could it be that your aunt taught you in vain in this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at his father\u2019s missing limbs, teardrops flowing uncontrollably. The once youngest Title Douluo had actually turned into this wind blown candle like old man, he was his father!</p><br/><p>The intense killing intent seemed as if it would rip through his chest. At this moment, Tang San\u2019s eyes were already gradually turning blood red.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u2019s expression mended, staring intently at Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cWake up, there\u2019s nobody that could turn me into this. The one who did it, was me. One year ago, after I returned here, I cut off my own right arm and left leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was dumbfounded once again. He was unable to believe that everything in front of him was actually his father\u2019s own work.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao gave a calm smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery astonished? Didn\u2019t you always want to know about my past? Follow me. I\u2019ll bring you someplace.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang Hao swung his remaining left arm. Spirit power erupted, and he shot up. Even though he only had one leg, his speed was still astonishing, and he directly soared towards the waterfall. Left hand pressing down on empty air, with just a burst of spirit power, he had already reached the reef across from the waterfall.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart held far too many questions, and he hastily leapt up, following his father to the rocks.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao didn\u2019t use spirit power to resist the battering of the waterfall, allowing himself to be drenched.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San catching up, he moved once again. With a wave of his left arm, a three meter long, hammer head like a water barrel, immense Clear Sky Hammer abruptly released and soared up. The torrent of water falling from the sky was rolled up by the tremendous spirit power, and Tang Hao also soared up along with his Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But his face had a trace of smile, for the real surprise was now here.</p><br/><p>Blue golden light spanned out and massive life force spread out instantly, engulfing not only the sacred pillar platform and the sea, but also the wide forest along the coastline. The massive life force instantly flooded and became Boundless Nature.</p><br/><p>Eight golden spears were released from Tang San\u2019s back with countless golden threads nimbly combined with the numerous Blue Silver Emperor. It was Blue Silver Domain\u2019s evolved skill \u2018Boundless Nature\u2019 and Eight Spider Lances, both of which came out the same time as the domain itself as a combined skill after consuming the golden threads.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Domain was Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s innate domain. Boosted by the spirit\u2019s own innate domain, the Blue Silver Emperor themselves were thickened in an instant. The soul power that was flowing away stopped suddenly, with every blade of the grass stopping the drain like stingy nobles fighting for their money. When the golden threads were affixed to the Blue Silver Emperor, the draining of the soul power stopped entirely. The battle has become a close fought wrestling.</p><br/><p>The devouring golden threads could not devour the opponent\u2019s power, and Sea Star Douluo could not devour Tang San\u2019s soul power through them as well.</p><br/><p>Sea Star Douluo\u2019s devouring power should not be underestimated. Though it was his third spirit skill, it was in fact the innate skill of his battle spirit, plus he also had a spirit bone which had the exact effect. Once this devouring ability was deployed, it would not pale in comparison to his eighth spirit skill. Even Sea Illusion and Sealance Douluos would suffer a sure defeat if they were to be grabbed like this now.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s devouring golden threads seemed to have an impressive devouring effect, but if compared to Sea Star Douluo\u2019s skill at it, they still had a ways off. However, blue silver domain\u2019s buff and weakening effect closed this gap. Under the pressure of the domain and seagod\u2019s light, the golden threads on the grasses would barely manage to break even. The situation started to change however, when Sea Star Douluo went all out with his devouring. The scales were starting to tip towards Sea Star Douluo. Even so, now would be where he was surprised the most. He couldn\u2019t anticipate that this young individual who got the prestige of Seagod Nine Trials would have such powerful devouring ability. Tang San dared to use this method to compete with him.</p><br/><p>The massive body convulsed as Sea Star Douluo\u2019s ninth spirit ring finally shined. Although Blue Silver Emperor wrapped around the body, it couldn\u2019t completely cover every part of it. The blades of grass that were sucked in had completely turned blue. In the sea, columns of seawater were released like arrows and then sucked in by Sea Star Douluo\u2019s suckers. Tang San then discovered that Sea Star Douluo could use the suckers to filter the seawater and use the energies within to add to his own. Furthermore, the body started becoming slicker while all the suckers were moving irregularly. The devouring continued, but Tang San\u2019s golden threads were getting less able to capture Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body, while the latter\u2019s devouring power became increasingly powerful.</p><br/><p>Several blue halos kept coming from Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body, and as the suckers turned blue in color, his body had also started becoming solid. In the center of the sea, tentacles came out and surrounded the entire area while every tentacle\u2019s suckers were radiating in eyecatching blue glow. The devouring was not only limited to the suckers on Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor, but the ones on the new tentacles also started devouring, and the target was Tang San\u2019s domain\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>This was Sea Star Douluo\u2019s ninth spirit skill, Thousand Touches Ten Thousand Suctions. Devouring any form of energy within the tentacles\u2019 reach, even the domain energies were not exceptions. The energies were then infused to his own, recovering lost energy. Seawater was no doubt his greatest buff. In places which had seawater, the skill\u2019s power would increase by 30 percent. It was an absolutely terrifying ninth spirit skill.</p><br/><p>The best way to counter this ninth skill was in distance. Using distance instead of close contact to attack him. Not being in the range of his devourment, wait until his skill power would run out, then move in for the kill. Sea Star Doulou clearly knew the shortcomings of this spirit skill, therefore, whenever he would deploy this skill, the condition would be that the opponent was already in his devouring range and was already being devoured. Under his ninth spirit skill, the most powerful thing that could be used would also be an ultimate melee skill. Facing Tang San\u2019s Boundless Nature and golden threads\u2019 devourment, the cautious Sea Star Douluo used his strongest skill without hesitation, to prevent further complications.</p><br/><p>Even the usually calm Tang San wouldn\u2019t anticipate that Sea Star Douluo\u2019s ninth spirit skill would be this insane, which completely abandoned attack power and focused on devouring. It could be said that it would be extremely difficult for flightless spirit masters to come out after entering his area of attack. Because if all forms of your attacks could be devoured of their energies and added to his, then the majority of the attack power would be devoured first, and adding the thickness of his flesh and powerful restorative ability into the equation, even if you had a greater strength, being tangled to death would not be a strange matter.</p><br/><p>With no other ideas, Tang San made an instant judgement. Even if he should use his strongest attack now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to break free. Using teleportation to leave the battlefield was also out of question, since that would mean giving up all of the Blue Silver Emperor. With great loss of soul power and the main body itself, a continued battle would spell his own defeat. Therefore, he only had one option left, and that was to keep on countering devourment with devourment.</p><br/><p>Upon eating stimulant pink sausage, the Blue Silver Emperor glowed intensely after stimulation. At the same time, Tang San ate an erect golden fly. Facing such a freakish opponent, he was forced to give his next action some extra insurance.</p><br/><p>The eighth spirit ring glowed and dark red waves came out like a torrent, covering every part of Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body in an instant. The convulsion just now stopped momentarily, but the ninth spirit skill had no signs of disappearing.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s eighth spirit skill first technique, Blue Silver Orca\u2019s Devil Absorption was activated. Forced initiative, absolute effective technique. Three seconds long dizziness befell on Sea Star Douluo, making his movements stop temporarily. But Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Emperor and Sea Star Douluo\u2019s tentacles were tangled, and with the suckers, he could never use these three seconds to break free.</p><br/><p>And Tang San had no such intention, as he braced himself and slammed towards Sea Star Douluo like a shooting star towards the moon. Xiao Wu\u2019s figure appeared from behind him for this attack as Tang San couldn\u2019t use the Vast Sea Barrier to hide her any further. The Blue Silver Emperor around Xiao Wu\u2019s waist was released, which flung her through the gap of Sea Star Douluo\u2019s tentacles and into the air. Sea Star Douluo was still dizzy so he couldn\u2019t obstruct her.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018POOF\u2019, Tang San lat the center of Sea Star Douluo\u2019s position and didn\u2019t touch make close bodily contact. Even so, he could feel the pressure from those giant suckers under him. Eight Spider Lances stabbed fiercely into Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body and a bright golden glow shot out.</p><br/><p>Sea Star Douluo\u2019s ninth spirit skill was for devouring, and likewise, Tang San\u2019s Eight Spider Lances were his strongest spirit bone that was used for devouring. As an externally attached spirit bone, up until now, besides the golden threads and for direct attacks, Eight Spider Lances could be said to have just one devouring skill. The majority of the toxins it had was due to Tang San\u2019s consumption of two extreme enchanted herbs.</p><br/><p>This was Tang San\u2019s all or nothing gamble. Under the effects of erect golden fly, Eight Spider Lances\u2019 devouring power was ramped up to 150 percent.</p><br/><p>Fearsome devouring power burst forth in an instant. Though three seconds were short, for Tang San it was enough. In the first second, he landed on Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body, then in the next two seconds, he could clearly see that Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body was drying up rapidly under the fearsome devouring effect of the Eight Spider Lances. Tang San used all of his energy for devouring, and Eight Spider Lance\u2019s toxins made quick way into Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Back when he was facing Deep Sea Demon Whale, Tang San also used Eight Spider Lances to inflict great damage. Now that his strength was two spirit rings greater, and after eating the erect golden fly, the lances\u2019 devouring power had a considerable increase. The lances couldn\u2019t compare with Sea Star Douluo when it came to wide area devourment, but it was another story if it was a small area instead. Unless Sea Star Douluo\u2019s suckers could be stacked together, then they couldn\u2019t be compared to the lances.</p><br/><p>In just two short seconds, Tang San devoured as much spirit power from the dizzy Sea Star Douluo as the amount he spent using Blue Silver Orca Devil\u2019s Absorption, while the toxins managed to enter Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body as well. He knew that Sea Star Douluo had the ability to use poison, so his poison resistance would be considerable, on top of being a Title Douluo. Even if the Eight Spider Lances had toxins, they wouldn\u2019t just take his life right off. That\u2019s why Tang San attacked in such a way without reservations.</p><br/><p>With the Eight Spider Lances\u2019 point of entry as the focus, the gigantic starfish was becoming dry from the middle while convulsing. When Sea Star Douluo came to consciousness after dizziness, he was taken by complete surprise. Spirit power and life force were fading away rapidly from eight wounds, while extreme cold and heat, polarizing sensations that could turn anyone insane with pain, were spreading inside the body, paralyzing his \u2018five limbs\u2019 for a moment. The spirit power\u2019s flow slowed down, while keeping up the ninth spirit skill became difficult.</p><br/><p>When he felt that the Eight Spider Lances could bring such terrifying sensations after piercing his body, Sea Star Douluo panicked. He struggled with all his might, intending to knock Tang San away with his movements. But, Tang San stuck on him firmly like a festering maggot as the limbs were fastened onto the body by the Blue Silver Emperor. The more the struggle, the faster the loss of soul power and life force.</p><br/><p>In exact opposite, as the devouring dragged on, Tang San\u2019s blue golden light became brighter. After taking in massive amounts of energy, the earlier losses were rapidly compensated. Even the devouring golden threads could gradually suppress the powerless tentacles. Facing the opponent that could counter he himself in a certain caliber, Tang San chose the most proper fighting style, and finally got the lead after using Eight Spider Lances which evolved several times, taking full and firm control of the entire situation.</p><br/><p>Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body gradually became half scorching hot, and half freezing cold. His defenses and self recovery were powerful, but he was completely helpless upon facing such fearsome toxins. He could only delay the speed of the spread, but he couldn\u2019t stop the devouring of his energies. At this point the battle\u2019s outcome was decided. Xiao Wu descended slowly from mid-air, and Tang San even used a Blue Silver Emperor to wrap around her waist, supporting her descent. Now he didn\u2019t even let Xiao Wu\u2019s soul enter her body. It was better to have options when there were still two more challenges ahead.</p><br/><p>The Eight Spider Lances under the effects of erect golden fly was too terrifying, to the point that Sea Star Douluo\u2019s ninth spirit skill broke down. The tentacles in the sea fell down quickly and the suckers\u2019 color were fading. Even his own body was shrinking rapidly as he condensed his energies to halt the advance of the devouring and toxins.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdmit defeat, senior.\u201d After saying that, Tang San suddenly stopped the devouring and didn\u2019t keep it up. Because he clearly felt Sea Star Douluo\u2019s heartbeats. Finding the opponent\u2019s heart meant that Sea Star Douluo had no more strength to protect himself. If this went on, there would be an irreversible damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI lost.\u201d A somewhat weak voice came. Though Sea Star Douluo wasn\u2019t happy, he was also not too upset. After all, four other partners before him also suffered similar fates.</p><br/><p>The Eight Spider Lances didn\u2019t leave Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body, but quickly took back the ice and flame toxins while returning the life force that was taken instead. Of course, Tang San wouldn\u2019t return the spirit power that was taken since Sea Star Douluo could always get it back through meditation, and Tang San needed it to compensate for what he used in this trial.</p><br/><p>With an ripping sound, the Eight Spider Lances left Sea Star Douluo\u2019s body, and the massive starfish of a body quickly shrinked back to human form, which was the weird man seen at the beginning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat power you used on me was from an external spirit bone?\u201d Sea Star Douluo\u2019s voice was very hoarse, and sounded very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Grabbing Xiao Wu, Tang San nodded, \u201cIt was my external spirit bone, Eight Spider Lances.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sigh, Sea Star Douluo muttered, \u201cNo wonder! My most deft devouring skill lost to yours. My defeat is without objections. You won.\u201d Tang San already showed him mercy and didn\u2019t bring him real harm, so he wouldn\u2019t find any issue in all of this. While he said that, his left hand extended in length and smacked on the sacred pillar. Just then, star shaped slivers of light flowed out of the pillar and landed on Tang San and Xiao Wu. The test of the fifth sacred pillar was finally passed.</p><br/><p>After thanking Sea Star Douluo, Tang San carried Xiao Wu on his back and returned to the coast without rest, and hurried to the next stop after rendezvous with their companions. Next up, they had to face the last couple of challenges, which would undoubtedly be the hardest among all seven. Tang San had to face the most powerful of sacred pillar guardians, the Sea Dragon Douluo at the very end, and Zhu Zhuqing in Black Class Fifth Trial had to undergo her own final test as well. For the last test, she had to face what was considerably harder than other Black Class tests. After passing it, she would be regarded as having the seagod\u2019s approval and become one of Seagod Island\u2019s members. The prestige would also be the same as Guardian Douluos of the seven sacred pillars.</p><br/><p>When traversing the forest, Tang San spoke to Zhu Zhuqing, \u201cZhuqing, don\u2019t force yourself in the next challenge. If things don\u2019t go well, then admit defeat to conserve your strength. After I defeat the Sea Witch, you will be able to win after trying again as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing knew of Tang San\u2019s good intentions of course. She looked at the nodding Dai Mubai and let out a smile with her cold face, \u201cThank you, San Ge, but I believe I can succeed. You\u2019ve done so much for us in the earlier tests. It is appropriate that I repay you. Don\u2019t forget, besides you and Mubai, my spirit power is the highest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s current spirit power was level 78. As Dai Mubai managed to make it past level 80, the next one to break through the stage of Spirit Douluo would be her. As the team\u2019s genuine agility attack spirit master, she wouldn\u2019t give in that easily. Perhaps she didn\u2019t have Dai Mubai\u2019s resilient body, or Ma Hongjun\u2019s fearsome burst of strength, but she had the speed they didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>Tang San wouldn\u2019t dampen Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s confidence. He looked at Rongrong and said, \u201cHow about you, Rongrong? Can you still hold up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong also took part in three challenges. She seemed to just support others behind them, but in fact, her consumption of spirit power was the greatest except for Tang San. For the victory of companions, she had to give it her all. With Oscar\u2019s sausages as guarantee, every time Tang San fought alone he could rest for a time. But she wasn\u2019t like Tang San who had cleared his eight extraordinary meridians and could recover spirit power anytime anywhere, so her state was far from the one before. Still, she nodded, for only the final battle was left. After assisting Zhu Zhuqing, she would also complete her own fifth trial.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t say anything else and everyone rushed on. Dai Mubai rested after the two battles earlier and recovered his spirit power after Oscar\u2019s sausage. He engaged his White Tiger transformation and took Ning Rongrong, Oscar and Zhu Zhuqing on their way. When they arrived at the sixth sacred pillar, the Sea Witch Sacred Pillar, the golden light in the sky showed that the time had passed the 16th hour. From how it looked, there was still enough time, while Tang San still had 56 hours to complete the later challenges.</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t rest, for the outcome of this battle was very important. It concerned whether Zhu Zhuqing could pass all of her tests and offer further consultation. His soul power had recovered up to 80 percent after all the devouring earlier, but the fatigue he experienced in the previous five battles was far from soothed. Every battle was about facing Title Douluo class powerful opponents, and the Sea Illusion Douluo battle was especially taxing. Even with Boundless level spiritual force, he still felt fatigued. Fortunately there was plenty of time. Until the sixth battle was over, he would have enough time to rest.</p><br/><p>The Sea Witch Sacred Pillar\u2019s platform had an incredibly simple form, as it was just a square. But the pillar itself at the center of the platform was different from the others. Rather than a pillar, it should be called a statue. The exterior was like an ivory color. A statue of a maiden, kneeling on top of the platform with both hands clasped together before the chest, facing the Seagod Hall in prayers. Although it was a statue, the devout look on the face was vivid and lifelike.</p><br/><p>At the edge of the platform, a young girl sat there. What was surprising was that she had a large fishtail. A beautiful arc extended to the waist. Her fishtail was hitting the surface of the sea light, and the upper body was clad in a black shirt without covering the midriff. She had large sky colored eyes, and rather than the ocean, her face would be like the beauty of the blue sky, as her lips formed a constant smile while the fishtail slapped continuously on the seawater with glee. Feeling the arrival of the Shrek Seven Devils, she raised her head and looked towards the coastside. \u201cAre you here to challenge me?\u201d Her voice came like it had the ringing of bells. The pleasant sounding voice couldn\u2019t raise any hostilities in anyone.</p><br/><p>The young girl appeared to be so, but everyone knew that as the Guardian Douluo of the sacred pillar, Sea Witch Pillar, her actual age wouldn\u2019t be much less than those of other Guardian Douluos.</p><br/><p>Tang San bowed down and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to ask senior\u2019s guidance. Please be lenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll start off easy.\u201d This surprised everyone, as this Sea Witch Douluo actually nodded and consented, while no ulterior movements could be seen from her look of naivete. The Shrek Seven Devils all thought, \u2018Is she really this young?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you weirded out about? No need to feel that way. I\u2019m not a human, but part of the mermaid race. Half human half sea spirit beast I suppose. We mermaid females will never get old. I\u2019m not a monster. Heehee.\u201d Sea Witch Douluo giggled as she explained. After hearing what she said, while everyone didn\u2019t pay it much attention, Tang San\u2019s expression changed drastically, \u201cMind reading?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sea Witch Douluo was also surprised when looking at Tang San, \u201cYeah! You actually saw through my innate ability. Looks like you\u2019re strong! This is bad, this is bad, I might lose today. Why can\u2019t I see through your heart?\u201d Her beautiful expression was centered by curiosity, and she soon saw Tang San\u2019s golden trident brand on his forehead, which caught her off guard, \u201cI see, you\u2019re that human who had the honor of getting the Seagod Nine Trials! With the protection of seagod\u2019s light, no wonder I can\u2019t see through you. You\u2019re all very bad, you want to beat me by relaying. How can you stand for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Sea Witch\u2019s joking nature, the Shrek Seven Devils were speechless, and the one struck the most was Dai Mubai. This Sea Witch no doubt had a great charm to her. He would rather struggle against Sealance Douluo and not willing to face such an opponent. Fortunately, this challenge was to be taken by Zhu Zhuqing, a female.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our test. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we can stand for it or otherwise.\u201d Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s cold voice broke Sea Witch\u2019s voice. Taking Ning Rongrong and soaring through the surface of the sea, they landed before the sacred pillar after a few jumps.</p><br/><p>Sea Witch didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of attacking them and just stared with wide eyed curiosity, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you two big sisters. It\u2019s my first time seeing girls as beautiful as I am.\u201d This wasn\u2019t self exaggeration. In terms of looks, she really was on the same level as Zhu Zhuqing and Ning Rongrong, even more when the two women didn\u2019t have the grace of the sea.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing shielded Rongrong behind her. While unleashing her own spirit Ning Rongrong couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cBig sister? Let me ask senior, what age are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sea Witch Douluo twiddled her fingers naively as the long fishtail raised from the seawater, landing on the platform before turning into a pair of legs with a black long skirt covering them. \u201cI can\u2019t remember. Something like 96 or 97? Wah, big sis, your expression is so unpleasant! I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re old since we mermaids have five times the lifespan of you humans. According to your calculations, I\u2019m not even twenty. Calling you big sisters should be appropriate right. Look, this statue was my ancestor. When we leave seawater, we turn into human in appearance but only for a short amount of time, otherwise we die. My grandpa is now the chief of mermaids. He said I have exceptional talent just once in ten thousand years, so he sent me to guard this sacred pillar. But it\u2019s so boring here. I don\u2019t like this monotonous life, but I can\u2019t leave here. You two big sisters, since you\u2019re so beautiful, let\u2019s not fight like we\u2019re killing each other ok? I\u2019ll blow you a tune. When it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll pass. How\u2019s that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Her left hand moved a bit, and a black short flute appeared in her grasp. She spinned it around and took it to her lips with both hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her blow it and attack immediately. Rongrong, no domain. Attack in full force!\u201d Tang San didn\u2019t use telepathy, but screamed it out.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing and Ning Rongrong had their hostilities lowered by Sea Witch\u2019s words, but Tang San\u2019s voice was like an absolute command for them. Almost on a reflex, Zhu Zhuqing kicked out and turned into a series of afterimages to attack Sea Witch. Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda also appeared and the first buff on Zhu Zhuqing was agility. Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s body became illusory for a moment. Razor sharp cat claws were set to grab on Sea Witch\u2019s wrists and black flute.</p><br/><p>Sea Witch\u2019s brows curled as the light of her surroundings became a mirage. Nine neatly positioned spirit rings appeared around the black flute. The second spirit ring glowed, and in the mirage, her figure became wavy. Although she couldn\u2019t completely avoid Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s rapid attacks, the black flute in her hand resisted three blows, repelling Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s cat claws. She glared at Tang San at the coast, \u201cYou are a bad person. Not even a single tender thought for the fairer sex. So mean. My flute\u2019s tune is very good you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she said that, Zhu Zhuqing and Ning Rongrong\u2019s expressions had darkened. When the nine spirit rings appeared on the black flute, they knew they fell for a trap just now. If they really let Sea Witch play a tune, no one could tell what would happen next.</p><br/><p>Sea Witch didn\u2019t seem to mind being caught on one bit. Her figure slipped off while evading and blocking Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s attacks at the same time. She spoke a little urgently, \u201cBig sisters, don\u2019t listen to that bad person. Just listen to my tune. It\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing didn\u2019t pay her attention, but her mind was gradually being filled. This Sea Witch didn\u2019t use a lot to block against her attacks, and she appeared to be a Tool Spirit Master. The difficulty of this challenge would be worryingly great.</p><br/><p>Under Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s hail of attacks, Sea Witch was somehow displeased and curled her lips, \u201cThis big sis, how can you be like this? You\u2019re a girl. Why are you so rude like those guys. But, I won\u2019t blame you still. Have a tune.\u201d</p><br/><p>While saying that, Sea Witch\u2019s body slipped in a flash, avoided Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s cat claws, vaulted backwards and fell towards the sea.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing wouldn\u2019t let her opponent off easily, so she chased fiercely. Third spirit skill Hell Execution erupted in an instant. Using Ning Rongrong\u2019s speed and attack buff, even when this was just her third spirit skill, for swift attack spirit masters, having this speed would also mean greater increase of attack power.</p><br/><p>Black figure in the air chased Sea Witch in the middle of backflipping, but everyone on the coast heard the bell-ringing voice, \u201cBig sis, you fell for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A circle of bizarre waves expanded from Sea Witch, covering Zhu Zhuqing and herself then actually shut off Ning Rongrong\u2019s buffs by force. Sea Witch shifted in the air by three feet horizontally and dodged Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s pounce. As soon as the toes landed on the seawater\u2019s surface, the two legs turned back into a fishtail. With a twist, the large fishtail smashed against the falling Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>At this point, Dai Mubai was very worried. He could tell that Sea Witch\u2019s attack and explosive force weren\u2019t that great, but her skills were variable and numerous. Complimenting her mind reading and looks which people would easily fall for, she had firmly controlled Zhu Zhuqing and Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>Just then, Zhu Zhuqing suddenly disappeared as Sea Witch swam towards the air with waves of distortion behind the fishtail. Her clear eyes had traces of fear, showing that she didn\u2019t understand why this would happen. Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s mind could understand the mind reading, but everything before her was happening too quick.</p><br/><p>Of course Zhu Zhuqing wouldn\u2019t disappear for real, because when the fishtail slammed her, her body was split up. That\u2019s right. It separated into dozens of figures scattered in mid-air. Every figure was seemingly real, and using the seawater\u2019s surface, they charged at Sea Witch at the same time. What she used was her own fourth spirit skill, Hell Shadow Doppelg\u00e4nger. Just then, Ning Rongrong at the coast side didn\u2019t apply buffs in a hurry, but flashed away and hid behind the sacred pillar.</p><br/><p>The situation had changed, and Sea Witch\u2019s adapting speed was incredibly quick. Facing multi directional attacks, her body suddenly sped up, heading downwards instead of evading. With a plop, she disappeared into the seawater.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s thoughts were surely affected by mind reading, but Tang San\u2019s telepathy managed to let her make a difference.

Hear my command, everyone leave immediately, report the Clear Sky School\u2019s reappearance to the city master, go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time as he roared, he was already lunging straight at Tang San, the Blood Devil Axe in his hand glittering with light, a black seventh spirit ring becoming an enormous black light and entering the axe with a flash. In that instant, the Blood Devil Axe in his hand suddenly expanded, becoming the size of a cartwheel in the blink of an eye, chopping towards Tang San with an intense blood reeking aura, like a red bolt of lightning appearing in midair.</p><br/><p>With their leader\u2019s orders, those low level spirit masters turned and ran. These people also counted as quick witted, no two escaped in the same way, and rather headed in different directions, with the agility attack spirit masters running furthest ahead. The compound wasn\u2019t small, but they still only needed a few breaths of time to escape with their speed. If several dozen spirit masters escaped at the same time, into the winding streets outside, even with Tang San\u2019s strength it would be a lot of trouble to kill them all.</p><br/><p>The spirit avatar state Blood Devil Axe was undoubtedly extremely powerful, this was a Spirit Emperor upper range Spirit Sage doing his all, all in order to give his comrades the chance to escape, and at the same time also personally try the feeling of contesting with a Clear Sky School power. He firmly believed that as long as the opponent wasn\u2019t far more powerful than him, even if he couldn\u2019t win, he\u2019d still have the chance to escape. After all, at the Spirit Sage level, if you focused on running, you would be extremely difficult to intercept.</p><br/><p>But confronted with that Blood Devil Axe falling like red lightning, Tang San only used one very simple gesture to dissolve the opponent\u2019s all out attack. Raising his right hand, the dark green Seagod Trident rose with power to sear the Heavens. He didn\u2019t even use any spirit power.</p><br/><p>A loud clang echoed. The red light shattered in that instant, and the Seagod Trident didn\u2019t even tremble. Only the magic lines on its surface rippled with a faint dull golden color. But that spirit avatar state Blood Devil Axe was shattered into splinters.</p><br/><p>With the spirit shattering, the spirit master who possessed it naturally wouldn\u2019t be feeling good. Blood Devil Axe Spirit Sage vomited blood, thrown several dozen meters into the air. When the Clear Sky Hammer smashed into his back, shattering all his bones into inch-sized pieces, he still couldn\u2019t understand how he was defeated so miserably. He hadn\u2019t even glanced one of the opponent\u2019s spirit rings. A spirit avatar attack facing a casual swing of a polearm, was somehow completely crushed.</p><br/><p>Let alone that he was surprised, Tang San who was using the Seagod Trident for the first time also stared blankly, so much so that he even let the fastest of the Spirit Empire spirit masters reach the compound wall.</p><br/><p>Originally Tang San only wanted to use the Seagod Trident to ward off the opponent\u2019s attack, and then win with the Clear Sky Hammer. With the trident\u2019s one hundred eight thousand weight, even if the opponent was using spirit avatar he still likely couldn\u2019t harm him. But who would have thought that, on meeting the Seagod Trident, that Blood Devil Axe actually directly turned to fragments. That moment, Tang San didn\u2019t even feel the trident vibrate.</p><br/><p>This was the true power of a divine tool? Worthy of the weapon the Seagod once used! Just the physical destructive power alone had already reached such a frightening degree. With it, the attack power Tang San lacked before was completely complemented, and the spirit power savings was difficult to estimate.</p><br/><p>The outcome of their confrontation was settled as soon as they met. If someone with Blood Devil Axe Spirit Sage\u2019s strength couldn\u2019t stop Tang San for an instant, how could Tang San give those other Spirit Hall spirit masters the chance to run?</p><br/><p>With a pop, blue light flashed and vanished from Tang San\u2019s forehead. In answer, a ray of blue light also flitted across that rhombic gem on the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>In that instant, all the escaping spirit masters felt their bodies slow down, as if they were dumped into a stormy sea. Enormous energy pressed their mental worlds. Starting from the weakest, one spirit master after another went limp on the ground. They weren\u2019t dead, but their spirits were broken, turning them into imbeciles.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s control over spiritual force could be called meticulous. He didn\u2019t kill any more, but what was the difference between killing these people and turning them into idiots? Spirit Hall\u2019s spirit masters had been acting oppressively for so many years, especially inside the city, getting used to being arrogant and despotic, harming countless ordinary people. Ending up like this was fully deserved.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, everything became quiet again. What Tang San used was strictly speaking one of the Vast Sea Cosmic Shroud\u2019s four abilities, now also branded onto his skull bone, the Vast Sea Wild Wave. A group mental attack ability. Even though the single target attack power couldn\u2019t compare to the Purple Demon Eye, it won out in attack range. These spirit masters under rank sixty had no hope to resist.</p><br/><p>Covering the Seagod Trident with a cloth again, Tang San strolled out of the spirit master encampment. What happened here would be discovered, so how could he wait for those unconscious soldiers to wake up again.</p><br/><p>Tang San first found a night open public bath to wash. Even though he wasn\u2019t stained with any blood, but that imperceptible smell of blood was something Xiao Wu couldn\u2019t stand. He washed himself, changed his clothes, then hid himself and flew off, leaving the city. Once the sky turned bright, he had already brought Xiao Wu to the next city in the Spirit Empire\u2019s H\u00e4agen-Dazs province.</p><br/><p>West Lu City, early morning, before the sky was bright, all the high levels and nobles in the city were in an uproar. In the city guard spirit master encampment, of more than eighty spirit masters, forty six had met a violent death, and thirty seven had become idiots. The dead even included the Spirit Empire\u2019s commander in West Lu City, Blood Axe Spirit Saint. For a moment, West Lu City was on the brink of panic. The city lord instantly ordered the city sealed, immediately sending people to report to Spirit Empire\u2019s capital, Spirit City.</p><br/><p>Of course, that city lord also understood that sealing the city was basically useless. How could the soldiers and officers under his command resist people with the strength to kill more than eighty spirit master? All he could do was pray that those killers wouldn\u2019t come looking for him.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Empire had their own communication methods. The news had already reached Spirit City in just one day\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>Hu Liena sat upright in the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s official business hall, Yan and Xie Yue on either side of her. Reading the dispatch in front of her, she couldn\u2019t help frowning.</p><br/><p>Xie Yue said in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the report, the people we sent to West Lu City should have been ambushed, then completely annihilated. Moreover, the ambushers should all be experts, the majority of them were killed with blunt weapons. I know Blood Devil Axe Spirit Sage Stanford, rank seventy four. Tool spirit sage, quite considerable strength. One on one, I couldn\u2019t defeat him. He actually died with every bone in his body broken, he should have been hit by a powerful spirit ability attack. Those people who turned into idiots should have suffered a mental type spirit ability attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan slammed the table, saying angrily:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s people. They\u2019ve got some guts. They actually dare ambush us. The loss of more than eighty spirit masters isn\u2019t a small number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to say. Even if those subordinate provinces have all acknowledged the empire, they were after all kingdoms and duchies before, it\u2019s not out of the question for them to move. Every nation has a group of experts. Of course, this possibility would be quite low. It would be very difficult for even Title Douluo to kill so many of our people undetected, the enemy wouldn\u2019t consist of a small number. Only attacking simultaneously from multiple directions could achieve this kind of result.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Liena\u2019s brows tightened,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to judge the circumstances based only on this one document. It seems it\u2019s necessary to make a trip. Her Majesty isn\u2019t present, with something of this scale, if it can\u2019t be handled appropriately, we won\u2019t be able to account for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan immediately said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNana, let me go. I\u2019ll bring a squad of elites. I can definitely catch the trail of those people. If it was Heaven Dou Empire, then once Her Majesty returns, isn\u2019t that an even better justification to go to war?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Liena shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be reassured if you alone go. Since they dare do this, there\u2019s definitely some plot. I\u2019ll go personally. Big brother, you and Yan take charge here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, before Her Majesty left she put the empire\u2019s affairs in your hands, how can you leave that easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan immediately said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Nana, you can\u2019t go. I\u2019d be better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Liena shook her head, her beautiful eyes showing her resolve:</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me, right now the empire is already on the right track, developing more and more prosperously with each day, and there are no enemies that would dare invade our Spirit City, nor anything major going on. But the occurrence in West Lu City is similar to the destruction of the Gengxin City Hall more than four years ago. It\u2019s very difficult to tell who\u2019s behind it. I received Her Majesty\u2019s trust, I have to take a look at this personally to be at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Spirit Hall founded a nation, Hu Liena\u2019s status also rose like a boat with the tide. The title of Holy Maiden didn\u2019t change, becoming the Spirit Empire Holy Maiden, her authority second only to Supreme Pontiff Bibi Dong, with the right to deploy the Spirit Empire\u2019s armies and imperial spirit masters apart from Elder Hall. As time passed, her strength had also come to surpass Xie Yue and Yan by far, becoming the one of the Golden Generation most hopeful to break through rank seventy before age thirty. Even though Yan had always pursued her, Hu Liena had never feigned interest in that regard, putting her all into helping Bibi Dong establish the empire, as well as develop it, deeply earning Bibi Dong\u2019s confidence. When she had made a decision, even Xie Yue couldn\u2019t easily oppose.</p><br/><p>\u201cNana, then won\u2019t you please invite two elders to accompany you? The opponent isn\u2019t weak, you can\u2019t be in any danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue spoke with some concern.</p><br/><p>Hu Liena shook her head:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, Her Majesty already brought six elders away, there needs to be a few elders left to oversee Spirit City. Even if the enemy won\u2019t likely attack here, the capital is the foundation of the empire, it can\u2019t be allowed to be shaken. You deal with everyday affairs, and if a powerful enemy invades, ask the elders to act. As for me, you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ll bring a Nirvana Squad with me. That\u2019s enough to deal with any circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. But be careful on the road anyway. Don\u2019t let those provincial officials know who you are before you reach West Lu City. In the off chance they\u2019re plotting something, you\u2019ll still be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Liena nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the imperial capital to you. I\u2019ll leave immediately. If I hurry, I can reach West Lu City in four or five days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Done speaking, she stood and left with large strides.</p><br/><p>Watching Hu Liena\u2019s disappearing back, Yan couldn\u2019t help sighing:</p><br/><p>\u201cNana looks more and more like a leader, only\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue shot him a glance,</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly what? Only she\u2019s still rejecting your love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan smiled bitterly:</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me Xie Yue, we grew up together, so why doesn\u2019t Nana like me? I remember when we were small, she was still very good to me! Isn\u2019t it because of that Tang San?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue said helplessly:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t know either. Only, I often see Nana look like something\u2019s weighing on her. Don\u2019t think too much about it, give up if there\u2019s no hope. Speaking of. You\u2019re also close to thirty, you should find a partner. Don\u2019t get held up because of Nana.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan said hatefully:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely because of that Tang San. That bastard pretending to be some Tang Yin, deceiving Nana\u2019s feelings. Don\u2019t let me see him again, or I\u2019ll rip his corpse into ten thousand pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold light flashed in Xie Yue\u2019s eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San really is difficult to deal with. Even though I\u2019m confident in you, if it really came to a one on one against him, do you have any certainty? Don\u2019t forget how many people he finished back then when you had him surrounded. Each one had strength beyond his. This guy is too dreadful. Especially when that spirit beast lover of his sacrificed herself for him, he\u2019s carried a bone deep hatred for us for a long time. Only, strangely, for these past few years, we\u2019ve spent enormous manpower to track him down, but never found a clue. It\u2019s a lot like he disappeared into nothingness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of Tang San\u2019s strength in the Star Dou Great Forest back then, Yan couldn\u2019t help being a bit disappointed,</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know how that guy cultivated. Even when younger than us, his spirit power wasn\u2019t lower than ours. But scariest were all those tricks he had. Anyway, nevermind him. Xie Yue, Nana wouldn\u2019t be in danger when she\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bringing a Nirvana squad, what danger could she be in? Those are Her Majesty\u2019s personally trained experts. They\u2019re the strength our Spirit Hall has saved for decades. There are altogether five Nirvana squads, each led by five Spirit Douluo level powers, with another twenty Spirit Sage level experts. As long as it\u2019s not at least three Title Douluo, there won\u2019t be a problem. And they\u2019ve also trained together for so many years, they\u2019re extremely well coordinated. With these experts along, who could still touch Nana?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue, I\u2019m worried for nothing. Only, I\u2019m still concerned! To tell the truth, there really isn\u2019t any other woman in my heart besides Nana. I believe I will definitely move her one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Yue and Yan\u2019s confidence in the Nirvana squad was shaken over the next couple of days. In a short two days, the received five urgent reports in succession of the guarding spirit master regiments in five cities suffering devastating attacks one after another. There were unexpectedly no conscious survivors. Adding West Lu City from before, more than five hundred spirit masters guarding six strategic towns were either dead or idiots. The dead also had nothing in common with each other, the most miserable spirit master regiment died smashed to pieces. The loss of more than five hundred spirit masters, even the Spirit Empire which controlled the vast majority of spirit masters couldn\u2019t take it!</p><br/><p>But Xie Yue and Yan unfortunately could do nothing about it, they didn\u2019t have the authority to deploy the Nirvana squads. Helplessly, they could only send one order after another for all cities and garrisoned Spirit Empire spirit masters to be alert, and prepare to respond to enemy attack at any time. After this, all they could do was wait for news from Hu Liena or for Bibi Dong to return.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Sitting cross legged on a hill, Tang San inhaled and exhaled the purple qi. Even though his Purple Demon Eye had already been cultivated to the Boundless level, he still didn\u2019t abandon a cultivation habit formed over so many years.</p><br/><p>The fresh and clean air seemed to carry away the bloody smell from his mouth and nose, and especially the sweet fragrance from the plants on the hill calmed his heart.</p><br/><p>The constant killing wasn\u2019t anything to Tang San\u2019s strength, the Deathgod Domain had even improved somewhat, his spirit power was also only a narrow line away from rank eighty five. However, the constant slaughter also seemed to bring him back to that time in Slaughter City, and that bloody feeling made it very difficult to calm down. Tang San knew that he couldn\u2019t keep going like this, otherwise he\u2019d very easily lose his heart to the influence of the killing intent.</p><br/><p>With killing several hundred Spirit Hall spirit masters in six towns in succession, his goal could also be considered reached. Due to the slaughter over these few days, he\u2019d never dared let Xiao Wu out. As long as her soul wasn\u2019t back in her body, he\u2019d have her sleep in the Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse.</p><br/><p>After finishing cultivation, Tang San stretched his whole body. Spirit power flowed like mercury into his limbs and bones, unspeakably comfortable, and he picked up the Seagod Trident from the ground. He was growing more and more fond of this divine instrument. He didn\u2019t even need to release it\u2019s true light, just that terrifying weight was enough to deal with a lot of problems. In these days of slaughter, Tang San hadn\u2019t once released his Blue Silver Emperor spirit, just relying on spirit bone abilities and the Clear Sky Hammer and Seagod Trident to easily annihilate those guarding spirit master regiments.</p><br/><p>He was actually secretly looking forward to meeting a somewhat powerful opponent, preferably a Spirit Empire Title Douluo. Like that, he could not only test the Seagod Trident\u2019s true power once, but could at the same time also complete the five Clear Sky School elders\u2019 last task.</p><br/><p>Only, Title Douluo weren\u2019t something you\u2019d find lying about everywhere. In six cities, he had only met two Spirit Sages. He was currently a hundred li away from the city where he\u2019d slaughtered last night, not far from the official road. Tang San had already decided not to keep killing and bring Xiao Wu to hurry to Star Dou Great Forest, completing his most important task.</p><br/><p>Taking a look at the cloth wrapped Seagod Trident in his hand, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone exerted itself, pushing Tang San to soar up high, flying in the direction of Star Dou Great Forest. By his calculations, he could arrive in at most three days.</p><br/><p>Tang San had been flying for a couple of hours when the sky suddenly changed. The sky that had been sunny and cloudless in the morning was gradually shrouded in clouds. A large expanse of clouds appeared in sight, blocking the warmth of the sunlight, cooling the air.</p><br/><p>It was currently early autumn on the Continent, and the air temperature was still quite high. Travelling on a cloudy day like this would be a lot more comfortable than under the scorching sun. Tang San might as well use his full spirit power, and advance quickly.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, suddenly, Tang San\u2019s pulse accelerated a few beats without reason, a throbbing feeling coming from his left hand.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Tang San was alarmed, and hurriedly looked at his left hand. Immediately, he saw strands of black energy circle around his left hand, like silken threads, emanating slightly shuddering.</p><br/><p>Hurriedly pulling up his sleeve, Tang San discovered that the same was the case for his entire left arm, spreading the whole way to his shoulder. The black energy contained an aura he was very familiar with, his second spirit, the Clear Sky Hammer. But, he didn\u2019t trigger it, and he wasn\u2019t cultivating either, so how could something like this suddenly appear?</p><br/><p>Tang San had never been careless. Aware that there was a problem with the Clear Sky Hammer, he landed immediately.</p><br/><p>The Clear Sky Hammer still didn\u2019t have any spirit rings. Even though it had enormous potential, it still couldn\u2019t compare to the eight ring Blue Silver Emperor. Tang San believed that even if it had some problem, he could still deal with it. Immediately, urged by his thoughts, he released the Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Black light flashed, and the Clear Sky Hammer appearing in Tang San\u2019s hand throbbed once, transmitting a kind of excited feeling to Tang San. It was the excitement of bloodthirst. The Deathgod Domain pattern inscribed on the hammer had now turned completely blood red, clearly visible even in daylight, and moreover gradually emerging on the surface of the Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>Bloodthirst, slaughter, terror, all kinds of negative feelings constantly spread from the blood colored pattern. Ever since obtaining the Deathgod Domain, this was the first time Tang San felt the Deathgod Domain react like this on its own. Generally speaking, this sensation should be felt by the enemies enveloped in the Deathgod Domain.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s spiritual force was enormous, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t be influenced by the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s aura. But he was very curious. Even though he had killed a lot of people before, by all reason, even if it had changed somewhat it should still be the Clear Sky Hammer, but it seemed like the problem was with the Deathgod Domain inscribed on the hammer. What was going on?</p><br/><p>However, this couldn\u2019t continue. Who knew what would happen if he was imperceptibly influenced by it. Immediately, Tang San used the most dependable method to deal with it. Golden light blossomed from between his eyebrows, glorious golden Seagod\u2019s Light spreading out, enveloping the Clear Sky Hammer.</p><br/><p>It really was as Tang San expected, even though the Seagod\u2019s Light had no offensive power, it still stemmed from the Seagod\u2019s aura, and under its influence, the Clear Sky Hammer\u2019s Deathgod Domain instantly settled down. The changes on the hammer quickly calmed down, and Tang San felt the slightly irascible influence even he had suffered subsequently calm down. Tang San once again deeply experienced how the seemingly mediocre Seagod\u2019s Light actually possessed nearly omnipotent capabilities. Even though it didn\u2019t count as powerful, it had endless marvellous uses.</p><br/><p>Just as he prepared to recall the Seagod\u2019s Light and take a look at whether the Clear Sky Hammer would keep changing, suddenly, through the Seagod\u2019s Light\u2019s scan, Tang San discovered that the Deathgod Domain carved on the Clear Sky Hammer seemed to maintain a subtle spiritual force connection with the outside world.</p><br/><p>If not for the Seagod\u2019s Light, even Tang San\u2019s boundless level spiritual force couldn\u2019t have sensed its existence, but now he had still clearly discovered it. This trace of spiritual force was faintly discernable, containing exactly the same negative aura as the Deathgod Domain. This was also how it could elude Tang San.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026...</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t use the Seagod\u2019s Light to sever this connection, but rather attentively tried to sense it. Very soon, he discovered the effect of this trace of spiritual force. That was, locating.</p><br/><p>Indeed, someone actually used spiritual force to locate his Clear Sky Hammer. No, to be precise, it should be to locate the Deathgod Domain carved on it. Even if the Clear Sky Hammer was still within Tang San\u2019s body before, it still always maintained this kind of locating effect. And the reason the Clear Sky Hammer changed seemed to be because the source of the spiritual force locating the Deathgod Domain was already very close to him.</p><br/><p>Tang San of course had no idea what was going on, he couldn\u2019t understand how this could occur. But to him, being located with spiritual force wasn\u2019t a good thing. Even if he didn\u2019t sense it before, since he had now discovered it, he would of course deal with the problem as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Without alarming that trace of spiritual force, Tang San very quickly used the Seagod\u2019s Light to follow the trail, sensing the direction of that mental connection, then again soared into the sky. Holding the Clear Sky Hammer and Seagod Trident, he hurriedly flew towards that mental connection.</p><br/><p>His heart filled with the desire to kill. Tang San had already decided that, no matter who it was that was targeting him like this, he definitely had to get rid of them. The secret existence of an enemy able to locate him was a mortal threat.</p><br/><p>Accelerating with his full strength, Tang San\u2019s spiritual force also firmly monitored that trace of mental fluctuations on the Deathgod Domain. Very soon, he discovered his choice was correct. That mental fluctuation was constantly growing stronger as he flew, and even suppressed by the Seagod\u2019s Light, the Deathgod Domain on the Clear Sky Hammer was growing more and more excited. It wasn\u2019t the feeling of backlash, but rather the excitement of finding kin.</p><br/><p>Could it be Hu Liena? Tang San thought of a possibility. Back then, he and Hu Liena had obtained the Deathgod Domain at the same time, and only she possessed the same type of domain as he did. No, impossible. Hu Liena\u2019s spiritual force couldn\u2019t be this strong. Even though the spiritual force attached to his Deathgod Domain was extremely faint, it was as persistent as a bone maggot, that was impossible to achieve without a high mental level. By a conservative estimate, it should be a Title Douluo level power. Even if Hu Liena was quite talented, it was impossible for her to reach that kind of level in a short few years.</p><br/><p>Moreover, as Tang San flew he had a kind of feeling like that trace of spiritual force connected to his Deathgod Domain hadn\u2019t always been there, but rather something hidden in the Deathgod Domain that automatically activated as that source came within a certain distance of him. If that was the explanation then it was reasonable. Otherwise, if the spiritual force could have tracked his Deathgod Domain the whole way to Seagod Island, wouldn\u2019t that be truly godly?</p><br/><p>Just as he was thinking, the Deathgod Domain pattern on the Clear Sky Hammer suddenly flared with light, unexpectedly breaking through the restraints of the Seagod\u2019s Light in an instant. White light glittered, and the Deathgod Domain actually automatically released without Tang San\u2019s prompting, the enormous killing intent about to lash back at Tang San. Only, Tang San\u2019s spiritual force really was too formidable, pale blue light spread out, boundless level spiritual force instantly counter attacking and taking back control over the Deathgod Domain.</p><br/><p>Tang San discovered that his Deathgod Domain had become unprecedentedly powerful, formidable killing intent constantly rising, as if it would crush all things in the world. At the same time, that strand of mental connection from before suddenly became intense, doing its all to attack Tang San\u2019s spiritual force, trying to take control of the Deathgod Domain.</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed coldly, throwing off the cloth covering the Seagod Trident with a shake of his hand. Hovering in the air, he turned the head of the polearm to softly touch the Deathgod Domain pattern on the Clear Sky Hammer. At the same time, a ray of Seagod\u2019s Light fell directly on that rhombic gem on the Seagod Trident.</p><br/><p>Golden light just barely glittered once, light flitting across the Seagod Trident, a speck of golden light pouring into the Deathgod Domain pattern from the tip of the trident\u2019s central blade. That quickly strengthening mental fluctuation was instantly forcefully severed.</p><br/><p>The Seagod Trident contained a portion of the Seagod\u2019s divine power. With this method, Tang San not only severed the other side\u2019s connection with his Deathgod Domain, but moreover also cleanly wiped away the backdoor through which it was established. Similar circumstances would never occur again.</p><br/><p>The reason Tang San did so really wasn\u2019t because he was going to let them go, but rather because the spiritual force he scattered had already targeted the opponent\u2019s position, there was no need for this mental fluctuation connection on the Seagod Domain. Looking down, the Blue Silver Emperor right leg bone launched its full strength, sending Tang San streaking downwards at an angle like a shooting star.</p><br/><p>Very clearly, the person capable of targeting his Deathgod Domain was full of malice. Even though Tang San had already thoroughly dealt with the problem with the Deathgod Domain, he absolutely didn\u2019t want to leave this kind of hidden enemy.</p><br/><p>Tang San very soon approached his goal. Surprising him was that his spiritual force unexpectedly couldn\u2019t reach inside that area. An intense aura of slaughter created a kind of special barrier, giving his spiritual force a feeling of chaos after entering. He could only vaguely sense an enormous killing intent and a blood red color.</p><br/><p>Floating down into a forest, before he had set foot on the ground, Tang San already caught an intense bloody smell. Startled, he saw two corpses hanging in the trees not far away, their bodies so broken it was hard to tell they were human, and more like two lumps of ground meat. Giving him a strange feeling was that, even though there was a reek of blood in the air so intense it made people want to vomit, there wasn\u2019t a single drop of blood to be seen. Those two corpses were all dead grey bone and flesh, without a trace of blood remaining.</p><br/><p>Skilled experts are bold, and the scene didn\u2019t intimidate Tang San, on the contrary affirming his conviction to find out more. From the tattered clothes of those two corpses he could tell that they should have been together. From the clothes, and also from the grain of the muscles, even though they were already ragged, his spiritual force examination could still determine that they were different from ordinary people. They should have been quite powerful spirit masters.</p><br/><p>Inside the forest were marks of a violent struggle, the surrounding plants seriously damaged, and moreover with a lot of traces of corrosion. Raising the Seagod Trident in his hand, Tang San kept moving in the direction he determined with his spiritual force before.</p><br/><p>Very soon he saw a few more corpses exactly the same as before, not one hadn\u2019t died extremely miserably. A few corpses didn\u2019t even have internal organs left. It was very difficult to believe that this was caused by humans, and seemed even more like the doings of savage spirit beasts. Could it be there was some formidable and vicious spirit beast here?</p><br/><p>Speeding up, in the forest he constantly discovered one corpse after another. Finally, when Tang San saw the twenty third corpse, something different appeared ahead. A large expanse of red blood mist enveloped the forest in front, the sounds of violent spirit power collisions constantly echoing from within.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

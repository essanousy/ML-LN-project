Even this altitude didn\u2019t hinder him.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression was also serious, seeing Qian Renxue didn\u2019t speak again, he could tell that she really was doing her utmost. Her Angelic Raiment was no longer golden, it had actually turned completely fiery red, and even inscribed pattern was a bit vague due to how much True Sunfire she was absorbing. In fact, absorbing True Sunfire regardless of the consequences like this, with the slightest mistake in control, she might self combust. How would she do something like this unless the circumstances were like this?</p><br/><p>Two gods faced each other in the air, and on the ground the curtains were already drawn on the battle.</p><br/><p>As Tang San and Qian Renxue flew up at the same time, the soldiers on both sides of course also simultaneously lost the god level domain shrouding them. On the Heaven Dou Army side, the high morale only slowed a bit, while the Spirit Empire defenders seemed to have lost their backbone. After all, their morale was just too suppressed before, and the time the Angelic Domain covered them still wasn\u2019t enough to reverse the contrast. This was also why Tang San relied on his Seagod Domain to press in step by step, forcing Qian Renxue to set herself against him prematurely. He definitely didn\u2019t want to let the momentum he\u2019d built up be changed by Qian Renxue. And Qian Renxue had no choice, she could only join battle with Tang San ahead of time.</p><br/><p>Xue Beng, overseeing the army, could be said to be the most excited person in the Heaven Dou Empire million man army. He had never expected that his white lie would actually come true at the crucial moment. And this change also forcefully pulled his mind back from deathly stillness. He could of course tell that Tang San held the advantage against Qian Renxue. Moreover, returning with Tang San were also the other six devils that had already become Title Douluo level. The battle where he\u2019d originally planned to bet everything had now become an ideal opportunity to completely vanquish the enemy. How could Xue Beng give up this chance?</p><br/><p>As Xue Beng drew his imperial sword, holding it high, shouting with nearly all his strength, Tang San\u2019s name had already risen to an incomparable position in his heart. Tang San\u2019s appearance today had not only changed the course of the battle, but could also be said to have saved the entire Heaven Dou Empire! Even though Xue Beng\u2019s \u201clong live\u201d shout had been a bit impulsive, he didn\u2019t regret it at all, because to him, Tang San was definitely deserving.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven Dou Empire, our grand King Lan Hao has already cultivated to divinity, in today\u2019s battle, before Jialing Pass, we won\u2019t give the enemy another chance. We will use the blood of our enemies and possession of Jialing Pass to celebrate our patron saint of the empire, King Lan Hao. All forces charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>The full attack order passed down, and Xue Beng wasn\u2019t the only person whose blood boiled, all the soldiers in the Heaven Dou Army now felt certain of victory. Tang San had already several times showed what was meant by an undefeatable legend in front of them, and Xue Beng calling him patron saint of the empire was just what these soldiers were thinking.</p><br/><p>One million heroes began a thundering assault, from the highest commander marshal Ge Long, to the lowest level five man commanders, everyone was incomparably excited. Legions in formation started to separate on the vast plain, pressing in step by step towards Jialing Pass.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Six Devils charged at the very front, Dai Mubai furthest ahead, becoming the arrowhead of a million men. The other five followed by his side. They had already eaten Oscar\u2019s strengthened flying mushroom sausage, two pairs of illusory wings beating on their backs as Jialing Pass came closer and closer.</p><br/><p>The brothers Tang Hao and Tang Xiao glanced at each other, thinking the same thing. The two leapt up simultaneously, arriving at the front of the army in practically a few leaps, pitch black Clear Sky Hammers appearing in their hands, standing side to side with the Shrek Six Devils.</p><br/><p>How to avoid as many casualties on the battlefield as possible? Without a doubt, most important was settling the outcome between the strongest. Tang Hao and Tang Xiao deeply knew this point.</p><br/><p>The walls of Jialing Pass, without a doubt, were defended mostly by spirit masters. Breaking their defense was impossible by relying only on soldiers. Once spirit masters reached a certain level, fighting one against a hundred really wasn\u2019t difficult, let alone with the solid walls of Jialing Pass. Consequently, the collision between powers would become most important. Only by killing the strongest spirit masters on the other side leading the powers of their side, was it possible to break Jialing Pass as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao and his brother weren\u2019t the only ones who knew this. Poison Douluo Dugu Bo, Sword Douluo Chen Xin, Bone Douluo Gu Rong, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi, as well as the four Tang Sect hall masters were already charging forward. Adding the Shrek Six Devils, more than ten powers formed a line, accelerating simultaneously, taking the lead to charge towards Jialing Pass.</p><br/><p>They say that experts are bold, and that they dared attack like this when Jialing Pass held several tens of thousands of Spirit Empire spirit masters, clearly showed they had this confidence.</p><br/><p>On top of Jialing Pass, watching the enemy army approach, the hundred year old Golden Crocodile Douluo\u2019s eyes were a bit red, roaring,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit masters below rank eighty disperse, the rest come with me to annihilate these ignorant children!\u201d</p><br/><p>Spirit masters above rank eighty couldn\u2019t simply be counted in quantity. During the Spirit Empire\u2019s war with the Heaven Dou Empire, the losses of spirit masters was disastrous. In fact, cultivating spirit masters wasn\u2019t easy, and Golden Crocodile Douluo didn\u2019t want to expose the spirit masters under his command to unnecessary risks, leading to grievous harm.</p><br/><p>As they say, soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals. If Tang San and Qian Renxue were kings against kings, then what was happening here was a battle of generals.</p><br/><p>Jialing Pass was coming closer and closer, Dai Mubai shouted:</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave those six priests to us. The rest is up to you seniors.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Dai Mubai faced upwards and roared wildly, his seventh spirit ring suddenly brightening. His whole body suddenly expanded, growing golden fur. In the blink of an eye, he had turned into a ten meter long giant tiger, all the fur erect like metal needles, nine spirit rings erupting. Especially the last red hundred thousand year spirit ring gave people a hair-raising feeling. His evil eyes savage, his hind legs pushed against the ground, instantly crossing the moat, becoming the first to lunge onto the walls of Jialing Pass.</p><br/><p>Along with Dai Mubai came a loud and resonant phoenix cry, dazzling red light shooting towards the sky, a figure as enormous as Dai Mubai glittering in the air, nine phoenix heads crying, its giant wings roiling with heat. Phoenix Douluo Ma Hongjun\u2019s spirit avatar, Nine Headed Fire Phoenix.</p><br/><p>This was still only the beginning. Even more dazzling lights followed, rushing out along with Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun, a black stream of light quietly following Dai Mubai. That illusory silhouette basically couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, like it was Dai Mubai\u2019s shadow. At the same time as her, Oscar ate a clone mirror sausage, his body shaking, actually taking the same appearance as Dai Mubai, his imposing manner not weaker at all, leaping onto the walls closly behind the white tiger.</p><br/><p>Pink light exploded along with them, and in that pink cloud Xiao Wu\u2019s body multiplied. Her spirit avatar actually didn\u2019t turn her into a bunny, but rather caused six silhouettes identical to her to appear next to her, only condensed from pink light, guarding at her side. With light and shadow flickering, the seven figures leapt towards the walls simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s spirit avatar was different from Tang San, Dai Mubai and the others\u2019. She had cultivated from a hundred thousand year spirit beast, once her strength broke through, she had turned completely from beast to human. Even though her spirit was still a Soft Bones Rabbit, due to her beast form being completely refined into a human, when she used spirit avatar she couldn\u2019t possibly turn back into her spirit form. These six clones each possessed seventy percent of her strength, but could only act according to instinct, mainly protecting Xiao Wu herself. In fact, right now Xiao Wu\u2019s strength had reached rank ninety six, and even with just the instinctive attacks with seventy percent of her strength, these six clones were absolutely terrifying.</p><br/><p>At the same time as the first five devils charged forward, as the last one, Ning Rongrong still didn\u2019t cross the moat, but rather stood firm on her side, the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda in her hand instantly expanding. In the blink of an eye, it had already become a true thirty meter tall treasure pagoda. And Ning Rongrong herself, disappeared inside.</p><br/><p>When she previously carried the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda in her hand in seemed like nothing, at least not many people noticed it, but now that it expanded hundreds of times, it suddenly became the focal point of the entire battlefield.</p><br/><p>Her spirit rings also grew along with the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, nine dazzling spirit rings each becoming more than ten meters in diameter, such a dazzling scene. Especially the last blood red spirit ring imperiously declared a hundred thousand years of power to those Spirit Empire spirit masters on the walls.</p><br/><p>Seeing that dazzling Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master Ning Fengzhi\u2019s eyes shone, thinking to himself that it was finally time for him to retire. Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda had completed the last hurdle, nine rings! The dream of all members of hte Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, on this day, was finally accomplished by his daughter.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Ning Fengzhi swayed, and another pagoda appeared. Even though it was only seven floors, and also only had seven spirit rings, and its light a bit duller, its simultaneous appearance on the battlefield was no less shocking.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School was the world\u2019s number one support sect, but could only have at most seven spirit rings. Now, one peak level Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda spirit appeared, as well as another nine floor Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. This upsetting display gave the Spirit Empire powers on the walls an intense shock.</p><br/><p>In fact, Ning Fengzhi\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was only an illusion, only strengthening his support by a certain degree. But Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda wasn\u2019t just her seventh spirit ability spirit avatar. At the same time it was also the Nine Treasure Divine Light Barrier of her eighth spirit ability. With this defense, unless god level powers like Tang San or Qian Renxue appeared, nobody could think of breaking it. As a support type spirit master, having such a powerful defensive ability would definitely let her show her full strength on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The instant Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Divine Light Barrier formed, she showed all the spirit masters present what was meant by the number one support type sect, what the charm of the number one support type spirit master was.</p><br/><p>A full thirty lines of dazzling light suddenly shot from Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, at the same time as the first six spirit rings on the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda flashed. This dazzling scene made the fighters on both sides for a moment forget the two deities that had risen to battle in the sky.</p><br/><p>Thirty rays of light, every six landing on one person, perfectly boosting the Shrek Five Devils charging towards Jialing Pass. In fact, after reaching rank ninety five, Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost ability had already reached the full one hundred percent. In other words, illuminated by her six rays of light, the Shrek Five Devils\u2019 strength, agility, spirit power, defense, attack and attributes were all doubled.</p><br/><p>Even for spirit masters above rank ninety five, advancing from rank ninety five to ninety six only doubled spirit power, the other areas didn\u2019t advance that much. With Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost, right now the Shrek Five Devils\u2019 full strength had completely broken through rank ninety five, each one blossoming with an incomparable second flourish of light.</p><br/><p>First to charge, Dai Mubai was now still furthest ahead. The instant Ning Rongrong\u2019s six lights of support enveloped him, he instantly erupted with the formidable strength as the strongest power attack type battle spirit master of the Shrek Seven Devils. A savage red light suddenly shot from his right leg, instantly spreading all over him, finally freezing over his dual evil eyes. Dai Mubai\u2019s presence also instantly grew savage, his already ten meter long body expanding once again under the effect of the six boosts and this red light. His height didn\u2019t change, but all his muscles swelled, his terrifying presence suppressing the Spirit Empire spirit masters below rank ninety such that they couldn\u2019t breathe, even weakening the spirit abilities they used by thirty percent.</p><br/><p>That red light was the Bloodthirst ability of the Bloodsucking Savage Hurricane right leg bone Dai Mubai possessed. It instantly maximized his fighting strength. Dai Mubai clearly understood that this was the most crucial moment, and only by powerfully assaulting the top of the walls could they truly fight the powerful spirit masters of the Spirit Empire. But it was also during the charge to the top of the walls that they faced the most attacks. Therefore, just as they charged, each of them ate one of Oscar\u2019s seventh spirit ability Erect Gold Fly, even Ning Rongrong was no exception. As a result, Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost for them wasn\u2019t as simple as one hundred percent. Even though this sudden support light had thirty rays, with her formidable strength after reaching rank ninety five and meticulous control, she actually managed to use them all simultaneously, and even though these thirty rays of light didn\u2019t reach the Erect Gold Fly\u2019s promised one hundred five percent effect, it still raised them by twenty percent, reaching one hundred twenty percent effectiveness. With Dai Mubai in addition using the Erect Gold Fly himself, his spirit avatar instantly reached a terrifying level of strength, not at all inferior to the strongest on the Jialing Pass walls, Golden Crocodile Douluo.</p><br/><p>The others also each showed changes from this boost. The vague shadow following next to Dai Mubai was Hell Douluo Zhu Zhuqing. She was even more vague, like a puff of smoke twisting around Dai Mubai. Oscar expanded, also temporarily serving as a power attack type spirit master. He was the only one who didn\u2019t eat the Erect Gold Fly, because if he did it couldn\u2019t amplify the next spirit ability attack power by another fifty percent after eating the clone mirror sausage, it could only boost his sausage making ability. But, this fellow bluntly released all of Dai Mubai\u2019s support ability forms, White Tiger Vajra Form, White Tiger Devilgod Form, White Tiger barrier as well as spirit avatar, using all of them in one go. With Ning Rongrong backing him, even though he was a replica White Tiger Douluo, he currently displayed the strength equivalent to a rank ninety five power attack type Douluo. He caught up to Dai Mubai, helping him withstand the pressure.</p><br/><p>And in the air, Ma Hongjun had already turned the top of the walls fiery red. He only used his fifth spirit ability, Phoenix Meteor Shower, and countless flaming balls fell from the sky, indiscriminately bombarding the walls of Jialing Pass.</p><br/><p>Absolutely don\u2019t underestimate this fifth spirit ability. Ma Hongjun had already become the Phoenix Douluo, the heat of his phoenix flame had already reached a rather horrifying degree. Most importantly, his Phoenix Meteor Shower not only had the one hundred five percent boost of the Erect Gold Fly, but at the same time also Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost. Ning Rongrong\u2019s six great buffs had the most obvious effect on him. The reason was very simple, that attribute buff had the greatest effect on Ma Hongjun, doubling both the heat and the burning ability of his phoenix flame! Such a wide area attack revealed his power even further. Of course, Ma Hongjun didn\u2019t hope for his attack to have any conclusive effect, he was just harassing the opponents as much as possible, giving his comrades a chance to scale the walls.</p><br/><p>But most shocking was still Xiao Wu. The six figures she had produced before had now turned into nine, clearly the effect of the Erect Gold Fly. At the same time, after these nine figures were buffed by Ning Rongrong, each one turned from pink to scarlet. With the buff, the strength of each was now no less than Xiao Wu\u2019s normal state. They were only one beat slower than Dai Mubai as they screened Xiao Wu to head to the top of the walls.</p><br/><p>Watching the Shrek Six Devils completely erupt, the brothers Tang Hao and Tang Xiao, as well as Sword Douluo, Bone Douluo and the others were also shocked. Even though they were also buffed by Ning Fengzhi, clearly, the effect was much lower than what Ning Rongrong gave the Shrek Six Devils. Even though they\u2019d already seen that the Shrek Six Devils had reached the Title Douluo level, now that they truly saw their strength, this old generation of Title Douluo truly recognized the power of these youths.</p><br/><p>In the past, the Shrek Six Devils had always been hidden by Tang San\u2019s overly dazzling radiance. At this moment, in this battle with the Spirit Empire, they themselves showed everyone their strength. In the Shrek Seven Devils, Tang San definitely wasn\u2019t alone on the stage. Each one was a Shrek Academy monster, truly unreasonable monsters. Each one was the genius of several generations of the spirit master world.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Spirit Empire side didn\u2019t sit still either. They of course wouldn\u2019t let the enemy onto the walls so easily. The six great priests led by Golden Crocodile Douluo, as well as altogether eight Title Douluo transferred from other places to Jialing Pass in recent days, fourteen powers with the aid of more than a hundred Spirit Douluo, wildly attacked Dai Mubai and the others. They had only one goal, to keep them off the walls.</p><br/><p>Boom\u2014\u2014 The Phoenix Meteor Shower became the first wave of attacks. The moment Ma Hongjun soared into the air, he had already drawn the attention of the Spirit Empire powers on the walls. Among the fourteen Title Douluo level powers, a water attributed spirit Title Douluo immediately released a wide area defensive ability.</p><br/><p>An enormous blue barrier covered the top of the walls, trying to stop Ma Hongjun\u2019s attack. This Title Douluo was also a power second only to the high priests, his spirit power at rank ninety four, his cultivation even a bit higher than Ma Hongjun, and this defensive spirit ability was his eighth spirit ability. In the eyes of the Spirit Empire powers, it was enough to block Ma Hongjun\u2019s fifth spirit ability.</p><br/><p>However, history had showed that underestimating the Shrek Seven Devils was disastrous. This time was no different.</p><br/><p>Boom\u2014\u2014 The moment the first Phoenix Meteor hit the blue barrier, that Title Douluo\u2019s expression changed, shouting,</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, watch out above!\u201d</p><br/><p>A single Phoenix Meteor smashing his blue barrier caused an intense ring of light to ripple out, already showing a crack. His warning wasn\u2019t slow, but unfortunately, right now the Spirit Empire powers\u2019 gazes were all focused on Dai Mubai and the others striking the walls. They basically hadn\u2019t imagined that the eight spirit ability couldn\u2019t block the attack from the sky. Therefore, their attack abilities were all pouring downwards. Even if they reacted, there was no time to launch any attacks above.</p><br/><p>A series of explosions rang like thunderclaps above Jialing Pass. That rank ninety four water attributed Title Douluo instantly paled, using his spirit avatar to turn into an enormous turtle, constantly pouring spirit power into his Warding Rain Barrier. Unfortunately, he underestimated Ma Hongjun too much.</p><br/><p>In terms of attributes, fire and water cancelled each other. The one with the strongest attribute held the advantage. Even though his spirit wasn\u2019t bad, compared to the peak level fire type spirit Phoenix, he was still far behind. Let alone when all of Ma Hongjun\u2019s attributes were doubled, as well as the effect of the Erect Gold Fly.</p><br/><p>Three seconds, only a short three seconds. The blue barrier in the sky loudly shattered, turning into countless motes of blue light that scattered in all directions. It had only stopped one third of the Phoenix Meteor Shower. Even more flaming blasted down, exploding in the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo roared angrily. Qian Renxue wasn\u2019t here, so it was up to him to manage the situation, so when the others all acted, he held back until last, and now revealed his unreasonable strength as the Spirit Empire\u2019s second priest. Seeing the flaming meteors rain down, he suddenly leapt into the air, swaying, already using spirit avatar to turn into a giant crocodile. And at the same time, without anyone noticing which spirit ring brightened, countless glittering metallic scales burst from his body, shooting towards the Phoenix Meteor Shower in the air.</p><br/><p>Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\u2026\u2026 Like rolling thunder, violent explosions detonated in midair, countless sparks scattering, dazzling. The majority of the phoenix meteors were actually blocked by Golden Crocodile Douluo, only a small number exploded in the ranks of Spirit Empire spirit master powers, causing some injuries among Spirit Douluo, but not managing to influence their fighting strength.</p><br/><p>In the air, Ma Hongjun\u2019s Nine Headed Fire Phoenix gazed with ice cold killing intent, focused on Golden Crocodile Douluo. The nine heads rose simultaneously, issuing a resonant phoenix cry, then suddenly fell from the sky, the entire phoenix flaming, charging straight for Golden Crocodile Douluo. His aura was also completely locked on Golden Crocodile Douluo.</p><br/><p>Even though Ma Hongjun\u2019s Phoenix Meteor Shower couldn\u2019t truly influence the majority of the Spirit Empire spirit masters on the walls, his attack definitely disrupted their rhythm. Especially when his strength alone drew over the strongest second priest Golden Crocodile Douluo, keeping him from stopping the Heaven Dou Empire powers from scaling the walls, reducing the pressure on Ma Hongjun and the others considerably.</p><br/><p>Golden Crocodile Douluo was shocked as well. He now clearly felt a formidable pressure descending, he had never imagined that a spirit master whose strength clearly wasn\u2019t at rank ninety five would actually make him feel such pressure. He had to face him seriously. The giant crocodile raised its head, gazing at the descending Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Ma Hongjun\u2019s strength of course wasn\u2019t equal to Golden Crocodile Douluo. Even with Ning Rongrong\u2019s buffs, his strength was at most between rank ninety five and six, his overall strength absolutely wouldn\u2019t be rank ninety six, and his spirit power was still a considerable distance from the rank ninety eight Golden Crocodile Douluo. The reason he could give Golden Crocodile Douluo such pressure was mainly because of spirit suppression. The phoenix could be said to restrain the majority of all reptile spirits, and Golden Crocodile Douluo\u2019s spirit belonged to this category. No matter how strong he was he couldn\u2019t fly, and confronting the diving phoenix, the pressure he felt from the source of his spirit was crucial to now making him passive.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Six Devils really were too familiar with each other. Being together for so many years, they didn\u2019t even need to look over to understand the abilities the others used in battle. In the sky, Ma Hongjun drew the attention of Golden Crocodile Douluo. Below, Ma Hongjun and the others were already clashing head on with the Spirit Empire powers.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai amply displayed the meaning of overbearing. In his spirit avatar, especially with after his second growth with Ning Rongrong\u2019s buffs and the Bloodthirst ability, he definitely drew the most attention. As a result, at least six Title Douluo focused their attacks on him, even including three priest level powers. These Spirit Empire spirit masters had a very clear purpose, to kill Dai Mubai in one move. No matter how strong he looked, power still had limits. Let alone him, even Golden Crocodile Douluo definitely wouldn\u2019t dare simultaneously take the attacks of these Title Douluo level powers.</p><br/><p>But in fact, Dai Mubai bore these six Title Douluo attacks head on, and moreover directly charged at the walls. Of course, that wasn\u2019t with his strength alone.</p><br/><p>Black and golden, vague and distinct, two rays of light instantly completed a fusion ability in midair. The originally already enormous white tiger now seemed to stretch and swell once again. The glittering golden light disappeared, Dai Mubai\u2019s fur again turning white. But, that was white like milky white crystal. A pair of wings on its back, its whole body seemingly carved from crystal, more than thirty meters tall, an incomparably enormous terrifying white tiger suddenly appeared. With a beat of its wings, it accelerated even further, an intense ring of white light suddenly exploding around it.</p><br/><p>This white tiger had black stripes, the enormous \u2018king\u2019 character on its forehead especially distinct, its tiger eyes more than a meter in diameter, with faintly red light. Even the Spirit Empire priests couldn\u2019t help feeling a chill down their spines.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was no idiot, of course he knew that what kind of attacks he would face if he charged first, and naturally Zhu Zhuqing knew it as well. The instant these attacks launched, they also used the strongest ability in the Shrek Seven Devils apart from the now god level Tang San, Hell White Tiger.</p><br/><p>That crystalline giant white tiger also pulled along a vague shadow, and as the powerful Title Douluo abilities clashed with that white ring of light, they were actually all deflected.</p><br/><p>Tang San once said that once Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing reached the Title Douluo level, with their high affinity, their Hell White Tiger very possibly might briefly reach god level strength. The white tiger was also a feline, and had a seventy percent affinity with Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s Hell Civet. Among the spirit masters of the Heaven Dou Empire that could use spirit fusion ability, this was second only to Grandmaster, Flender and Liu Erlong\u2019s Golden Sacred Dragon. However, of those three only two were Spirit Douluo. These were two Title Douluo, and Dai Mubai\u2019s strength had moreover reached rank ninety five, and with Ning Rongrong\u2019s full support as well as Oscar\u2019s Erect Gold Fly backing them, this instant explosion of power really was too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Right now, even if Dai Mubai and Qian Renxue appeared, they would still be startled by this super edition Hell White Tiger. Even they would hesitate in facing an attack of this level, and in a frontal clash might not be able to keep the Hell White Tiger off the walls!</p><br/><p>Boom\u2014\u2014 The Hell White Tiger forcibly smashed onto the wall with incredibly unreasonable strength. With a shake of its thirty meter long body, at least five Title Douluo were blasted off.</p><br/><p>Roaring wildly at the sky, the Hell White Tiger\u2019s enormous body didn\u2019t attack these Spirit Empire powers again, nobody had expected that the moment after they\u2019d just climbed the walls, it lunged towards Golden Crocodile Douluo. And this instant was also the moment Ma Hongjun was about to dive from the sky to attack Golden Crocodile Douluo.</p><br/><p>This was teamwork, perfect teamwork. From the start, Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun and the others had been aiming for Golden Crocodile Douluo. Having fought once, they of course knew the importance of this second priest. Not only in terms of strength, but as Qian Renxue was fighting Tang San, it was impossible for her to come back and take charge, and this Golden Crocodile Douluo was definitely the enemy\u2019s vital commander. If they could him, the impact on today\u2019s battle could be imagined. As a result, Dai Mubai would rather aim this Erect Gold Fly boosted attack on him alone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

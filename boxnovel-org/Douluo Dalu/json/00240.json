She swiftly rolled towards Dai Mubai\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai didn\u2019t react slowly either. On discovering Zhu Zhuqing was ambushed, his enormous White Tiger Avatar directly charged, he firmly believed that if Tang San was given a few more breaths of time, he he would have a chance to catch Zhu Zhuqing. Consequently, he unhesitatingly chose to merge with Zhu Zhuqing, launching the spirit fusion ability Hell White Tiger. This was an important weapon for them to defeat Tang San. After fusing, their attributes rose substantially, and naturally wouldn\u2019t fear Tang San\u2019s sneak attacks. Even Xiao Bai had no way to harm them in their Hell White Tiger state, let alone Tang San with spirit power still below Xiao Bai\u2019s.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how fast their reaction, they were still a beat slower than Tang San with the initiative. A blue light shot out from between Tang San\u2019s eyebrows, deftly enveloping Zhu Zhuqing. Not only did it block her from rolling sideways, it also firmly confined her within. At the same time that triangular blue light also just blocked the several lines of light Ning Rongrong sent over to rescue. Dai Mubai\u2019s enormous body knocked against it, but separated by that layer of blue light, not only was Zhu Zhu Zhuqing unable to start the spirit fusion ability with him, she was even knocked away by his collision.</p><br/><p>This blue light was one of the previous Vast Sea Cosmic Shroud\u2019s four great abilities, Vast Sea Stasis, now become Tang San\u2019s head bone ability.</p><br/><p>Watching Zhu Zhuqing enveloped in the Vast Sea Stasis field being knocked flying by Dai Mubai, Tang San gave a laugh,</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, boss Dai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed. The surrounding blue golden forest changed irregularly, and the scene before the eyes of Dai Mubai\u2019s quartet grew indistinct, making them unable to see each other.</p><br/><p>Reddish golden light spread out in an instant, and the landscape that had just puzzled Dai Mubai grew clear again. It was the release of Ma Hongjun\u2019s Phoenix Domain. Seeing Zhu Zhuqing attacked by Tang San, Ma Hongjun finally couldn\u2019t hold back, transforming into the Seven Headed Fire Phoenix and releasing his domain. His domain was released just right, breaking open the illusion within a twenty meter range. Swiftly guarding Ning Rongrong and gathering together with Dai Mubai. But Zhu Zhuqing caught by the Vast Sea Stasis barrier was like a grey goose flying in the dark, completely unseen. Clearly Tang San had already brought her out of this twenty meter range while Fatty released the domain.</p><br/><p>Tang San and Zhu Zhuqing one vs one. There was no need to wonder about the outcome.</p><br/><p>Whether Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun or Ning Rongrong, their hearts all sank. They had originally thought that no matter how strong Tang San was, if the five of them focused their strength, they would still definitely be able to beat him easily. With the five mutually adding their fighting strength, there was no doubt that they were stronger than Tang San alone. However, after the battle truly started, it had far exceeded their imagination.</p><br/><p>The Blue Silver Domain their group had relied on in the past was turned against them, just that was painful, moreover Tang San\u2019s innumerable succession of techniques gave them even more of a headache. In just a few eyeblinks, only three remained of the five.</p><br/><p>All kinds of Ning Rongrong\u2019s support abilities were quickly used on Ma Hongjun and Dai Mubai. Both were spirit masters with tremendous explosive force, and further adding Ning Rongrong\u2019s frightening eighty percent boost, even if they wouldn\u2019t necessarily lose in a frontal fight with Tang San, they were still cautiously on guard.</p><br/><p>Elegant nine colored light spread from Ning Rongrong, filling a range of twenty meters, just enveloping the three of them within. They could see everything outside, but it wasn\u2019t possible to see through this fantastical nine colored light mist from the outside. This was Ning Rongrong\u2019s head bone subsidiary domain, Illusion Space.</p><br/><p>The Illusion Space plus the Phoenix Domain could finally count as having counteracted the threat of the Blue Silver Domain. Of course, it was only within this twenty meter range.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun asked Dai Mubai softly.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai spoke in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to guard against all of little San\u2019s abilities. If we want to defeat him, we first of all heave to break out of this Blue Silver Domain. With the help of so many plants, his domain will definitely last longer than us. Fatty, we\u2019ll focus our attacks on one spot and see if we can\u2019t split open little San\u2019s domain. We have Rongrong\u2019s full strength boost, our total spirit power should exceed little San. It should be possible to temporarily break through the domain. Once we\u2019ve rushed out, we\u2019ll attack with our full strength, we won\u2019t give him the chance to release the domain. Rongrong, we break through the domain, you use Illusion Space to trap little San. Make him unable to communicate with the surrounding plants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try and see. The gap in spiritual force between me and Tang San is too wide. I might not be able to hold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was also a seasoned veteran, he knew well that he couldn\u2019t despair at this time, or there would be no need to continue this battle. Drawing a deep breath, he shared a look with Ma Hongjun in Seven Headed Fire Phoenix form, and started to release his spirit power under Ning Rongrong\u2019s full strength support.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Tiger, Annihilation\u2014\u2014 Kill\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhoenix, Cloud\u2014\u2014 Piercing\u2014\u2014 Strike\u2014\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun had cooperated for years, and the two simultaneously launched their attacks directly at one point on the Blue Silver Domain\u2019s Boundless Nature outside. With Ning Rongrong\u2019s eighty percent boost ability, each of their attacks already surpassed Tang San. Even more when they purely attacked one point, plus each of their own boost abilities, even a ninety fifth ranked Title Douluo might not dare take it.</p><br/><p>A strange scene appeared, just as their attacks left the twenty meter range of the Illusion Space and Phoenix Domain, suddenly, all the surrounding golden blue completely disappeared. Disappeared without any warning. Their incomparably overbearing attacks shot straight at the ocean, entering the sea in the blink of an eye, raising close to fifty meter high giant waves and surging steam.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Little San?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was dumbfounded. Not only was there no collision between their attacks and the Blue Silver Domain, even after his and Ma Hongjun\u2019s attacks hit the sea, the surrounding beach was as empty as nothing, where was there a trace of Tang San?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me third brother escaped just before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said somewhat incredulously.</p><br/><p>\u201cEscaped your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun still hadn\u2019t finished speaking before he already heard Tang San\u2019s voice behind him. Ma Hongjun only felt his back tingle, the effect of Tang San\u2019s amassed power. He urged his Seven Headed Fire Phoenix Avatar to dash forward to hide, practically without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, keep little Ao company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s silhouette appeared next to Ning Rongrong, and before she could react, Tang San\u2019s right hand was already pressed to her forehead. At the same time a mental attack shot out, and even with a certain amount of protection from Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda energy, compared to Tang San\u2019s Boundless level spiritual force, she really was too far away. Groaning, she fell into Tang San\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>From removing the Blue Silver Domain, and Ma Hongjun and Dai Mubai\u2019s attacks killing empty air, to Tang San subduing ning Rongrong, only two breaths of time had passed. Tang San\u2019s Blue Silver Domain hadn\u2019t collided with Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun\u2019s attacks, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t suffer any attack. But having used their full strength to launch attacks, the two were in a state of old strength having left, and still not replaced with new strength. The will to turn and help Ning Rongrong was there, but the strength was not. Ma Hongjun was even scared off by Tang San and had flown off several dozen meters.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s boost disappeared, and as Ma Hongjun and Dai Mubai rushed back, Tang San had already pulled her along and flown up. Back in midair he stuffed ning Rongrong into his Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse.</p><br/><p>A hundred or more Blue Silver Emperor blossomed from Tang San, pursuing and attacking Ma Hongjun. Tang San gave a calm smile, his left leg whipping out, suddenly producing a razor blade of red light, forcibly sending Fatty in Spirit Avatar form spinning several turns in the air.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for Dai Mubai to pounce, Tang San\u2019s eighth spirit ring already flashed, the red wheel of light appeared again. But this time it didn\u2019t solidify the sea or the air, but rather released circles of blood colored light, instantly enveloping Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>The two were stunned in practically the same moment. This was the other ability of Tang San\u2019s eighth spirit ring.</p><br/><p>Turning around, Tang San threw himself towards the stunned Ma Hongjun. In midair, an enormous spiderweb already sprayed out, tangling around the Seven Headed Fire Phoenix. The fire immune Blue Silver Grass basically wouldn\u2019t fear the scorching hot phoenix flame protecting him.</p><br/><p>And at the same time another figure had already separated from Tang San, an illusory silhouette floating over behind Dai Mubai with a flicker, a long scorpion braid whipped out, tangling around Dai Mubai\u2019s neck. The illusion tossed, and the next moment, Dai Mubai was already in the air. It was Tang San\u2019s sixth spirit ability, Nothingness, Burst Kill Eight Stage Drop.</p><br/><p>As Ma Hongjun awoke from unconsciousness, what he saw was eight dazzling golden lances pointing at eight vital spots on his body, and what he felt was a spiderweb closely restraining his body.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was even more miserable than him, when he came to he only felt his surroundings flash past. His body was constantly flung around high and far. Of course, Xiao Wu\u2019s soul form illusion wouldn\u2019t really smash him on the ground, but at this moment he and Ma Hongjun both understood that they had already lost this fight. Lost it so thoroughly. Tang San didn\u2019t even have Xiao Wu\u2019s soul return to her body to fight, but still easily defeated them.</p><br/><p>From start to finish, the whole battle had taken less than five minutes. As Dai Mubai and Ma Hongjun safely landed on the ground, the effects of all attacks removed, the two were already lifeless. An intense feeling of defeat filled their hearts, especially that feeling of clearly having strength but being unable to use it made them even more depressed.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t speak, only fishing out Ning Rongrong, Zhu Zhuqing and Oscar from his Wishful Hundred Treasures Purse, then finally also brought out Xiao Wu, holding her close.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong and Zhu Zhuqing were the same, after coming to they both stood there lifelessly, not uttering a word.</p><br/><p>But as Oscar woke up, he couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck me, little San, you\u2019re too despicable. You actually sneak attacked me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, is this your first day out? Will the enemy warn you ahead of time? Don\u2019t forget that we were five against little San alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar paused, looking startled at these four companions with dejected expressions, and cried out:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have lost, right? With Rongrong\u2019s powerful support, boss Dai\u2019s powerful body, Fatty\u2019s scarily explosive strength, and Zhuqing\u2019s speed. You all together actually couldn\u2019t defeat little San? Boss Dai, you and Zhuqing didn\u2019t use the Hell White Tiger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing sighed softly,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother basically didn\u2019t give us the chance to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai\u2019s gaze changed somewhat. Looking at Tang San, he said in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, tell us, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San naturally understood what he wanted to ask, but didn\u2019t directly speak. Rather his gaze swept past the five companions in front of him. Once everyone\u2019s attention was on him, he calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason is very simple: because because you didn\u2019t show your true strength against my attacks. I exploited my familiarity with everyone, each attack hitting where it hurt. If you could be a bit cautious and careful, I wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat you so easily. Indeed, the five of you together are absolutely stronger than me. However, you\u2019ve forgotten one thing. That is that one person will be more flexible than five people. My strength alone is higher than any one of you, if you are unable to effectively join together to resist me, then even if you\u2019re somewhat prepared, you still won\u2019t have much of a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, Tang San raised his hand to point at Oscar,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy first target was little Ao. Because I understand that, with inertia of thinking, you would inevitably believe that my first target would be Rongrong who has no fighting strength, and so you would pay even more attention to her. But you still neglected that Little Ao isn\u2019t much stronger than Rongrong before he has eaten a clone mirror sausage. Little Ao, do you know what your mistake was? Even if you instantly ate your clone mirror sausage, you didn\u2019t look for your comrades\u2019 protection beforehand. When I instead had already used teleportation to attack you, you should have some contingency plan. If you had first used your spirit bone Clone ability to create a clone, and then eaten the clone mirror sausage, you would have had at least a fifty percent chance of escaping my attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really was my mistake. I didn\u2019t expect your first target would be me either. At that time I still wanted to eat a clone mirror sausage and go guard Rongrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San sternly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince your sausage spirit rose to the seventieth rank, you already possess extremely potent fighting strength. You can even clone a hundred percent of someone\u2019s abilities to fight for ten minutes. However, there\u2019s one point I have to warn you of. Your greatest weakness is in the brief time before you\u2019ve eaten the clone mirror sausage. This time you were the weakest. In this respect, if you can think of some way to make up for it, it will make your weakness even smaller. Otherwise, as long as it\u2019s an opponent somewhat familiar with your spirit, they will think of some way to not give you the chance to eat the clone mirror sausage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar nodded in deep thought, hanging his head to contemplate, pondering a way to improve himself.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze next turned to Zhu Zhuqing and Dai Mubai,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also equally made mistakes. After I dealt with little Ao, you wanted to return to help Rongrong. However, you forgot about one thing. Even if Rongrong\u2019s boost ability is powerful, it still won\u2019t immediately give you the strength to beat me. Among the five of you, the only one with the strength to instantly smash me is the Hell White Tiger. Therefore, from the start of the battle, you should have moved hand in hand, maintaining a physical link. Like that, even if I used the domain abilities, I still wouldn\u2019t have been able to directly seal you. With the Hell White Tiger there, you had a chance to win. If you had held hands at that time, then my Cosmic Stasis Field could only have enveloped both of you, and with the Hell White Tiger\u2019s strength you would also completely have been able to break out. Moreover, Zhuqing, you didn\u2019t react fast enough. While in a spirit avatar state, as an agility type Spirit Master, there should never have been a moment when you stopped, you should have constantly been in high speed motion, exploiting everything in the surroundings, including your companions to shield your figure. The greatest characteristics of the agility attack type spirit master is formidable attack power and speed, but defensive strength is her weakness. If you let the opponent lock onto you, then if at that time I didn\u2019t use the Vast Sea Stasis Field, but rather the Blue Silver Overlord Spear, you would very possibly already have been seriously injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMubai, after Zhuqing was caught, your mind was a bit chaotic. To the extent that you again and again made mistakes in the following battle. Even if you were deeply within my Blue Silver Domain Boundless Nature, relying on Rongrong\u2019s domain was enough to protect you. Let alone with Fatty there. With these you still had a chance to stay on even footing. But you and Fatty launched all out attacks to break open my domain. Even if this really had a probability for success, don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a control type spirit master, my control over my own abilities is considerable, that\u2019s why I removed the domain at the same time as you attacked. If I wanted, I could completely have reinstated the domain when you had attacked. At that time, you would no longer have stood a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San\u2019s analysis, Dai Mubai sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019re right, the five of us made this and that mistake one after another. However, you also overlooked some things. It\u2019s not about whether we could cooperate, but rather because we didn\u2019t have you to command. It\u2019s now I discover that we are so dependant on your commands. Without you to take command between us just now, we couldn\u2019t even display fifty percent of our strength. But when you\u2019re there, we can very possibly even show one hundred twenty percent strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Dai Mubai, his eyes revealing a pondering light. Indeed, everyone were always together, and his companions really did depend on him a lot. Moreover, as the team\u2019s only control type spirit master, he had the effect of a mediator, an extremely important position.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually you don\u2019t have to be discouraged. Just now was also because you were unprepared. If you\u2019d prepared in advance, as long as you adopted a tactic stable guarding and countering, you would still have had a major chance to defeat me. The reason you had no way to catch me was because I have too many dodging abilities, whether teleportation, Invincible Golden Body or Blue Silver Barrier, they can all help me quickly leave the battlefield. And you had no abilities to control the initiative. Therefore, having me stay still is very difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai grinned:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Xiao Wu had been on our side, you wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked somewhat dumbfounded at Dai Mubai,</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you still want to make it six on one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said grandiosely:</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a freak like you, six on one isn\u2019t anything impossible. Your Invincible Golden Body only works three times. Just as you said, as long as we use tactics of stable defense and countering, taking turns to rest, it\u2019s impossible for your domains to continue indefinitely. And your Vast Sea Stasis Field is useless to our Fatty. Our burst attack strength is formidable, and if you want to catch us, your spiritual force is also bound to take considerable blows. And you will definitely pause when launching abilities. As long as you give us one chance to let Xiao Wu approach you with teleportation, you\u2019re a finished egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San scratched his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, Xiao Wu\u2019s abilities counter me considerably. In some sense, Xiao Wu should be considered a close quarters power attack type battle spirit master. Or you might say a close quarters control type spirit master. Even if her abilities need proximity to show their full effect, at the same time her abilities will also be a lot stronger than our ordinary abilities. At least even I can\u2019t take her Burst Kill Eight Stage Drop. However, Boss Dai, do you believe Xiao Wu would help you against me? Heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said from the side:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way is better. Third brother, from now on, you\u2019re banned from using the dodgin abilities of teleportation, Invincible Golden Body, and hiding. You can only fight head on. I\u2019ll help the four of them to fight you separately. Isn\u2019t that our fifth trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar shook his hands,</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind. Rongrong, we don\u2019t stand a chance. Little San is a control type spirit master. In front of that Blue Silver Emperor even gods or devils can\u2019t see through, none of us have the ability to protect you. Even if he didn\u2019t use those dodging abilities, as long as as he first controls you, the rest of us basically won\u2019t stand a chance. A control type spirit master on little San\u2019s level is already beyond what agility attack type spirit masters can counter. Let alone the rest of us. I\u2019d prefer to directly go confront a Sea Douluo than to practice with Tang San again. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d lose my confidence. That guy is still best as our partner, having him as an opponent is too painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s declaration immediately gained Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun and Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s favor. Indeed, it seemed to them that Tang San was still best suited as a friend no matter when.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll try to pass the trial. With our present strength, we should still have a considerable chance. Right, did your trials specify which Sea Douluo you had to face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSeahorse Douluo once told us that the seven sacred pillars are each named Seahorse, Sea Devil, Sea\u2019s Lance, Sea\u2019s Fantasy, Sea Witch, Sea Star, and Sea Dragon. They each have a corresponding Title Douluo guarding them. So far we\u2019ve only met Seahorse Douluo. But judging from what he told us then, the strongest among these seven should be Sea Dragon Douluo, who\u2019s very possibly already reached the ninety fifth rank. My fifth trial examiner is Sea Witch Douluo, she might more precisely be called Sea Woman Douluo[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy examiner is better, an old acquaintance, Seahorse Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy examiner is Sea\u2019s Lance. Should be called Sealance Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy examiner is Sea Devil Douluo, I suppose the correct appellation is Sea Ghost Douluo[2].\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San exhaled:</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately your opponents don\u2019t include Sea Dragon Douluo. Otherwise passing might have been difficult. According to the contrast in strength between us and these Sea Douluo, Sea Dragon Douluo is undoubtedly the strongest. And the reason Sea Star and Sea Fantasy Douluos didn\u2019t appear among your examiners might very well be because they are the weakest of them all. Sea Horse Douluo outlined their strength. Sea Woman Douluo, Sea Ghost Douluo and Sea Lance Douluo grow stronger in that order. I currently have a method that might guarantee you pass. But the rewards from passing the trial might be reduced. Do you want to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said doubtfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can guarantee we\u2019ll pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. My trial is to challenge the seven Title Douluo within three days, and completely defeat them all. But it didn\u2019t say anything about the order. If I challenge your corresponding Title Douluo, and you moreover raise your challenges after I defeat them, it can practically guarantee you will pass. The strength of the Sea Douluo I\u2019ve defeated is bound to be lowered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun\u2019s eyes opened wide,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that alright too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing not alright about it. Since the conditions of our trials doesn\u2019t forbid us from doing so, then it\u2019s rational. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar scratched his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have any certainty to pass by relying on the clone mirror sausage. I\u2019ve thought it over, and little San is right, I have a considerable gap when reusing the clone mirror sausage. But confronting a power on the Title Douluo level, even with Rongrong\u2019s boost, It\u2019s still impossible for me to win within the time of one clone mirror sausage. When I take the second, too dangerous. If I can\u2019t pass with the first, then figuring out what next is too difficult. Little San, please help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing suddenly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, if it\u2019s as you say, then isn\u2019t the reverse also possible? Leaving it to us to first challenge our Title Douluo, then for you to challenge them next, like this you can save your strength. After all, your trial is to defeat seven Title Douluo within three days!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled and shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Once you\u2019ve all passed, I\u2019ll wholeheartedly go to pass. Have faith in my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, Zhuqing is right. We can\u2019t always rely on you. It really is difficult for little Ao to pass, he can use your help. But me, Zhuqing and Fatty can pass just fine on our own. I believe that of the seven sacred pillars, the strongest opponent is Sea Dragon Douluo. You have to conserve your strength as far as possible before facing him. Intersperse the three of us challenging Title Douluo in your overall challenge time. Like this, you can also rest better. Trust us, we have the strength to rely on ourselves to complete the challenges.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said hesitantly:</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if I pass successfully, then I won\u2019t be able to help you. Just in case\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said resolutely:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo just in case. If we always think of a way out whatever we do, it\u2019ll be impossible for us to break through. Don\u2019t forget that the one rank reward is very important to us. I can break through the eightieth rank. I don\u2019t want to have to use even more time to break through because the reward is reduced. At the same time, this is also Zhuqing\u2019s last trial. I think that if she can\u2019t rely on her own strength to pass this last trial, her overall reward will definitely be reduced. Little San, don\u2019t forget that we have confidence in ourselves. The fourth trial mainly relied on your strength, so let us help you for this one. We Shrek Seven Devils are always as one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, then it\u2019s settled. We\u2019ll rest one day, and start the challenges tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t decline again, he definitely wouldn\u2019t dispel his comrades\u2019 belief in certain victory.</p><br/><p>The next day, early morning.</p><br/><p>The sky held the first glimmers of dawn, but the Shrek Seven Devils group had already arrived at the familiar sea within the sea surrounding the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>Because it was so early, the blue of the sky was still a bit dark, gradually rendered brighter by the sun slowly revealing itself in the east.</p><br/><p>Seahore Douluo quietly sat straight backed below the Seahorse Sacred Pillar, just like the first time Tang San and the others saw him. Perhaps because he sensed their arrival, Seahorse Douluo slowly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than three years since we met, but it seems everyone\u2019s strength has grown a great deal. Coming today, would be for the fifth trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse douluo looked smiling at everyone on the shore. As his gaze fell on Tang San, he clearly revealed a look a respect.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, today is for the fifth trial, senior please impart your teachings.\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words fell, Tang San rose into the air, flying towards the triangular platform below the Seahorse Sacred Pillar.</p><br/><p>Against Tang San\u2019s expectations, Seahorse Douluo didn\u2019t draw on the strength of the Seahorse Sacred Pillar\u2019s strength to use the sea to attack him, and just accelerating once, he landed safely on the Seahorse Sacred Pillar platform.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo looked at Tang San landing in front of him,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already prepared to begin the fifth trial?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m already prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo clearly knew the contents of Tang San\u2019s trial,</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the examination begins, within the next seventy two hours, you must defeat us seven sacred pillar Douluo one by one. If you exceed the time or cannot completely defeat us all, it will be viewed as failing the trial. Within one year, you still have a chance to challenge again. In the process of the examination, we won\u2019t draw on the Seagod\u2019s strength of the sacred pillars. We will only rely on our own strength to conduct your examination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San bowed in salute to Seahorse Douluo.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo leaned to the side, not receiving Tang San\u2019s salute. Extending his right hand, the Seahorse Sacred pillar flashed with light, a golden ray soaring up, overpowering the still oncoming dawn.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, as if responding to the Seahorse Sacred Pillar\u2019s golden light, golden light rose separately in six distant directions, converging together with the light from the Seahorse Sacred Pillar. The seven golden lights formed an immense ball of light in the sky, emanating several dozen concentrated golden flames.</p><br/><p>Seahorse Douluo said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThese flames symbolize your trial time. When they are completely extinguished, it means the seventy two hours have have already passed, and at that time the trial will be failed. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden blue light suddenly flourished. At the same time as Tang San released the spirit Blue Silver Emperor, he also launched his seventh spirit ability, Blue Silver Avatar. Even though he had absolute confidence in himself, this was also his first time fighting a Title Douluo one on one. He absolutely wouldn\u2019t be careless. This was the sea within the sea, it was a place most suited for sea spirit masters to show their strength. If he didn\u2019t go all out, how could he guarantee victory?</p><br/><p>At the same time as Tang San released his spirit, Seahorse Douluo also released his. In an instant, his whole body was enveloped in bizarre ash gray armor, and behind him appeared a giant seahorse image very similar to the one carved on top of the Seahorse Sacred Pillar. Two yellow, two purple, five black, nine spirit rings flashed simultaneously. Without a hundred thousand year spirit ring, this was already the most ideal spirit ring configuration. Capable of becoming one of the protectors of the Seagod\u2019s seven sacred pillars, Seaghorse Douluo\u2019s personal strength really wasn\u2019t common.</p><br/><p>However, as Seahorse Douluo saw the spirit rings Tang San released, he still couldn\u2019t help being sluggish for a moment. Two yellow, one purple, two black, three red. Eight spirit rings flickered with dazzling light, not only were there two more than three years ago, but both of those two were hundred thousand year red spirit rings!</p><br/><p>[1] Sea Witch Douluo - () \u201cSea Devil Woman Douluo\u201d, shortened to () \u201cSea Woman Douluo\u201d.</p><br/><p>[2] Sea Devil Douluo - () is shortened to ()</p><br/>\n</div>"}

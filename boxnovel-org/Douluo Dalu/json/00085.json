What is it?\"</p><br/><p>Tang San said, </p><br/><p>\"Do you still remember the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure that I used two days ago to suppress the poisonous fog? As an immortal treasure herb, it can be considered to be one of nature's rarest gems. If I were to expose it to the surroundings, just its aura alone should attract the attention of powerful spirit beasts. However, as such, it would be impossible for me to guess what manner of beasts it could bring. It is quite possible that it could summon an exceedingly high quality spirit beast that we cannot hope to defeat, furthermore, the quantity it can summon will not be low either.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Flender realized it wasn't because Tang San purposely withheld a solution earlier, but because this solution was truly far too dangerous. In the worst case scenario, it was possible that they could face total annihilation.</p><br/><p>Even though Flender, Zhao Wuji, and Liu Erlong were all rank 70 plus spirit masters, some especially powerful spirit beasts could easily destroy them.</p><br/><p>Just like the Titan Giant Ape they encountered in the Star Dou Great Forest; a terrifying existence that even a Titled Douluo dare not easily provoke.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Gang, what do you think?\" </p><br/><p>Flender posed the question to Grandmaster</p><br/><p>Grandmaster pondered for a moment and said, </p><br/><p>\"Little San's idea is not necessarily unusable; it all depends on how we approach it. Little San, can you still find the lair of Dugu Bo?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing Grandmaster's question, Tang San's eyes immediately lit up, his inner thought progression closely mirrored Grandmaster's so even though Grandmaster had not revealed his idea, he already understood.</p><br/><p>\"Master, you mean to use the venom left behind by the Old Freak to protect us?\"</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled faintly and nodded. Right now everyone else were still baffled, not understanding what this pair of master and disciple were talking about.</p><br/><p>Tang San at Grandmaster's indication explained that because this Sunset Forest housed Poison Douluo Dugu Bo's private hideout, the perimeter near the location of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well was protected by Dugu Bo's poisonous formation.</p><br/><p>That poison formation came from Dogu Bo's horrifyingly potent venom abilities.</p><br/><p>Even a ten thousand year spirit beast wouldn\u2019t dare take a step past the boundary.</p><br/><p>Of course, such a poison posed no challenge to Tang San. Even if Dugu Bo had not already given them the antidote, he could still easily produce an antidote himself or rely on the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure to suppress the poison.</p><br/><p>By exposing the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure outside of the poison formation, they could attract many spirits beasts and should at any time the beasts become too powerful, they could retreat back into the protection of the poison and no longer fear being overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>When they wanted to leave, they could simply exit the Sunset Forest in a different direction.</p><br/><p>Now that they had a method, everyone immediately set out for the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well under Tang San's directions.</p><br/><p>The Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well was located in the center of the Sunset Forest, equidistant to the edges of the forest, and since the Shrek Academy group had already been inside the Sunset Forest for some time, it took them less than half a day to reach the outside perimeters Dugu Bo\u2019s poison formation.</p><br/><p>Tang San with a serious expression passed out two pills to each person, </p><br/><p>\"The poison the old freak used for protection here is extremely insidious, although it will affect spirit masters to a lesser degree compared to spirit beasts, if your spirit energy is less than 70 ranks, a single step inside the protected ground and your death will be assured. First take one of the pills, it will ensure your safety for a day, tomorrow at the same time take the second pill. I believe two days should provide us ample time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, Tang San began the preparations. He first entered the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well alone and retrieved some of the fertile mud from the banks where the two sides of the well flowed together. After that he returned and dug out a hole outside of the poison formation and placed the mud within before carefully planting the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure on top.</p><br/><p>The Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure was different from Xiao Wu\u2019s Yearning Heartbroken Red that would never wilt. Once it had left the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse, if it didn\u2019t receive enough nature\u2019s spiritual nourishment, it will slowly wilt.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the soil from the side of the Ice and Fire Yin Yang Well had sufficient energy to nourish it; otherwise Tang San would never let it touch regular soil.</p><br/><p>Having completed the temporary planting of the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, Tang San took out a small jade bottle from the Wishful Hundred Treasure Purse. As he removed the stopper from the bottle, a thick cloud of briny stench wallowed out, immediately filling the air. Even the fragrance of the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure couldn\u2019t suppress its terrible smell.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what is that thing? The smell is killing me\u201d </p><br/><p>Dai Mubai who always loved cleanliness, immediately dodged far away when he smelled it.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, and thought to himself, \u2018Boss Dai, how can you possibly know that this liquid with it unbearable stench was synthesized by me using more than ten kinds of precious ingredients. Its rarity is almost comparable to that of the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure.\u2019</p><br/><p>He very carefully tilted the bottle above the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, allowing a single drop of black liquid to fall onto its stamen. Tang San then carefully resealed the jade bottle and returned it into his Hundred Treasure Purse.</p><br/><p>An extraordinary scene unfolded. The Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure\u2019s stamen began emitting a dense of purple gas, it\u2019s originally gentle fragrance immediately growing more powerful. The smell of the flower was no longer limited to within its area of effect, instead started to quickly permeate the surrounding air and beyond.</p><br/><p>Even Dai Mubai who had evacuated the area previously to escape the stench could feel perfumed air tickling his nose.</p><br/><p>Tang San explained to his group, </p><br/><p>\u201cThe medicine I used on the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure will nourish it, causing it to temporarily lose its poison suppression effect for about two hours, however, within this time its scent will rapidly spread to a minimum of ten li[1]. This should be more than enough to attract some spirit beasts. After all, the scent belongs to one of the exceedingly rare heavenly treasures; there should no beasts that wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the group couldn\u2019t help but be amazed at Tang San\u2019s application of medicine. Of course they all attributed this to the half year Tang San spent studying under Dugu Bo.</p><br/><p>Nourishing the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure and attracting spirit beasts, for Tang San, this could be considered two birds with one stone. As the gentle scent slowly saturated the air, the Shrek Academy party also became increasingly alert.</p><br/><p>The three with the weakest fighting power, Oscar, Ning Rongrong and Grandmaster were positioned closest to the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, the rest are around them, carefully observing in all directions.</p><br/><p>Having finished preparing the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, Tang San did not immediately join his friends in surveying the surroundings but rather walked around the flower a distance away. The scent produced by the divine flora held great attraction to all spirit beasts regardless of their cultivation level.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent the spirit beast with too low of a cultivate level to disturb them and disrupt their planning, Tang San prepared his own layer of protection via poison.</p><br/><p>His poison formation clearly wasn\u2019t as severe as the one created by Dugu Bo, but it should be effective in filtering the spirit beasts. According to Tang San\u2019s calculations, spirit beasts that had less than two thousand years of cultivation should not be able to easily enter.</p><br/><p>Spirit beasts were different from humans; their senses were much sharper. Especially towards dangers such as poison, their judgement was rarely wrong.</p><br/><p>Once they discovered that the poison was not something they could resist, they would never risk their lives.</p><br/><p>With the assistance of this poison protected ground, the Shrek Academy\u2019s group of people could save a lot of energy. They only need to choose targets among the sufficiently cultivated spirit beasts.</p><br/><p>The stage had been set, all that was left was to tighten their formation and wait. Even though this hunting method could easily attract more powerful spirit beasts, it was equally dangerous. Whether the spirit beasts that came were too powerful or too weak, neither would satisfy Tang San and the others\u2019 requirements. As a result, no matter how you put it, luck held a certain part.</p><br/><p>The lure of the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure\u2019s effect was even bigger than Tang San had expected. Once they have finished setting up, less than a cup of tea\u2019s time had passed before the first spirit beast appeared.</p><br/><p>A low rumbling roar and a faint stench reached them, the trees to their left started to sway, as if brushed by a gale.</p><br/><p>\u201cCloud follows the dragon and wind follows the tiger. It should be a spirit beast of the tiger family. Everyone be careful.\u201d </p><br/><p>Grandmaster calmly deduced.</p><br/><p>Just as Grandmaster finished speaking, a gorgeous yet ferocious tiger burst through the thickets.</p><br/><p>The tiger was covered from head to toe in murky black fur; the only exception being the \u201cking\u201d character[2] on its forehead patterned in white. The length of its body was over three meters long and stood at one meter fifty shoulder height. Although it was quite large, it was nevertheless very nimble.</p><br/><p>Even before anyone had a clear look at the beast, it already pounced towards them. Its movement like a trail of shadows and its aim was precisely the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure being protected behind everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin combat!\u201d </p><br/><p>Tang San roared, and without withholding any spirit power raised his arm, releasing a Spider Web Restraint. Due to his spirit power increase, his limit had now increased to four Spider Web Restraints.</p><br/><p>Spirit beasts from their outer appearance can be seen that generally those with cultivation less than ten thousand years would increase in size the more they cultivate, but those that have surpassed ten thousand years instead will start decreasing in the size the more powerful they grow.</p><br/><p>Of course, there are some exceptions, but other than spirit beasts that are especially powerful or weak most do follow this development path. The black tiger before them could easily be identified as one that has cultivated between three thousand to five thousand years, perfectly suitable.</p><br/><p>Tang San without hesitation chose to fight rather than flee.</p><br/><p>The green light expanded in a flash. Sometimes having too fast of a speed is not always good; such as the case for this spirit beast Phantom Tiger[3] that only has the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure in its eyes.</p><br/><p>The Phantom Tiger\u2019s horrific speed and combat prowess was well known, it can be considered to be among the strongest spirit beasts. It was also incredibly aggressive and will not hesitate to fight anyone that dares intrude in its territory to the death.</p><br/><p>Because its speed was incomparable, even other spirit beasts that had achieved similar years of cultivation, ordinarily would not seek to fight it.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San unleash Spider Web Restraint at the Phantom Tiger, its body flickered strangely, and the originally one Phantom Tiger suddenly turned into three.</p><br/><p>The one in the Spider Web Restraint faded away unseen like a mirage, while the other two advanced even faster.</p><br/><p>Phantom Tiger\u2019s innate ability, Shadow Doppelg\u00e4nger.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai roared deeply, four spirit rings simultaneously flashing up from below. When the Phantom Tiger appeared, his body already swiftly swelled up, and now watching the Phantom Tiger dash forward he went head to head with it without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>A pair of tiger paws slapped forward, and from his mouth a white light jetted out, already releasing White Tiger Light Wave.</p><br/><p>Spirit power rising substantially increased the might of spirit abilities, and Dai Mubai\u2019s goal was also only to block the Phantom Tiger\u2019s charge.</p><br/><p>In the flash of white light, another Phantom Tiger disappeared. Without a doubt, Dai Mubai\u2019s target had also been a shadow.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun and Xiao Wu went up simultaneously, preparing a cooperative attack on the Phantom Tiger\u2019s true body. It\u2019s enormous body flashed with black light, once again separating two silhouettes. By now it was already in front of everyone, the three forms simultaneously charging at the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure from different angles. With the previous lesson in mind, right now nobody actually knew which form was after all the real Phantom Tiger.</p><br/><p>At this moment, purple golden light flashed out of Tang San\u2019s eyes, his gaze sweeping, already shouting,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe left one is real. Careful, Zhuqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the gaze of Purple Demon Eye there was nowhere for the Phantom Tiger to hide. Even though Tang San\u2019s eyes still couldn\u2019t be called \u2018piercing eyes\u2019, after reaching the mustard seed stage, his eyes could even distinguish energy attribute differences, and could naturally differentiate the the aura fluctuations around the three Phantom Tigers.</p><br/><p>Right now, the only one confronting the real body was Zhu Zhuqing, and behind her back were Ning Rongrong and Oscar. This Phantom Tiger was undoubtedly clever, choosing the weakest direction to attack from.</p><br/><p>Flender, Liu Erlong and Zhao Wuji were all already waiting for action with their strength stored up. If the Shrek Seven Devils were unable to withstand the attack of this Phantom Tiger, they would act immediately.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils had cooperated for so long that the tacit understanding between them had long ago already reached a certain boundary. Seeing Zhu Zhuqing in danger, the gold purple light in Tang San\u2019s eyes suddenly intensified, everyone seeing a glaring light flash past.</p><br/><p>That Phantom Tiger hissed sharply, and its forward momentum immediately slowed down somewhat, and even the other two disappeared like smoke.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing very clearly understood that there was no space to dodge behind her, and advanced rather than retreating, going up to meet the Phantom Tiger\u2019s charge. It was also now that three streams of warmth entered her body from behind, strength, agility as well as spirit power simultaneously upgrading substantially, immediately letting her condition surpass her peak.</p><br/><p>Hell Rush Stab unleashed, Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s delicate body directly struck the Phantom Tiger, the keen blades at her fingertips ruthlessly flitting across the Phantom Tiger\u2019s throat, leaving behind several deep cuts.</p><br/><p>The pain woke up the Phantom Tiger from Tang San\u2019s mental attack, and with a fierce roar, black light rushed out from its whole body and it distorted, inconceivably shifting sideways, just dodging away from Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s followup Hell Hundred Claws.</p><br/><p>However, this brief moment\u2019s obstruction was already enough. Dai Mubai\u2019s tall figure already charged over from the side. The tiger stripes all over his overbearing form had all turned golden, and snarling, golden light burst out. With his body as the center, countless fist sized golden spheres of light locked on to the Phantom Tiger, flocking towards it. It was precisely the fourth spirit ability Dai Mubai obtained not long ago, White Tiger Meteor Shower.</p><br/><p>In terms of burst attack power, perhaps this fourth spirit ability of Dai Mubai\u2019s couldn\u2019t compare to Fatty\u2019s Phoenix Cry Sky Strike, but its greatest feature was that it could lock in on the opponent. Once the target was locked in, all the White Tiger Meteors formed from spirit power would launch as a concentrated volley.</p><br/><p>The entire attack power could be concentrated on one opponent, and they could also disperse to attack multiple opponents.</p><br/><p>The attack power contained by each ball was equal to one tenth of Dai Mubai\u2019s spirit power, which showed how powerful growth potential this spirit ring gave him. He could launch more than a hundred meteors.</p><br/><p>If the Phantom Tiger hadn\u2019t suffered Tang San\u2019s mental attack it could still have used its Doppelg\u00e4nger ability to as much as possible of Dai Mubai\u2019s attack, but right now its mind was injured by Purple Demon Eye, and it was temporarily unable to fully use Doppelg\u00e4nger. Helplessly, it could only stiffly resist Dai Mubai\u2019s attack with its own body.</p><br/><p>Black light flashed out and transformed into a black light cover that enveloped the Phantom Tiger. Each White Tiger Meteor that bombarded it would erupt in a loud explosion, and concentrated booms echoed continuously, ring after ring of golden ripples erupting on that black light.</p><br/><p>The Phantom Tiger curled up its body as much as possible, making the area suffering the attack smaller in order to increase its defense.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 cooperation was so implicit, Ning Rongrong\u2019s hand supported the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, already releasing her three spirit abilities on the five people in charge of attacking.</p><br/><p>Besides strength and speed amplification, her third spirit ability, also a thousand year spirit ability, directly amplified spirit power. In other words, currently the effective spirit power of Tang San and the others was one hundred forty percent that of normal.</p><br/><p>The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s effect as the first support spirit had become more and more clear as Ning Rongrong\u2019s strength grew.</p><br/><p>Of course, as a result of the spirit ability effects increasing, the consumption of Ning Rongrong\u2019s own spirit power was no doubt immense. Amplifying three aspects simultaneously, even though she already possessed fortieth ranked spirit power, she could at most persevere for ten minutes.</p><br/><p>Intense explosions made the soil turn, the Phantom Tiger was like an angry wolf in a small boat, constantly rocked by the shocks. But it was indeed powerful, under this kind of attack it actually still didn\u2019t collapse.</p><br/><p>When the White Tiger Meteor Shower finally ended, the instant all the explosions finished, suddenly the Phantom Tiger\u2019s curled up body instantly unfolded. Immediately followed by an immense flash of black light and shadow bursting from within its body, going straight for Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>That black light and shadow suddenly condensed in midair into an identical form as the Phantom Tiger, with even the same size. Terrifying energy fluctuations made the air issue ear-piercing sharp hisses, as if cut open by that black light.</p><br/><p>The five Shrek Seven Devils in charge of attack now surrounded the Phantom Tiger, but it movements were really too fast, and nobody had expected that after just now having endured the White Tiger Meteor Shower bombardment and with blood flowing from its nose and mouth, it could still so quickly issue an all out attack.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even enough time for Tang San to release Blue Silver Grass to save Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>A more than three thousand year spirit beast\u2019s all out attack was terrifying, the Phantom Tiger\u2019s attack capability couldn\u2019t be any less than the Pink Queen. The reason it chose to attack Zhu Zhuqing was because behind her was the closest way to the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure.</p><br/><p>As long as it could break out from this situation, it could not only grab the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure, but also turn and escape.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this Phantom Tiger still underestimated Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s strength and resolve.</p><br/><p>Confronting this black light and shadow attack, Zhu Zhuqing didn\u2019t dodge or escape, her third spirit ring flashed with purple light, both hands like lightning folding over her head, the claw blades of the five fingers on each hand fusing together with astonishing speed, becoming a one chi[4] long sharp blade.</p><br/><p>Black light also rushed out from within Zhu Zhuqing, and her whole body seemed to become a part of that sharp blade, swinging both hands down to meet the black light released from the Phantom Tiger.</p><br/><p>This was the thousand year spirit ring ability Zhu Zhuqing obtained after reaching the thirtieth rank \u2014\u2014 Hell Decapitation.</p><br/><p>Equally ear piercing tearing noises resounded, on both sides of the Hell Decapitation, the air distorted like rippling water, clearly splitting open.</p><br/><p>The black light blade only condensed in a straight line, and just as it struck down it heavily bombarded that Phantom Tiger\u2019s transformed shadow.</p><br/><p>With the assistance of Ning Rongrong\u2019s Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, this attack could be said to be Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s most powerful attack at present.</p><br/><p>There was no noise of a collision, only a teeth ache inducing grinding sound.</p><br/><p>In midair, the Phanttom Tiger shadow paused before that sharp Hell Decapitation attack, and the instant the Hell Decapitation struck it was cut in half.</p><br/><p>But, this was after all only the third spirit ability, while this shadow attack could be said to be the Phantom Tiger\u2019s all out attack. Its body already came charging closely behind.</p><br/><p>The might of the Hell Decapitation was in the end still by far counteracted by the Phantom Tiger\u2019 far superior energy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because it was stopped, after that black shadow halted, it immediately used even higher speed to strike at Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>And this moment was just after Zhu Zhuqing had just released her full strength attack, the dangerous juncture when new strength had not yet been born.</p><br/><p>A massive silhouette just like a shield moved across in front of Zhu Zhuqing, and without any fanfare struck out head on with a white furred tiger palm.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, that massive silhouette swayed once, but still didn\u2019t agree to retreat a single step. It was precisely the Evil Eye White Tiger Dai Mubai.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s Hell Decapitation couldn\u2019t completely cut open the Phantom Tiger\u2019s attack, it could still fight for time. The instant he discovered the danger Dai Mubai had rushed over, just in time to shield Zhu Zhuqing.</p><br/><p>Using his tyrannical spirit power to shield her from the remaining attack.</p><br/><p>In spite of wisps of blood flowing from the corners of his mouth, Dai Mubai immediately revealed his overbearing side. Faced with the Phantom Tiger\u2019s charge, condensing spirit power he released White Tiger Body Barrier, stiffly blocking the Phantom Tiger\u2019s charge.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>White Tiger collided with Phantom Tiger, a muffled grunt and a sharp hiss echoed practically simultaneously. Dai Mubai staggered back before turning, but that Phantom Tiger was also sent flying by him.</p><br/><p>A slender figure quietly appeared behind the Phantom Tiger, a pair of slender perfectly straight thighs quietly winding around its neck, Waist Bow launching, Xiao Wu completed a graceful backwards summersault in the air, and under the powerful strength of her Waist Bow the Phantom Tiger\u2019s more than three meters long body was thrown directly into the air, and slammed back down heavily on the ground.</p><br/><p>There was an intense boom.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the Phantom Tiger was stunned.</p><br/><p>A flicker of red light, Ma Hongjun\u2019s plump body already since long ago waited where the Phantom Tiger fell, and the instant Xiao Wu\u2019s long legs released it, his right fist also accurately struck the ground. He and the Phantom Tiger were completely enveloped within distorted air.</p><br/><p>A resonant phoenix cry once again echoed in the Sunset Forest, and along with an immense bird of flame soaring up, and the large Phantom Tiger no longer even whimpered.</p><br/><p>From Zhu Zhuqing halting the Phantom Tiger with Hell Decapitation, to Dai Mubai tyrannically blocking it from the front and sending it flying, Xiao Wu\u2019s midair Soft Skill linking up to Ma Hongjun\u2019s right hand restricting it with Phoenix Cry Sky Strike, all of this flowed as smoothly as running water and moving clouds.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The Phantom Tiger\u2019s body covered in flames fell heavily on the ground. Even if it wanted to crawl it wouldn\u2019t be able to succeed.</p><br/><p>The red hot phoenix flames were constantly eroding its body. Successively enduring Dai Mubai\u2019s White Tiger Meteor Shower and Ma Hongjun\u2019s Phoenix Cry Sky Strike, even though this Phantom Tiger was any number of times stronger than the Pink Queen, in the end it still suffered life threatening injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuqing, do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s calm voice promptly echoed.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhuqing moved around Dai Mubai, transforming into a series of incomplete shadows, and the instant the Phantom Tiger drew its last breath she relied on her Hell Rush Stab to make the last attack, her right hand claws thrusting into the Phantom Tiger\u2019s left eye to reach its brain, ending its life.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun opened his mouth wide and inhaled, withdrawing the phoenix flames on the Phantom Tiger and polluting Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s arm, putting a satisfactory period to this time\u2019s perfect kill scene.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Grandmaster\u2019s somewhat impatient voice suddenly reached them,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, quickly take back your Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that the Shrek Seven Devils paid attention, on their side they had dealt with the Phantom Tiger, but on the other side, Zhao Wuji, Flender and Liu Erlong were all already fighting.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know when, but during the fight seven wildly different spirit beasts had appeared, in the process of besieging Flender\u2019s trio. If it wasn\u2019t for the trio\u2019s immense strength, if even one slipped by them it wouldn\u2019t have been easy for the Shrek Seven Devils to handle.</p><br/><p>Originally, when the Phantom Tiger appeared and drew the attacks of the Shrek Seven Devils, one after another seven spirit beasts arrived. Tang San\u2019s seven could cope with one five thousand or so years spirit beasts, but if there was another, they might take casualties. Flender, Liu Erlong and Zhao Wuji immediately went to meet them, helping them block the attacks of later spirit beasts.</p><br/><p>After this the amount of spirit beasts grew greater and greater, one more powerful than the other. If it went on like this, perhaps even they would be unable to resist.</p><br/><p>Therefore Grandmaster had Tang San quickly take away the target of these spirit beasts.</p><br/><p>With just a glance, Tang San already had a grasp of the battle circumstances, and without the slightest hesitation said to Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cMubai, you bring the Phantom Tiger\u2019s corpse and Zhuqing into the poison formation first, let her absorb the spirit ring. The rest of you follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai looked distracted a moment, but only hesitated slightly. He naturally had confidence in Tang San and only smiled wryly inside. Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s character wasn\u2019t too good to begin with, and when further absorbing this tiger type spirit, how couldn\u2019t she become even more like a tigress? However her spirit was also a cat type, and this Phantom Tiger excelled at speed, seemingly it was also suitable.</p><br/><p>Along with Dai Mubai and Zhu Zhuqing first stepping into the poison formation, Tang San took the variety of sausages Oscar handed over. After each of them first at a recovery sausage, they immediately gathered towards Flender\u2019s trio.</p><br/><p>Strength. This was strength!</p><br/><p>Watching Flender\u2019s trio fighting, the Shrek Seven Devils couldn\u2019t keep from inwardly sighing in admiration.</p><br/><p>Flender, Liu Erlong and Zhao Wuji were all three Spirit Sage powers over seventieth rank. Right now the three weren\u2019t coordinating at all, only fighting their own battles, but withstood the attacks of those seven spirit beasts without allowing them to take one step past the line.</p><br/><p>The reason they didn\u2019t cooperate wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t want to, but rather because they couldn\u2019t. The might of the trio\u2019s spirit abilities was too great, and if they cooperated with each other they would instead cause disturbances, making them unable to bring out their full strength.</p><br/><p>At such a time, Ning Rongrong showed the effect of the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda spirit she had inherited.</p><br/><p>When the Phantom Tiger was defeated, she had already stopped assisting Tang San and the others. Right now the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s three rings of light flashed once again, becoming three lines of light that simultaneously poured into Flender\u2019s trio.</p><br/><p>The more powerful the Spirit Master the greater effect the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s support would have, this was something all the Shrek Seven Devils knew. Because its support increased by a percentage, the higher the base value the more powerful the upgrade effect. But when truly used in combat, that reversing heaven and earth terrifying effect still shocked Tang San and the others.</p><br/><p>The light around Flender\u2019s trio simultaneously rose sharply, and the seven spirit beasts that had previously been constantly attacking them were forced to retreat practically simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Ning Rongrong\u2019s support could also only continue for a few short breaths. This was still the first time she supported Spirit Masters with so much higher spirit power than her own.</p><br/><p>The feeling was as different as black and white compared to supporting the Shrek Seven Devils, in just a few seconds she could feel her spirit power draining away, her whole body unspeakably unwell.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat into the poison formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender shouted. He had no choice but to make this decision, because he saw more than ten spirit beasts more rushing out from the forest, their target on their side.</p><br/><p>The Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure\u2019s fragrance was dense and lasted long without scattering, even though right now it had already been withdrawn by Tang San into the Hundred Treasure Purse, the scent was still there. The later arriving spirit beasts unexpectedly had a lot that were over the ten thousand year level, this wasn\u2019t something Flender and the others could hold back.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils and Grandmaster swiftly retreated into the poison formation Dugu Bo had set up. Although Flender\u2019s trio had lost Ning Rongrong\u2019s support, with their strength, even if they couldn\u2019t win, they could still run.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because the poison formation had been here for so long, but just as Tang San expected, when the approximately twenty spirit beasts reached its edge they immediately stopped, and could only make some long range attacks.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately their range was limited, and Flender and the others blocked them a few times as the Shrek Academy party already moved within the poison formation where they couldn\u2019t reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, that Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure of yours really is too effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender looked with some trepidation at the still increasing number of spirit beasts outside. Who said Sunset Forest didn\u2019t have formidable spirit beasts? Among the twenty nine spirit beasts already gathered outside, there were at least six or seven whose strength exceeded ten thousand years, even so much that one spirit beast\u2019s cultivation approached thirty thousand years. The other spirit beasts were also all over three thousand years.</p><br/><p>Even the impulsive Liu Erlong understood that such high level spirit beasts wasn\u2019t something they could match, and could only avoid.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze turned to the side where Zhu Zhuqing was already absorbing the spirit ring, and happily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least we didn\u2019t waste our strength. That Phantom Tiger is quite good, whether in ability or attributes, they\u2019re both very suitable for Zhuqing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was now constantly observing the spirit beasts outside. Due to the Aromatic Silk Beauty Immortal Treasure\u2019s scent still not scattering, right now the spirit beasts were still pacing outside the poison formation, while absorbing the scent left in the air they glared like tigers watching prey at their side.</p><br/><p>At least until the fragrance scattered they clearly wouldn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>Tang San raised the sleeve on his right arm and swiftly removed the Flying God Claw and handed it to Flender to the side.</p><br/><p>Flender puzzled said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDean, there are so many spirit beasts outside, and there are a few that suits us. They don\u2019t dare enter the poison formation, so we need to pull them inside to hunt them. With your, teacher Zhao and teacher Erlong\u2019s strength, pulling them inside shouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender astonished said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019re joking. Can\u2019t you see how many spirit beasts are outside? As soon as we go out, we\u2019ll definitely be mobbed. Even we couldn\u2019t retreat intact. There really are too many spirit beasts outside, the instant burst power they could produce would give a headache even to Title Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, always planning in advance pointed to the Flying God Claw in his hand, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m giving you this. With it you basically don\u2019t need to go outside. Mubai, little Ao, give your Flying God Claws for teacher Zhao and teacher Erlong to use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, Flender was immediately greatly curious,</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, so you kids still had another move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he still didn\u2019t understand what Tang San wanted them to do, he could see from Tang San\u2019s expression that he held considerable certainty.</p><br/><p>From the suggestion of setting up by the poison formation, he clearly had already planned ahead, one plan after another, his mind was even more meticulous than the majority of adults.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Clear Sky Douluo\u2019s genes were this good?</p><br/><p>Tang San helped the curious trio set up the Flying God Claws on their right arms, then gave them a detailed explanation in its use.</p><br/><p>[1] 5km</p><br/><p>[2] (wang )</p><br/><p>[3] () \u201cGhost/Crafty Tiger\u201d</p><br/><p>[4] 1  = \u2153 m</p><br/>\n</div>"}

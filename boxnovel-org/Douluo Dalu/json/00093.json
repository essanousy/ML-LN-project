Little San, this is the Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s present crown prince, his highness Xue Qinghe[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was inwardly alarmed, and immediately understood why this youth felt familiar. That was it, his appearance was somewhat similar to both emperor Xue Ye, as well as the ones that originally inconvenienced Shrek Academy, fourth prince Xue Beng and prince Xue Xing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s his highness the crown prince. Tang San offers his respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bowing slightly, Tang San was neither servile nor overbearing.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe praised:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf uncle Ning hadn\u2019t told me, I really would have found it difficult to believe you\u2019re only fourteen. To think that when I was fourteen, I was just an ignorant boy. I\u2019m happy to meet you, and if you don\u2019t mind, call me big brother Xue. It\u2019s better not to mention the words \u2018crown prince\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San couldn\u2019t help being astounded by the other party\u2019s manner of speech and bearing; did he really have the same father as that prince Xue Beng? Why was there such a difference? As a person of two lifetimes, Tang San inferred from Ning Fengzhi bringing him to meet this crown prince that the prince had already obtained the support of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Recalling that emperor Xue Ye wasn\u2019t exactly young, could it be that there was a struggle for position in the Heaven Dou imperial family?</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi said from the side:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s sit down and talk. The green tea here is pretty good. Little San, you try it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three host and guests sat down, and Xue Qinghe personally poured tea for Ning Fengzhi and Tang San. Without need to drink, just the scent had a feeling of penetrating deep into the heart. Further adding the antique decorations in the room, it was very easy to feel relaxed both mentally and physically.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xue, I heard from uncle Ning that you knew something about my father going into seclusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know everything. Only what I heard from the court officials. Your esteemed father was always my idol, so I asked around at that time. According to what I learned, the reason your esteemed father disappeared from the Spirit Master world, was related to Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Big brother Xue, do you know something concrete?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat anxiously asked. According to what Strength Clan chief Tai Tan and Ning Fengzhi said, his father was one of the twin Douluo of the first ranked of the seven great schools, Clear Sky School. With such a venerable position, how could he have degenerated into a drunkard blacksmith? The reasons for this had always been what Tang San wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe didn\u2019t keep him in suspense, nodding:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I learned was this. Approximately fifteen years ago, counting back, it should have been before you were born. Spirit Hall was apparently looking for something. That thing was extremely important to Spirit Hall. Consequently, Spirit Hall dispatched a formidable line-up to search all over. Not only did four platinum bishops all participate, but even the Supreme Pontiff at that time as well as his two personal guards participated. The people I talked to didn\u2019t know what specifically they were looking for, but from the way Spirit Hall\u2019s senior members came out in force, that was certainly something extremely important.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this thing seemed to have fallen into your father\u2019s hands. At that time your father wasn\u2019t at the Clear Sky School, but should have brought your mother to travel the Continent. Abruptly getting involved in this matter was presumably also made things extremely difficult. I also don\u2019t know the details of the negotiations between him and Spirit Hall. I only heard that your father declared his separation from Clear Sky School not long after. At that time, your father was still a Spirit Douluo and hadn\u2019t yet reached the Title Douluo realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long after this was another piece of news. It was said your father and Spirit Hall had a decisive duel somewhere, and was injured. But they apparently still didn\u2019t successfully obtain that thing. It was precisely from that battlefield that it was known your father had already reached the Title Douluo stage. Spirit Hall admitted to this themselves, and said your esteemed father had become the nowadays youngest Title Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Tang San couldn\u2019t help asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cMy information doesn\u2019t have anything pertaining to your mother. Only that less than a month after that battle, Spirit Hall announced the death of the Supreme Pontiff, and the succession of the new Supreme Pontiff. Therefore, my sources judged it very possible that the Supreme Pontiff was severely wounded in the battle with your father, dying not long after, and that your father chose to go into seclusion for this reason. Even though he had separated from Clear Sky School, he was after all still their most important direct disciple. His hiding was presumably also to keep the School from getting involved. After all, Spirit Hall really is too powerful, even so much that they\u2019re on an equal footing with the two great empires, not something a single school has the capability to resist. Even the present age\u2019s number one great school wouldn\u2019t be capable. It was also starting from this time that the Clear Sky School distanced itself from peoples\u2019 eyes, and very rarely moved in the Spirit Master world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi interjected:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf all this is true, then what\u2019s most important is finding out just what that thing Spirit Hall fought over was, and the true circumstances of that fight. This is perhaps also something only those involved would know. Only, it\u2019s certain that battle is closely related to your father\u2019s reason for going into seclusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San silently nodded. Even though Xue Qinghe\u2019s words were somewhat discrepant from his own conjecture, it was still extremely reasonable. In the Douluo Continent, only Spirit Hall would have the strength to force a Title Douluo into seclusion, and force the number one great school into seclusion. If his father had really killed the Supreme Pontiff, then the hatred and desire for revenge between him and Spirit Hall were enormous. In order to avoid implicating the School, in order to avoid pursuit, he had brought him to live in a small mountain village.</p><br/><p>But in Xue Qinghe\u2019s entire story there was no mention of his mother. Could it be that his mother had been killed by Spirit Hall in that battle?</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, Tang San\u2019s fists gradually tightened. Even if he had no relationship with his mother in this world, his life was after all given him by this mother. In his body flowed the blood of her and his father. He could not live under the same sky as his parents\u2019 enemies. If it truly was done by Spirit Hall, then\u2026...</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, an uncontrollable threatening cold light appeared in Tang San\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I know, I truly find it embarrassing. I\u2019ve dispatched people to investigate, but it\u2019s already been more than ten years, and I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be very effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for the information, big brother Xue. As far as I\u2019m concerned, being able to learn this is already very useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression very quickly recovered to normal.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe smiled faintly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for brother Tang to be polite, it\u2019s as easy as lifting my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the serious matters concluded, the trio drank tea and chatted idly. Tang San discovered that this Xue Qinghe wasn\u2019t only extremely entertaining in conversation, but also had extensive knowledge and learning. His style of conversation relaxed people, and throughout the conversation he never argued. Tang San discovered from his own observations that this person\u2019s mind was extremely broad, different as black and white from prince Xue Beng and prince Xue Xing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tang, it would be better to eat lunch together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe proposed.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll still return to the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe smiled faintly, and pulled out a golden medal from his chest. The golden medal design was simple, but it contained a stream of unusual energy, and on the surface was carved a Heaven character[2].</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, as a brother I won\u2019t keep you. I\u2019ll give you this medal. If there\u2019s any matter later on, use it to come find me at the imperial palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hesitated a moment on seeing the gold medal, and Ning Fengzhi to the side said:</p><br/><p>\u201cQinghe doesn\u2019t have any other intentions, take it. This badge is only Qinghe\u2019s personal seal, there are no other uses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ning Fengzhi say this, Tang San didn\u2019t decline. Picking up the heavy gold medal, he put it into his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe and Ning Fengzhi personally saw Tang San to the door of the teahouse, and Tang San bid farewell to the two and returned to Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>Seeing Tang San\u2019s gradually disappearing back, Xue Qinghe praising said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you\u2019re right. He really isn\u2019t like an only fourteen year old child. Not only does he conceal his thoughts, but his discourse and manner are all very steady. Truly worthy of being a child of the Clear Sky School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child\u2019s brilliance can\u2019t be accorded the Clear Sky School, it all relies on his own capability. Even I can\u2019t see his future clearly. If it was another Spirit Master, it would be very difficult to succeed with Blue Silver Grass as a spirit, but he\u2019s different. At such a young age he has not only already reached the fortieth rank, but the strength he has displayed is also not a bit different from fortieth ranked Spirit Masters with first rate spirits. In the future, if he can settle the issue of twin spirit backlash, this child is bound to become a character who calls the wind and summons the rain in the Continent, he will even surpass his father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe thought deeply and nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cI will pay special attention to researching the matters related to Clear Sky Douluo\u2019s withdrawal, I hope I can find some accurate information soon. As for Tang San, I\u2019ll first build a good relationship with him. Even though he\u2019s outstanding, right now he\u2019s still too young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi sternly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cQinghe, I must remind you of one thing. Judging by the time I\u2019ve interacted with this child, if you want his assistance in the future, then you can\u2019t try to recruit him, only try to be a true friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe looked distracted a moment, his gaze meeting Ning Fengzhi\u2019s. After a long time, he slowly nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I understand. Thank you for your directions.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way back to the Academy, Tang San\u2019s head was filled with what Xue Qinghe said. \u2018Father, for what reason did you clash with Spirit Hall, what about mother? Even though what Xue Qinghe had talked about hadn\u2019t mentioned his mother, Tang San still felt that his father\u2019s seclusion was directly related to his mother.</p><br/><p>The teahouse wasn\u2019t far from the Academy, and Tang San returned very quickly. He headed directly to the log cabin in the Academy forest, it had practically become their exclusive training spot.</p><br/><p>Right now, not only had the team returned, but Grandmaster and Liu Erlong were also back. Only Flender wasn\u2019t present.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster saw Tang San return, and waved at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked as he walked over.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI will train Rongrong alone, you come too. What I say should be useful to you as well. Training her also needs your cooperation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Ning Rongrong to the side. Right now the others were all in the vicinity of the log cabin, perhaps cultivating, or perhaps sitting together and chatting, but Ning Rongrong was at Grandmaster\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster brought Tang San and Ning Rongrong into the depths of the forest, and not even Liu Erlong followed.</p><br/><p>Having walked several hundred meters, Grandmaster stopped in a relatively spacious area.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong somewhat nervously asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, what special training do you have in mind for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even now she still had a trauma from Grandmaster\u2019s special demonic training.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, if I\u2019m not mistaken, your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School should have a technique called Heart Separation Control[3]. To what degree have you cultivated it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked distracted a moment, afterward answering:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019ve just cultivated it to Three Aperture Governing Heart. I can just manage to use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s brows wrinkled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means, still only the most elementary level. My special training for you is in this special area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the battle today was an easy win over the Heaven Dou Imperial Academy second team, their second team absolutely doesn\u2019t represent the overall strength of all advanced Spirit Master academies. Especially now that Tang San and Dai Mubai\u2019s strength has already been revealed. The opponents you will confront in the future will only be stronger and stronger. And that evolved Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda Spirit of yours can be said to be extremely gifted and rich in resources, one might say that your ability will have an extremely effect on whether you will be able to become champions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong giggled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, are you praising me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s complexion was stiff:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not praising you. Rather praising your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s spirit. It\u2019s still very difficult to reveal its might with your present capability. It doesn\u2019t have a very large effect on the team in a fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side, Tang San astonished said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, Rongrong is already on the fortieth level, her auxiliary is already outstanding. Able to simultaneously boost us fifty percent in four categories at the same time, that instantly erupting strength is practically enough to let us promote one class!\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong, right now she can boost you fifty percent in four attributes. Then, you ask Rongrong, if you Shrek Seven Devils were in a fight together, and she boosted the six of you at the same time, how long could she keep it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San puzzled looked at Ning Rongrong, whose complexion had also changed somewhat,</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, how do you know the secrets of our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that I come from the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Clan, also one of the three upper sects. The secrets of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s Spirit aren\u2019t so secret, it\u2019s not strange that I know about it. Not just me, but practically all formidable Spirit Masters would know. But despite this, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School is still the most powerful auxiliary system Spirit Master clan, do you know why this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong blankly shook her head.</p><br/><p>To the side Tang San couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because of that Heart Separation Control you mentioned? Teacher, can\u2019t you explain it clearly, what\u2019s the secret of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda Spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong looked at Grandmaster who nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, the reason why the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda holds the title as the number one auxiliary system spirit is admittedly related to the spirit itself, but this Heart Separation Control is even more important. It\u2019s admittedly important to raise spirit power, but to your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, this Heart Separation Control is even more important. If my guess is correct, then Rongrong\u2019s father, school master Ning\u2019s ability in Heart Separation Control should already have reached the Seven Aperture Exquisite Heart level. Tell me if I\u2019m wrong, Rongrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong nodded, and at the same time cleared Tang San\u2019s doubts,</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda Spirit\u2019s secret lies in spirit power consumption. The higher the level of spirit power, the higher the spirit ring, the more clear the disadvantage is. In my present condition, if I simultaneously boosted the six of you fifty percent in all four aspects, at most I could only endure for three seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree seconds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was gobsmacked.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cI called out Rongrong alone in order to keep everyone from hearing this secret. This world is impartial. Even though the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda is powerful in support, it also has its limitations. Because a Spirit Master\u2019s spirit power is finite, no matter how good your spirit is, if you don\u2019t have spirit power to support you it won\u2019t be able to show sufficient results. Because the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda\u2019s support ability is too powerful, its spirit power consumption is subsequently also frightening. Consider, for Rongrong to boost all six of you with fifty percent in four attributes with her fortieth level spirit power, what kind of concept is that? If it could be kept up for a long time, then wouldn\u2019t it be unparallelled? I recalled this issue that day when Rongrong assisted Flender and the others in when we were hunting spirit beasts. If it can\u2019t be settled satisfactorily, then it will be very difficult for her Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda Spirit to show adequate results in your future matches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San now understood,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re saying that the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s Heart Separation Control is the way to deal with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s called Heart Separation Control has the effect of controlling different spirit abilities at once. This control method is useful to any Spirit Master, but the effect is particularly pronounced for the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. For common Spirit Masters, more powerful abilities consume more spirit power, but this isn\u2019t the case for the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Each of their spirit abilities will consume the same amount of spirit power on the same level. Simply put, if Rongrong was a twentieth ranked Spirit Grandmaster, then the spirit power consumption of her two spirit abilities would be the one. Once she reached the thirtieth rank, the spirit power consumption of her three spirit abilities would still be the same. But because the boost rate has gone up, the spirit power consumption has also changed to two, and so on in a similar fashion. Thus, if she simply releases all her spirit abilities to boost at once, the spirit power consumption would be an astronomical figure. Let alone her, even a Title Douluo would find it very difficult to support that kind of drain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Heart Separation Control is the key point to settling this issue. One might say that in battle, the support needs of each combatant is different. For example, with Rongrong\u2019s current four spirit abilities, what\u2019s most important for you is only the spirit power boost, and her other three effects would be useless, it would only drain her spirit power. But Dai Mubai needs attack, defense, and spirit power boosts, agility amplification isn\u2019t as important. Being able to amplify them all would admittedly be good, but when spirit power is limited, boosting the key areas is undoubtedly where the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda can completely display it\u2019s support capability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s Heart Separation Control is split into five levels, Three Aperture Governing Heart, Four Aperture Constant Heart, Five Aperture Dispersed Heart, Six Aperture Wishful Heart, and Seven Aperture Exquisite Heart. Each level represents how many spirit abilities can be controlled at once and how many times they can be released. Such as Three Aperture Governing Heart, it indicates you can simultaneously manipulate three kinds of spirit abilities to accurately support three targets, Four Aperture Constant Heart indicates the ability to simultaneously manipulate four spirit abilities to support four targets. And under such accurate control, you can accomplish the degree I spoke of before, conducting the most suitable support to the people that need them the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Here, Grandmaster paused a moment, continuing after giving Tang San a meaningful glance:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe effect of Heart Separation Control isn\u2019t very large for common Spirit Masters, because the spirit power consumption of each spirit ability is different and there is little need to release all spirit abilities in one. Consequently, the cultivation method for this Heart Separation Control has been gradually lost with time. Only the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School would have it. Rongrong, I hope that before the finals you will be able to at least reach the Four Aperture Constant Heart stage. Like that, you can at least support four of your comrades at once, releasing different supporting spirit abilities at different times. This is the true secret of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stuck out her tongue, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you really are difficult to deal with. What you said is practically the same as what dad said. He also told me that if I wanted to really show the effects of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda, I had to assiduously cultivate Heart Separation Control. Only, the method for cultivating Heart Separation Control is too difficult, and it\u2019s so boring. That\u2019s why\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster indifferently glanced at Ning Rongrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to say that even your Three Aperture Governing Heart isn\u2019t completely mastered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s charming face turned red, but she still nodded, somewhat ashamed not daring to look at him again.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed lightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, as a direct descendant of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, you possess circumstances that other people don\u2019t. If such a gifted spirit isn\u2019t treasured, you will definitely come to regret it. You have to cultivate the esoterics of Heart Separation Control. Otherwise, even if you can become a Title Douluo in the future, you still won\u2019t meet the standards of a Support Spirit Master. Can you understand teacher\u2019s efforts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s voice was very mild, but such a gentle rebuke instead made Ning Rongrong feel even more ashamed. Exerting herself to nod, she said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, don\u2019t worry. From today on, I will definitely work hard to cultivate Heart Separation Control. I\u2019ll strive to reach Four Aperture Constant Heart shortly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s face held a trace of a smile, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I also haven\u2019t learned this Heart Separation Control, I can teach you a method. Remember, when using your support abilities hereafter, you must become the most miserly Spirit Master possible yourself. Even bits and pieces of spirit power must be conserved as far as possible. Each time you support must be done just perfect, not too much, not too little. As long as you can accomplish this, your support capabilities will be on the right track.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong recorded what Grandmaster said in her heart, and even if she didn\u2019t completely comprehend it, what Grandmaster said let her adequately recognize the effect of Heart Separation Control.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed lightly, his gaze falling on Tang San to the side,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy reason for calling little San over is actually selfishness. Heart Separation Control isn\u2019t much use for ordinary Spirit Masters, but it\u2019s different for him. He\u2019s a control system Spirit Master, and moreover has twin spirits. The spirit power of his new spirit ability can\u2019t be considered high. If he can master Heart Separation Control, then his control capabilities will be even greater on the battlefield. Especially when he possesses the spirit abilities of his second spirit later. Such circumstances will change even more clearly. Rongrong, I don\u2019t know what the rules of your Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School say, but if it isn\u2019t expressly stipulated, when you cultivate Heart Separation Control, can you let little San cultivate with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Grandmaster, somewhat eagerly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good. Heart Separation Control is the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s secret skill, how can it be taught to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being from Tang Sect, he clearly understood how much the sect\u2019s most profound techniques were valued. Let alone teaching it to outsiders, even if someone lusted after it he would immediately suffer Tang Sect\u2019s severe reprisals.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I teach it? Third brother, train together with me. This actually doesn\u2019t matter. As Grandmaster said, this Heart Separation Control originally wasn\u2019t our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s sole property, but since it was useful to us we always passed it down. What\u2019s more, with your favors to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, even if dad was here, he would definitely agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San still hesitated and wanted to decline, but Ning Rongrong interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what? Third brother, did I say anything when you gave me the immortal treasure tulip? Did I refuse? I didn\u2019t, because I really consider you my big brother. If a big brother gives something to his little sister, why should I refuse? Although at that time I didn\u2019t know how precious that immortal treasure herb was, even if I knew, I would still definitely receive it. Right now is the same, we Shrek Seven Devils are all one family. You\u2019ve always been selfless to everyone. This is just one tiny technique, if you refuse again, it will be like you don\u2019t consider me your little sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Ning Rongrong\u2019s rapid fire interrogation, Tang San was immediately left speechless. Of course he had a mind to learn this Heart Separation Control, but this was after all a school\u2019s secret skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Rongrong, ask uncle Ning first. If uncle Ning says I can learn it, then I\u2019ll cultivate together with you, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong somewhat resentfully pouted, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you still won\u2019t believe me? Dad definitely won\u2019t refuse. Since you insist, I\u2019ll go find him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go now. You don\u2019t even know where uncle Ning is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wanted to hold back Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can find dad. How couldn\u2019t our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School have ways to communicate? Grandmaster, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ning Rongrong ran directly towards the edge of the forest.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster laughed in spite of himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl, she really is impetuous. Little San, don\u2019t worry. Since I proposed it, Ning Fengzhi naturally won\u2019t refuse. Even though this Heart Separation Control is important to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, it\u2019s not a secret that can\u2019t be passed on to others. If my guess is correct, Ning Fengzhi will be eager to let you learn it. Like this, you will owe a favor to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. As school master, Ning Fengzhi stands tall and sees far, whether you or your father, you\u2019re both important targets. While Rongrong is off looking for her father, tell me, what did Ning Fengzhi want to talk to you about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Grandmaster say this, Tang San felt more at ease. Immediately, he related in detail his meeting with Xue Qinghe and the conversation the three of them had.</p><br/><p>Having heard Tang San\u2019s recount, after Grandmaster muttered to himself a while he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crown prince\u2019s information shouldn\u2019t be common knowledge. Able to find out so much couldn\u2019t have been easy. Spirit Hall has comprehensively blocked everything about that matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you know something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San eagerly asked. In front of Grandmaster, he never concealed anything.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But in theory, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with the information the crown prince gave you. Right now the key point lies in just what made all of Spirit Hall turn out in full strength, and when they returned in defeat, could be worth the loss of the Supreme Pontiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, wouldn\u2019t it be a spirit bone? To Spirit Masters, most precious should be spirit rings and spirit bones. Spirit rings can\u2019t be taken away, but spirit bones can.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think not. If it was a spirit bone, it would be impossible for Spirit Hall to fail. Even though your father became a Title Douluo, it would still be impossible to contend with Spirit Hall. In fact, besides the Supreme Pontiff, Spirit Hall still has at least three Title Douluo. Even if your father was even more powerful, it would still be impossible to deal with so many powers by himself. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the reason Spirit Hall didn\u2019t persist, isn\u2019t because that thing was damaged, but because it already lost its use. Don\u2019t tell me, it was a spirit beast? But how would spirit beasts be related to your father? Leaving aside how high the level of a spirit beast would have to be to draw the attention of Spirit Hall, just with the unreconciled conflict between spirit beasts and humans, it still wouldn\u2019t be near your father. And it would be impossible for your father to break away from the school to offend Spirit Hall without hesitating for a spirit beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s power of deduction was doubtless powerful, but hearing his analysis, Tang San was even more confused. Just what was that thing? It seemed that the only way to know was to see his father again.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong wasn\u2019t gone for long, and after an hour she had already excitedly come running back with a letter in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, for you. As I said, dad definitely agreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The message was very simple, and Tang San recognized Ning Fengzhi\u2019s handwriting. It said:</p><br/><p>Little San, Heart Separation Control really isn\u2019t some secret skill, if it\u2019s useful, train together with Rongrong as much as possible. How could such a tiny skill compare to your contributions to Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School? \u2014\u2014 Ning Fengzhi</p><br/><p>Even though it was only a few simple words, and even though Tang San clearly understood Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words held some intent of drawing him in, his heart still eased, unspeakably comforted. No matter what was said, Ning Fengzhi was the master of a school, and also a tolerant and generous senior.</p><br/><p>And so, from this afternoon on, Tang San and Ning Rongrong cultivated this skill together.</p><br/><p>The method for cultivating Heart Separation Control wasn\u2019t complex, but the method for cultivating this skill was different for different Spirit Masters. Ning Rongrong\u2019s cultivated by continuously releasing her different abilities, releasing each ability with different speed and time, looking for as great precision as possible, smoothly releasing and receiving. Right now, she simultaneously released three abilities, starting to cultivate the most basic Three Aperture Governing Heart.</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cSnow Clear River\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] ()</p><br/><p>[3] () This is when the first two characters are read separately, they could also be read together for \u201cDistraction Control\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t fit the ability.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

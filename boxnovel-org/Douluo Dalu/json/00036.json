But, where have your crossbow bolts gone to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, indicating another tree behind the first,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he walked over to that tree. This second tree was still ten metres from the first, as everyone reached him, they only then saw the traces of the bolts the Godly Zhuge Crossbow\u2019s launched.</p><br/><p>Sixteen crossbow bolts, in two neat rows, completely entering the tree.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji looked at that tree, taking another look at these bolts,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, did these crossbow bolts you shot penetrate that previous tree, then again enter this tree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Godly Zhuge Crossbow\u2019s power is very formidable, specialised in breaking spirit power defense. If their defensive power isn\u2019t exceptionally tyrannical, the target will be dead in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Tang San\u2019s explanation, everyone couldn\u2019t help but draw a breath, with such an unreasonable penetrating power, among everyone present, besides Zhao Wuji, all knew they would be unable to resist.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai muttered to himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is too potent, even if I used White Tiger Vajra Transformation, perhaps I would still be seriously hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San raised his hand to pat at the tree trunk, relying on Mysterious Heaven Skill to apply Capturing Dragon force, bit by bit shaking a crossbow bolt from within the tree trunk.</p><br/><p>This Godly Zhuge Crossbow\u2019s bolts were not easy to make, the ones previously fired into the Man Faced Demon Spider were clearly lost, but these he would hate to part with.</p><br/><p>While clapping the tree trunk, Tang San meanwhile said to Dai Mubai:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Godly Zhuge Crossbow can be said to be the common soldier\u2019s nightmare. But also, its greatest feature is not its power, but its hidden weapon characteristics of concealment and surprise. As long as it\u2019s loaded, shooting it doesn\u2019t require any spirit power. Even an ordinary person could easily use it. According to my calculations, Spirit Masters under fortieth rank if struck from the front, have very small odds of survival. On non-defense type Spirit Masters it has an extremely powerful restraining effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, is all this your research?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong asked.</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment, saying with a wry smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be considered so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could never tell everyone that these were techniques he had brought from another life.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong probing asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, can\u2019t you sell this thing to me? You can set the price. You know I\u2019m an auxiliary system Spirit Master, without any defensive capability. When everyone\u2019s lives are on the line, besides a bit of supporting spirit ability, I can only watch. If I had this thing, I could also have a bit of offensive strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San let slip a smile, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSell what, later I will give you one as a gift. Only, making this thing requires very expensive materials, this material expenditure is on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, the crossbow bolts had already been clapped out of the tree by Tang San, so everyone saw the appearance of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow\u2019s bolts.</p><br/><p>The bolts were eight cun long, without fletchings, the rear four cun were cylindrical, the front four cun were shaped to a needle point, the front-most three cun had a whole twelve tiny blood groves, the tip extremely sharp, twinkling faintly with cold light, without any wear from penetrating the tree trunk.</p><br/><p>Tang San flipped the side of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow, opening the arrow trough, pushing sixteen crossbow bolts back inside the box one by one.</p><br/><p>Oscar had by now already moved over, his face wearing a flattering smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, aren\u2019t we good brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at him and smiled slightly, how could he not understand Oscar\u2019s intention,</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, be at ease, I will give each person a Godly Zhuge Crossbow. Just like with Ning Rongrong, you cover the material costs, I will be responsible for making them. However, Making this thing is very troublesome, in one month I can only make one. You mustn\u2019t feel anxious. Furthermore, don\u2019t easily use it except as a last resort. Making the crossbow bolts is also not easy, and after shooting it\u2019s very difficult to recover them. I\u2019m after all only one person, I definitely can\u2019t provide more than for all of you to use personally. To say nothing of this Godly Zhuge Crossbow\u2019s own extreme potency, its killing power is too great, and it\u2019s very easy to cause fatal wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, this won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji suddenly spoke up.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked blank a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy, teacher Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji\u2019s face revealed a cunning smile, looking at the other students he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThese fellows are not persons without money. Making this Godly Zhuge Crossbow of yours isn\u2019t easy, it can\u2019t be cheap to them. In any case some people don\u2019t care about money, so you estimate a proper price to sell it to them for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree with teacher Zhao. Little San, if you had to sell this Godly Zhuge Crossbow of yours, how much money would it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head with a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is one of us, there\u2019s no need to mention money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of us is true. But they also can\u2019t let you suffer losses. If one small box is capable of shooting such enormously powerful crossbow bolts, clearly the craftsmanship is exceedingly complex. We cannot always let you tax yourself for nothing. Let alone, after we use this thing, we still need to replenish crossbow bolts. Don\u2019t tell me that every time we would have you make them for free? Don\u2019t be modest with us. This is proper, this first Godly Zhuge Crossbow counts as your gift to us. We only pay for the materials. If we later need more, you have to sell it to us, how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar laughed, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, like this, anyway every month we all have a not insignificant stipend. This thing can save our lives in a crucial moment. Being a bit expensive is of no concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded at this, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen fine. Since everyone is interested in this mechanism type hidden weapon, afterwards I will strive to help you all get your own equipment, after all, one more kind of weapon is also one more kind of guarantee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone were clearly very interested in the hidden weapon, of course, this also was greatly related to the effect Tang San produced when using the hidden weapon. After all, on the first day of arriving at Shrek Academy, relying on hidden weapons he put the compared to him more than forty spirit power ranks higher Zhao Wuji at a disadvantage. Let alone these students, even Zhao Wuji was somewhat affected.</p><br/><p>Finally they had left Star Dou Great Forest. Out of the forest\u2019s boundary, although they no longer had that fresh and clean air, everyone seemed to be unburdened from a layer of pressure, feeling much lighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will hurry on again, we can rest at the little town.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf everyone\u2019s condition is no problem to rush a bit, after reaching the small town, I would invite everyone for a drink. Teacher Zhao, this time you can\u2019t decline. If not for your assistance, perhaps we would all be unable to walk out alive from Star Dou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji smiled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bai, I know you\u2019re wealthy. Only, my capacity is vast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai laughed,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, did you not hear that sentence? My ability to use money to settle matters is no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Entering Star Dou Great Forest this time, the bounty truly wasn\u2019t small, not only did Oscar succeed in entering the Spirit Elder realm, Tang San and Xiao Wu also equally succeeded in fusing with their third spirit rings. Even more significant was strengthening the cooperation and relationship between everyone. The entire Shrek Academy altogether only had these seven students. Removing conflicts would be greatly beneficial to everyone\u2019s cultivation from here on.</p><br/><p>The party rested at the small town for as much as two days. Recovering spirit power and physical power naturally didn\u2019t require this much time, but after continuously living in a stretched tight condition the mind needed to relax.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai was extremely grand, paying for everyone\u2019s expenses over the two days, everyone also didn\u2019t cultivate, each day drinking together and playing noisily, indescribably pleased. Even the always ice cold Zhu Zhuqing\u2019s expression softened a lot. Only, she didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t agree to let Dai Mubai again pull on her hand.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai also didn\u2019t push her, after all, she was just a twelve year old little girl. He wasn\u2019t anxious.</p><br/><p>After two days, everyone once again set off, following the one day\u2019s journey they smoothly returned to Suotuo City\u2019s Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally back. Coming home feels truly wonderful, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar somewhat exaggeratedly shouted out loudly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji glared at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your voice down, haven\u2019t you seen the sky is dark? Well, you each return to your dormitories to rest. I will go see the dean and report what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>After one day of fast travelling everyone were tired, each walked towards their dorms.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, wait a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was just about to leave with Oscar for their dorm, when Ning Rongrong called out.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked blank a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong bit her lip, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to chat with you alone, can we?\u201d</p><br/><p>At Tang San\u2019s side, Oscar\u2019s expression stiffened at once,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou chat. I\u2019ll return first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since that day he pushed down Ning Rongrong when the Titan Giant Ape attacked, Oscar\u2019s originally already dead affection had begun to live again, after all, Ning Rongrong\u2019s appearance was beautiful, although only twelve years old, she was still growing into a rare beauty. These past few days as he had paid great attention to her, Ning Rongrong also had not again rejected him, on the contrary getting much closer.</p><br/><p>But now Ning Rongrong suddenly said she had to chat with Tang San alone, Oscar in his heart couldn\u2019t help but be a bit sour, but also couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu looked somewhat curiously at Ning Rongrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what do you need little San for? I can\u2019t hear it either?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong hesitated a moment, but still gave a nod.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu pouted, pulling a face towards Ning Rongrong, and with that ran off towards the dorm.</p><br/><p>Dai Mubai, Ma Hongjun and Zhu Zhuqing had just now already returned to the dorms, currently, at the Academy entrance remained only Tang San and Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, in the end what is the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang San, I want to make a deal with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat astonished looked at her. In his heart thinking, \u2018don\u2019t tell me this Ning Rongrong has returned to her old ways again?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong earnestly nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I know you can\u2019t be short on money, but I still very much want to make this deal with you. Only, in this matter I can\u2019t make it on my own. I wanted to first ask whether you were willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>Tang San, through observations, discovered Ning Rongrong apparently wasn\u2019t going back to her old ways. Her expression was very serious, and even slightly excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it, what is the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that I come from the Seven Treasures Glazed Tile School. Although we are one of the seven big clans of the current age and have a high status, our school\u2019s core students are all support type Spirit Masters. When we meet enemies, we are always the priority target. I think your mechanism type hidden weapons will help us greatly. At least it will let our members have a bit of self defense ability. So, if possible, I hope that, through the school, I can buy a batch of mechanism type hidden weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that\u2019s why. Tang San understood Ning Rongrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I heard Seven Treasures Glazed Tile School had many subsidiary clans and members just for protecting the core students. You even have two powerful Title Douluo. Is it still not enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong said: \u201cThat, after all, is still external help, not belonging to us. Also, no one can promise there won\u2019t be traitors! In the past in our school, that happened once. One of my uncles were abducted by a protector of the school. Afterwards, even though the school set many laws against similar incidents, we\u2019re still passive in any situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, sorry. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to let you down. If it was only a few, there wouldn\u2019t be any problem. I should be able to make enough hidden weapons. But for your entire school, there are at least over a hundred core students. I really can\u2019t make that many hidden weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong anxiously said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quality doesn\u2019t have to be very good. As long as we can defend ourselves. If the quality is worse, can it save some time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked sternly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, don\u2019t ever say that again. I either don\u2019t do it, or do it to the best of my abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stuck her tongue out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no other way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San thought for a bit, and suddenly remembered Tang Sect\u2019s old way of operating. If he imitated it, could he\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a way, but I need to think about it carefully before I can give you an answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong smiled slightly and said :</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Tang San, how about this. Give the first hidden weapon you make to me. I also need to bring it to my dad for a look. Only my father can decide whether they should equip the core students with your hidden weapons. If it really is ok, you have to ask for a high price, don\u2019t be polite. Heehee, I need to go back to sleep. I possibly have to explain to your Xiao Wu as well. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t make her feel jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Done talking, with a string of laughter Ning Rongrong ran towards the dormitory.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Rongrong\u2019s departing figure, Tang San showed a relaxed smile. Money was a good thing, he naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse it. For him, if he wanted to make more powerful hidden weapons, he needed the support of money. Tang San decided to think about it carefully when he got back. He wanted to see if he could bring the Tang Sect\u2019s way of business here. After all, making massive amounts of hidden weapons wasn\u2019t something he could accomplish alone.</p><br/><p>Back at the dormitory, Little Ao wasn\u2019t resting. He only laid on his bed, looking at the ceiling. Seeing Tang San enter, he quickly sat up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, what did Rongrong need you for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his nervous expression, Tang San couldn\u2019t help but laugh on the inside and tease him,</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. We only exchanged affections.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExchanging affection?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar\u2019s voice became slightly strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, is Xiao Wu really your sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu is my adopted sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you already have Xiao Wu, shouldn\u2019t you not fight over Rongrong with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at Oscar, amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you give up already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar felt a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you feel after we went to Star Dou Great Forest, she changed a little? She seems not as annoying as before. Also, she\u2019s still young, I believe her attitude will definitely get better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San also laid down on his bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you have to try hard. Don\u2019t worry, she talked to me only for business about my hidden weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was amazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then that\u2019s great. Little San, you really are my good brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San rolled his eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a break, go rest. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes, Shrek Academy\u2019s friends flashed through Tang San\u2019s head one by one. All of these people can be said to be monstrous prodigies. Even their minds were more mature than people their age. Just the thought of Ma Hongjun, at the age of twelve, loitering around brothels, and Dai Mubai with those twins, was unfathomable to Tang San. Was this the early maturing in legends?</p><br/><p>After a day of travelling, fatigue was unavoidable. Finally getting back, Tang San decided to allow himself to relax for a day. He didn\u2019t start cultivation, but went straight into dreams. A mind that was always tense would actually bring disadvantage when cultivating. Needed rest would benefit the effects of daily cultivations. This was the way of striking balance between work and rest that Grandmaster passed on to Tang San.</p><br/><p>In the dean\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Flender, full with astonishment, finished listening to Zhao Wuji\u2019s description of the journey this time. His expression changed multiple times, and after finally hearing everyone returned safely, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we were still too careless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender sighed and felt a wave of lingering fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time they go hunt for spirit beasts, I will lead the team with you, with two other teachers. These kids are all favored by fate, if they have any accidents, that\u2019s equal to ruining geniuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji sat in a seat on the side. He was even more afraid that any accidents would happen. He laughed bitterly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be blamed on you. Who would know that Star Dou Great Forest would become this weird, with this many things happening in the outer edges. They even met the Unrivalled Dragon Serpent couple. The thing I understand the least is the appearance of the Titan Giant Ape. However you look at it, with his ranking within spirit beasts, he wouldn\u2019t lightly come to the outer edges. Good thing Xiao Wu\u2019s fortune is good, or else this time we really would have big losses. Frankly, even if we did what you said and sent four teachers to protect these kids, if we met the Titan Giant Ape we still would have been destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Star Dou Great Forest is the nearest spirit beast habitat. Other than that we have no other choice. But from your explanation, the Titan Giant Ape seemed unhostile and didn\u2019t kill everyone. Or else, even if you used your Spirit Avatar you wouldn\u2019t have been able to block it. Xiao Wu surviving is even more surprising. What is the cow roar she talked about? Don\u2019t tell me that in the Star Dou Great Forest, there is some spirit beast that can raise a response from the Titan Giant Ape?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cow roar was probably from the Skyblue Bull Python[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>A stiff and slightly strange voice came from outside the door. Zhao Wuji was startled. He had already heard the sound of approaching footsteps, but he didn\u2019t really care about it. He only thought it was a teacher of the Academy. Now that he heard the voice, he felt something was wrong. No one in the Academy sounded like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, a familiar person came. Xiao Gang[2], quickly come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened and a middle aged man walked in from outside. A stiff face, a perfectly straight back, a first impression of lifeless eyes, but in fact deep in the dark pupils expressing some anxiety. If Tang San were here, he would have recognized the person on first sight, because he was Tang San\u2019s Teacher, in the Spirit Master realm famous as Grandmaster</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Wuji, you don\u2019t recognize him right? I will introduce you to him. This is my old partner in those days, also Tang San\u2019s teacher. You can call him Grandmaster. Almost the entire Spirit Master world calls him that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji suddenly remembered something and looked at Grandmaster, surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are Grandmaster. Greetings, I am Zhao Wuji.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s tone was always that flat, his stiff face barely squeezing out a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotionless Bright King, you don\u2019t have to be polite. You came back, Tang San should have came back with you. Is he safe and sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>He only heard Zhao Wuji talk about Xiao Wu being let go by the Titan Giant Ape and didn\u2019t hear any previous conversations.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji chuckled and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Our luck is pretty good, everyone came back safe and sound. This time it really was thanks to Tang San. Grandmaster, you indeed brought up a good apprentice. When did you arrive at the Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender helped Grandmaster answer Zhao Wuji\u2019s question,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe arrived the day before yesterday. If not for Tang San, he might have never come. Xiao Gang, sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Grandmaster heard Zhao Wuji say Tang San was safe, his expression clearly eased. Without being polite, he pulled over a chair and sat down. Zhao Wuji then learned that Grandmaster\u2019s real name was Xiao Gang, hearing this was a little unexpected, but it was also a name brimming with masculinity. He had also heard quite a few rumors about Grandmaster. Although Grandmaster himself looked skinny and lacked strength, his character was famously strong. Once, he abandoned his family for some matters. That was when he met Flender and another person, later creating the famous Golden Iron Triangle[3].</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji was very interested in what Grandmaster said as he entered, and hastened to question closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, just now you mentioned some spirit beast? One unexpectedly able to make the Titan Giant Ape pay attention?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Grandmaster\u2019s face was revealed a focused serious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Xiao Wu heard a cow\u2019s roar, then, the Titan Giant Ape giving up and leaving her is a very reasonable explanation. Within Star Dou Great Forest, there is not only this one Titan Giant Ape forest king. There is still a compared to him even more formidable existence. That existence is Star Dou Great Forest\u2019s greatest power. If speaking of the Titan Giant Ape as king, then, he is the emperor. This kind of spirit beast is the Sky Blue Bull Python.</p><br/><p>Whether it was Zhao Wuji or Flender, both revealed expressions of listening earnestly, also in their hearts secretly sighing in admiration, in terms of knowledge, perhaps no one would be able to compare to this Grandmaster before them. Zhao Wuji also finally understood why he would be known as Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs everyone knows, for a spirit beast\u2019s strength, apart from its cultivation age, innate talent is also extremely important. Just like us Spirit Master: apart from cultivation level and spirit rings, the spirit\u2019s innate strength also determines future development potential. But among spirit beasts, if dividing spirit beasts according to level, then, the Sky Blue Bull Python and the Titan Giant Ape should both be considered the most super formidable. They possess incomparable innate talent and tyrannical physique. These two existences within Star Dou Great Forest have already surpasses at least fifty thousand years cultivation. Although they still haven\u2019t reached the hundred thousand spirit beast level, their oppressive strength is already sufficient to compare with the Title Douluo among us spirit masters. When their cultivation age reaches a hundred thousand years, then, perhaps they will become existences transcending Title Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, I have previously heard of this Titan Giant Ape many times, but this is still my first time hearing the name Sky Blue Bull Python. Unexpectedly it\u2019s even more powerful than the Titan Giant Ape, then what is it capable of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like no one knows the Titan Giant Ape\u2019s full ability, even less people know what the Sky Blue Bull Python is truly capable of. A Title Douluo once penetrated deeply into Star Dou Great Forest. He was confident in his strength, wanting to have a look at what kind of place the core of this Star Dou Great Forest was like. His strength was indeed formidable, finally entering the deepest part of the forest. Reaching that core, he was astonished to discover, that place unexpectedly no longer was a forest, but a not very large lake. The lake water was clear, surrounded by forest, like a fairyland.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lake? Zhao Wuji looked astonished at Grandmaster, Flender had a somewhat pondering expression.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster continued:</p><br/><p>\u201cJust next to that little lake, the Title Douluo saw a spirit beast drinking water. But this spirit beast was actually the Titan Giant Ape you encountered this time, that Title Douluo seeing the Titan Giant Ape was greatly excited, he had always heard it was a kind of formidable spirit beast existence, and immediately intended to start a fight with the Titan Giant Ape. But, in the end he couldn\u2019t compete with the Titan Giant Ape, because he in less than a moment already lost his head out of fear and escaped that place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Because of the Sky Blue Bull Python?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji had opened his eyes wide.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely because of the Sky Blue Bull Python. As that Title Douluo prepared to fight, suddenly, the little lake before him boiled, and immediately afterward, he saw an incomparably enormous bull head[4] stretch from below the surface, incomparably immense pressure making that Title Douluo unable to help being shocked. The bull headed python bodied spirit beast slowly separated from the surface, revealing its hundred metre long huge body. At that time it was evening. This whole blue-green spirit beast hissed at the sky. In the sky the moon\u2019s radiance seemed to be swallowed by it. But what truly scared that Title Douluo was that this Sky Blue Bull Python unexpectedly spoke human words, saying to that Title Douluo, \u2018human, your cultivation becomes difficult, leave this place.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji and Flender looked at each other, Flender couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow have I never heard of this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster coldly glanced at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still very many matters you don\u2019t know about. Do you know how the Titan Giant Ape behaved when the Sky Blue Bull Python appeared? Before the Sky Blue Bull Python it would display a fearful expression. But that Sky Blue Bull Python at that time, from its mouth issued an ear splitting bull roar. Consequently, from what Xiao Wu said I can determine that Titan Giant Ape certainly heard the Sky Blue Bull Serpent\u2019s call, putting down everything in its hands, hurrying to meet it. The reason why the Sky Blue Bull Serpent is not as well known as the Titan Giant Ape, is because it very rarely leaves the pool at the core of Star Dou Great Forest. But this matter was related to the spirit master world by that Title Douluo. Still its existence is known only by a small number of people, and I am precisely one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this. It appears that Xiao Wu\u2019s luck truly is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, I carefully read these current students\u2019 records, this time you left for Star Dou Great Forest in order for that food system Spirit Master child to look for his third spirit ring, I do not know what spirit beast\u2019s spirit ring he obtained in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji chuckled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time our luck wasn\u2019t bad, it could also be considered robbing the fat from other peoples\u2019 mouths, Oscar that kid obtained a thousand year Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent\u2019s spirit ring, possessing a pretty good third spirit ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA thousand year Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The muscles in Grandmaster\u2019s rigid face changed at once,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis truly is very good. Originally I had anticipated several kinds of spirit rings suited to this food system child, but I never expected this child would obtain a spirit beast result so good. The Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent\u2019s disposition is relatively gentle, but extremely cunning, most expert in fleeing, its cultivation is not easy. If my conjecture is correct, Oscar\u2019s third spirit ability is certainly related to speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji with a sigh of admiration said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWorthy of being called Grandmaster, you are correct, this third spirit ring of Oscar\u2019s is related to speed. His third spirit ability is a kind of mushroom sausage, after eating it one can maintain flight for one minute, flying at the same speed as the Phoenix Tail Crest Serpent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster seemed shocked, clearly he had not anticipated the spirit ability Oscar obtained would be like this. He resolutely said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child\u2019s food system spirit talent is unprecedented, the most outstanding of all the food system spirit masters I have met. His future prospects cannot be measured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender smiled darkly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Shrek Academy of mine has always accepted only monsters. Did you just find out now? Unfortunately, this is the last class. These seven children are the Academy\u2019s last disciples, I certainly must foster them into people worthy of respect. This time with your help. We brothers working with a common purpose, in less than ten years, we will certainly let the word Shrek shake the Spirit Master world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster unhappily glared at Flender,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not for little San, I wouldn\u2019t remain here. Flender, don\u2019t forget what you promised me. In the future when little San hunts spirit beasts you must personally accompany him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is easy. Only, we still must wait for him to reach fortieth rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was an astute person, his seemingly expressionless eyes released a flash of light, staring fixedly at Zhao Wuji, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, don\u2019t tell me little San also already reached thirtieth rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI also just thought to ask Grandmaster whether the change on little San\u2019s body was ordinary\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At once, he repeated what he previously told Flender, telling Grandmaster in even more detail about the events of this time entering Star Dou Great Forest.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster listened very attentively, without overlooking a single word of what Zhao Wuji said. In his eyes all along expressed a pondering light.</p><br/><p>Although Grandmaster\u2019s disposition was calm, as Zhao Wuji spoke of Tang San several times being in danger of death his expression couldn\u2019t help but transform, especially hearing Zhao Wuji say Tang San absorbed that two thousand year cultivation Man Faced Demon Spider his expression changed greatly. No one understood more clearly than him how grave the consequences were of absorbing a spirit ring surpassing one\u2019s limit, that was practically certain death.</p><br/><p>Once Zhao Wuji had finished everything he had to say, Grandmaster slowly released a long breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San this child\u2019s willpower is stronger than I had imagined. I didn\u2019t expect that he would be able to endure like this. This child\u2019s prospects are perhaps even more outstanding than I had estimated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why Tang San was able to persevere is perhaps related to Xiao Wu. A person\u2019s willpower will sometimes be affected by external circumstances. I can reach the conclusion that Xiao Wu in Tang San\u2019s mind has an extremely important position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s very possible this is the reason. However, this is still greatly related to his own willpower. Tang San this child\u2019s will is precocious, already far exceeding his peers\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuji said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, what is after all going on with the eight spider legs that appeared on Tang San\u2019s back? Those don\u2019t seem at all a result of the spirit ring. He has a Tool Spirit, how could he himself transform? If it wouldn\u2019t be spirit ring variation, perhaps it\u2019s spirit variation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now I still don\u2019t dare be certain of what his condition is. Spirit ring variation is impossible, spirit beasts\u2019 spirit rings are invariably fixed. Although bringing different results when combined with different spirits, the spirit rings themselves will not have too great changes. Tang San already obtained a spirit ability, the spider legs appearing on his back should not be bestowed by the spirit ring. As for spirit variation, it\u2019s not impossible. But I do not believe this is the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cSky Blue/Green Cow/Bull/Ox Python\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] () \u201cLittle Firm\u201d</p><br/><p>[3] ()</p><br/><p>[4] Possibly related, Ox Head () is one of the two guardians of the underworld in Chinese mythology, along with Horse Face ()</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I don\u2019t have a mother, I can\u2019t also be without a father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao looked at his son, unable to keep from being somewhat blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t promise me, my body for yours, then I\u2019ll accompany you in death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The points of the Eight Spider Lances already stuck to Tang San\u2019s skin. Even if Tang Hao was even more powerful, it would still be impossible to stop his suicide.</p><br/><p>Seeing the resolve in his son\u2019s eyes, Tang Hao knew that Tang San wasn\u2019t playing a joke on him. From childhood he had never shown any intent of disobedience, but right now, his son seemed to have already completely left his control.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s appearance had become handsome, even more like his mother. Tang Hao\u2019s eyes turned somewhat misty, it seemed as if the one standing in front of him wasn\u2019t his son, but his wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, if mom was still alive, she wouldn\u2019t want you to disregard your health. For me, and for mom, promise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drawing a deep breath, Tang Hao faced the sky and sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I\u2019ve really grown old. Really unable to do anything. Fine. Once you\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019ll go accompany your mother by her tomb. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he walked forward without turning his head.</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s compromise was a weight off Tang San\u2019s mind. His face revealing a genuine smile, he followed his father with quick steps.</p><br/><p>In the direction Tang Hao brought Tang San, they first reached the side of a small river.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at your present appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly, present appearance? He lowered his head to look his body over, but there was nothing clearly distinct. Only his muscles didn\u2019t seem as protruding as before, but the proportions of his body were even better.</p><br/><p>Walking to the side of the river, when Tang San saw his reflection in the water, he couldn\u2019t help staring blankly.</p><br/><p>His skin was somewhat fairer than before, dark blue eyes bright and filled with expression, a head of beautiful deep blue long hair, a handsome face with a somewhat steadfast imposing manner. It was as if his face was peeled with a knife, releasing the spirit stored within.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis. Is this me?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Tang San was described as ordinary before, then, right now, he would absolutely be on the same level as Dai Mubai and Oscar. Even though the style wasn\u2019t the same, right now he wouldn\u2019t pass without attention like before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eyes are bigger, more like your mom. Having inherited her blood, you would naturally also inherit some of the genes she always hid within you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Touching his smooth face,</p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression became a bit softer. Laughing wryly in his heart, he didn\u2019t know if Xiao Wu and the others would still recognize him now.</p><br/><p>Carefully watching the reflection in the river, what had changed wasn\u2019t only his appearance. The current him had even changed in temperament, seemingly a bit more refined and serene than before, just like an elegant beautiful youth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, who was mom really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San really couldn\u2019t help but voice the doubts in his heart, asking his father. Who was his mother after all? Why would his mother possess the Blue Silver Emperor Spirit?</p><br/><p>Tang Hao shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d tell you after you completed all my special training. Let\u2019s go. We must go to where you should go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once on the road again, Tang Hao\u2019s words returned to being as sparse as before. Tang San judged by the sun in the sky that he hand his father were always heading north. As for where they were going, he had no idea. Only the atmosphere gradually grew colder.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao still followed the trails between the mountains. To them, the cold of the outside world didn\u2019t count as anything.</p><br/><p>After eating the wind and sleeping outside for half a month.</p><br/><p>Ahead was a small town. This was the first time Tang San had seen a town since starting Tang Hao\u2019s special training. Inwardly he couldn\u2019t help be suffused with a different kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>This little town wasn\u2019t large, but just as they entered, Tang San felt an odd atmosphere in their surroundings. He couldn\u2019t say why, but he always thought the people around them had a kind of unusual coldness.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao brought Tang San to a tavern in the small town and entered.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the tavern was extremely turbid. Tang San noted that the decorations here were unexpectedly all black. Even though it was daytime outside, inside this place was a gloomy and cold dark feeling.</p><br/><p>Right now the tavern was about thirty percent full or so. Even though the atmosphere was turbid, people rarely spoke, giving an extremely quiet impression.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao and Tang San\u2019s arrival attracted a lot of gazes, but for the most part they were only quick glances flitting across them.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao found a place to sit with his son in the corner. A waiter in black clothes and apathetic expression walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me two Bloody Mary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter\u2019s face changed slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Swept with Tang Hao\u2019s ice cold gaze, he didn\u2019t dare say anything else, turned his head and left.</p><br/><p>After a moment, two cups of muddy liquid were carried over. The liquid seemed dark red, distributing a strong stink, as if the nose was assaulted by blood.</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned, but Tang Hao raised a cup and emptied it in one gulp. Raising his head to look at his son,</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hesitated a moment, slowly raising the cup,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao shot him a glance, repeating:</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San drew a deep breath, suddenly closing his eyes, pouring the liquid in the cup into his stomach in one mouthful.</p><br/><p>The liquid was somewhat salty, and moreover a bit acrid. A strong taste of blood suddenly pervaded Tang San\u2019s sense of taste and smell.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao looked at him, calmly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a cup of human blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s face instantly turned pale. The next moment, he couldn\u2019t help leaning his head over to the side, throwing up.</p><br/><p>The violent vomiting broke the calm within the tavern, and also attracted the eyes of all the people there. Roaring laughter rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did this chick come from? Fuck off back home. This isn\u2019t a place you should be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t even enjoy a cup of Bloody Mary, and still wants to gain the qualifications to enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, go back home and suck your mommy\u2019s tits.\u201d</p><br/><p>All kinds of vile voices filled the tavern. The restrained emotions of those customers seemed to have found an outlet, and struck Tang San without restraint.</p><br/><p>Emptying everything in his stomach still couldn\u2019t completely get rid of the taste of blood, and Tang San almost spit out even his gall.</p><br/><p>As Tang San raised his head to look at his father, Tang Hao raised his hand, pointing at those jeering people,</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The jeering voices screeched to a stop, each person looking at Tang Hao with suddenly monstrous gazes.</p><br/><p>Tang San hadn\u2019t thought that his father would give him this requirement either, and inwardly he was immediately somewhat hesitant.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao spoke in a low voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to take my place to finish my business? Then, do as I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drawing a deep breath, constraining the nauseous feeling, Tang San slowly stood.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u2019s voice came from behind him,</p><br/><p>\u201cKindness to the enemy, is cruelty to yourself. None of the people capable of leaving this place have walked a road without death. Including you, including me. Kill them, leave none alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tang San could move, a big man nearby had already stood suddenly,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>A horn handled dagger thrust out in a tricky angle, straight at Tang San\u2019s heart. This person was clearly very experienced, and he aimed the dagger just where it could pierce the cracks between Tang San\u2019s ribs.</p><br/><p>Slaughter intent, was this his father cultivating his slaughter intent? Tang San moved. He had never been a charitable person; kindness to the enemy, was cruelty to oneself.</p><br/><p>His left hand stretching out like lightning, catching the dagger with a keng sound. The dagger wielding big man only felt as if his dagger was stuck in solid rock, unable to advance, unable to withdraw.</p><br/><p>Tang San took a step with his right foot, his gaze already cold, his mouth still flooded with that taste of blood, an ice cold chill emanated from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Peng\u2014\u2014 Tang San\u2019s shoulder struck the big man\u2019s chest, and a layer of white light abruptly emanated from Tang San\u2019s body. That wasn\u2019t in order to attack, but to shield him from the blood spraying from the big man\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>That tall and sturdy man was directly sent flying from the strike, his entire chest caving in, the sounds of bones snapping spreading throughout every corner of the tavern, making people\u2019s teeth ache.</p><br/><p>Tang San had moved, his movement concise and forceful.</p><br/><p>Sparkling and translucent Blue Silver Grass flew out in all directions, frantically spreading.</p><br/><p>By now he already clearly saw that there were twenty three people in the tavern besides him, his father, and the waiter. He had killed one, twenty two still remained.</p><br/><p>Among those twenty two people, five swiftly released their spirits, the remaining seventeen without the slightest hesitation pulling out their weapons. Unexpectedly, none ran away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a test, a test for us from Slaughter City[1]. Kill him, and we\u2019ll be able to enter Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody knew who shouted, but everyone\u2019s eyes turned red, charging at Tang San as if crazy.</p><br/><p>Twenty two people, only five were Spirit Masters, and the strongest one had no more than four spirit rings.</p><br/><p>A blue aura fluctuated and rose, and along with that instantly spreading Blue Silver Grass, five spirit rings quietly rose from below Tang San.</p><br/><p>Yellow, yellow, purple, black, black. Five terrifying spirit rings quietly appeared.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>The light of the fourth spirit ring abruptly flared. The next instant, the entire tavern was already filled with a layer of sparkling and translucent blue.</p><br/><p>Strand after strand of bulky Blue Silver Grass protruded from underground, solid awl-shapes piercing one body after another.</p><br/><p>Blue Silver Emperor\u2019s fourth variant spirit ability, Blue Silver Thrust, launched.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed to stop. Even that Spirit Ancestor couldn\u2019t escape the fate of being skewered. Not a single body could obstruct that Blue Silver Grass that was as sharp as the Eight Spider Lances after evolving. One after another, the lifeless corpses were pushed up. They were completely skewered, the breath of life swiftly passing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t insult my mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue at the corner of Tang San\u2019s eyes abruptly grew stronger. As he turned around, once again sitting across from his father, his spirit rings and the Blue Silver Grass disappeared simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Putong, putong, putong\u2026\u2026 Corpse after corpse fell to the ground, blood dying the floor of the tavern red. But right now Tang San\u2019s expression was very calm, calm enough to astonish Tang Hao.</p><br/><p>Nodding, Tang Hao calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I still underestimated you. Remember, entering Slaughter City, you can only rely on yourself. I won\u2019t be by your side, much less protecting you. There are no friends or companions there, only enemies. Kill everyone that can threaten you. Obtain the championship in the Hell Slaughter Arena, I will naturally receive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter in the tavern didn\u2019t lose his head because of a couple dozen people getting killed. He was as calm as Tang San, apparently long since used to the sight.</p><br/><p>He naturally also heard Tang Hao talking to Tang San, only his face grew even more disdainful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to enter Slaughter City by killing a few people? He still isn\u2019t qualified.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter coldly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t even take a cup of Bloody Mary, how could he enter? Eh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng\u2014\u2014 Spear sharp Blue Silver Grass shot out of his chest. Tang San didn\u2019t turn around to look, only calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I qualified now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter clearly couldn\u2019t answer. He had never expected Tang San to actually act against him too, and his eyes gradually grew larger. The Blue Silver Grass swayed gently, and the corpse was flung aside. Blood pooled, mixing with that of the previous corpses.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou adapt very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao looked at Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at his father,</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I have to. Because you said that each person here, including you and me, all walk the road of death. I believe you. Slaughter City, yes? This is the place where I must train. Dad. I will succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t say was that, in order to protect his family, lover and companions, in order to realize his own hope of survival, he wouldn\u2019t shrink back.</p><br/><p>Tang San was an astute person on his own, and after obtaining the wisdom skull, his brain had become even sharper. When throwing up, he had already understood that he could only choose to slaughter in this world of slaughter his father had brought him to. Otherwise he would be killed. That time of vomiting was the only weakness he would allow himself. He wouldn\u2019t be weak a second time.</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Tang San stood and walked over to the tavern counter with large strides, not caring about the two additional stunned waiters behind it. Raising his hand, one palm heavily swatted the counter.</p><br/><p>With a loud explosion, the counter turned into splinters flying in all directions, revealing the ground.</p><br/><p>The two waiters looked on stupidly. Tang San\u2019s blue light had already vanished by now, and in his left hand, that black little hammer had appeared at some point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe entrance to Slaughter City, should be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Twisting, calves generating force, the pitch black little hammer turned into a black streak of light, heavily striking the floor.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s spiritual force had long since probed a difference here. There was an empty space beneath this counter. It was definitely impossible for this little town to be Slaughter City. An entrance was the most rational explanation. He wouldn\u2019t go look for some mechanism. In a different place, he\u2019d need to use a different method.</p><br/><p>With a loud explosion, an enormous hole was revealed in the ground. A gloomy and cold wind brushed out of the cave. Tang San turned his head to look to where his father sat before, but discovered that Tang Hao had already disappeared. Without hesitation, he leapt down, directly into the pitch dark ground. His body was instantly swallowed up by the darkness, without a trace.</p><br/><p>Entering the darkness, Tang San only fell several meters before he had his feet firmly planted on the ground. He didn\u2019t need any light, his Purple Demon Eye could clearly see everything in the darkness.</p><br/><p>This was a large tunnel, sloping downwards. A gloomy and cold air constantly caressed Tang San, but he still advanced with large strides.</p><br/><p>When Tang San had walked one thousand four hundred sixty two steps, an ice cold voice suddenly came from all around,</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to Slaughter City. This is the capital of Hell, a world brimming with slaughter. Here, you can obtain everything you want, at the price of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>He released his spiritual force, but Tang San immediately sensed that the material of this passage was extremely unusual, his spiritual force unexpectedly unable to penetrate it. Face changing slightly, Tang San\u2019s expression became a bit frozen, but his pace didn\u2019t slow. In the darkness, his Blue Silver Grass stretched out to explore first, with him behind.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao said that killing intent was equal to bravery in some sense. But bravery didn\u2019t med impetuousness. Tang San seemed to advance boldly, but he never lacked caution.</p><br/><p>Turning a corner, a vague light came from up ahead. Tang San squinted, operating Purple Demon Eye, and the illumination in front immediately grew before his eyes. That was an open door. On the other side of the door, were signs of life.</p><br/><p>Advancing with big strides, Tang San vaguely heard noise. As he walked out of the passage, in front of him appeared one hundred and one men.</p><br/><p>Completely covered in black armor, even their faces hidden behind helmets. One hundred of them carried heavy swords, and only one sat on a tall war horse, his horse also covered with thick black armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve broken the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deep voice sounded extremely cold, as if not from a human mouth. The speaker was the mounted black armored knight.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t look at him, but rather shifted his gaze behind him. What he saw was a black city. The solid black walls were extremely thick, that was unexpectedly truly a city. And in the air above the city, a purple moon was unexpectedly suspended. The moon hung very low, seemingly only five hundred meters distance from the ground. Looking further up, everything was black, as if a night sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should be done if I broke the rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>The black armored knight\u2019s voice was still cold, without a trace of human aura,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you must accept the penalty. Defeat me, and you will possess the right to enter Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked calmly.</p><br/><p>The black armored knight slowly raised the lance in his hand, and the black armored warriors on either side of Tang San slowly withdrew, leaving a spacious arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am dread knight Scott.\u201d</p><br/><p>The war horse abruptly accelerated, the black armored knight charging at Tang San with a bitter aura.</p><br/><p>An ice cold aura filled the air, a cold murderous spirit pouncing ahead. Compared to Tang Hao\u2019s tremendous killing intent, even though the killing intent this black knight emitted was a lot smaller, it still had a sharpness.</p><br/><p>Internal strength congregating, Tang San suddenly discovered that his spirit rings unexpectedly didn\u2019t appear along with his Blue Silver Grass. As if all spirit abilities had already lost their effect at this moment.</p><br/><p>Without a trace of panic, Tang San shifted and withdrew Blue Silver Grass. In his left hand only a Clear Sky Hammer appeared. At this moment, he finally understood why his father once had him cultivate with his spirit power sealed. This Slaughter City unexpectedly had special rules. Here, all spirit abilities were ineffective. Even Spirit Master could only use the most basic strength. The spirit\u2019s most basic form.</p><br/><p>The spirit abilities were gone, but there was still spirit power, as well as Mysterious Heaven Skill. Twisting, the Clear Sky Hammer in Tang San\u2019s hand exploded out. Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method, first swing. What he met, was the impulse of that war horse mounted heavy armored dread knight.</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The warhorse cried out, the immense impulse screeching to a halt. A more than four meter long heavy knight\u2019s lance split the air, flying far into the distance.</p><br/><p>Dread knight Scott was no longer on his horse. Just like his lance, he was already sent flying. And that warhorse, stopped by Tang San\u2019s right hand, the immense impulse halted, and under the enormous forces, the warhorse flipped sideways, twitching violently. Its neck had already snapped in two by the forceful collision.</p><br/><p>The burst strength the five hundred jin heavy Clear Sky Hammer could generate with one swing from Tang San, was something only Tang Hao understood best.</p><br/><p>With two years of forging under the waterfall, Tang San\u2019s body had long since become a weapon. Even though the impulse was tremendous, it was still basically unable to influence him.</p><br/><p>Dread knight scott slowly crawled from the ground. The armor on the right hand that previously held his lance had already ruptured and flown off, the same even went for the armor on his entire right arm. Equally ruptured was still the muscles and bones of his arm.</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned. According to his initial estimate of the opponent, this one swing should have been able to take his life. But this dread knight\u2019s strength was even a bit more than he had expected, leaving his life behind.</p><br/><p>Advancing step by step, Tang San raised his head to look at that purple moon, thinking to himself: \u2018Slaughter City where spirit abilities can\u2019t be used. I\u2019m here.\u2019</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>\u201cHa-, halt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scott shouted, trying to show a strong front.</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at him coldly. Right now, Scott\u2019s helmet had already fallen off, revealing the face of a vicious middle aged man. He saw the expression in Tang San\u2019s eyes, and was already alarmed. Clearly, he hadn\u2019t imagined how this kid\u2019s strength would be so terrifying. Wasn\u2019t he a Spirit Master?</p><br/><p>\u201cObstruct me again, and I don\u2019t care if I have to kill every one of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not obstructing you. You\u2019ve already passed my test. You have the qualifications to enter Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dread knight spoke with some difficulty. What he least understood was, when ordinary Spirit Masters came here they would panic when they couldn\u2019t use spirit abilities, but this youth in front of him didn\u2019t seem to reveal a trace of influence from it.</p><br/><p>He handed over a black tile in front of Tang San, and Tang San off-handedly took it. On the tile was carved a human skull, and below was a number. 9528.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your Slaughter City ID. Please enter the city, someone will receive you at the gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding the tile, Tang San advanced with large strides, without giving the dread knight a glance.</p><br/><p>Gazing at Tang San\u2019s gradually distancing back, Scott drew the saber at his waist. Swinging it fiercely he cut off his own already completely ruined right arm. Scarlet blood soaked the black soil, the stench of blood filling the air.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The pitch black city gates gave people a kind of extremely oppressive feeling. Tall words were hung on the enormous city gates, Slaughter City.</p><br/><p>Two black armored warriors stood silently in front of the gates. Before Tang San could reveal the token in his hand, a woman with a black muslin mask stepped out to greet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s voice was very pleasant. Stepping aside from in front of Tang San, she made an inviting gesture.</p><br/><p>Even though this underground city made Tang San extremely astonished, especially the restrictions on spirit abilities, he maintained a calmly accepting attitude, following that woman through the gates. Perhaps it was because of the identification badge in his hand, but nobody stopped him.</p><br/><p>Entering the city, what Tang San saw was a blue purple world. Lanterns were hung on both sides of the street, all of them issuing only these two colors of light. Making him somewhat astonished was that there were no few people here, and nobody paid attention to an outsider like him. Besides everything appearing that dim, what he saw was unexpectedly no different from an ordinary city.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your guide. You can ask me about anything you don\u2019t understand. Within twenty four hours, I will answer all your questions. After twenty four hours, this is the place where you\u2019ll live, and you\u2019ll formally become a Slaughter City citizen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cSlaughter city, what kind of place is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman said:</p><br/><p>\u201cA paradise. A paradise of depravity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned,</p><br/><p>\u201cSo simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman nodded agreement.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how was Slaughter City founded?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman\u2019s answer this time was more to Tang San\u2019s satisfaction,</p><br/><p>\u201cSlaughter City has already existed for a thousand years. According to legend, it\u2019s the domain left behind after a formidable Spirit Master broke through the hundredth rank. Here, all Spirit Master abilities are ineffective, people can only rely on their own instinct and physical strength to survive. Spirit power can be used as a source of strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San looked at the black masked young woman,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are the rules here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman said serenely:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rules here are that there are no rules. As a citizen of Slaughter City, you can do whatever you want here. Even if a Title Douluo came here from the outside world, he would still grow weak due to losing his spirit abilities. But under the rule of our Slaughter King, there\u2019s basically no need to fear them. In Slaughter City, as long as you have the ability, you can do whatever you want. But I must warn you, precisely since there are no rules here, you may face mortal danger at any time. In some sense, this is a paradise of crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cParadise of crime?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. There are a lot of people who come here precisely because they can\u2019t exist in the outside world, and have no choice but to enter. After coming here, there\u2019s no need for them to worry about pursuit again. Each citizen of Slaughter City will enjoy Slaughter City\u2019s protection.</p><br/><p>Tang San hardly paid attention to this protection. Since he could come here through force of violence, that meant any power could do the same. Even without spirit abilities, there was still spirit power. Title Douluo were still powers among powers here. Were the criminals here really safe?</p><br/><p>\u201cMister 9528. I understand what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Tang San stared blankly a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely wondering how Slaughter City can protect its people, yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman said:</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause every new arrival to Slaughter City will think the same thing. But very soon, they will give up on this idea. Entering Slaughter City requires undergoing the test and slaughter examination. Even though you entered via a peculiar method, you carry sufficient killing intent. Moreover, you defeated the lord dread knight. Therefore you obtained permission to join. However, there\u2019s one thing I must warn you of. Entering Slaughter City is simple, but leaving is practically impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan only enter, never leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San somewhat shocked looked at the black masked young woman. He didn\u2019t believe he would be unable to break out.</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are special law enforcement teams within Slaughter City. You met lord dread knight Scott, but he\u2019s only one member of the enforcement team. The mighty Slaughter King controls everything here, and the powers of the enforcement team are all Spirit Douluo who the Slaughter King have granted the ability to use spirit abilities. The captain is even a Title Douluo. Once a lot of people wanted to break out, but there are no exceptions to the end result.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was shocked. If saying Title Douluo that couldn\u2019t use spirit abilities were still formidable, then Title Douluo that couldn\u2019t use spirit abilities would definitely be unable to defeat Spirit Douluo that could. Furthermore, according to what the black masked young woman said, the captain of Slaughter City\u2019s law enforcement was actually a Title Douluo that could use spirit abilities. No wonder she would say it was impossible to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no way out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cNot quite. There\u2019s only one way to leave Slaughter City. That is to become the champion of Hell Slaughter Arena, obtaining the qualifications to challenge the Hell Road, and after breaking through the Hell Road, then you can leave Slaughter City. Every power who does so will be bestowed with the title of Deathgod[2]. In Slaughter City\u2019s thousand year history, there has appeared altogether eight Deathgods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eight in a thousand years, what kind of unbalanced figure was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if one fails the challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San questioned closely.</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cSlaughter City, has no defeat. Only success and death. This is so for all matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems this place really is worthy of being Slaughter City.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no currency within Slaughter City, any food and drink are provided free of charge. Of course, poisonous ones are not excluded. Here, dead people are the most valuable. The number of human skulls each person possess symbolizes their strength. The blood and skulls of the opponents you\u2019ve personally beheaded can be used to trade for other goods.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed in Tang San\u2019s eyes. It seemed that it was as his father said, anyone here had come by the road of death.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, bring me to Hell Slaughter Arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said indifferently.</p><br/><p>The black masked young woman stared blankly a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? Entering there, less than one in ten can return alive. That\u2019s the place where it\u2019s the easiest for our Slaughter City population to decrease. Each person will be required to enter Hell Slaughter Arena once each year. As long as they can pass one fight, they can life in Slaughter City for another year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, let\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Purple Demon Eye, Tang San could vaguely see the elegant eyebrows of the young woman\u2019s face wrinkle slightly behind the black muslin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, the black masked young woman walked towards the center of the city. The pace she kept was very measured, following at Tang San\u2019s side all along, just half a step ahead of Tang San.</p><br/><p>Tang San wasn\u2019t urgent about anything either, only calmly observing everything around him.</p><br/><p>As they walked, a figure suddenly stood up on the side of the road. He had previously been in a dark corner, and even Tang San hadn\u2019t noticed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a rookie, it seems there\u2019ll be a new Bloody mary. Gaga.\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze sweeping this person, Tang San couldn\u2019t help frowning. The speaker\u2019s age couldn\u2019t be discerned, because his stature was really too extraordinary. His entire body didn\u2019t seem to have two liang[3] of flesh put together. If he didn\u2019t have a layer of skin, it might\u2019ve been easy to mistake him for a human skeleton. Moreover, simple observation told Tang San that this wasn\u2019t because he had cultivated any special methods. His qi and blood were both empty, he could die at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan people like him also pass the Hell Slaughter Arena battles once a year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San asked the black masked young woman.</p><br/><p>That skeleton then saw the black masked young woman on Tang San\u2019s other side, and seemed as if he had encountered something terrifying, no longer daring to say anything, and swiftly vanishing into the darkness again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. Not everyone needs to pass the baptism of the Hell Slaughter Arena. After all, the mortality rate here is too high. Besides experiencing a fight in the Hell Slaughter Arena every year, there\u2019s still one other way survive in Slaughter City. That is to contribute two cups of Bloody Mary every month.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cSlaughter Capital City\u201d, or \u201cMassacre Metropolis\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] () \u201cKilling God\u201d or \u201cMurder God\u201d to be specific, but Deathgod reads better.</p><br/><p>[3] 2 = 100g</p><br/>\n</div>"}

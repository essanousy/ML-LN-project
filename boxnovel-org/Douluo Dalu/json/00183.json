I\u2019ll regret it if you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a chance to make a world for you two alone? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been suffering now.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he smiling winked at Oscar.</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, and Ning Rongrong\u2019s charming face turned red, pinching Oscar hard,</p><br/><p>\u201cLaugh, you laugh. Humph humph, if not for you, I would\u2019ve gone to play with third brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar was still smiling, and still smiling very proudly, he didn\u2019t seem in pain from Ning Rongrong\u2019s forceful pinching.</p><br/><p>From the side, Ma Hongjun suddenly cried out,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, little Ao, Rongrong is breaking your arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong was alarmed, hastily looking at Oscar\u2019s arm, but instead of signs of breaking, it was just a bit red.</p><br/><p>Looking at her nervous expression, Tang San, Ma Hongjun and Oscar couldn\u2019t help laughing. For a moment, the atmosphere in the wooden house turned extremely relaxed.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong hit Oscar\u2019s shoulder hard, embarrassed lowering her head. Oscar caught her hand and held it close, his smile recovering some of its previous vulgarity.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Rongrong, if you really do ask senor Bone Douluo to watch over the Academy, then we really will go out on a trip again. And this time, we can\u2019t do without you, the Tang Sect\u2019s god of wealth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ning Rongrong\u2019s eyes immediately brightened, looking at Tang San with flickering light in her big eyes,</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, where are you going to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar raised his hand to knock the top of her head,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, all you know is playing, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t need to cultivate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf third brother said it, then it\u2019s definitely proper business. We\u2019ll go by carriage, we can cultivate there! Besides, Grandmaster said that always worrying about cultivating will instead be harmful to spirit power progress. Suitable relaxation is also necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is proper business. Our Tang Sect\u2019s hidden weapon manufacturing requires large quantities of metal. The Strength Clan doesn\u2019t lack common metals, but we have to go out to buy uncommon ones. I heard elder Tai Tan say that the capital of metal, Gengxin City, has all kinds of metal for sale, a lot of uncommon metals too. Elder Niu Gao is enough to start constructing the plans for the Tang Sects, so we and elder Niu Gao will make a trip to Gengxin City and have a look at whether we can dredge up some treasures. At least we\u2019ll buy back some common metals for forging hidden weapons. We have to manufacture a batch of finished goods in the next year. Once the Seven Great Sects re-election assembly starts, perhaps that will have some effect. If we let Spirit Hall successfully hold this assembly, the two great empires will become too passive. We have to help the two great empires attract as many spirit masters as possible at the assembly.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Tang San\u2019s mention of Spirit Hall, Ning Rongrong\u2019s expression immediately turned hateful,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, we\u2019ll manufacture them some trouble this time. Ruin their assembly.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she suddenly stood, and Tang San stunned said:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong giggled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally I\u2019m going back for reinforcements! We\u2019ll go out when grandpa Gu comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unexpectedly impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar also stood, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accompany her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San originally planned to allocate some of the money from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School to construct the Tang Sect, but let it be on second thought. Anyway, he himself had put aside some fairly impressive savings over these years, enough to build the Tang Sect. The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s money would be spent on buying metal, that was where it was needed the most.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because she hadn\u2019t gone out for too long, but Ning Rongrong\u2019s efficiency was extreme. When she returned from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School that evening, she actually directly brought Bone Douluo back with her. Ning Fengzhi didn\u2019t come personally, only let Ning Rongrong tell Tang San that everything on the Imperial Family side was under control. Only emperor Xue Ye\u2019s poison still hadn\u2019t been dissolved, but Poison Douluo was expending all his efforts to detoxify it.</p><br/><p>At the same time, learning Tang San would go to buy metals Ning Fengzhi also specially gave Ning Rongrong a sum of money. Adding the sum from before, the overall sum reached five hundred thousand gold spirit coins. It clearly showed that the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s reputation as the richest sect absolutely wasn\u2019t undeserved. In fact, a condition of Tang San and Ning Fengzhi\u2019s agreement was that the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School would have priority on the hidden weapons the Tang Sect produced. Moreover, a full eighty percent of the price would be deducted from this advance payment.</p><br/><p>However, they still couldn\u2019t set off immediately. Tang San and the others had just returned, travel worn and fatigued. They needed some rest and readjustment, and the plans on the Tang Sect\u2019s side still needed adjustment.</p><br/><p>One week later, after everything was properly arranged, everyone set off under Tai Tan\u2019s directions for the main headquarters of the continental smith association, Gengxin City.</p><br/><p>As they were about to leave the Tang Sect, Tai Tan couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. There were still those two special carriages, each handled by a Strength Clan clansman. Everyone split into the two carriages. Tang San, Xiao Wu and Tai Tan was in one. Ning Rongrong, Oscar and Ma Hongjun the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good to have old rhino here, leaving the whole mess for him to deal with, I can be all arm-flinging shopkeeper. Young master, did you see the old rhino\u2019s face when we left just now? Thinking of that indignant expression, I just want to laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, pulling Xiao Wu closer against his chest,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith senior Niu Gao in charge of building the Tang Sect, you can be at ease! If it was anyone else, maybe you\u2019d hate to leave it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan nodded earnestly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so. Old rhino isn\u2019t just my brother, in the construction field, perhaps you couldn\u2019t find anyone stronger than him in the entire continent. This time we\u2019re buying large quantities of the surrounding properties, the Tang Sect is expanding to more than twice the size of our Strength Clan mansion. With old rhino here, once we get back, it might be close to finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be impossible to build slowly. With the strength of the Strength Clan people, as well as the craftsmanship of the Defense Clan, how couldn\u2019t it be fast? On the subject, actually seeing senior Niu Gao\u2019s artistry in construction, he is indeed worthy of being called a construction grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of the construction plans he had seen in these few days, Tang San couldn\u2019t keep his heart from twitching. How was that building a mansion? Clearly it was a fortress! Of course, the expenses were corresponding. After Tang San made clear he would support it financially, Niu Gao\u2019s plans had undergone a series of changes. The required building materials had also undergone large changes. When Tang San imagined it now, he rather felt terrified. Simply put, even the doors of each room were wood paneled iron plates. As for the mansion courtyard walls, they were going to be fifteen meters high. That height was enough to rival the imperial palace.</p><br/><p>Tang San of course wasn\u2019t concerned the government would make trouble. The day before yesterday he had specially gone to the Moon Pavilion to see his aunt Tang Yuehua. For some official matters, directly having his aunt\u2019s help in clearing obstacles naturally wouldn\u2019t be problematic. That he didn\u2019t directly let Ning Fengzhi help was because he didn\u2019t want information about the Tang Sect to leak from the imperial family side.</p><br/><p>From the moment he convinced the four single attribute clans, the Tang Sect had already stepped onto the road of forming. Before the seven great sects re-election assembly that Spirit Hall organized started, was the most important time for the Tang Sect\u2019s development.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu leaned on Tang San\u2019s shoulder, quietly waiting. Her eyes were still empty. Since meeting Ning Rongrong, Tang San could finally heave a sigh of relief. When Xiao Wu and Ning Rongrong were together, she wouldn\u2019t particularly stick to him. But making him not know whether to laugh or cry was that, at night, this would immediately change. No matter what was said, the soulless Xiao Wu didn\u2019t want to sleep with Ning Rongrong. Under Oscar and Ma Hongjun\u2019s disdainful gazes on several occasions, Tang San still had to achingly and happily sleep together with her. However, this also advanced Tang San\u2019s cultivation. Being together with a lover who preferred being naked every day, how would he dare sleep? He just cultivated every night as Xiao Wu slept. And his thighs had also become Xiao Wu\u2019s preferred pillow.</p><br/><p>Gengxin City was within the borders of Star Luo Empire, by coincidence in an entirely different direction than Rising Dragon City. Rising Dragon City was southeast from Heaven Dou Empire, and Gengxin City was within the borders of Star Luo City to the southwest, close to the interior region of Star Luo Empire. This journey wasn\u2019t short, travelling at top speed the whole way, they had used close to a month when they arrived at Gengxin City.</p><br/><p>Gengxin City was one of Star Luo Empire\u2019s main cities, but it absolutely didn\u2019t count as any famous place. The area belonging to the city only included a lower river. The Douluo Continent was a spirit master world. As a city of metal, it was normal that it wasn\u2019t valued. The status of smiths was the same as ordinary people. The smith association might have some influence in this city, but Spirit Hall was a spirit master organization and could influence the situation in the whole continent. This showed how huge the difference was between smiths and spirit masters.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan told Tang San that the greater the smith, the larger the chance it was a spirit master. Because spirit masters\u2019 strength far surpassed that of ordinary people and could forge more elaborately. Of course this wasn\u2019t absolute. There were still some smithing geniuses that could still have enormous accomplishments in the smith world without the aid of spirits.</p><br/><p>Distantly, Gengxin City was already in view, and everyone left the carriages. As far as could be seen, they could see those tall city walls. Gengxin City\u2019s walls seemed entirely iron gray, as if forged from metal. Even though they still hadn\u2019t entered the city, they could vaguely feel some of the metallic atmosphere of Gengxin City.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong somewhat excitedly pulled Xiao Wu\u2019s hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally here, sitting in the carriage the whole way has made my bones go soft.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how comfortable the Strength Clan\u2019s carriages, sitting in one for a month might still be boring. However, this journey couldn\u2019t be said to be completely without rewards. Ma Hongjun had really begun to work hard, perhaps it was because of what Tang San said to him, but on the road he had put his effort into cultivating and his spirit power had risen from fifty seventh rank to fifty eighth. The distance to the critical point of rank sixty was one step closer.</p><br/><p>Flender once told Ma Hongjun that when his spirit power reached the seventieth rank, and he could use Spirit Avatar, he would ender a whole new realm. Only at that time could his Phoenix spirit reveal its true power. And Ma Hongjun was now also advancing in this direction. After all, besides Xiao Wu, he was the only one of the Shrek Seven Devils who still hadn\u2019t broken through the sixtieth rank.</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned, saying to Ning Rongrong:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I give you a massage tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong\u2019s face turned red, sticking out her tongue at him,</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah right, who knows whether you have good intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun to the side said with schadenfreude:</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sausage Uncle\u2019s heart, is known by all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar snorted, deliberately raising his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, you\u2019re so jealous. Barefaced envy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun curled his lips,</p><br/><p>\u201cJealous your face, I also have a girlfriend. Once we get back I\u2019ll let you see how beautiful my girlfriend is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar somewhat shocked said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a girlfriend? Which family\u2019s miss would be so blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun grew angry,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, fight me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar grinned,</p><br/><p>\u201cCome! I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t do it. Big brother has a lot of mirror image sausages. I might not be unable to defeat you. Don\u2019t forget that I still have Rongrong\u2019s Seven Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda. Don\u2019t tell me us husband and wife can\u2019t defeat you alone? Little San is definitely neutral.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s husband and wife with you? Did I marry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong snapped.</p><br/><p>Oscar, immensely pleased with himself, said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of due course. My father in law doesn\u2019t oppose it. Can you still escape the palm of my hand? Beauty, you\u2019re regretting it too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ao, your strength in flirting seems to have returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at them laughing and joking, Tang San felt a burst of warmth in his heart, as if they had returned to those carefree and worriless days of cultivation of five or six years ago. Only, Xiao Wu next to him was\u2026...</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone would go along with this Fatty. Little San, you\u2019re always together with him, is he lying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Tang San opened his mouth, Ma Hongjun was already rushing to say:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat lying. Once we return this time I\u2019ll let you see my girlfriend. She\u2019s called Bai Chenxiang, this name is pleasant. You\u2019ll die of envy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar showed a prideful appearance, his nostrils turning to the sky,</p><br/><p>\u201cEnvy your farts. Bro has Rongrong, don\u2019t tell me I\u2019d still look at another woman? Besides my Rongrong, other women are just smoke to my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Ning Rongrong had no retorts, snickering looking at Oscar and Ma Hongjun bickering, anyone could see the satisfaction in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan sighed:</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing together with youngsters like you, I feel like I\u2019ve grown a lot younger myself. Youth truly is good! When I was your age, I was even more frivolous than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong giggled:</p><br/><p>\u201cOur grand elder feels he\u2019s old? You\u2019re not the slightest bit old! A mature man like you, is even more charming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan laughed despite himself:</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, you really can talk. If I were fifty years younger, maybe I\u2019d fight little Ao. It\u2019s no wonder someone like Bone Douluo would pamper you so desperately. You really are a little fairy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the might of beauty, defeating both young and old. Little Ao, what are you looking at me for, not satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar snorted,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat use is not being satisfied. Anyway, my looks are ruined now, nobody would want me besides you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words \u201cruined looks\u201d, Ning Rongrong\u2019s expression immediately turned gentle,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t deliberately provoking you. Little Ao, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled slightly, his eyes revealing some melancholy. Sighing, he held Ning Rongrong\u2019s shoulders, softly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t. In all my life I will only love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he spoke, he was exchanging proud glances with Ma Hongjun and Tang San to the side. This wasn\u2019t the first time he had used this move. But it was one hundred percent effective. The scar on his face that had once made him feel inferior was now a killing weapon that could touch the softest place in Ning Rongrong\u2019s heart. Of course, Oscar\u2019s tenderness wasn\u2019t just a show. He most liked Ning Rongrong\u2019s appearance like a little bird relying on people.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun swiftly ran over to Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo good, third brother, I can\u2019t stand it. These two are always so nauseatingly corny. I\u2019ll go lie down in the carriage first. Call me when we\u2019ve entered the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone smoothly entered Gengxin City. The metallic atmosphere that hit their faces just inside the gate immediately gave them a kind of different sensation. After entering the city, everyone got off the carriages once again, full of interest and excitement looking around at the unique style of this city.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan clearly grew excited, pointing to the surrounding buildings and giving everyone introductions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGengxin City is the place with the most smith shops, only in this town will smiths be valued. It\u2019s said that there are more than a thousand such shops in Gengxin City. smiths are even more numerous. A lot of smiths from other cities come here to take smith exams. If they can pass the high level smith exams, they can stay in the city. One might say that this is the paradise of smiths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if smiths aren\u2019t valued in the two great empires, the army\u2019s weapons and equipment, farm tools, buildings, furniture, all require the participation of smiths. The higher level the smith, the more expensive his work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun astonished asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Tai Tan, what, smiths are also split into levels?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as detailed as you spirit masters. Generally speaking, smiths are split into seven grades. From lowest to highest, they\u2019re: junior smith, intermediary smith, advanced smith, master smith, grandmaster smith, smith scholar, and divine craftsman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun asked closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what level of smith are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar to the side interjected:</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot. No point asking. Elder Tai Tan is the vice president of the smith association, of course he\u2019s a divine craftsman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan laughed out loud, a tacit agreement.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, how many divine craftsman level smiths are there on the Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s expression changed slightly, sighing:</p><br/><p>\u201cThree. Me, your father, as well as the smith association president.</p><br/><p>Hearing Tai Tan mention his father, Tang San couldn\u2019t keep his heart from contracting. Thinking of his father\u2019s ruined limbs, he felt a burst of heartache. But right now he really had far too many things to do. If he wanted to go see his father, he couldn\u2019t set out immediately. Tang San secretly decided that, once Spirit Hall\u2019s seven sects re-election assembly ended, he would definitely return to the Ice Fire Yin Yang Well to see his parents. He didn\u2019t know to where his mother had evolved there.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan patted Tang San\u2019s shoulder,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think too much about it. Master has a good son like you to inherit his legacy, he can live in seclusion at ease. Young master. Bring me to see him when there\u2019s a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded softly.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, everyone suddenly heard a loud and clear voice hawking from further ahead,</p><br/><p>\u201cWalking past or walking by, don\u2019t miss it, the current blacksmith association president, divine craftsman king Lou Gao\u2019s[1] second generation disciple\u2019s personally crafted Glorious Bright Silver Armor, only one set. Preferential price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLou Gao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said a bit doubtfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Lou\u2019s second generation disciple has to hawk his wares at the side of the street? Oh, Lou Gao is the president of the smith\u2019s association, calling him the divine craftsman king isn\u2019t wrong. Your father has retired, and in forging we struggle for victory. I\u2019m better at refining metal, he\u2019s better at elaborate work. Speaking of, this time I was planning on getting a few of his disciples. Among those hidden weapons of yours, some of the especially elaborate work will be even more fluent for his branch of smiths to make. Let\u2019s go, we\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>By now the source of the hawking was already surrounded by a lot of people. Tang San and the others squeezed their way through, then saw the circumstances within.</p><br/><p>That was a seemingly very ordinary smith\u2019s shop, just now hawking. A bare chested bronze skinned muscular middle aged big man, seemingly in his fourth decade, sat there in front of the door, his eyes calmly closed, with the appearance of an able person. Just next to him was arranged a suit of armor.</p><br/><p>The suit of armor was entirely bright silver colored, shining and dazzling in the sunlight, with gorgeous craftsmanship. It could be seen that each chunk had undergone special polishing. It even had a huge transparent crystal inlaid on the heart guarding mirror[2], reflecting the sunlight to set off the armor itself.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan only gave that armor a glance, his brows wrinkling, then said one disdainful word,</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Let alone Tai Tan, even Tang San who was far from him in terms of forging could see that this suit of armor was all flower and no fruit. Even though it seemed very pretty, with Tang San\u2019s eyesight, his Purple Demon Eye having already reached the Detailed level, he could clearly make out the material and methods this armor had been created with.</p><br/><p>Those sheet after sheet of silver armor leaves were actually made by polishing steel, but each armor leaf was very thin, clearly without any defensive power. But the weight was correspondingly not very high, perhaps that was the only advantage of this suit of armor. If you wore this armor, its only effect might be for decoration. As for using it on the battlefield, don\u2019t even think about it. The weakest infantryman could break it with one chop.</p><br/><p>Even though Tai Tan was in his eighth decade, as the Strength Clan\u2019s chief, he absolutely had lung power. Even though he only proclaimed it as trash in his normal voice, the people all around still heard it. That middle aged robust man hawking it was naturally no exception.</p><br/><p>Just exerting himself to call out, his gaze immediately fell on Tai Tan,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld fellow, what did you call trash?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Tai Tan\u2019s status, he coldly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI said that armor is trash. The smith who forged it is too.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, his voice was a bit higher. That middle aged man sitting upright in the blacksmith shop door had already opened his eyes, looking at Tai Tan with a condescending gaze.</p><br/><p>That hawking middle aged robust man had already stepped over in front of Tai Tan with large strides,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld fellow. Don\u2019t you understand forging? By your appearance you\u2019re a stranger to this town, don\u2019t talk drivel when you don\u2019t understand. My teacher is the current smith\u2019s association president senior Lou Gao\u2019s direct disciple. You dare say the armor my teacher forged is trash? That\u2019s an insult to our divine craftsman branch. If you don\u2019t make your words clear today, don\u2019t think about leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan snorted disdainfully,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to say it clearly. Fine, then I\u2019ll let you hear it properly. Let alone this teacher of yours, even if Lou Gao was here, claiming this armor was created by him, I\u2019d equally proclaim it as trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, the surroundings were immediately in an uproar. There was no lack of smiths among the crowd watching the scene, and also some with extraordinary strength. They of course saw that this armor was all flower but no fruit, but the hawker\u2019s sentence about Lou Gao\u2019s second generation disciple still dominated everyone present. Lou Gao\u2019s status here in Gengxin City was equivalent to Bibi Dong in Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>Nobody had any objections to Tai Tan criticising this armor, but when he talked about directly criticising divine craftsman Lou Gao, the surrounding smiths couldn\u2019t ignore it. The noise instantly grew louder, and even included some curses.</p><br/><p>Tang San frowned, just pulling Xiao Wu in front of him. Both his hands encircled her waist, letting her comfortably lean against his chest. Incorporeal spirit power naturally released, isolating her from the surrounding crowd. He wouldn\u2019t let anyone touch Xiao Wu.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan took two steps forward. Even though he hadn\u2019t released the pressure of his spirit power and the Spirit Douluo level, his tall stature and the dignity formed over many years as clan chief still made that hawking middle aged big man retreat a few steps.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan walked over to that armor and turned around, looking at the surrounding crowd,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t accept it? Fine, then I\u2019ll let you hear it. This armor is made with the interlocking chains method. If you look carefully, the size of each armor plate is slightly different. On the surface it might seem very bright and neat, but in fact, the quality itself is very meager. Bright Silver Armor? This is made from silver plated polished steel, not much stronger than wet paper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing him say this, that calm and easy going middle aged man couldn\u2019t take it sitting. Shooting to his feet, he angrily said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis suit of armor is originally for decorative use. Not for the battlefield. Making each armor leaf so thin shows skill. Like this the weight is low, wearing it won\u2019t be tiring. Ornamental, do you understand the word ornamental?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan said coldly:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you say about the different armor plate sizes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged man strongly argued:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called asymmetrical harmony. It\u2019s taught by my grand master divine craftsman Lou Gao. What do you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan laughed out loud,</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, such an asymmetrical harmony. If that old fellow Lou Gao was here, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d make him so angry he\u2019d spit blood, whether his current reputation has already been just about ruined by someone like you. Glorious Bright Silver Armor, Lou Gao really did create such an armor. Only, this imitation of yours is still too shoddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he raised his hand and pulled that suit of armor from its stand, turning it over to the back. That middle aged man didn\u2019t have time to stop him.</p><br/><p>If the surface of the armor was as shiny as a mirror, then the back was crude as hemp. Tai Tan casually shook his hand, and there were already armor plates falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>With a cold snort, Tai Tan casually threw that suit of armor in front of the dumbstruck middle aged man,</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling you trash is a bit generous. Teach you to behave, Lou Gao\u2019s Glorious Silver Armor leaves used pure silver undergoing refinement, made from silver essence. Even though each plate was also very thin, the defensive power was quite powerful. Even though it was ornamental, it was still practical to use. Don\u2019t drag his name around to swindle people in the future. Otherwise, there\u2019s no need for you to stay in Gengxin City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That middle aged man purported to be Lou Gao\u2019s second generation disciple\u2019s face had already turned blue, and the din from the surrounding spectating civilians and smiths was a lot lower.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged man pulled out an ox ear knife from behind his back with a trembling hand, throwing himself straight at Tai Tan.</p><br/><p>With Tai Tan\u2019s strength, having him fight at close quarters would be a joke. Without turning his head, his right foot stomped hard on the ground. Immediately followed by a deep rumble. Intense shockwaves immediately threw that middle aged man to the ground. The surrounding crowd felt a burst of shaking under their feet, but they weren\u2019t struck.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s causing trouble here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the watching crowd suddenly parted, a group of soldiers in non-standard Star Luo Empire equipment striding inside.</p><br/><p>Common infantry at most had only leather armor, but these Gengxin City soldiers could count as a pavilion by water, unexpectedly outfitted with light metal armor. Altogether more than ten people, led by a man around thirty years old or so. His armor was clearly a bit thicker, and his hand supported the hilt of a long sword at his waist as he strode in.</p><br/><p>When that middle aged man who had been shocked into confusion by Tai Tan\u2019s stomp saw these soldiers, his mind immediately roused, rolling and crawling over in front of that leader,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother in law, it\u2019s him, I was just selling my latest work, and this old fellow came to cause trouble. He\u2019s obviously an outsider. Not only did he criticise my newly crafted armor, he even insulted divine craftsman Lou Gao. Quick, arrest him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan gave a cold laugh,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder you would dare exploit Lou Gao\u2019s name, you actually have a bit of backing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s face chilled, sharply swinging his hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cTake him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the soldiers could move, a loud shout suddenly resounded from the crowd. The crowd parted, and a sixty year old elder quickly stepped inside. The old man seemed very strong and healthy, his pace vigorous and full of strength. But he had an alarmed expression.</p><br/><p>Seeing this old man, that captain\u2019s expression immediately changed, softly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster smith Ren Yuan[3]. Please don\u2019t block us from carrying out justice. Otherwise, even with your status as master smith, you still won\u2019t be pardoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>That master smith called Ren Yuan didn\u2019t seem to have heard him, rushing over to Tai Tan, staring wide eyed and carefully watching Tai Tan\u2019s flat face,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan\u2019s brows wrinkled,</p><br/><p>\u201cI seem to have met you. At that time you should have been an apprentice under Lou Gao. Now it seems you\u2019re a master smith. Pretty good, pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Ren Yuan immediately shivered, kneeling on the ground with a putong sound,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really you, lord Tai Tan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Yuan\u2019s action, that captain\u2019s face immediately stiffened, and the surrounding civilians and smiths were in an uproar. In fact, as a master smith, Ren Yuan was famous in this neighbourhood. But right now he was kneeling on the ground in front of this old man.</p><br/><p>Tai Tan pulled him back up,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this, what does this look like.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain came closer, tentatively asking,</p><br/><p>\u201cMater smith Ren Yuan, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Yuan sharply turned around, his expression immediately turning cold,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are an idiot brat, you actually dare arrest lord Tai Tan, Even if your father, grandmaster Si Di[4] was here, even he would deferentially kowtow to lord Tai Tan. You kids go back and take your family\u2019s punishment. Let me tell you, lord Tai Tan is the vice president of our smith\u2019s association. Just like lord Lou Gao, he\u2019s one of the three divine craftsmen in the present world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ren Yuan\u2019s words immediately made the surrounding spectators explode. If it was any other town, perhaps it might be nothing. But don\u2019t forget that this was the capital of metal, the holy land of smiths. The meaning contained in the words \u201cdivine craftsman\u201d was paramount to the people of Gengxin City.</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s expression immediately turned deathly pale, subconsciously retreating a few steps, his feet softened and he immediately fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun came closer to Tang San, softly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that senior Tai Tan would actually have such a status here in the capital of metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar sighed even further:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid being low key might be damn difficult this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the excited appearances of the surrounding crowd, Tai Tan somewhat helplessly told Ren Yuan:</p><br/><p>\u201cHave everyone disperse, what does it look like always being surrounded here. Is this fellow really Lou Gao\u2019s disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking, he pointed to that middle aged man.</p><br/><p>Ren Yuan said disdainfully:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only a distant relative of grandmaster Si Di. Oh, grandmaster Si Di is lord Lou Gao\u2019s chief disciple. That\u2019s why this fellow cheats people by bragging with the name of a second generation disciple. We don\u2019t bother dealing with him out of consideration to grandmaster Si Di\u2019s position.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] Lou Gao - () \u201cStories Tall\u201d</p><br/><p>[2] Heart guarding mirror - a decorated plate on the middle of the chest and back on some Chinese armors. http://img4.131home.com/www/500/2012/01/31/20120131140637966.jpg </p><br/><p>[3] Ren Yuan - () \u201cAssigning Blame\u201d - by chance also the pen name of the author of Immortal Executioner.</p><br/><p>[4] Si Di - () \u201cThink Enlightened\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

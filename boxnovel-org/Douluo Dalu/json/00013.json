Before Tang San\u2019s eyes floated the dispirited figure of his father, could it actually be said his father originally was an outstanding blacksmith?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle San, I also don\u2019t know whether this is Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method, this is something father taught me.</p><br/><p>Shi San exhaled a long breath, then said with a big hearty smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks as if, this time we picked up a treasure. The employment conditions just now are void: for the time being you first will be paid the same as everyone, every month one silver spirit coin. If business is good, you take an additional percentage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like this, Tang San formally became a member of Shi San\u2019s smithy, beginning to live a full life.</p><br/><p>The academy\u2019s curriculum certainly was not a necessary place to him, Grandmaster\u2019s instruction was much more useful than the academy teachers in relating basic theory.</p><br/><p>He also carefully read that book Grandmaster gave him. Just like he expected, the spirit power cultivation methods Grandmaster put forward were very similar to the internal strength cultivation movement routes. Of course, this after all was only Grandmaster\u2019s theoretical designs, and compared to genuine internal strength cultivation methods was still a certain distance apart, not to speak of Tang sect\u2019s finely tempered Mysterious Heaven skill.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu smoothly obtained the spirit master title, and after becoming the academy\u2019s generally accepted Xiao Wu Jie, the working students\u2019 lives became relaxed and comfortable.</p><br/><p>Early morning every day, Tang San would take advantage of the new-born sunrise to cultivate his Purple Demon Eye, in the morning attend regular classes, in the afternoon labour in the smithy, in the evening again listen to Grandmaster\u2019s instruction. At night cultivate Mysterious Heaven skill. It could be said that every day to him was absolutely full.</p><br/><p>At Shi San\u2019s smithy, Tang San only needed a very short time to gain everyone\u2019s approval. Shi San gave him the assignment of refining metal, and in the remaining free time, Tang San used some discarded bits and pieces to refine on his own, starting his great hidden weapon production undertaking. Of course, he was only producing some components in the smithy, genuinely assembling after returning to the academy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu relying on her own tyrannical strength with Xiao Chen-Yu\u2019s assistance, very quickly became approved as the entire Nuoding primary spirit master academy\u2019s students boss, and compared to Tang San she passed the time very leisurely, sometimes even to the extent of not going to class. Tang San did not even see how she cultivated. But Xiao Wu\u2019s actual strength continuously elevated steadily.</p><br/><p>At Nuoding primary spirit master academy, one semester was one year\u2019s time, in the entire year students were not permitted to return home, but family members could come to visit. Tang San more than once expected his father to come, but until the end of the semester, still did not see a trace of Tang Hao. Fortunately his life was sufficiently full, and he did not have too much time to long for it.</p><br/><p>As for Spirit Hall, not long after Tang San underwent spirit master review, Spirit Hall\u2019s people came to Nuoding academy to look for Grandmaster, Grandmaster never told Tang San what they discussed, and Tang San also did not ask. But from Grandmaster\u2019s face compared to normal was much more smiling, and Tang San guessed the relationship between Spirit Hall and Grandmaster should have become a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, for tomorrow\u2019s holiday, will you return home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said to Xiao Wu while packing his luggage.</p><br/><p>One school year had passed, and he was finally able to return home and see his father. This afternoon at the smithy he had already asked Xhi San for a leave of absence. Also specially bought a brand new forging hammer, intending to bring back to give to his father.</p><br/><p>Since Tang San joined Shi San\u2019s smithy, making the quality of the various kinds of weapons and equipment produced in the smithy rise one grade, business became better, and right now Tang San\u2019s wages already reached five silver spirit coins every month, equivalent to half a spirit master\u2019s stipend.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu leaned on the bed, her eyes revealing some loneliness, entirely different from her usual liveliness,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home. Maybe, just stay at the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San was dumbfounded a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cAll year, you won\u2019t return to see your family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, your family isn\u2019t far from the academy is it? Otherwise, I\u2019ll follow you to return and play, how about that? Anyway Wang Sheng and Xiao Chen-Yu are both going to participate in the intermediate spirit master academy examination, there\u2019s nobody to accompany me to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled, after passing one year together, he could be considered as having some comparative understanding regarding Xiao Wu could. This little girl was lively and energetic, always appearing motivated by a desire to see the world in chaos; when acting gentle and soft, she somehow appeared like a lovely doll, but a moment later became a violent whirlwind. That Nuoding Xiao Wu Jie title of hers was exactly called in vain. In the entire academy, who knew how many students had already tasted bitterness from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family can be very poor, without anything good to entertain you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu with both hands akimbo, and big eyes glaring at Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery month you saved so much of your stipend, so reluctant to spend, but still fear entertaining me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San wearing a slight smile extended his right hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of stipends I suddenly recall, a certain person still appears to owe me six silver spirit coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was dumbfounded a moment, her fair and tender little face revealing some embarrassment. A stipend of one gold coin every month could definitely not be regarded as little, however, her spending was truly extravagant, if seeing something good coming back to buy it, not taking into account a bit whether or not it was useful. By now she long ago already had her own bedding, not having to share with Tang San. Never able to manage her finances, in a short time asking Tang San to lend spending money, already became habit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot exactly six silver coins? Wait for me to get the stipend to pay you. You still haven\u2019t said, if you after all are willing to let me come along with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said with a slight smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go then go. Only, my dad\u2019s temperament can be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu not in the least fazed said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone this lovely, your dad will happily approve of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, still assuming a gentle and soft appearance asking Tang San with blinking eyes.</p><br/><p>Other people might be fooled by her outward appearance, but Tang San had seen too many scenes of her true volcanic eruptions. He could not help but shake his head, still not a bit swallowing her cover.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need not use your honey trap on me. Fortunately you will appear seven years old, if a bit older, perhaps you truly would have a little fox spirit talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>\u201cFox spirit? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu full of curiosity asked.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiling said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of spirit beast turned into a demon, specializing in seducing men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was stunned a moment, her gaze at Tang San suddenly became somewhat strange, between eye blinks, her mood abruptly became agitated,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou drop dead, daring to call me a fox spirit, I\u2019ll definitely fight you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, she already baring fangs and brandishing claws leapt up from her bed, charging at Tang San.</p><br/><p>The other working students regarding this scene no longer wondered at the sight. The noise of fighting between Xiao Wu Jie and Tang San to their point of view, long ago became accustomed to; if some day those two were not fighting several times, on the contrary perhaps they instead would feel uneasy.</p><br/><p>Early the next day, as Tang San set out with that very bouncing and vivacious young girl at his side, wearing Nuoding academy\u2019s uniform, leaving Nuoding city, and heading towards Holy Spirit village.</p><br/><p>This past year, to Tang San\u2019s point of view, had been extremely rich, and also extremely satisfying. Breaking through Mysterious Heaven skill\u2019s first tier bottleneck, under assiduous cultivation, Mysterious Heaven skill had made rapid progress. On the basis of his own calculations, by now he should already be reaching the upper middle second tier\u2019s strength, on the basis of spirit power calculations, he should have about sixteenth rank approaching seventeenth rank.</p><br/><p>In the academy, people able to compare spirit power with him, only had a Xiao Wu: even though he never saw her cultivate, when the two compared spirit power the difference was never far. Sometimes Tang San had the upper hand, sometimes he was reversely surpassed by Xiao Wu. Although both were children, to the two who refused to give in, exchanging points like this was hard to avoid.</p><br/><p>Just when starting, Xiao Chen-Yu and Wang Sheng, these higher grade students occasionally joined in, but along with Tang San and Xiao Wu spirit powers\u2019 lightning fast rise, there were no people who again came to disturb them. One could ask: who would hope to become like a sandbag\u2019s existence?</p><br/><p>Therefore, although Xiao Wu was nominally the boss of Nuoding\u2019s students, in practice, when Xiao Chen-Yu\u2019s group addressed Tang San, he was also called little San Ge.</p><br/><p>When Tang San exchanged pointers with Xiao Wu, he always losing more than he won. Xiao Wu\u2019s fighting techniques emerged in an endless stream, especially her Soft Skill gave people a kind of New Year cake like feeling, if in circumstances where both sides did not draw support from spirit ring powers, Tang San was practically certain to lose. Even if using spirit rings, relying on blue silver grass binding and paralysing effects, the most he could accomplish when battling Xiao Wu was a draw.</p><br/><p>As for Tang San\u2019s secretly practiced hidden weapons these were certainly not used when exchanging pointers, first was because the hidden weapons\u2019 killing power was too great, too easy to injure a person, and second, he was still hoping to temper his own close combat strength through exchanging pointers with Xiao Wu. Perhaps it was because of the two mutually acting as sparring partners giving rise to an accelerating effect, but in respect to fighting, they advanced side by side. The academy\u2019s teachers were all already disinclined to be in charge of them, and in Nuoding, although Tang San and Xiao Wu were still only first years, they already became the academy\u2019s famous geniuses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it still far ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu looked east, then gazed west, offhandedly asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive soon. See that hilltop over there? Our Holy Spirit village is at the foot of the hill.\u201d</p><br/><p>About to arrive home, Tang San couldn\u2019t help his mood being somewhat excited, if not for the Nuoding academy regulations he would have returned to stay at home at night, without the teacher making the rounds every day, maybe Tang San long ago would have returned home to look in on his father. \u2018Not meeting for a year, dad, are you still well?\u2019</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because of being an orphan in his last life, this life, Tang San all the more especially treasured that family love.</p><br/><p>Touching Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges at his waist, there he had brought the iron hammer for his father, brand new clothes, and even some bottles of pretty good wine.</p><br/><p>The little mountain village where he lived for six years was already in view, not knowing why, in Tang San\u2019s heart a kind of indescribable feeling gradually appeared. If insisting on using words to describe it, then he would say, the feeling of having family was truly good. Even if that family only was him and his father.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the two already walked into Holy Spirit village. Tang San\u2019s home was at the edge of the village, raising his hand to indicate the roof with that dilapidated sign, Tang San smiled at Xiao Wu and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, that\u2019s my home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Home before his eyes, Tang San\u2019s mood subconsciously became excited, underfoot his steps increasing pace, three steps and two more and he reached the door of his home.</p><br/><p>The front door exactly alike as when he left certainly didn\u2019t matter, this was Tang Hao\u2019s habit all along. After all, this smithy did not have anything that could be stolen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San excitedly shouted.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu from never having Tang San this excited, stood at his back looking at him somewhat curiously. In her impression, Tang San was a very gentle friend, usually not saying much, but always with a busy feeling, always having some matter to attend. Only in their exchanging of pointers could his serious side be seen. And even if seriously losing to her, one still never saw his angry or even agitated appearance.</p><br/><p>While calling, Tang San walked inside with quick steps.</p><br/><p>Everything seemingly had not changed, the smithy was still in turmoil, even more so compared to before he left, a hideous mess of things left all over, a broken tattered and worn out feeling, bringing Tang San even more familiarity.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, little San, you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>A mild voice rose. From inside a person walked out.</p><br/><p>Seeing him, Tang San couldn\u2019t help but be stunned,</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Jack, you also, ah, then my dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walking out from inside was exactly Holy Spirit village elder old Jack, on his face a somewhat wry smile, he handed over a paper in his hand to Tang San, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a look, this is your father\u2019s message. Earlier I came to find him, originally thinking to have him and me go meet you, not thinking you would already have returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>A nervous feeling appeared in Tang San\u2019s heart, hurriedly taking the paper old Jack held out and lowering his head to read.</p><br/><p>On the paper were only a few simple lines, handwriting somewhat sloppy, but concealing a bold and unconstrained spirit.</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San:</p><br/><p>When this letter reaches you, I will have already left. Do not look for me, you will not be able to find me.</p><br/><p>Although you are still young, you have the strength to provide for yourself. A young falcon must first spread its wings on its own before soaring.</p><br/><p>You need not worry about me. In your nature is a great deal of your mother\u2019s delicacy. Dad is a useless person. You gradually grow up, dad has to go get back some things that originally should have belonged to me. Inevitably one day, we two father and son will again see each other.</p><br/><p>I hope you become formidable, but I also do not hope you become formidable. You choose your own path.</p><br/><p>If one day you feel the spirit master vocation is not good, then return to Holy Spirit village, and like me, work as a blacksmith.</p><br/><p>Do not miss me.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u201d</p><br/><p>Reading the letter in his hand, Tang San\u2019s entire person was already stunned, the joy filling his chest in an instant changing into helpless loss.</p><br/><p>Dad left, dad, why must you leave?</p><br/><p>Old Jack saw Tang San in low spirits, and with a wry smile said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Hao this fellow left without any warning. The day before yesterday I came to have him forge some farm tools. With him leaving like this, we must again find a blacksmith later. This fellow, truly too irresponsible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly returned from his absentmindedness,</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Jack, you\u2019re saying, dad would have left in only these two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jack nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould have left in these two days. Little San, don\u2019t feel sorry, this kind of a father is unworthy of it. Come with grandpa, we\u2019ll go to my home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San silently shook his head, with the greatest care folding the letter in his hands, placing it in his bosom.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Grandpa Jack, but my home is in this mess, I must decline and remain. I still have to put it in order at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Jack was stunned a moment, he had not thought the very small Tang San unexpectedly would send him off, with a sigh, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well. Only, if you need anything, do not hesitate to come find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With no choice but to shake his head, he turned towards the outside and left.</p><br/><p>As old Jack left, within the smithy remained only the two people Tang San and Xiao Wu. Tang San did not open his mouth, then began tidying up the messy room, clearing away the room\u2019s different things.</p><br/><p>Unusually, the ordinarily lively and energetic Xiao Wu right now kept silent, walking to Tang San\u2019s side, calmly helping him put various things away, and bringing scoops of fresh water from the water jar outside, helping him wipe the dirt within the room.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Nuoding primary spirit master academy.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster was in his room reading. Little San having returned home, his heart was empty. Knowing him for a year\u2019s time, even though he never said so aloud, but his attachment to this child constantly deepened.</p><br/><p>Until this morning when Tang San left, he still hesitated whether to go to his home to have a look. Finally Grandmaster still vetoed this notion of his. There were very many reasons, even to the extent that including himself was unable to explain clearly.</p><br/><p>Peng, peng, peng, at this time, a knocking sound suddenly rose.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s brows knitted, normally besides Tang San, there were basically no people that would come here.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster put down the book in his hand, speaking coolly.</p><br/><p>Opening the door, a large figure entered from outside. He wore a simple grey robe, messy black hair hanging loosely down to the shoulder, hoary face carved full of the vicissitudes of life, a pair of muddy eyes as if already like a candle guttering in the wind, his appearance didn\u2019t at all correspond to his fifty or so years of age.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>The visitor\u2019s voice was deep and hoarse.</p><br/><p>No knowing why, when this person entered the door, Grandmaster\u2019s entire body subconsciously tensed, even unconsciously spreading spirit power all over his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly standing up, Grandmaster\u2019s eyes revealed some uncertainty.</p><br/><p>The grey clad person coolly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of, we should not have met for twenty years, right. With this current appearance of mine, it\u2019s no wonder you do not recognize me. I\u2019m Tang Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s \u2018old well makes no waves\u2019 expression suddenly changed greatly, eyes focusing in practically an instant, rigidly staring at this person before him, both hands clutching the table, fingers already becoming pale,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-, you are Hao\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao waved his hand, stopping Grandmaster from speaking, coldly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cPast titles need not be brought up again. In those days, for however many reasons, other people would perhaps consider you as only a madman, but I know you are a persistent person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster gradually calmed down, rigid face somewhat affected at once,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems as if my conjecture was not mistaken, as expected you are Tang San\u2019s father. He already returned home, why would you be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao lowered his head, coolly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely because he returned home, I would be here. I know you accepted him as apprentice. As father, I should have come to see you long ago. I must leave, my only worry is just him, therefore, I hope to entrust little San to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must leave? Go where? He is your son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster glared rigidly at Tang Hao, the expression in his eyes somewhat fierce.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao still had a cold appearance,</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is still your disciple. I have to leave, there are very many matters that are necessary to attend to. Following me, he cannot obtain happiness. I have no other requests, his life, he must choose by himself. Ten years, I have already left this world for ten years, by now he has already grown up, so I have some business that I have to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster drew a long breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know what happened to you, but, I can see little San is very reluctant to part from you, you do not feel that this kind of departure is too cruel to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Hao coolly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe decided on his own to walk an extraordinary path; being together with me would be cruel to him. Well, I\u2019ve said what I had to say, no matter when, please remember, he is my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said this, Tang Hao waved his raised hand, a jet-black token tile dropped onto Grandmaster\u2019s desk with a clanking sound, the token tile was impressively similar to the one Grandmaster originally brought with Tang San to enter Spirit Hunting Forest, only, in this token tile\u2019s pattern were all six\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Part 4</p><br/><p>Peng, the door closed, Tang Hao\u2019s large figure had already disappeared. Looking at the door, Grandmaster stood there for a long time without any movement.</p><br/><p>After a good while, he could slowly lower his head, gaze falling on that token tile, the corners of his mouth revealed a slight wry smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cI would not have thought, my idol unexpectedly already became like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Sunlight slanting from the west, side by side in front of the smithy\u2019s door sat two petite figures. They were dressed in similar clothes, sitting quietly.</p><br/><p>The glow of the setting sun coloured them faintly red, seemingly branding their bodies a golden red.</p><br/><p>The girl on the left inclined her head, looking at the boy, both hands poking her chin, wanting to say something, but she endured in the end.</p><br/><p>On the contrary it was the boy who opened his mouth, in his hands holding a brand new forging hammer,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank me for what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu full of curiosity asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for keeping me company all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San lowered his head, looking at the ground underfoot, the expression in his eyes somewhat misted, also somewhat hazy, but in the end without tears falling.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu giggled, pushing Tang San\u2019s shoulder with great force, nearly pushing over Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be gloomy. Your dad only left temporarily, that\u2019s all. Inevitably one day, you will meet again. Maybe, his leaving was only in order to let you grow even better, let you gain even more power. If you again became down like this, wouldn\u2019t it disappoint his efforts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s face revealed a trace of a wry smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe so, but, why did he not let me see him again. Xiao Wu, did you know, dad is my only family. Home without dad, is also no longer a home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu flung back her head, tossing her long scorpion braid in front,</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout dad, you still have me this friend, right. If you absolutely want to find family, I wouldn\u2019t mind being your older sister. Quickly, let me hear you call me Xiao Wu Jie. Everyone calls me that, only you are an exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Wu\u2019s lovely and smart appearance with that evening sunset glow illuminating her flushed little face, Tang San couldn\u2019t help but smile. Just when a person\u2019s heart was the weakest having by his side a person for company, was an extremely happy matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to become my little sister, I won\u2019t be opposed. I remember what was said: although we are of the same year, it seems you compared to me must be a few months younger. I was born on the first month, you on the eighth month, correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that\u2019s possible. I will only be the older sister, I\u2019m unsuitable to be the younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu angrily raised her hand to knock Tang San\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s body in a flash had already leapt up, standing three meters in front of Xiao Wu,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, follow me onto the hill, I will show you some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s expression was very earnest, seemingly like having decided on something.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu also did not again play, on her little face revealing cleverness, nodding towards him.</p><br/><p>Tang San took the initiative and pulled Xiao Wu by her delicate hand, and ran for the small hill outside the village. The two\u2019s shadows under the illumination of the setting sun gradually lengthened on the ground.</p><br/><p>Tang San brought Xiao Wu continuously running to the hilltop before coming to a stop, under conditions of fully pushing Mysterious Heaven skill, he could not help but pant slightly.</p><br/><p>Standing on the hilltop, Tang San faced the setting sun, both eyes already filled with purple,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wu, this is my former practice place. I am very seriously asking you a question, and I hope you can seriously answer me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu bit her lip,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know, your current appearance is very like that old fogey at the academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San slowly turned around, seriously looking at Xiao Wu,</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you willing to be my little sister? I truly hope to be able to again have a family member.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu was about to say something, but was stopped by Tang San,</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst listen to what I have to say. I have nothing, you have also seen my family\u2019s circumstances, and I am only descended from impoverished commoners. I cannot give you wealth and also cannot give you power. You also have innate full spirit power, but you and I are not alike, I can see your life\u2019s experiences should have some story. But I never asked, because I feared that our backgrounds disparity is too great, and we could not even become friends.

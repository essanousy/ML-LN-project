Placing his hand on Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, he took out the already yellowed letter from his belt. </p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, do you recognize this handwriting? When I was six years old, my father left this letter behind and left home and never came back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San showed the letter to Tai Tan, which he often took out to read, this was the only trace of his father. Every time Tang San took out this letter, he couldn\u2019t suppress the longing he had of his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle san,</p><br/><p>By the time you see this letter, I have already left.</p><br/><p>Do not bother trying to find me, you can never find me.</p><br/><p>Although you are still young, you have the ability to provide for yourself.</p><br/><p>Young eagles must spread their wings on their own and fly, only then will they soar to great heights.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need to worry about me, in your character there is a lot of your mother\u2019s softness.</p><br/><p>Father is a useless man.</p><br/><p>You have grown bigger, father has to go back to get some things that originally belonged to me.</p><br/><p>Someday, we father and son will meet again</p><br/><p>I wish for you to become strong, but at the same time I do not wish for you to become strong. This is your own path and your own choice.</p><br/><p>If one day you feel that becoming a spirit master is not the job for you, you can return to holy spirit village and become a blacksmith like me.</p><br/><p>Do not miss me,</p><br/><p>Tang Hao\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San had always considered this letter a memory, entrusted with his father\u2019s thoughts of him. But reading it again now, combined with what Tai Tan had suggested about his identity, it suddenly held a completely different meaning.</p><br/><p>Especially the line \u201cI wish for you to become strong, but at the same time I do not wish for you to become strong\u201d showed the mixed feelings Tang Hao had when he wrote this letter. Also, the thing that Tang Hao wanted to take back, what might it be?</p><br/><p>After reading the letter, Tai Tan had a peal of despondency, and could not help but think out loud:</p><br/><p>\u201cOh master, how can you say you are useless? In this old slave\u2019s heart, you will eternally be the pillar of the clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bowing his head to look down at Tang San in front of him, Tai Tan carefully returned the letter to his hand,</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, there\u2019s no mistake. This is master\u2019s handwriting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen my father really came from the Clear Sky School? Senior, I implore you, tell me the truth about this matter. Since he was a member of the Clear Sky School, why would he live with me in Holy Spirit Village? What actually happened in between? Please tell me, I must know the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan looked at Tang San, tears could not help but flow from his eyes once more. He could fully imagine how life had been like without a mother, and having his father leave him when he was six years old. How lonely and bitter a life Tang San must have led for these years. Tai Tan couldn\u2019t keep from spreading his arms, pulling Tang San into an embrace,</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, my poor young master, all these years you must have suffered.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment Tang San\u2019s emotions were surging, not knowing what to do. The sudden news had completely disturbed his train of thought, and the words \u2018Clear Sky School\u2019 were too shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, I can\u2019t tell you about master\u2019s affairs back in those days. That secret belongs to master himself, even I am unsure what happened. All you need to know is that master was a man with an indomitable spirit, the most terrifying existence in this world, no one could compare to him. My Strength Clan was originally one of the four great subsidiary clans of the Clear Sky School, it was because of master that I chose to separate from the Hao Tian clan, to again stand independent in Heaven Dou City. Since Master has reappeared, the Strength Clan will without a doubt be master\u2019s subordinates. Although Master is currently not around, there is still you, young master. From now on, the Strength Clan will be yours to command. A total of two hundred and seventeen able bodied Spirit Masters who will follow you to the death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s eyes blurred, his father had left for eight years, without a word the whole time.</p><br/><p>It would be impossible to claim that there wasn\u2019t a hint of resentment, but right now Tang San could suddenly feel his father\u2019s helplessness. If he was really from the Clear Sky School, and the one Tai Tan called master, yet had been reduced to poverty as a blacksmith and drunkard in Holy Spirit Village for six years.</p><br/><p>Just how deep was his sadness and helplessness?</p><br/><p>Thinking of his father\u2019s mournful wails when he was reincarnated into this world, Tang San understood something.</p><br/><p>He gripped Tai Tan\u2019s solid arms with his own, </p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, right now my thoughts are in a mess, I need to calm down and think it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan quickly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, you mustn\u2019t by any means call me something like senior again. Just call me old slave Tai Tan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Tai Long\u2019s grandfather, he and I are school mates, and I am younger than him as well. If you do not mind, I will call you grandpa Tai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d </p><br/><p>Tai Tan hesitated.</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201dEven if my father were here, he would definitely approve of me addressing you like this. Grandpa Tai, I must go see school master Ning, let us meet again. Regarding my life since my birth, please keep it a secret. I need to calmly think about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Tan spoke in a grave tone</p><br/><p>\u201dYoung master, you must definitely be careful of Ning Fengzhi. The owner once said that the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s new master Ning Fengzhi was a man of great potential, in his hands the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School would definitely flourish. You belong to the Clear Sky School, no matter what you cannot join the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded slightly, </p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Tai, don\u2019t worry. Even if we hadn\u2019t spoken today I still didn\u2019t intend to join any school. I wouldn\u2019t give up my own freedom for power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, Tai Tan couldn\u2019t help looking distracted a moment, his eyes blurring. Within Tang San\u2019s calm and collected words it was as if he could see Tang Hao from those days.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the room with Tai Tan and his family, Tang San took two deep breaths, wiped clean the moisture from his eyes, and calmed himself down, entering the other meeting room.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi was seated in the seat of honor in the conference room, calmly drinking tea. By his side, Bone Douluo Gu Rong was seated with his eyes closed until Tang San entered the meeting room. Opening his eyes he swept his gaze across Tang San, with an unconcealed sharpness.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stood obediently behind Ning Fengzhi, sticking out her tongue at Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, uncle Ning, I\u2019ve kept you waiting.\u201d </p><br/><p>Tang San bowed slightly towards Ning Fengzhi.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi slightly smiled and said </p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter. Sit. Little San, can I call you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Rongrong\u2019s father, of course you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi laughed in spite of himself,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I\u2019ve actually been infected by Rongrong\u2019s enthusiasm. After hearing about you from Rongrong, as well as last time\u2019s meeting, I dare say even your father had never accomplished such things at your age. Honestly speaking, I came here ready to bring you into my clan at any cost, but I didn\u2019t expect you to be the son of an old friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ning you know my father?\u201d </p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s not easily restrained pulse sped up once again.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally. The Continent\u2019s youngest Title Douluo, I expect that in the Spirit Master world there aren\u2019t many that don\u2019t know of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Tang San had guessed his father\u2019s strength, when Ning Fengzhi said Title Duoluo, he still felt an intense shock.</p><br/><p>That father who had drowned himself in cheap ale, relying only on blacksmithing to make a living, would actually be called a Title Douluo?</p><br/><p>When Ning Fengzhi brought up about Tang Hao, even the Bone Douluo sitting to his side couldn\u2019t help showing a respectful expression.</p><br/><p>Nothing was hidden from Tang San\u2019s eyes, and seeing this was another step towards confirming that Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words weren\u2019t unfounded.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi continued: </p><br/><p>\u201cYour esteemed father has been missing for so many years, do you know his current location? We brothers have not met for many years, and if there was a chance I would personally go meet him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San bitterly said:</p><br/><p>\u201dI also don\u2019t know my father\u2019s whereabouts. He disappeared eight years ago. In these eight years there has yet to be a word from him. If it is like senior says and my father comes from the Clear Sky School, then perhaps right now he should be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi and the Bone Duoluo looked face to face, their eyes revealing expression of astonishment. Ning Fengzhi\u2019s expression very quickly returned to normal and he said to Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201dLittle San, I have come to recruit you to my clan and give you the best treatment. But since you\u2019re the son of an old friend, this is obviously impossible. However uncle is still very interested in the hidden weapons you made, would you be willing to sell the production method to us? You can name any price, uncle won\u2019t haggle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ning Fengzhi appeared rather elegant and refined, his words gave people a kind of broad magnanimous feeling, this was clearly not something an average person possessed.</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head without hesitation and said: </p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I won\u2019t sell the hidden weapon production method. But I promised Rongrong that I would sell hidden weapons to your school. I can give you the forging procedures, but the final assembly must be done by me. Firstly, it\u2019s because hidden weapons research is difficult, and I don\u2019t want to sell it, another reason is that to teach an artisan to create hidden weapons would take several years. I still have to spend most of my time cultivating, and there\u2019s no spare time for such.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi hadn\u2019t expected Tang San to refuse him so firmly. What is called \u2018giving a man a fish, is less than teaching a man to fish\u2019 was naturally an argument he understood clearly.</p><br/><p>Hidden weapons would naturally break down and be consumed with time.</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>If they truly had such a great effect, then wouldn\u2019t the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School\u2019s face hereafter always rely on this child?</p><br/><p>Watching the pondering expression Ning Fengzhi revealed, Tang San didn\u2019t hesitate at all, indifferently saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether uncle Ning would like those hidden weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi returned to himself. From Tang San\u2019s tone he could tell that the hidden weapon manufacturing methods clearly weren\u2019t up for discussion. Even though Tang San was only a teenager, the calm cool-headedness and unswerving determination he had revealed wouldn\u2019t be so easily swayed.</p><br/><p>Immediately Ning Fengzhi settled for the next best thing, saying to Tang San:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the hidden weapons Rongrong was equipped with. Equipment just like hers, I want five hundred sets. I will pay ten thousand gold spirit coins for each set, what do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price is no problem, but I must say something first. This full set of hidden weapons won\u2019t include the Flying God Claw on Rongrong\u2019s right hand. I can exchange it for another Silent Sleeve Dart. The rest will be the same. It\u2019s because the Flying God Claw isn\u2019t a hidden weapon, even though it has the ability to attack, it\u2019s even more important as support. Furthermore the Flying God Claw components are very difficult to make, it would be hard for a common artisan to complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi hadn\u2019t seen Ning Rongrong use the Flying God Claw, and only now learned from Tang San that his daughter actually still had such a thing. But he was already extremely satisfied with the hidden weapons Ning Rongrong used before, and immediately nodded and smiled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s settled. Additionally, I will pay you a further one million gold spirit coins, as repayment for the Beautiful Silk Tulip you gave Rongrong. At the same time I would also like to ask, do you still have Beautiful Silk Tulips? If you do, no matter the price, I want to trade for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Ning Fengzhi\u2019s status, the lure of the Nine Treasure Glazed Tile Pagoda was really too great. That was the only opportunity to take one step further for him who was already at the highest stage.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Tang San shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Beautiful Silk Tulip is considered an immortal treasure herb, there is perhaps only the one in the present age. There won\u2019t grow more than one in the same place. Perhaps there is still others on the Continent, but I haven\u2019t found them if so. The one Rongrong has was my gift to her, how could I ask for compensation from uncle? Five million gold spirit coins is sufficient. However, I must make one thing clear, I am only in charge of the final assembly. For the intermediate component manufacturing I would ask uncle Ning to find a way on your own. According to Rongrong, your school possesses specialized ironworkers, so this shouldn\u2019t be difficult. At the same time, along with your school\u2019s own blacksmiths forging components, in the future it will also be easy to replenish all kinds of hidden weapons supplies, especially crossbow bolts and steel needles and such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Tang San pulled out a pile of blueprints from Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges, and after carefully looking them over he handed them to Ning Fengzhi,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilent Sleeve Dart, Stomp Crossbow and Flying Boot Blade components can all be made.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Ning Fengzhi carefully accept the blueprints, The Bone Douluo to the side couldn\u2019t help saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you really can do business! Without even making the components, you\u2019ve really earned these five million gold coins too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Bone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi shook his head at Gu Rong, hinting he shouldn\u2019t be talkative.</p><br/><p>Right now Tang San didn\u2019t have too much interest in money, but rather hoped to even more quickly clarify his own identity. With a calm smile he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf uncle Ning feels this price is too unreasonable, you can lower it, the price was proposed by you before. I have no complaints.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled slightly:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to lower it. Even though my words aren\u2019t precious like gold or jade, the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School still has credit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this is settled. Uncle Ning, thank you for your assistance just now. If there\u2019s nothing else, I would like to go back and rest. Regarding the hidden weapons, please forge one hundred sets of the hidden weapon components and deliver them here. After I\u2019ve assembled them I will deliver them to you. For hidden weapons consumables you will have to create them on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi didn\u2019t keep him, and personally saw him out of the meeting room. At the same time he pressed a golden bright and dazzling card in his hand. Ning Fengzhi didn\u2019t say how much money was inside, only telling Tang San that it was a down payment. The rest would wait until after the Hidden Weapons were assembled and delivered.</p><br/><p>Looking at Tang San walking out, Gu Rong couldn\u2019t help frowning,</p><br/><p>\u201cFengzhi, why would you promise so much? Even if our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School is wealthy, we still can\u2019t be spending like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi delicately indicated the blueprints and said with a smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle Bone. These blueprints Tang San gave me are extremely detailed, not only do they mark the required materials, but still indicates the required component casting methods in detail. Moreover there\u2019s no confusion about the order, all the components are classified by hidden weapon. There\u2019s no lack of skilled workers at our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, don\u2019t tell me we can\u2019t assemble them? It seems to me that five million gold spirit coins for buying this set of hidden weapons manufacturing blueprints isn\u2019t cheap. Taking a step back, even if we didn\u2019t have these hidden weapons blueprints, do you really think five million gold coins is enough to pay for that Beautiful Silk Tulip immortal treasure herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Ning Fengzhi, Uncle Bone\u2019s expression eased, and he muttered:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you count it like that, then it doesn\u2019t seem like a loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong to the side couldn\u2019t stand just listening,</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, grandpa Bone, what are you scheming about my third brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi glared at Ning Rongrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t call it scheming. As the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School Master, everything daddy does must be done with the school in mind. Alright, you go back first. Continue cultivating properly at the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong glared discontentedly at her dad, then gave the Bone Douluo an appealing look. But this time the Bone Douluo didn\u2019t help her, only showing her a meaningful expression, indicating she should leave first.</p><br/><p>After Ning Rongrong left the meeting room, the only two people remaining were Ning Fengzhi and Gu Rong. With Gu Rong\u2019s strength, it would be impossible for anyone to eavesdrop.</p><br/><p>\u201cFengzhi, what do you think of that kid? Is he really Tang Hao\u2019s son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t be a mistake. The Clear Sky School\u2019s Clear Sky Hammer can\u2019t be imitated. According to what I know, there hasn\u2019t been any directly blood related disciples who left the Clear Sky School in recent years, as a whole they\u2019ve kept a low profile. Only Tang Hao was unaccounted for. Besides, this child admits his father\u2019s name is Tang Hao. Going by his age, there isn\u2019t much discrepancy. I really hadn\u2019t expected Tang Hao to foster such an outstanding son after leaving the Clear Sky School.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong said with a wry smile:</p><br/><p>\u201cHow couldn\u2019t he be outstanding, after all, this child has Tang Hao and that woman as parents. This kid isn\u2019t just terrifyingly strong, his mind also isn\u2019t ordinary. By his appearance, he shouldn\u2019t have known about Tang Hao\u2019s identity, under such circumstances suddenly learning about it today and still managing to keep a cool head, this isn\u2019t something a ten something years old child is capable of. With time, I\u2019m afraid he will be another Tang Hao. School master, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, Gu Rong\u2019s expression turned severe, his right hand making a knife like cutting gesture in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi resolutely rejected Gu Rong\u2019s proposal,</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Bone, never say something like this again. Even though the Clear Sky School has always been placed above our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, us three upper sects have always been like brothers, no matter the point of view, we can\u2019t harm this child. Even though even I can\u2019t guess what rate of development this child will be able to have in the future, judging by his twin spirits, perhaps, after several years he will also be a character like the Supreme Pontiff. To this child, even if we are unable to draw him into the school, we must still do everything in our power to make friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong somewhat puzzled said:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t tell me we will watch such a threat mature? If in a few decades he also grows into a Title Douluo, the Clear Sky School will become a three Douluo sect. If this happens, then perhaps we will always be suppressed by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you say is admittedly true, but I must think of even more. Uncle Bone, you haven\u2019t left the school for a long time, and you\u2019ve never cared for matters of the outside world. However, don\u2019t you feel that for the last twenty years the whole Continent\u2019s Spirit Master world has been too quiet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong\u2019s expression changed slightly,</p><br/><p>\u201cSchool master, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi said:</p><br/><p>\u201cI still remember the rising winds and scudding clouds of the Spirit Master world in my youth. Seen and unseen struggles happening everywhere. But in the last twenty years struggles like these have practically disappeared. The whole Continent, the Spirit Master world of the two Great Empires is frightfully quiet. But I vaguely feel the signs of mountain rain on the wind. Perhaps, in just a few years, the Spirit Master world\u2019s situation will change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong somewhat disbelieving said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFengzhi, aren\u2019t you being a bit paranoid? The Continent\u2019s calm seems to me an inevitable trend. The Spirit Master world is mainly controlled in the hands of Spirit Hall and our seven great schools, everyone minding their own business between each other, the majority of Spirit Masters attaching themselves within these two sides. Even if it wasn\u2019t these two sides, there\u2019s still the two Great empires or perhaps the kingdoms and duchies for control. The whole situation would naturally stabilize. Would something still change in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi laughed bitterly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s really like this, then that\u2019s naturally for the best. But I\u2019m afraid it isn\u2019t so simple. I\u2019ve already found some tiny hints, but I still can\u2019t be certain. Everything must still be handled carefully. But, I can be certain that if anything changes in the Continent, our seven great schools must band together. I don\u2019t dare speak for the lower four sects, but our upper three sects have always been like brothers, as long as our relationship is stable, I won\u2019t fear a change in power on any one side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Josh)</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very optimistic of Tang San; I also believe that by using all of his capabilities and gifts, he will be an outstanding talent in this spirit master world before long. Looking at it, this child is a person who does not like being restrained, but his desire for fame and profit is very small. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have gifted those precious herbs to his companions. Regarding this child who could become an extremely strong person, we must only have a good relation with him as in the future he could be of help to us. I even think that it would be a very good option if we can raise the importance of our Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School by marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelated by marriage? But didn\u2019t Rongrong say that he already already had a close female friend?\u201d</p><br/><p> Gu Rong said puzzled.</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi smiled indifferently and said, </p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of how outstanding he may be, he is still only a child, and since he is a child, his will is far from being fixed. Who knows what will change in the future? Don\u2019t tell me that my girl is not suitable for him? This is still something to be taken up later, we must first look at this child\u2019s development in the next few years. If he is still able to keep up this rapid speed, I naturally will have measures for dealing with the situation. Uncle Bone, after we get back, you must not tell anyone the information you learned today, especially of the possibility of Tang San\u2019s Clear Sky School background. I really do not wish for members of Clear Sky School to look for him. Although Tang Hao left Clear Sky Academy, that place was still where he started. Even now, there is certainly no one who would say he isn\u2019t one of Clear Sky\u2019s pair of Douluos. If Tang San really returned to Clear Sky Academy, that could not be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong nodded his head. He could see, Ning Fengzhi still had some words in his heart that he had not said. However, these words were not important to him; it was only important for Ning Fengzhi, the helmsman of Seven Treasures Glazed Tile Pagoda Academy, to clearly see everything.</p><br/><p>When Tang San returned to the dormitory, he found that Oscar, Zhu Zhuqing, Ma Hongjun and Xiao Wu were all unexpectedly waiting for him here. Further, once he entered, Ning Rongrong had already ran in from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have something you want to ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze swept over everyone, his face showing a trace of astringency.</p><br/><p>Oscar was the first to shake his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to ask. Your own business is your own to deal with. I only know that you are the third brother of the Shrek Seven Devils.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun scratched his head:</p><br/><p> \u201cI still am not clear of what happened so there is nothing to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Zhu Zhuqing said, </p><br/><p>\u201cYou also have not asked about our origins; everyone has their own secrets which should be considered as their own private information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu immediately said:</p><br/><p> \u201cWe are only concerned about you as a person; everything else does not matter. By coming back safe and sound, we are all already relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong angrily said:</p><br/><p> \u201cXiao Wu, dont tell me that my father would harm Little San? En. Let me tell you a secret: Little San became rich. He sold my father 500 sets of hidden weapons with the total price ending up at about 5 million gold spirit coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar heard this and immediately jumped off the bed, his face excitedly looking at Ning Rongrong:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, where is the most expensive place in Heaven Dou City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stared blankly:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar pointed his finger at Tang San and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously beating the local tyrant and dividing the land[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong laughed:</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you plan on beating a tyrant, then you will have to wait a few days. Can\u2019t you see how tired third brother is? You should try and endure a Spirit Douluo\u2019s power for that long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar mischievously looked at Tang San:</p><br/><p> \u201cAnyways, he is in the same dorm as me so he cannot run. Okay, since little San is tired, you should head back and let little San rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another everyone nodded; Xiao Wu looked at Tang San with an extremely troubled expression. However at the moment, Tang San\u2019s state of mind was extremely disordered and did not respond to her gaze.</p><br/><p>Once Oscar and the other left the dorm, the only one remaining was Tang San.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the bed, he felt the sunlight on his body bringing a sense of warmth, but his heart was still extremely confused.</p><br/><p>Father. Where are you? Who can tell me what is going on? What everyone has said is so contradictory: if his father was born in Clear Sky School and even was one of Clear Sky School\u2019s two Douluos, then why did he degenerate into a drunkard? From childhood, he did not mention his information pertaining to his spirit. The only thing he left him was that simple forging skill and the Disorder Splitting Wind Hammer Method.</p><br/><p>His father had been missing for 8 years, what was he doing? Why is it that even now he hadn\u2019t come to find him? Tai Tan his Strength Clan left the Clear Sky School for his father. From this it is possible to see that when his father left Clear Sky School, it was most likely that he had a disagreement with the school that made him leave. This disagreement was among the most important points. Where did this disagreement come from? How his mother also die? Perhaps all of these crucial points are all related to his mother.</p><br/><p>Alone in the silent room, Tang San slowly arranged all the information he learned today in his head and gradually made an outline. However at the moment, it was still impossible to make anything out of it and he was unable to figure out what the crucial point was.</p><br/><p>It was when Tang San was in the room racking his brains, when Oscar was carrying out one of the most important events of his lifetime.</p><br/><p>After exiting the dorm, Xiao Wu harbouring thoughts went back to her room, Zhu Zhuqing went back to her daily cultivation and at Oscars \u2018suggestion\u2019, Fatty also left. At the moment, there was only Oscar accompanying Ning Rongrong at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, I did not realize that you would come back so quick. What are you going to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar smiled while remarking.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong was a bit at a loss and said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I do not now. I feel like cultivating, but I cannot stop thinking. Father made me leave so I do not know what he and grandpa Bone are talking about. Perhaps they are still talking with Teacher Zhao. Is it bad that I came back so quick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s good. You don\u2019t know this, but when you left, I feared that your father would not let you come back. That certainly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong stopped walking and somewhat suspiciously looked at Oscar.</p><br/><p>Before Ning Rongrong came back, Oscar had already summoned the courage, but right now in front of Ning Rongrong, looking at her pink small face, he did not know why, but all the courage had left him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it! A big boy shouldn\u2019t be this effeminate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to bear it any longer, Ning Rongrong kicked Oscar.</p><br/><p>Oscar finally mustered the courage:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, can you give me an answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive you an answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong suddenly jumped, already conscious of what this was about. Females are inherently keen and are mature faster than men. Looking at Oscar\u2019s peach blossom eyes full of peculiarity, her heartbeat immediately sped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, give me an answer. If not, I will also give up. Everyday when we are together, we don\u2019t think of this, but when you left, although it was only for a day, I felt as if I were sitting on pins and needles. All I could think about was you. If there really will be a day when you leave my side, I don\u2019t know what I would become. It is better to just get the pain over with, rather than prolong the agony. If you don\u2019t have any feelings for me, then please reject me now. I know that the feeling of rejection will hurt me for a period of time, but it is still better than pain for all my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Oscar, Ning Rongrong couldn\u2019t help but widen her eyes. She found that today\u2019s Oscar not only had worn a clean and tidy shirt, but also had shaved his beard to make it neat. Although those peach blossom eyes expressed seriousness, they also gave people a feeling of being dazzled and stunned. His handsome face couldn\u2019t help but resonate within her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Why are you talking about this. Right now we are still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong somewhat in a state of panic lowered her head, refusing to look at Oscar\u2019s gaze. Her heart and mind were like deer colliding and for a moment she did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>Oscar raised his hands and grabbed Ning Rongrong\u2019s slender shoulders:</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, look at me. All I need is an answer. No matter what the answer is I can handle it. If we really wait until we are older, I\u2019m afraid I will not be able to handle it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would appear that he gave Ning Rongrong a very easy choice: Receive my intentions, or reject my intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong heart was already confused and disordered so much that it was even more so that Tang San\u2019s. Feeling Oscar\u2019s presence, she really could not reject him, but at the same time, she also could not say yes. She knew that although her father doted on her, as well as two Grandpas protecting her, when it came to family customs, her father would not give leeway.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour heart still has a place for me, right or wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ning Rongrong\u2019s both welcoming and refusing demeanor, Oscar could not help but blurt out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong wished she could reject Oscar. Looking at it logically, she knew that there was no way she could be with him, but when she looked at the fiery gaze Oscar\u2019s peach blossom eyes emitted, her spirit felt it was comforted and she was unable to refuse him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRongrong, you heart still has a place for me, right or wrong? If you don\u2019t say anything then it could be a yes, but it could also be a no. Fine, I won\u2019t force you\u2026 I won\u2019t force you. Right now I am still young. All you have to do is let me know that I still have a chance. That much is enough. Dont worry, I will try my best. Although I don\u2019t have any background, I will definitely rely on my own effort to earn your father\u2019s approval and let him marry you to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] (\u3001) Slogan used in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s agrarian revolution in 1927.

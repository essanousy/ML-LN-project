Among tool Spirit Masters, the most difficult to cultivate was food system tool Spirit Masters. With Oscar apparently twenty something years old still advancing past the sixtieth rank, to the Spirit Emperor level, it was obvious how talented he was. Consequently, the four clan chiefs returned the courtesy in turn.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s second introduction was Ning Rongrong,</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Rongrong, sixty first rank auxiliary system tool Spirit Master. I think I only need to introduce her spirit for all clan chiefs to understand her somewhat. Rongrong is from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, the present Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School master senior Ning Fengzhi\u2019s only daughter, and also the future successor of the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Entering our Tang Sect, besides being in charge of future sect financial affairs, she also has the important responsibility of communicating with the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Everyone are on the same side here, so I won\u2019t hide it, the Tang Sect\u2019s establishment is vigorously backed by the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. That\u2019s how we possess sufficient funds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, once second of the three upper sects, second only to the Clear Sky School, the four single attribute clan chiefs were of course very familiar with it. Just Ning Rongrong\u2019s position as the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School heir was enough to make them not dare look down on her, and even more so when learning that ning Rongrong was even a bit younger than Tang San, but had still already broken through the sixtieth rank. The Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School had never had anyone break through the eightieth rank, but even the seventy something ranked Ning Fengzhi was already the most formidable tool Spirit Master on the entire Continent. There was no need to doubt the ability the sixty one ranked Ning Rongrong represented.</p><br/><p>Ning Rongrong equally got up to respectfully salute the four clan chiefs in greeting. As early as when she was beaten after entering Shrek Academy, her haughty manner had already disappeared. In these years she had concentrated even more on cultivation, and even if she was just turned twenty, she already had some of her father\u2019s elegance.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze finally turned to Ma Hongjun, sitting closest to him on the right,</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Hongjun, fifty eighth ranked power attack type battle Spirit Master, spirit Fire Phoenix. He is also a bit younger than me, and fourth oldest among us Shrek Seven Devils. His spirit is certainly best in battle properties. For the moment I\u2019ve decided to put him in charge of the Tang Sect\u2019s later battle operations, specially choosing the disciples from the sect that are best at fighting to form the Martial Hall. In the future, the sect\u2019s external operations will be handled by the Martial Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s gaze finally fell on Xiao Wu,</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I should also let all elders know about her. Xiao Wu was once a member of us Shrek Seven Devils, the fifth oldest. She was also my lover. But because of Spirit Hall\u2019s persecution, her soul left her body. Even though she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s already lost her awareness. She only has a bit of instinct. I won\u2019t hide it from you elders, Xiao Wu is the same as my mother, originally she wasn\u2019t human, but a hundred thousand year spirit beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, the four clan chiefs as well as divine craftsman Lou Gao were simultaneously greatly alarmed, their gazes at Xiao Wu immediately turning monstrous.</p><br/><p>Tang San didn\u2019t seem to notice the change in their expressions, continuing:</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you elders have seen my sixth spirit ring. The reason I can possess a hundred thousand year level spirit ring as my sixth, really isn\u2019t due to my own ability, nor is it that I can break through the limits of the Spirit Master world. It\u2019s because of Xiao Wu. In order to save me, Xiao Wu chose to sacrifice herself, sacrificing her spirit ring for me. It\u2019s also because of this that she changed into her current state. If it wasn\u2019t because I had an immortal herb called the Yearning Heartbroken Red at the time, she would long ago have truly died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYearning Heartbroken Red?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Wudi cried out.</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Blood Crystal Dragon Ginseng gave me was eaten by Xiao Wu, before that she was the little rabbit I carried. It was with the aid of these two great immortal treasures that Xiao Wu separated from the beast form, becoming human. But she still has no consciousness or soul. Her soul has already fused together with my sixth spirit ring along with her sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Tang San related it very calmly, the atmosphere in the Tang Sect sect master meeting hall still grew a bit somber. Looking at Xiao Wu, including Lou Gao, the eyes of the five elders all revealed some respect. Choosing to sacrifice herself for her lover. So what if she was a spirit beast? How many humans could do it? In their thoughts were only four words, humans inferior to beasts.</p><br/><p>Drawing a deep breath, Tang San calmed his mood, turning to the five elders,</p><br/><p>\u201cI plan to set up the four single attribute clans like this. Because we are in ourselves a sect, it\u2019s not too appropriate to continue calling it as clans. I want to simply change the naming of the four single attribute clans. The Strength Clan will hereafter be called the Strength Hall, mainly in charge of the sect\u2019s hidden weapons production. This is also the future main source of income. Elder Tai Tan will hold the concurrent post as hall master. The Defense Clan will hereafter change name to Defense Hall, in charge of the sect\u2019s defense and all manner of construction obligations. Elder Niu Gao will hold concurrent post as hall master. The Speed Clan will change to Speed Hall, in charge of information gathering, investigation, and news. Elder Bai He holds concurrent post as hall master. The Breaking Clan will change name to Medicine Hall, in charge of sect defense along with the Defense Clan, but mainly refining medicine. Among these, the drugs will be split into healing and poison. I will talk over the concrete details with elder Yang Wudi. Elder Yang Wudi holds concurrent post as Medicine Hall master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all I can think of for the moment. At the same time, all elders present as well as I, Oscar, Ning Rongrong, and elder Lou Gao, altogether nine people will form Procedure Hall. We will commonly discuss all major sect events, and decide by vote. Each person has one vote. What do you elders think?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils naturally wouldn\u2019t object to Tang San\u2019s proposal. Tang San had for the moment thought of these for the Tang Sect\u2019s structure, the remainder was a matter for discussion.</p><br/><p>As the head of the five elders, Tai Tan was first to speak up. His expression when looking at Tang San was clearly filled with praise,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no objections, sect master\u2019s plans are very systematic. If I were to raise one opinion, I feel that, as sect master, your authority really is a bit too little. I propose that the sect master has two votes. Even if it\u2019s adding one vote for miss Xiao Wu. At the same time, sect master possesses a veto power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only Tai Tan, the other elders also nodded simultaneously. Even if Tang San\u2019s plans changed the names of the four single attribute clans, he divided the authority evenly, without monopolizing power. This bit made the elders exceedingly appreciative. But they were intelligent people, and also saw that the future accomplishments of the few Shrek Seven Devils in front of them was immeasurable. If they only coveted a bit of strength at present, then some day the future of the four single attribute clans might be affected. This was something they didn\u2019t wish to see. Even more, as the sect master, Tang San should originally possess even more authority.</p><br/><p>Lou Gao spoke up,</p><br/><p>\u201cSect master, now they all have duties, then what about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Lou Gao, you should basically also be part of Strength Hall. However, I don\u2019t want to give you a post there. Tai Tan is in charge of Tang Sect\u2019s overall hidden weapon production, so I want you to be in charge of producing the Tang Sect\u2019s most advanced hidden weapons. Once the blacksmith scholars Si Di and Si Kai arrive, it will be up to you and them to complete this responsibility. I will make blueprints for all the Tang Sect\u2019s most advanced hidden weapons and materials and give them to you. I believe that, among the future hidden weapons the Tang Sect produces, each and every one with the characters Lou Gao will be on the divine tool level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that Tang San would offer him blueprints and materials, Lou Gao\u2019s eyes immediately brightened, hurriedly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then it\u2019s decided, I have no objections.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Tang Sect\u2019s first high level conference ended smoothly, without any dissenting voices. The Tang Sect\u2019s overall structure and labor division was already clarified, and this recently established sect immediately got to work.</p><br/><p>The five elders left, leaving only the Shrek Five Devils in the meeting hall.</p><br/><p>Oscar said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, isn\u2019t it careless to leave me in charge of logistics? I don\u2019t have any experience in that area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is originally a joint responsibility for you and Rongrong. Anyway, Rongrong is our god of wealth, so your logistics work will need her support. With your relationship, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone more suited to hold this post. Don't tell me you don\u2019t believe you have the ability? You might have a lot of work. Later you and Rongrong go to the warehouse together and take stock of the metals we got on our trip this time, then supply Strength Hall. Our development has to be accelerated. The distance to the day of the seven sect reselection assembly is getting closer and closer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oscar laughed helplessly,</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re pushing me beyond my ability. Oh, right, shouldn\u2019t we go back the the Academy first? I don\u2019t know how the thing with the four element academies turned out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should make a trip back, Rongrong has been gone for so long and should go back to see uncle Ning. How about this, Little Ao, you and Rongrong go back to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, me and Fatty will visit the Academy. Teacher and the others should also have returned. After you\u2019ve been to the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, return and meet up with us at the Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the Tang Sect had just been established, they currently possessed the advantage of abundant resources. First of all was their location. Within Heaven Dou City, even if Spirit Hall discovered their existence, they would still be unable to easily move against them, at the same time the Tang Sect also had the backing of the Shrek Academy and the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, so much that even the Heaven Dou imperial family supported them. As long as they didn\u2019t step on the wrong path, Tang San believed that he definitely could develop and advance the Tang Sect on the Douluo Continent.</p><br/><p>The four left the Tang Sect almost simultaneously, hurrying in different directions. Tang San pulled Xiao Wu and went towards the Shrek Academy together with Ma Hongjun.</p><br/><p>They had just left when, suddenly, they met a troop of around a hundred cavalry straight ahead, unexpectedly galloping down the street at high speed, just like last time when Tang San met fourth prince Xue Beng\u2019s troop. Because he had Xiao Wu along, Tang San didn\u2019t want to frighten her, and stepped out of the way to the side of the street with Fatty.</p><br/><p>Even though that troop of cavalry was very fast, their horsemanship was exquisite, and they even had a somewhat severe aura.</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s heart twitched, vaguely sensing something wrong, but he was still unable to say why. Having left Heaven Dou City for a time, just now there also hadn\u2019t been time to exchange information with elder Bai He. But his intuition was always very sharp. Reaching out to hold Xiao Wu\u2019s slender waist, he said to Ma Hongjun:</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, we\u2019ll move a bit faster, something might be happening in Heaven Dou City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun stared blankly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t. Everything seems very normal to me! Besides, if something ha happened, why didn\u2019t elder Bai He tell us just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either, only, just now that troop of cavalry was a bit strange. There was no one among them dressed as a noble, still daring to rush down the street like that only has one other explanation, that they were carrying out a mission. But what urgent missions could there be in Heaven Dou City? Let\u2019s first go take a look at the Academy. Any situation should be clear there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the three returned to the Shrek Academy. Entering the Academy, Tang San\u2019s uneasy feeling from those soldiers before faded a lot. At least on the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like anything had changed at the Academy. Everything seemed very ordinary. Right now it was already after class, and students came and went in a steady stream.</p><br/><p>These students naturally knew Ma Hongjun and Tang San, and they could be seen stepping aside one by one, standing there and worshipfully watching them enter the Academy. Even if Tang San and Ma Hongjun were no longer considered members, their status in the Shrek Academy wasn\u2019t any lower than that of the teachers, to the extent that they were even seen as the spiritual emblem of Shrek Academy.</p><br/><p>At the school building, the three went directly to Flender\u2019s office, and Ma Hongjun went up and knocked.</p><br/><p>Flender\u2019s familiar voice came from inside,</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty smiled at Tang San, making a gesture of everything as always and pushed open the door.</p><br/><p>Flender leisurely leaned back in his office chair, and immediately smiled on seeing Ma Hongjun,</p><br/><p>\u201cHongjun, you\u2019ve returned\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only reached so far when he screeched to a stop, shooting out of his chair, his eyes filled with a startled light. Because he could now see Tang San and Xiao Wu following Ma Hongjun in.</p><br/><p>Just as Tang San and Xiao Wu entered, there was already another familiar voice echoing from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlender, you really don\u2019t care about anything. Erlong said you\u2019re refusing to work again?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a rigid face, a familiar figure entered the not yet closed door. Tang San had already respectfully turned around,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>The new arrival was Grandmaster, only, right now it was as if he hadn\u2019t heard Tang San\u2019s words, his expression hardly any different from Flender, staring fixedly at Xiao Wu next to Tang San, white dressed, scorpion braid hanging over her chest.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun chuckled,</p><br/><p>\u201cVery astonishing. Xiao Wu resurrected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, little San, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wu\u2019s appearance already exceeded the limits of Grandmaster\u2019s imagination. With his research into spirits and spirit beasts, he couldn\u2019t understand how Xiao Wu could recover her human shape in such a short time.</p><br/><p>Tang San glanced at Xiao Wu with a look full of tenderness, tightly pulling her waist close, simply explaining the matter of Xiao Wu\u2019s resurrection.</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San\u2019s account, whether it was Flender or Grandmaster, they both displayed knowing smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent, her body has recovered, we can always think of a way for the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender sighed.</p><br/><p>Ma Hongjun said:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, has something major happened in Heaven Dou City in the time we\u2019ve been gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender looked distracted,</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened! Everything is normal. Eh. Oh, right, last time you dealt with the matter of the four element academies very well. Now they\u2019ve already formally merged into our Shrek Academy. If it\u2019s only in terms of the strength of the Academy, our Shrek Academy can absolutely count as number one on the Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, even Tang San was shocked,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four element academies have merged into Shrek Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender chuckled, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four element academies are just stray dogs, don\u2019t tell me they can hope to share our cup of soup in Heaven Dou City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster snapped:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also because they encountered an unscrupulous profiteer like you. With a shark like you going to set terms for the academies, how could we lose out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender proudly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all thanks to Tang San and the others\u2019 arrangements before leaving. The four element academies were finally scared by Bone Douluo and the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Besides, the second time they came, not only was Bone Douluo was here, but even Poison Douluo came. With two Title Douluo supervising, would they dare not compromise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Flender, Tang San\u2019s heart twitched,</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Dugu came?\u201d</p><br/><p>He naturally wouldn\u2019t address Dugu Bo as old freak to outsiders.</p><br/><p>Flender said:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was looking for you, seemed quite urgent. At that time I gave the four element academies an introduction to that honorary dean of ours. Speaking of, Poison Douluo might not be equal to Bone Douluo in terms of strength, but for deterrence, he\u2019s far superior. His poison is a tyrannical ability that can silently annihilate countless opponents.\u201d</p><br/><p>The previously diluted sense of crisis once again appeared in Tang San\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t get deeper into the immensely self satisfied Flender\u2019s dealings with the four element academies, and questioned closer:</p><br/><p>\u201cDean Flender, senior Dugu didn\u2019t say why he was looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender shook his head:</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, after I introduced him to the four element academies, he left in a hurry. His expression seemed a bit abnormal. As if he was troubled by something. It\u2019s possible it was something about Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, wrong. Tang San\u2019s mind moved like lightning, immediately recalling the contents of his last discussion with Dugu Bo. At that time Dugu Bo had just treated emperor Xue Ye\u2019s poison, and according to him, it was almost done. What matter could have him anxiously come looking for him?</p><br/><p>With Dugu Bo\u2019s strength, it was naturally impossible to be something related to power. Then, there was only one possibility.</p><br/><p>After a simple analysis, Tang San\u2019s estimation of Dugu Bo\u2019s reason for finding him was more or less correct, and he also couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat anxious. For Tang Sect\u2019s future development, it naturally wouldn\u2019t do to only rely on the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Only by relying on the great tree of the Heaven Dou Empire could they develop to their fullest potential.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster and Flender noticed Tang San\u2019s silence, and didn\u2019t disturb him. Along with the rise of the Shrek Seven Devils\u2019 strength, their influence in the Spirit Master world also imperceptibly rose to a higher and higher degree. Especially now that Tang San had decided to establish the Tang Sect. Even if it was impossible to gain the approval of Spirit Hall, Flender and Grandmaster both understood that this exceptionally talented disciple had already stepped onto the Spirit Master world stage in a true sense. As long as everything went smoothly, Tang San and the Shrek Seven Devils would shine brightly in the Spirit Master world.</p><br/><p>Tang San returned to himself, somewhat apologetically looking at Grandmaster and Flender,</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I spaced out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, how far has that Tang Sect of yours come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is already in order, we can start regular operations at once. We had a rich harvest on our trips to Rising Dragon City and Gengxin City. The four single attribute clans have now already joined the Tang Sect, giving the sect its embryonic form. Next is to operate the sect at full strength, manufacturing the first batch of hidden weapons. Once we have hidden weapons to a certain extent and in stock, the sect can be considered to stand firmly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Tang San, Flender and Grandmaster couldn\u2019t help simultaneously being excited. They of course knew about the four single attribute clans. The previous Clear Sky School was a colossus in the Spirit Master world. As the Continent\u2019s number one sect, the subordinates of the Clear Sky School, besides the directly related Spirit Masters, supported a total sum of more than four thousand Spirit Masters. The most famous among these were the four single attribute clans. In their most flourishing stage, they each had close to one thousand five hundred Spirit Masters. That was already a considerable number in the Spirit Master world. Moreover, even though each of the four single attribute clans had very large drawbacks, at the same time they also possessed extremely large accomplishments in their own spheres of influence. To use an appropriate term, their power was extremely frightening.</p><br/><p>When the Clear Sky School\u2019s old sect master chose not to confront Spirit Hall head on and retreat, even if it prevented calamity for the Clear Sky School, it still might not have been proper. Even though Spirit Hall\u2019s power was enormous, the Clear Sky School\u2019s overall strength wasn\u2019t weak. Now that Tang San had taken in the four single attribute clans, as long as they were deployed appropriately, the Tang Sect would have future accomplishments.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the four single attribute clans haven\u2019t existed in the Spirit Master world for very long, each of their strengths and skills will be extremely useful to the Tang Sect\u2019s future. Little San, you have to treat them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. Today I\u2019ve already made some simple arrangements for the Tang Sect\u2019s structure\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, he went through the five Halls he had established in the Tang Sect today, as well a each of their roles.</p><br/><p>\u201c...... so at present the Tang Sect\u2019s main strength is all used on building the sect, as well as producing hidden weapons. Even though the four single attribute clans are outstanding, they\u2019re still not suited to becoming true warriors. Later the Martial Hall Fatty is responsible for will expand, absorbing some Spirit Masters with strength. At the same time, I also plan to later establish a Punishment Hall, to deal with the Tang Sect\u2019s internal matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender smiled:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, these five Halls of yours are all very characteristic. Then won\u2019t Oscar and ning Rongrong establish a Hall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San said:</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the moment there is no need. Little Ao, Rongrong, and Fatty, will all later be the Tang Sect\u2019s vice sect masters. Finances and logistics are both fairly important. I\u2019ve talked it over with Rongrong, and we\u2019re planning to first transfer some personnel from the Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School. Once everything is on track, we\u2019ll replace them with our own people. Right now there\u2019s no capital to establish a Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Flender said:</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, if there\u2019s anything the Academy can help you with, just say it. Because of Spirit Hall, now there has also begun to appear problems with recruiting students. Spirit Hall has recently integrated a lot of advanced Spirit Master academies, leading to the majority of young spirit masters joining them. If not for our Shrek Academy still having some reputation, I\u2019m afraid circumstances would\u2019ve been even worse. After Spirit Masters graduate, they always need to find a way forward. I hope that your Tang Sect will be able to become this way in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded, but didn\u2019t make any promises. The Tang Sect had only just set out, and while he of course hoped the Tang Sect could later absorb some outstanding Spirit Masters, at the same time he didn\u2019t want both good and bad people to mix in with the Tang Sect. The concrete circumstances still depended on the later development of the Tang Sect, as well as the circumstances on the Shrek Academy\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster seemed to know what Tang San was thinking, and calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, this time we led the students to hunt spirit beasts in the spirit beast forest, and there also emerged a batch of quite promising students. I will do some screening among them, and pick out some outstanding students to join the Tang Sect.</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t be willing when the time comes. After all, right now the Tang Sect has only just started out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s face revealed a rare smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong about that. You might not know the influence you have on the hearts of the students right now. After the few times you\u2019ve displayed your strength, right now you\u2019re practically an idol to the students in the Academy. When they hear they have a chance to become part of a sect established by you, practically every student in the Academy will sign up. The graduation exam is in half a month. At the same time there will be a test for them. When the time comes I will pick out a group of students with good strength and morals and send them to you. Young Spirit Masters are impulsive and hot-blooded. I believe you won\u2019t let them down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the faint smile on Grandmaster\u2019s face, Tang San\u2019s heart warmed. His Teacher had already prepared to help him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thanks. You are my only disciple, I only wish for you to be even more outstanding. Reach Title Douluo soon, and let me see the true might of twin spirits, that is the best gratitude you can show me. I\u2019m carefully researching your present circumstances. Among all Spirit Masters, you can be considered the most special case. Possessing a hundred thousand year spirit ring and four spirit bones at sixtieth rank. Also twin spirits. For your future development direction and your own circumstances, I\u2019ve made some simple assessments regarding spirit power development and all kinds of attributes.</p><br/><p>Speaking of spirits, Grandmaster\u2019s mind clearly grew stimulated,</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greatest drawback of twin spirits is that the attribute upgrade from a quantity of spirit rings surpassing that of ordinary Spirit Masters will be too much for the body to handle. I once spoke to you about this issue for the Spirit Master world. Spirit Masters are human, and each person have their own endurance limits. The higher this limit is, the more attribute advancement they can endure. Of course, this also has an important relationship with the spirit rings and spirit bones obtained.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Hall\u2019s current Supreme Pontiff Bibi Dong also possesses twin spirits. Even if I don\u2019t know how strong she is now, I\u2019m certain she will inevitably already be cultivating both spirits simultaneously. With her position in Spirit Hall, the added attributes from each of her spirit rings naturally won\u2019t be lacking. But she still hasn\u2019t reached her limit. I\u2019ve always reflected on this problem over these years, why hasn\u2019t Bibi Dong\u2019s added attributes reached the limit? Her own attributes evolving is unrelated to any outside assistance. That goes even more for the body\u2019s ability to withstand it. In other words, she definitely uses some method to share her the burden of her excessively advanced attributes. Thinking on it from this point of view, I found some small clues. But I\u2019ve never dared be certain. Only last time when I heard you speak of your spirit bones forming an armor could I be more or less confident in my estimate. If I\u2019m not mistaken, if you could possess a perfect configuration of spirit bones, you would immediately form that special spirit bone armor. And such an armor in itself will cause a certain variation. Not only can it protect the body, it will also cause the Spirit Master\u2019s own endurance to rise dramatically.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the same time, I\u2019ve also carefully researched your present condition. You\u2019re different from Bibi Dong. Your body can be said to have passed a thousand hammer blows, and a hundred refinements. Especially those immortal treasure herbs you took caused enormous changes to your body. For the present you, your physical endurance far surpasses that of ordinary people. Consequently, I believe that after your Blue Silver Emperor is cultivated to the Title Douluo level, even if you continue absorbing with the Clear Sky Hammer spirit, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems at least within four spirit rings. And at that time, I hope you can already possess a full set of spirit bones. Then we can examine my hypothesis. If my conjecture is correct, then, you will very possibly become a twin spirit dual Douluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San listened carefully to Grandmaster, only speaking up once Grandmaster finished his account:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, then isn\u2019t the Supreme Pontiff already a twin spirit dual Douluo now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster shook his head, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Even if Bibi Dong is a genius, at the same time she is also a perfectionist. If I\u2019m not mistaken, right now she should only be a single Title Douluo. Even I don\u2019t know what her second spirit is, but from her actions against Xiao Wu, she clearly hasn\u2019t gathered all spirit rings for her second spirit yet. She is inevitably hoping to have even more powerful spirit rings to absorb. Of course, I can also be sure that, right now, she is absolutely the most powerful Supreme Pontiff in the history of Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s impression of Bibi Dong had always been that appearance when the Shrek Seven Devils participated in the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament. When his father appeared that time, Bibi Dong didn\u2019t display much power. It felt as if her strength wasn\u2019t very different from Chrysanthemum Douluo and Ghost Douluo.</p><br/><p>Seeing the expression of deep thought in Tang San\u2019s eyes, Grandmaster lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you must remember what I say. You cannot for any reason underestimate Bibi Dong. Not even if you become a twin spirit dual Douluo in the future. I\u2019m relatively familiar with Bibi Dong\u2019s character. She\u2019s not only someone who will do anything to achieve her goals, she\u2019s also an extremely patient power. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be the Supreme Pontiff right now. Even I didn\u2019t know she actually had twin spirits before she succeeded as Supreme Pontiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the master and disciple pair were discussing twin spirits, suddenly, an impatient voice came from outside,</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the little freak returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Tang San back? I don\u2019t know! If he is, he should be with Flender.\u201d</p><br/><p>The replying voice belonged to Liu Erlong.</p><br/><p>The office door opened, but before Liu Erlong could come inside, the Shrek Academy honorary dean, poison title Dugu Bo had already charged in like a whirlwind. With one look at Tang San, he immediately exulted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle freak, I heard that Ning family girl say you were back. I came to find you immediately. Quickly come with me, there\u2019s big trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, he directly pulled Tang San from the sofa, alarming Xiao Wu next to him who immediately tightly grabbed onto Tang San\u2019s arm and hiding behind him.</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo also looked distracted on noticing Xiao Wu, but he clearly had even more important things on his mind,</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, quickly. You brat, you\u2019ve been gone for so long. If you were even a bit later, I\u2019m afraid there would\u2019ve been major trouble. I can only count on you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Xiao Wu alarmed, Tang San couldn\u2019t help frowning a bit,</p><br/><p>\u201cOld freak, don\u2019t be anxious, no matter how urgent it is it can still wait a while. Is it that emperor Xue Ye\u2019s poison has resurged?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo stared blankly,</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled wryly:</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides poison, what else would you need my help for? Dean Flender mentioned you were looking for me, so I guessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dugu Bo looked at Grandmaster and Flender, revealing an extremely serious expression,</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, this time really is troublesome. Emperor Xue Ye is on the verge of death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides the soulless Xiao Wu, everyone in Flender\u2019s office cried out simultaneously. Everyone were shocked by this sudden news.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

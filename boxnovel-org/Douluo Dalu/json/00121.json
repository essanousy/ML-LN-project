Known as the most formidable leader in the history of Spirit Hall. In your present condition, you\u2019re in no way suited to oppose them from the front. Yielding isn\u2019t shirking, you\u2019re still young, even if you want to confront Spirit Hall, there will still be time later. Is there a need to be so stubborn this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San\u2019s brows tightened. After thinking deeply for a moment, he still shook his head,</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I have to participate in this competition. Uncle Ning, I understand your meaning, but I think this is also an important tempering in my life. If I can crash my way through, then when Spirit Hall wants to deal with me again in the future, it will also be severely difficult. It\u2019s impossible for them to always hide the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the radiance in Tang San\u2019s eyes, Ning Fengzhi couldn\u2019t help recalling the appearance of his father in his youth. Their expressions were so similar. Even though Ning Fengzhi and Tang Hao weren\u2019t very familiar in those days and they weren\u2019t far apart in age, the feeling Tang Hao gave him was always like looking up at a tall mountain. Among the people of his generation, no one could compare to Tang Hao. Right now Tang Hao\u2019s son had apparently duplicated this marvel, to the extent that he was even more outstanding than his father. \u2018Clear Sky School, don\u2019t tell me your genes really are that good?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, since you\u2019ve already decided, there\u2019s no need for me to say more. Uncle will guarantee your safety as far as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words were very flat, but as the master of a school, this was already equivalent to him giving Tang San a pledge.</p><br/><p>Tang San sensed that Ning Fengzhi\u2019s words right now weren\u2019t out of pragmatism, or an attempt to rope him in. It was entirely the concern of an elder for a junior.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ning, I might not be able to enter Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School, but as long as I still live, Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School will forever be my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Spirit City.</p><br/><p>A plain clothed Grandmaster entered the city after passing the Spirit Master inspection. At his age, thirty something ranked strength naturally wouldn\u2019t arouse any attention.</p><br/><p>Without resting a bit, without even catching his breath a moment, Grandmaster came straight to the highest governing body of Spirit City. Supreme Pontiff Palace.</p><br/><p>In front of Supreme Pontiff Palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two silver armored palace guard knights barred Grandmaster\u2019s path, altogether a hundred palace guard knights raised the longswords in their hands,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a restricted area. Approach one more step, and you will be killed without question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing more than a hundred palace guard knights with strength clearly above his, Grandmaster\u2019s expression was still as apathetic as always. Raising his hand, he suddenly revealed his warrant tile.</p><br/><p>The palace guard in the lead quickly stepped forward, when he saw the six insignia on the warrant tile, he couldn\u2019t keep from shivering. With a putong sound, he knelt on one knee,</p><br/><p>\u201cMy respect, elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hundred palace guards uniformly made the same motion. Contrasted by them, the originally ordinary Grandmaster seemed a lot less ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring me to the Supreme Pontiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster used the simplest possible words to inform them of his purpose.</p><br/><p>After an hour, in the official business hall of the Supreme Pontiff Palace, Grandmaster quietly sipped top quality fragrant tea, quietly waiting.</p><br/><p>Right now he was the only person in the more than a thousand square meter official hall.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze was all along focused on the fragrant tea in his hand, without so much as a glance at all the gold and jade splendor around him, he just waited quietly.</p><br/><p>The three meter high arched doors opened, and a soft voice echoed from outside,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wait outside. Without my order, nobody is allowed inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze finally shifted from the tea, turning in the direction of the great doors of the official hall.</p><br/><p>The door opened, and a woman walked in from outside.</p><br/><p>Not tall, dressed in black gilt-lined luxurious robes, wearing a nine tipped purple gold crown, a more than two meter long scepter in her hand, inlaid with countless precious stones. Fair skin and close to perfect complexion made her stand out from the masses.</p><br/><p>She especially revealed an intangible noble sacredness, making people even more inclined to kneel and pay their respects.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sat, and after entering the room, that woman also halted. The two peoples\u2019 gazes collided in the air like that. There were no sparks. Grandmaster\u2019s gaze held a lot of things. There was apology, memories, and even more of disappointment.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s gaze instantly had a complex change. Even though she only looked thirty or so, in fact, she was even a year older than Grandmaster, her age long since past fifty. The scepter in her hand struck the floor, issuing an echoing ding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle and pleasant voice very easily gave people a feeling of bathing in the spring wind.</p><br/><p>But Grandmaster\u2019s gaze instead became astringent, pushing on the table in front of him with both hands to stand, turning to that woman,</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I came. Are you well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s face displayed a slight smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cWith ten thousand subordinates, how would I be unwell? As the ruler of Spirit Hall, even the monarchs of the two great empires would have to show me some degree of courtesy. Where do you think I would be unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cBibi Dong[1], I know the pain in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBibi Dong? If you didn\u2019t say it, I would almost have forgotten this name. Please call me Supreme Pontiff, or Your Eminence. It\u2019s been long since I was that foolish Bibi Dong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, this seemingly gentle and beautiful woman before him was the current highest ruler of Spirit Hall, the target of pilgrimage for all Spirit Masters, the Supreme Pontiff.</p><br/><p>She was the youngest Supreme Pontiff in the history of Spirit Hall, taking the seat before forty.</p><br/><p>There were initially a lot of doubters, but as time passed, under her governance, Spirit Hall\u2019s development was even faster and more violent, and also even more unified. A lot of people already believed she was the most outstanding Supreme Pontiff Spirit Hall ever had.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Eminence Supreme Pontiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s pupils contracted somewhat, a trace of pain trickling through his eyes. He turned, walking over and standing where he sat before, hands clasping the fragrant tea, seemingly falling into old memories.</p><br/><p>Watching Grandmaster\u2019s back, the indifference in the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s eyes faded away, a somewhat unable to endure mood flashing. Raising her feet, she seemed about to step forward, but in the end held back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you come to find me for? It\u2019s already been twenty years since we last met.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff\u2019s voice still sounded so serene.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster drew a deep breath, suppressing his raging heart. Even he hadn\u2019t expected him to lose control like this on seeing Bibi Dong again.</p><br/><p>As he turned around, the mood in his eyes had completely disappeared, leaving only the usual apathy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Eminence Supreme Pontiff, I came to make a request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff looked at Grandmaster with some astonishment,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would come to request something of me? That doesn\u2019t seem like you. It seems time really will change a man. Speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster didn\u2019t explain. If it was only for himself, he would never come to make a request from the other person, but, for the disciple he thought of as a son, he had no choice but to make the trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Eminence, I want to know, how did you pass the crisis of twin spirits at that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff\u2019s eyes contracted a moment, and she calmly said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know. What\u2019s the significance of this to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster didn\u2019t hide it,</p><br/><p>\u201cI accepted a disciple, he has followed me to cultivate for seven or eight years. By luck, he possess twin spirits like you. This child is prodigiously talented, and I hope to foster him into a power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I help you? Let you cultivate a power to go against me later?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff\u2019s voice suddenly became chilly.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster lowered his voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. If you agree to tell me how you did it, I can guarantee you that my disciple will never oppose Spirit Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s mouth displayed a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, it\u2019s also this matter that not even this Grandmaster of theory knows. Yu Xiao Gang, You\u2019ve come too late. Several days ago I already dispatched people to rob and kill along the route the Heaven Dou Empire participating teams must travel. Their target, is that Clear Sky School disciple of yours. Therefore, there\u2019s also no need for you to know the secret of twin spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster trembled violently, turning back fiercely, staring at the Supreme Pontiff,</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff didn\u2019t hide it, and indifferently said:</p><br/><p>\u201cPlatinum bishop Salas sent word that a Clear Sky School child appeared, prodigiously talented. Already breaking through fortieth rank at such a young age, twin spirits, possessing a ten thousand year level fourth spirit ring. Even possibly possessing spirit bones. Close to Seven Treasure Glazed Tile School and Heaven Dou Empire. My Spirit Hall can\u2019t use such a person, but can only be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster stepped forward sharply, both hands fiercely grabbing the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s shoulders, his eyes instantly covered with blood, his whole body trembling violently.</p><br/><p>Seeing Grandmaster\u2019s eyes brimming with hatred, Bibi Dong went blank a moment,</p><br/><p>\u201cTo you, is he really so important?\u201d</p><br/><p>With her strength, she could naturally turn away Grandmaster, but she didn\u2019t do it, only letting his scorching hot hands hold onto her shoulders.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s breath became ragged, speaking word by word:</p><br/><p>\u201cBibi Dong, hear me clearly. If anything happens to Tang San, then I will spare no cost to destroy Spirit hall. In my life I have had no children, but he is like my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 2 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>Feeling Grandmaster\u2019s breath, the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s face flushed a bit, her breath somewhat urgent saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Xiao Gang, do you still have the time to worry? Back then, do you remember how you left me? For your own little sister, ridiculous, truly too ridiculous. You actually refused me for your own little sister. That I became Supreme Pontiff is admittedly thanks to you, but, I hate you. In all my life, you are the person I hate the most. I want you to suffer, I will not only kill your apprentice, I\u2019ll still kill Liu Erlong. No, I won\u2019t kill her, I\u2019ll torture her to make you suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff had clearly become agitated, her eyes with the ice chill of a viper.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, there was suddenly a light knock from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, didn\u2019t I say that nobody was to disturb me without my order?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff snarled.</p><br/><p>The person outside apparently hadn\u2019t expected the seemingly amiable and approachable Supreme Pontiff to be in such a temper,</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Eminence, the two elders have sent back news. They didn\u2019t accomplish the mission, and are waiting for your instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t accomplish the mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff\u2019s complexion changed, looking fiercely at Grandmaster,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems your apprentice is rather lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster stared blankly a moment, the red in his eyes gradually receding. He released his grip on the Supreme Pontiff\u2019s shoulders, and as he calmed down, he said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat you sent people to kill Tang San is perhaps not only because of his talent. With Spirit Hall\u2019s power, how would you fear one Spirit Master? If my guess is correct, you did it because of his father, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff\u2019s gaze froze,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still so clever. Leave. I don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded silently, walking towards the big doors. As he gripped the handle on the door, he suddenly halted, faintly saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty years, Bibi Dong. You\u2019re still so beautiful, but I\u2019m already old. If the one whose life was threatened today was you, I would still react the same. After all, you are my first love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff suddenly trembled,</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you still love? You\u2019re not fit to speak the word. Would you still leave me if you loved me? Preferring to be together with your little sister? You bastard, get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for why I left you back then, you shouldn\u2019t ask me, you should go ask the dead Supreme Pontiff. You always described me as fickle and cold. I\u2019ll follow your meaning. What I said before, if Tang San dies at the hands of Spirit Hall\u2019s people. Then. I will spare no price to retaliate. Bibi Dong, this is that last time I call you like this. You sent people to act against Tang San, our mutual relationship is hereby over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fiercely pulling open the door, Grandmaster left in large strides.</p><br/><p>Supreme Pontiff Bibi Dong swayed, seemingly unable to lean on the scepter, she fell to the floor.</p><br/><p>She hated Grandmaster, had hated him for twenty whole years. Being able to maintain such deep hatred for so long, meant that her love for him back then had been so profound. Grandmaster\u2019s words before leaving had suddenly made a small crack appear in her hatred.</p><br/><p>Recalling all the instruction of the last Supreme Pontiff as well as all kinds of matters in the past, the truth that had been obscured by hatred gradually appeared before her.</p><br/><p>Everything before her eyes gradually became hazy, her hands already turning white from the force with which she gripped the scepter,</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this fate toying with humans? Xiao Gang, the feelings between us. The feelings between us\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Supreme Pontiff suddenly ran over to where Grandmaster was sitting before, clasping that abundantly warm fragrant tea, swallowing big mouthfuls.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Heaven Dou Empire\u2019s competing Spirit Master teams continued onward, and for the rest of the journey, there were no more mishaps. In order to protect these Spirit Masters, crown prince Xue Qinghe requisition three thousand armored troops to supplement the guard from towns they passed. At the same time he also called for some Spirit Master experts from the capital.</p><br/><p>Xue Qinghe didn\u2019t interact more with Tang San. He was also very clear on what trouble Tang San was in, and at such a time, he used action to gain Tang San\u2019s favorable impression.</p><br/><p>On the way, the mood in the Shrek Academy team appeared somewhat oppressive. The only good news was that Xiao Wu had finally broken through to the fortieth rank, five days away from Spirit City. In order to let her possess a fourth spirit ring as soon as possible, Liu Erlong brought her directly to search for a spirit beast that suited her, to meet up with the others in Spirit City.</p><br/><p>At last, the whole procession reached Spirit City. Because of the special provisions of Spirit City, Xue Qinghe ordered the armored troops and imperial knights regiment to standby outside the city, and led the fifteen Spirit Master teams into Spirit City.</p><br/><p>Compared to enormous cities like Heaven Dou City and Suotuo City, Spirit City was a lot smaller. It didn\u2019t even cover a tenth of the area Heaven Dou City did. However, it was still plenty shocking to Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Despite the small area, Spirit City\u2019s walls were still absolutely constructed to the standard of any capital city. The more than eighty meter high city walls appeared extremely majestic from the outside, and they were also more than thirty meters thick, built completely out of granite.</p><br/><p>Even the wealthy Ning Fengzhi couldn\u2019t help sighing in admiration on seeing the walls.</p><br/><p>In fact, Spirit City was built entirely by Spirit Hall. Wouldn\u2019t building a city like this be easier said than done?</p><br/><p>Most unusual was that Spirit City wasn\u2019t as square as other cities, but rather hexagonal. In other words, its city walls had altogether six faces. The ones in charge of patrolling the city walls were all Spirit Masters, all wearing the special clothing of Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>Each of the six walls had an enormous sculpture, identical to Spirit Hall\u2019s warrant tiles, symbolizing six formidable spirits.</p><br/><p>Entering Spirit City gave people a spacious impression. There weren\u2019t a lot of people on the streets, and very few shops. The business of these shops were mainly in the goods needed by Spirit Masters. Even storage type spirit tools were for sale. Of course, the quality was a bit lacking.</p><br/><p>They were met in Spirit City by a cardinal, and under his guidance, space was very quickly found for the more than two hundred people, staying in a hotel on the west side of Spirit City. Shocking Tang San was that even the hotel staff were Spirit Grandmasters with more than twentieth ranked spirit power.</p><br/><p>After settling in, Tang San specially moved away from the hotel, carefully observing the other areas of Spirit City outside.</p><br/><p>He discovered that the hexagonal Spirit City was actually built around a hill. On this hill were two extraordinarily striking buildings. The building halfway up the hill was the most magnificent, clearly visible even from a long distance away.</p><br/><p>It was a building of pillars with a domed roof; the outside of the building made of golden material, glittering in the sunlight. By simply asking, Tang San found out that it was the newly constructed Supreme Pontiff Palace. The residence of the most senior ruler of Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>From Ning Fengzhi he had also learned that even deeper inside, Spirit Hall\u2019s Elder Palace was also located in Supreme Pontiff Palace. Of course, it was impossible for ordinary people to see those elders.</p><br/><p>The other building at the peak of the hill was a lot smaller than Supreme Pontiff Hall, approximately only a third of the size. It\u2019s architecture was somewhat similar, only its walls were white like jade, far from as eye catching as Supreme Pontiff Palace.</p><br/><p>For some reason, as Tang San looked at that palatial building, inwardly he sensed even greater depths.</p><br/><p>Ever since entering Spirit City, every Spirit Master had a kind of special feeling, apparently a somewhat pious mood in their hearts. Ning Fengzhi told Tang San that the seemingly much smaller building was the highest existence in Spirit Hall, Douluo Palace.</p><br/><p>Only dead Title Douluo could stay in that place. It could also be called the tomb of Title Douluo. The reason this place had such a devout atmosphere wasn\u2019t because of Supreme Pontiff Palace, but rather because of Douluo Palace.</p><br/><p>No matter where Supreme Pontiff Palace was established, Douluo Palace would follow, and moreover the position of Douluo Palace would always be even higher than Supreme Pontiff Palace. At times of great rites, the Supreme Pontiff would personally go to offer sacrifice before the doors of Douluo Palace, but even he didn\u2019t have the right to enter before death. These were the rules, and nobody could break them. Otherwise he would suffer the anger of all Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because of the existence of Supreme Pontiff Palace and Douluo Palace that Spirit City came to be known as the holy land of Spirit Masters after its founding. Of course, this was also publicly accepted by the majority of Spirit Masters.</p><br/><p>Because of the attack halfway and Tang San\u2019s persistence in staying in the competition, Flender and Liu Erlong both stayed in places closest to him, even Ning Fengzhi specially chose a place to stay not far away. Even though it was least probable that anything would happen in Spirit City, they still had no choice but to guard against it.</p><br/><p>According to the information from Spirit Hall, the competition would officially begin in three days. The journey was wearying, but these three days of rest were sufficient for the academies to adjust.</p><br/><p>Star Luo Empire\u2019s participating academies were arranged to rest on the other side of Spirit City. Imperceptibly, Spirit Hall had already split the participating teams of the two great empires into two camps.</p><br/><p>Regarding this, Xue Qinghe only smiled coldly in reply, but didn\u2019t raise any objections.</p><br/><p>The Shrek Academy group all kept resting for three days, spending all their time in meditation to cultivate spirit power, to maintain their peak condition as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong and Xiao Wu, finally returned the day before the start of the finals.</p><br/><p>Part 3 (TL by Bagelson)</p><br/><p>For some reason, Liu Erlong\u2019s expression was somewhat monstrous. Xiao Wu successfully obtained her fourth spirit ring, but according to Liu Erlong, she was separated from Xiao Wu at the time.</p><br/><p>And Xiao Wu herself said that she encountered an injured spirit beast, and by good fortune, obtained this spirit ring.</p><br/><p>The finals were just about to begin, and at this moment, nobody would wonder about this matter.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Wu returned, Tang San asked about her fourth spirit ability in order to begin combining it into the final tactics, but at this moment, Grandmaster finally returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San, you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first thing Grandmaster said on seeing Tang San.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you knew? I\u2019m alright. This time it\u2019s thanks to the old freak and uncle Ning\u2019s people, otherwise I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t have seen me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster sighed,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have let you participate in the tournament. You\u2019ve drawn their attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San smiled slightly, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, there\u2019s no need to blame yourself? I\u2019m still alright, it can even be considered an unconventional experience. Only by experiencing a confrontation with true powers do I understand how insignificant my own strength is. Afterwards I will redouble my efforts in cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s face finally revealed a smile,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been so sensible. You\u2019re right, make great efforts in cultivation. As long as I still draw breath, I won\u2019t let people harm you. The finals are on the verge of starting tomorrow. Call everyone over, I\u2019ll give you some simple tactics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having reached the finals, Grandmaster finally acted.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Tang San called all the team members over. Liu Erlong learned that Grandmaster had returned, and also hastily followed.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster and Liu Erlong\u2019s gazes met, and Liu Erlong read something in Grandmaster\u2019s eyes. She didn\u2019t speak and only quietly walked over to his side, holding his arm.</p><br/><p>Seeing Liu Erlong\u2019s tender appearance, the Shrek Seven Devils and others all couldn\u2019t help having somewhat strange expressions. The tyrant dragon would perhaps only restrain herself like this in front of Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze swept across everyone, then said:</p><br/><p>\u201cThe finals are about to begin. I think you might have already forgotten what I said about the competition format before. I\u2019ll repeat it once. The finals have altogether thirty three teams participating. Among them, the three seeded teams are separately selected from each of the two great empires and Spirit Hall. The greatest threat to you is no doubt the team sent by Spirit Hall. They are also the greatest hurdle for you to obtain the final victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are altogether five rounds in the finals. Somewhat shorter than the time used for the qualifiers and ranking competition, but because of the intensity of the competition, there\u2019s a day of rest and revision between each round. Before the final and fifth round, there are even three days of rest. In the first round, the three seeded teams will sit out, and the remaining thirty teams will fight for fifteen advancement placements, the losers being directly eliminated. The ruthless knock out competition is bound to make every Spirit Master team put their lives on the line even more. You definitely cannot have the slightest carelessness. At this final hour, the hidden capabilities of all the teams will finally be unleashed, no longer holding anything back. Even the teams you\u2019ve already fought may very possibly give you a \u2018surprise\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the tournament rules, in the second round, the first ranked teams from the two great empires will sit out. In other words, after we\u2019ve obtained victory in the first round, there will be enough time to rest in the second round. This is also the significance behind the ranking competition. At that time, sixteen teams will fight it out for eight places in the third round. Further adding our two resting teams, there are altogether ten teams. In the third round it\u2019s the second ranked teams that sit out. The remaining eight teams fight for the four places to enter the fourth round together with them. In the fourth round no team sits out. Consequently, only the top two teams from the ranking competition can benefit in the finals. But the earlier you can sit out, the more favorable, because you can avert being eliminated prematurely. In the fifth and final round, there are only three teams entering. The three teams will first use the method from the ranking competition, seven team members conducting circulating elimination, to decide which team has the strongest members. Afterwards the two losing teams will fight a team match, the winner again challenging the winner from before, to decide who will be the final champions. Do you all understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had good memory, and now when it was truly time for the finals, their minds were naturally incomparably focused.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tell who our first opponent will be, but at least it won\u2019t be the three seeds. That will avert us encountering them prematurely. However, it will still be the Shrek Seven Devils going out. You haven\u2019t cooperated on the battlefield for a long time already. This first round will be a warmup for you. I won\u2019t provide you with any specific tactics, the ring is still under little San\u2019s control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle San.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San hurriedly stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster gazed at him, saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re practically sure to pass the first and second rounds. Therefore, let the opponents learn as little as possible about where our advantages lie in the first round. Do you understand my meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang San nodded:</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that even though it\u2019s us seven going up, we must still conceal our strength as much as possible in the first round.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled and nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you still can\u2019t be careless. After all, it\u2019s still possible for you to run into powers from Star Luo Empire in the first round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster\u2019s gaze turned to the Shrek Seven Devils as a whole,</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve studied under me for two years. I\u2019m very clear on how much effort you\u2019ve expended over these two years. There\u2019s no need to doubt, you\u2019re all geniuses among geniuses. Even if you encounter opponents more powerful than you, there\u2019s no need for your confidence to wane, because you are the youngest team among all the competitors. Your futures are boundless. I don\u2019t have any requirements that you take the championship, my only hope is that each of you can display your own true strength. Find the best method to rouse your own potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shrek Seven Devils agreed loudly.</p><br/><p>As Grandmaster and Liu Erlong left, the Shrek Seven Devils instantly started to cultivate, preparing for the first round of the competition tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong pulled Grandmaster straight to her room,</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Gang, how was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Grandmaster, Liu Erlong\u2019s gaze was somewhat evasive. She of course knew where Grandmaster had gone, and Grandmaster didn\u2019t keep anything from her.</p><br/><p>Sighing, Grandmaster said:</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changed. Without meeting for twenty years, people will always change. Now she\u2019s the Supreme Pontiff. No longer the Bibi Dong of those days. It seems I really shouldn\u2019t have gone to find her.\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint stab of pain in his heart made his expression turn somewhat sad.</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong inwardly loosed a breath,</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means, she didn\u2019t tell you the method to cultivate twin spirits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Grandmaster smiled ruefully,</p><br/><p>\u201cShe sent people to dispose of Tang San, fully aware that he\u2019s my disciple. How would she tell me the method to cultivate twin spirits? But so what? I\u2019ve already faintly guessed some things. With the chance, as long as Bibi Dong can be brought to truly show her hand, I can be certain of my ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, Grandmaster took the initiative to pull Liu Erlong into an embrace,</p><br/><p>\u201cErlong, this is Spirit City, it\u2019s her domain. From now on, you can\u2019t be far from my side no matter what, I\u2019m afraid it would be detrimental to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Erlong immediately displayed her proper temperament,</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her come, would I still fear her? So what if she\u2019s the Supreme Pontiff, she still hasn\u2019t beaten me. As long as she doesn\u2019t take you away, I won\u2019t fear anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Liu Erlong\u2019s overbearing speech, Grandmaster couldn\u2019t help showing a faint smile, lowering his head to lightly kiss her forehead,</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll never take me. We are husband and wife, even if only in name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Liu Erlong couldn\u2019t help revealing some grief. Even though Grandmaster no longer ran from her feelings, and the two treated each other like husband and wife, Grandmaster never agreed to be too intimate. That relationship of siblings always stretched between them. Fortunately, even though it was in name only, it was still enough to console Liu Erlong\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>For the Continental Advanced Spirit Master Academy Elite Tournament finals, Spirit City had specially opened up a specific area. This area was in the heart of Spirit City. The enormous stage was more than a hundred meters across, made completely out of granite.</p><br/><p>This enormous stage was still reinforced with an enormous amount of spirit tools to prevent damage. According to Spirit Hall\u2019s information, this ring could take any attack from Spirit Masters under the Spirit Emperor level without taking damage.</p><br/><p>Only an organization as rich and imposing as Spirit Hall could do something like this, at least the two great empires would hate to part with such enormous resources.</p><br/><p>In front of this stage was Supreme Pontiff Palace, the distance from here to the hill where the Palace was located was less than a kilometer. Spirit Hall had already announced that the finals between the last three powers would take place just in front of Supreme Pontiff Palace.</p><br/><p>At that time, the Supreme Pontiff would appear personally to crown the final champions.</p><br/><p>To any Spirit Master, this was an incomparable glory.</p><br/><p>At first light, all the competing teams were led to the competition area by special guides from Spirit Hall. Each academy had their own rest area, constructed around the ring. On the opposite side of Supreme Pontiff Palace was the VIP judges\u2019 seating, where the people from the two great empires would observe the battles. Of course, there were still intermediaries from Spirit Hall.</p><br/><p>Just as they arrived, without pause, Flender was called up to draw lots.</p><br/><p>[1] () \u201cCompare East\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

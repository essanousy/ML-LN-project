Looking at this huge Susanoo, Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu continued to retreat backwards. After going through this battle just a moment ago, and in addition using several big moves, the energies inside of their bodies were already nearly exhausted, they didn\u2019t have any strength left to battle. Adelaide and Diaixinao, these two huge dragons, while they were trapped inside the trap of Ren Tianyou, they had exhausted quite a huge amount of their power to remove the impurity inside their body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201d Ren Tianyou waved the Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade), and send out a huge sword blade chop towards them. And this Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) sword blade chop advanced towards Ximen Shu in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one!\u201d Seeing that the huge sword blade chop was advancing towards Ximen Shu, Ximen Xinbo cried out in fear. Just when the Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade)\u2019s blade chop was about to hit Ximen Shu, a huge figure appeared in front of Ximen Shu, on the closer look this figure was actually Adelaide, who was using its huge dragon body to take on the powerful attack in the palace of Ximen Shu.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou saw that the blade of Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) had pierced through the huge dragon body of Adelaide, then suddenly a powerful red colored energy started to absorb the body of Adelaide, and following the blade of Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade), it would be sucked in inside the bottle gourd of Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade).</p><br/><p>\u201cAdelaide!\u201d Seeing that Adelaide had used its body to block the attack for him, Ximen Shu immediately yelled in utter grief and indignation. And both Ximen Xinbo and Diaixinao couldn\u2019t believe what they saw with their own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are so eager to die, I\u2019ll help you achieve your aim. I have heard that the dragon is covered with precious treasures from head to toe, I will accept this gift. And I will also spare you from the endless pain of Illusion world.\u201d Looking at that huge dragon Adelaide who had taken the attack in place of Ximen Shu, the blood red colored eyes of Ren Tainyou which hidden inside the mask flashed. Shortly afterwards Ren Tianyou who was prepared to immediately suck in that huge dragon body of Adelaide thought something, and the blade of Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) flashed. Then the huge suction power of Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) stopped for an instant, and in that instant the Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) cut off the dragon head of Adelaide.</p><br/><p>After the dragon head was cut off, that unceasingly struggling body of Adelaide completely stopped moving instantly. Then from the cut off neck of the dragon and the huge dragon mouth of the cut off head, huge amount of dragon blood poured out, painting the ground around them completely red.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tainyou failed to notice, with the death of Adelaide, an invisible soul energy suddenly appeared from the headless Dragon corpse and entered his body.</p><br/><p>The whole body of Ximen Shu was covered with the dragon blood of Adelaide, and along with that burning hot blood on his body, his brain finally perceive the current appearance of Adelaide, and his facial expression became lifeless, and then that expression gradually changed into a hideous expression. When he had just reached Saint-rank, he was given a chance to enter Dragon Island, there he had signed the contract with this golden dragon Adelaide and from then on Adelaide became his battle partner. Now he had already reached God-rank from Saint-rank, and till now he and Adelaide were already together for more than 30 years. And he had already regarded Adelaide as his most important partner, but now because of himself, Adelaide died, so why won\u2019t he feel extremely grieved.</p><br/><p>Ximen Shu started Ren Tianyou with his eyes full of hatred, \u201cYou bastard, you actually killed Adelaide, I\u2019ll fight you to death.\u201d After finished talking, he was about to rush towards Ren Tianyou, but Ximen Xinbo used his remaining right hand to held him back to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber two, why are you stopping me, quickly let me go, I must kill this bastard, and take revenge for Adelaide.\u201d Ximen Shu turned around his head towards Ximen Xinbo and roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one, clam down a bit!\u201d Ximen Xinbo gravely said to Ximen Shu, \u201cIf you rush to him in current circumstance, you are just courting death. Forget about taking revenge for Adelaide, instead you will also lose your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ximen Xinbo, Ximen Shu roared, \u201cThen what should I do? Don\u2019t tell me I cannot take revenge on this enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think the people of THAT place will let him off after he killed Adelaide? At that time, someone will naturally take revenge, even if his strength is extremely high, he won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d At this time, Ximen Xinbo didn\u2019t want to think much about taking revenge, because he knew that when the moment comes \u2018THOSE people\u2019 would take revenge for Adelaide, because from past to till now there was not a single person who had the ability to survive after they had killed a dragon. \u201cAnd also right now the most important thing for us, is to return back these younger generation to clan. They are the future hope of our Ximen clan. We absolutely cannot let them fall here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ximen Xinbo, Ximen Shu gradually settled down, \u201cYes, when the moment comes, naturally someone will avenge his death. Even though Divine wind continent is big, there absolutely will not be any place for him to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, in this case we should act quickly. Let\u2019s use that move.\u201d Ximen Shu eyes flashed with determination and both of them looked at the eyes of each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDiaixinao, you better leave this place, and return back to Dragon Island. You should not pointlessly waste your life in this insignificant fight.\u201d Ximen Xinbo said to Diaixinbo.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this way you will\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Diaixinao looked towards Ximen Xinbo and said, because it already could guess what would happen if it left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do not have time. I have already live for more than 30 years, it is already long enough. Only it\u2019s a pity that from now on I can\u2019t fight side by side with you again, and can no longer see my descendants.\u201d Ximen Xinbo said with a voice filled with sorrow, then looked towards Diaixinao and said, \u201cYou should go away, quickly use the power of contract, even that guy won\u2019t be able to stop you from leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of you, take care of yourself.\u201d Looking at its partner whom it had fought side by side for several tens of years, a reluctant to leave emotion flashed in the eyes of Diaixinao. Afterwards along with a boundless white color light beam, using the power of contract it returned back to Dragon Island.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Looking at the disappearing Frost dragon, Ren Tianyou was surprised, and secretly thought this was bad, after all he had killed a dragon, and if the other dragons knew about this, then this would not be a simple laughable matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately I have worn a mask as a precaution to hide my identity, and also changed my voice. I think they wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize me when that moment comes.\u201d Ren Tianyou rejoiced a bit when he thought this, but he didn\u2019t know that when he killed Adelaide, he had already invited a huge trouble for himself, and from here on he would fall into a very difficult position. But that is a part of story that is to come.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all, come over here.\u201d Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu spoke towards those 5 Saint-ranked bodyguards of younger generation, \u201cYou 5 use 5 dragon suppression domain formation, and release \u2018wall of sigh\u2019 and try to stall for time as long as possible. As for your family members, we Ximen clan will properly look after them in your place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing 5 dragon suppression domain formation, those 5 saint-ranked bodyguards suddenly trembled. And their eyes flashed with the emotion of reluctant to part with their family members, because anyone who use this 5 dragon suppression domain formation, they would certainly die.</p><br/><p>5 dragon suppression domain formation, this formation was high level battle formation handed down in Ximen clan. This formation requires 5 people with at least the power level of peak-swordmaster to use. Once this battle formation is activated, it absorbs all the life-force of the users, and the users of this formation could sustain for at most 5 minutes until all their life force are completely absorbed.</p><br/><p>And this 5 dragon suppression domain formation altogether have 5 layers, one of its layer is \u2018Wall of sigh\u2019. Wall of sigh, as its name suggest, even if god face this, all he could do is heave a sigh aloud, as he would be powerless to do anything else. Although this wall of sigh formation is not as exaggerated as this, nevertheless it truly is a godly skill. This wall of sigh could bring out extremely powerful defense power which far surpass the defense level of users, it could actually surpass the rank of the user in defense power. In another words, if the actual power of user is only Saint ranked, then using this wall of sigh formation, even god ranked experts should exert their full power to break through their defense. And if 5 Saint ranked experts use this wall of sigh formation, then at least 5 god-ranked experts are required to break through their defense. The time limit of using this \u2018Wall of sigh\u2019 is at most 5 minute, and after 5 minute this formation would completely absorb the life force of user.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This 5 body guards didn\u2019t hesitated any longer, and replied in unison. These guys and other similar bodyguards were orphan children with high talent that was bought as a slave cultivator by Ximen clan. From childhood they were brainwashed to protect Ximen clan, they were molded in such a way that they would die for Ximen clan, i.e. on the earth these types of soldiers were known as dead soldier. So all 5 of them didn\u2019t contradicted the order of Ximen Xinbo.</p><br/><p>After that these 5 Saint ranked body guards moved instantly, and formed a special circular formation and surrounded the member of Ximen clan including Ximen Shu and others. Then all 5 of them bit their right hand, and releasing a huge amount of battle qi, they quickly wrote a huge blood words. After these 5 huge blood words appeared in the sky, the powerful battle qi mixed with a peculiar power of life force appeared around them. Upon careful look, these 5 words were \u20185\u2019, \u2018dragon\u2019, \u2018suppression\u2019, \u2018domain\u2019 and \u2018formation\u2019. These 5 words.</p><br/><p>\u201c5 dragon suppression domain formation, first layer\u2014\u2014\u2013wall of sigh, open!\u201d These 5 Saint-ranked experts roared simultaneously. Then 5 huge blood pillar suddenly rose from the body of these 5 individuals, then gradually spread and these 5 blood pillars combined, and changed into a huge blood colored light which covered all the members of Ximen clan. And on the top of this light the 5 words \u20185\u2019, \u2018dragon\u2019, \u2018supression\u2019, \u2018domain\u2019 and \u2018formation\u2019 were drifting away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

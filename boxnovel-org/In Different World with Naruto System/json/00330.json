And that moon in the world of Naruto world was created by Sage of Six Path using Chibaku Tensei to seal the body of Ten Tailed Beast.</p><br/><p>Ningendo (Human Path): can read the memory and thoughts of other people, then extract the soul of other people, usually used to gather intelligence. Also can withstand powerful taijutsu, as once was able to block the attack under Sage Mode with one hand.</p><br/><p>Shurado (Asura Path): like cyborg, have weapons within the body: body will become machinery, can carry a large number of weapons within the body, body will have three heads and six arms, and waist will have a blade-like tail.</p><br/><p>Chikushodo (Animal Path): basically can only use Summoning Jutsu. Summoning beasts: can summon a large number of different summoning beasts. Also can summon other Pains. Zofuku Kuchiyose no Jutsu (Self Replication Summoning Jutsu) (B): summons a dog like summoning beast, which can split apart, when struck.</p><br/><p>Gakido (Preta Path): can absorb any jutsu of any attribute attack and any chakra (including Senjutsu Chakra). Devour: absorbs chakra attack of any attribute. Fujutsu Kyuin (Jutsu Absorption): after the opponent is caught, their chakra is forcibly absorbed.</p><br/><p>Jigokudo (Naraka Path): can summon Yama, the King of Hell, and repair the corpses, but it seems it needs to absorb human\u2019s soul as a price. Judgment: After catching hold of the opponent\u2019s throat, summon Yama, the King of Hell, then Yama, the King of Hell would make these opponents to lose their combat strength and consciousness. After that Yama, the King of Hell would consume their soul if they tell a lie. Simultaneously Yama, the King of Hell also has the ability to repair other destroyed Pain, for instance, after Shurado (Asura Path) was eaten up by Yama, the King of Hell, it was completely restored, possibly by injecting chakra and repairing the body. (Because Six Paths were dead body, there is no question about resurrection)</p><br/><p>And Gedo (Outer Path) controls over Rinne Tensei no Jutsu (Sa\u1e43sara of Heavenly Life Technique).</p><br/><p>But according to the guess of Ren Tianyou, the abilities of Rinnegan would be different according to the person\u2019s ability who awakened Rinnegan, and they would also awaken their unique dojutsu.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked at the Exchange System interface\u2019s Rinnegan exchange interface, and lightly said towards System, \u201cSystem, help me exchange Rinnegan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, exchanging Rinnegan requires 50 million system points, and it is fully deducted. Upgrading to Rinnegan, during this time, please close your eyes, if you open your eyes and any accidents occurs, then System will not be responsible for it.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the voice of the System resounded in the mind of Ren Tianyou. Shortly afterwards, huge power flowed towards his eyes from his mind.</p><br/><p>And after hearing System, Ren Tianyou who was sitting cross-legged on a rock closed his eyes. He already had experience of upgrading his Sharingan few times, so this time Ren Tianyou was able to withstand the pain he suffered while upgrading to Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>Time passed second after second, and roughly after three hours of time, the pain he was feeling disappeared, and was replaced by cool and refreshing sensation, making him feel like a flying immortal, and he wanted to sink in this feeling forever.</p><br/><p>Just then, the voice of System resounded inside his mind, \u201cExchanging Rinnegan complete. After deducting 50 million system points, now host has 24.3 million system points left.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the voice of System, Ren Tianyou slowly opened his eyes, and ripple pattern that spreads over the purple eyeball appeared. The instant these eyes appeared, the surrounding space seemed to be on the verge of scattering under the power of these eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the power of Rinnegan?\u201d Feeling that boundless eye power in his eyes, Ren Tianyou thought aloud.</p><br/><p>After Rinnegan was awakened, Ren Tianyou clearly understood the difference between the power of Sharingan and Rinnegan, no, this was a qualitative difference. First no need to talk about the difference of dojutsu, merely eye power alone was already in different dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, finally I exchanged Rinnegan, now even if it is Yaorao herself, I\u2019ve enough strength to directly confront her in a battle.\u201d Ren Tianyou firmly clutched his right hand into fist, while shouting loudly within his heart.</p><br/><p>After awakening Rinnegan, Ren Tianyou looked towards the System\u2019s exchange interference, and discovered that above Rinnegan, there however was another higher layer to exchange, but this layer of exchange however was all question marks, even how much system points were required to exchange was unknown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this? Could it be that there is still a higher level dojutsu above Rinnegan?\u201d Seeing this, Ren Tianyou asked to System.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait until you became the host of Ten Tailed Beast, i.e. reach the level of Sage of Six Path, then you will know.\u201d The voice of System slowly resounded in the mind of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost of Ten Tailed Beast? That will not happen anytime soon.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly thought, then again recalled the circumstance of Nagato while using Rinnegan, \u201cSystem, using the power of Rinnegan, will I also became like Nagato? Do I have to use my life-force to use any large-scale dojutsu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will not happen, the reason why Nagato had such great side effects when he used Rinnegan is because his eyes in itself was transplanted to him by Uchiha Madara, and that doesn\u2019t count as his own eyes. Moreover this was only possible because Nagato was from Uzumaki clan, and possessed formidable life-force. If Rinnegan was transplanted to ordinary person, then that person would die at that instant.\u201d System slowly explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head in understanding. If using Rinnegan would leave him barely alive, then Rinnegan wouldn\u2019t be reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the \u201cThree Great Dojutsu\u201d.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou simply wanted test the power of Rinnegan, so standing up, he looked towards the boulder not far away, then stretching his right hand towards that rock, \u201cBansho Ten\u2019in! (Universal Pull!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou felt a mysterious power flashing through his Rinnegan, then along with the consumption of a little bit of eye power, that distant boulder suddenly floated and was pulled towards Ren Tianyou with a mysterious power. And as if arrow leaving the bowstring, it shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>And when this boulder was about to hit him, eye power flashed through his Rinnegan, \u201cShinra Tensei! (Almighty Push!)\u201d</p><br/><p>A \u2018peng\u2019 sound resounded. A powerful repulsion suddenly spread in all direction from Ren Tianyou, and that boulder was suddenly hit by this repulsion and scattered into debris in the midair and fell down to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, this Rinnegan is truly worthy of its reputation of the most exalted eye amongst the \u201cThree Great Dojutsu\u201d. Its power is really super powerful.\u201d Feeling the power of Rinnegan, Ren Tianyou thought aloud.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, the eyes of Ren Tianyou slowly began to change, slowly changing into Eternal Mangekyo form, \u201cKamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, he disappeared from that place along with the appearance of spiral shaped space ripple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ren Tianyou stood up, it was precisely him who had interrupted Ling Xiaotian just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know whether sire Zero has any objection to my plans and arrangements, if there is any good suggestion, then there is no harm in saying it directly.\u201d Ling Xiaotian looked at Ren Tianyou and said. With regarding to Ren Tianyou interrupting him, he was not angry at all. As a Clan Head, if he couldn\u2019t even tolerate this much, then he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay in that position for this long.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case, as a matter of fact, sire\u2019s plan is pretty good, but if you wish to make your plan really able to bring down the casualty of Divine Wind Continent to lowest point, then we need to make few additions and adjustments.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said. With regarding to these people who truly wanted to put their lives on the line to protect their homeland, he had a bit of respect in his heart, in addition, this Divine Wind Continent was the hometown of White Tiger and others, so Ren Tianyou naturally will not let Demon clan easily have their way.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing was, Demon World\u2019s Universe Boundary Divine Artifact\u2014-Purple Ling Dark Break was also in the hands of Yaorao. According to that mysterious virtual shadow attached in the body of Ling Weiwei, he must gather 3000 Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, and only with their strength, he would be able to break the limits of this universe, so sooner or later he has to fight a real battle with her. Since that was the case, then he must ensure that Divine Wind Continent didn\u2019t perish.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t know what might those be? Please elaborate, sire Zero.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou really had a suggestion, the eyes of this Ling Xiaotian couldn\u2019t help but lit up, and said with interest. With regarding to Ren Tianyou and his Akatsuki organization\u2019s action, he had also heard to some extent. Not long ago, when they were intending to notify Dragon clan to attend the gathering, they however discovered that Dragon Island had already sunk into the ocean, and disappeared. The entire Dragon clan were truly exterminated.</p><br/><p>At that time he used his blood lineage\u2019s secret skill and divined one word\u2014-Akatsuki! Thinking of the hatred of Ren Tianyou against Ximen clan and Dragon clan, Ling Xiaotian guessed that Akatsuki quietly exterminated the entire Dragon clan without the knowledge of anyone. This shocked and also made him curious with regarding to Akatsuki, this mysterious organization, so he decided to let Ren Tianyou led a large unit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I have been to Demon World before!\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said, endlessly shocking everyone present there. The pupils of everyone involuntarily shrunk, some were shocked to the extent of immediately standing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You have been to Demon World before? How is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is simply too hard to create the path between Demon World and Divine Wind Continent, so how did you reach there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Everyone present there said in disbelief. All of them were filled with shock hearing the words of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSire, are the words you have said just now truth?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, even Ling Xiaotian found it a little hard to believe, after all, the matter of breaking the space barrier between two realms, even God Lord realm expert would find very difficult to accomplish it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I have indeed been to Demon World, more than once.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head and unhurriedly said, \u201cFurthermore the most important is, there I discover secret weapon of Demon Clan to be used to deal with us Divine Wind Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret weapon? What is that?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, everyone present couldn\u2019t help but asked in confusion. But everyone realized that this secret weapon was definitely not simple, otherwise Ren Tianyou wouldn\u2019t have such solemn expression and stand up to specially narrate it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is very difficult to describe in words, so, if you all look into my eyes, then I will show you everything I had seen at that time.\u201d Recalling the scene of that time, ice-cold dense killing intent appeared in his heart, then he said to everybody present.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook into your eyes?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, everyone present couldn\u2019t help but recall that strange feeling they had felt when they had seen Ren Tianyou\u2019s that scarlet colored eyes just some time ago, then their hearts were involuntarily filled with chilliness. They naturally were too lacking in understanding the power of Sharingan.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I will not use my eyes to harm you all, and I only want to use illusion through my eyes to transmit all the things I had seen to your visual sense, letting you all to see the circumstance I had seen in the Breaking Soul Cliff of Demon World.\u201d Ren Tianyou naturally knew the worries of everybody present, so he smiled and explained to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it turned out to be an illusion, fine, we\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d Brilliant stood up and said to Ren Tianyou. Although the power of illusion was powerful, but wishing to instantly dispose all of them was basically impossible, so they didn\u2019t have any worry.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, everyone present looked at the eyes of Ren Tianyou. Seeing everyone present were ready, his Sharingan changed into Mangekyo Sharingan, then his left eye began to spin rapidly, and large amount of eye power gushed out from his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDojutsu\u2014-Tsukuyomi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present saw the sudden change of the pattern of Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes, then their sight blurred, and when their vision restored, the surrounding environment had already changed dramatically.</p><br/><p>The original clear sky was already shrouded by dark clouds, and these dark clouds emitted an aura which caused people to feel stifling. The original beautiful square around them had also already changed into a huge cliff. Right now towering cliffs were standing at their both sides, and they were now at the bottom of these cliffs. Furthermore in the distant there was a huge valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Seeing the strange environment, everyone thought curiously.</p><br/><p>Just then, the space distorted, and Ren Tianyou appeared there.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, this is the scene of Demon World\u2019s Breaking Soul Cliff I had seen at that time. I\u2019ve created this with my illusion power. And the secret weapon of Demon World I was speaking about is in that valley.\u201d Ren Tianyou explained to everyone present.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is illusion? Never thought sire Zero\u2019s illusion strength is actually so exquisite, if it was not for your explanation, then we can hardly notice that we are actually in a space created by illusion.\u201d Illusory Shrine\u2019s Hall Master\u2014-Huan Tianshen closed his eyes and carefully perceived the surroundings, but he didn\u2019t find any flaw, this was just like a real space. This deeply shocked him. They, Illusory Shrine was the place where the illusion powers were concentrated the most in the entire Divine Wind Continent, but now even he was powerless to discover any flaw in this illusion, this shows the strength of Ren Tianyou\u2019s illusion.</p><br/><p>No kidding, Dojutsu\u2014-Tsukuyomi is strongest spiritual attack. With the exception of Kotoamatsukami (Distinguished Heavenly Gods) of Uchiha Shisui, there is no illusion technique that surpass Tsukuyomi.</p><br/><p>In addition to Huan Tianshen, everyone were also deeply shocked by the illusion technique of Ren Tianyou. One should know that the person that was capable of using this level of illusion were very few in numbers in Divine Wind Continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just a small trick, let\u2019s go, I want to let you see the things ahead, but you all should mentally prepare yourself to see what\u2019s next.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t show any arrogance, rather slowly said a sentence and took the initiative to walk ahead.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the valley, all the people present were stupefied seeing the scene before them, then boundless rage and killing intent appeared in their heart. The body of each and every one involuntarily emitted powerful aura and killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese damned Demon clan, actually dare to torture our clansmen this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will definitely kill you all, damned demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>What present in front of the eyes of everyone was a scene which was just like the scene of hell. In this valley there were huge iron trees, and hanging on these iron tree\u2019s branches were not leaves, rather people\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>They saw human, Holy Sword clan, Beast-men clan, Elf clan\u2026..and so on. All of their skin was cut opened, legs and hands were broken, tongue sliced off, and were hanged on those iron tree\u2019s branches. Their blood mixed with their boundless grievance flowed out from within their body and streamed down the trunk of these iron trees, until all their blood was dried. Some people that were hanged onto these iron trees already had their blood drained, and the iron trees merely had left over skin with already dried-up muscles and bones. After that they peel off and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing this circumstance, the eyes of everyone present became red. Seeing their clansmen tortured like that, how could they not hate, how could they not get angry\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the real scene of Breaking Soul Cliff. Those dark clouds above is the condensed powerful resentment qi emitted by these people in their death, and they wouldn\u2019t disperse for a long time. Furthermore there are many similar places like this in Demon World.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSire Zero, I don\u2019t think that this is the only thing you wanted to show us?\u201d Ling Xiaotian withdrew his killing intent, then taking a deep breathe, he said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what I want truly show is further inside, follow me.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then took the lead to walk ahead. This was the world of Tsukuyomi, everything was under the control of Ren Tianyou. They quickly passed those iron trees one after another, and when the scene around stopped, what appeared in front of them was a huge blood colored pond. This pond was filled with blood colored water, and in the surrounding of this pond, there was a huge magic formation.</p><br/><p>And what surprised all of them the most was, in the blood colored pond, demon clan\u2019s soldiers emitting powerful baleful qi were standing. But everyone felt something was wrong, as they couldn\u2019t sense any life aura from these demon soldiers.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

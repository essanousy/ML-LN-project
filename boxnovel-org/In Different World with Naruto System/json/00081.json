After that 5 spectres riding on the undead horses came next to Yan Xinluo and stood there just like a bodyguard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this for real? Is this a group brawl? Does he really want to bully I, your father with numbers?\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of several spectres, Ren Tianyou immediately had a pain in his ass. Although he already knew that the blood lineage of Si Shen clan \u2018Heart death\u2019 had the ability to connect to the bottomless nether world, can open the gate of death domain, and summon the spectres to fight, but this summoning in front of him was truly abnormal.</p><br/><p>Just take a look at those 5 spectre knights riding the undead horses, you could easily sense the strong death aura they were releasing, which was not any weaker that the aura of Great swordmaster ranked human warrior. Furthermore they were Great swordmaster level fighter who were unafraid of death, incorrect, they were already dead many years ago, so there were no reason for them to fear death.</p><br/><p>Okay, let\u2019s not speak about this, just take a look again at that thing that flew in front of Yan Xinluo, f**k, without doubt even bone dragon had come out from inside that gate. As long as something is associated with the word dragon, then that something would definitely not be simple at all. And also from the figure of that bone dragon, while living it was not the earth dragon or wing dragon which were from inferior dragon clan, but it absolutely was from legitimate dragon clan. Although after death it had turned into an undead and cannot utilize its full power when it was at its peak, nevertheless from the aura of this bone dragon, Ren Tianyou had determined that this bone dragon was still comparable to saint ranked human warrior.</p><br/><p>5 Great swordmaster ranked spectre knights, in addition simultaneously a saint ranked bone dragon, and furthermore Yan Xniluo himself who was also Saint ranked warrior, in a flash Ren Tianyou felt a great pressure\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Standing on the head of bone dragon, holding the Karma transmigration, Yan Xinluo gave a command, then suddenly the bone dragon issued a dragon roar filled with death aura. After that flapping its bone wings, it advanced towards Ren Tianyou in a high speed. Behind bone dragon, the 5 spectre knights immediately tightly held their spear, rode their undead horses and charged towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad. It seems I should get serious.\u201d Looking at the Yan Xinluo and his undead goons advancing towards him, Ren Tianyou revealed a wry smile, \u201cSince it is like this, I should dispose each and every one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAo!\u201d The bone dragon issued a dragon roar, and it opened up its mouth, and released a death dragon breath towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing the dragon breath of bone dragon, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted with disdain. Shortly afterwards the lightning light around his body abruptly rose, and all of his hairs stood up erect. Ren Tianyou had increased the lightning system chakra a step further, to obtain even more powerful strength and speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d The silhouette of Ren Tianyou suddenly became blurred at his original location, then gradually leaving behind an after image, he disappeared for that location. And the dragon breathe of bone dragon hit the ground of arena, suddenly with a \u2018chi chi\u2019 corroding sound, the surface of the arena was immediately corroded beyond recognition by the dragon breath. It seems like after the death of this dragon, it had gradually lost its original attribute, and had its attribute changed into death attribute. Even its original dragon breath had changed into a death dragon breath which was filled with the corroding ability of death system.</p><br/><p>At this time, at the side of bone dragon who was in the process of attacking, a sound was suddenly heard, and saw that Ren Tianyou who was emitting a strong lightning light had suddenly appeared at that location. And his right elbow which was covered with a violent lightning light was advancing towards the bone dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Erubo!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014Elbow Bolt!)</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Under the stunned gaze of everyone, with the strength of that small body of Ren Tianyou, he immediately hit the bone dragon who was more than 20 meter in height.</p><br/><p>\u201cCross-shaped undead slash!\u201d At this time, Yan Xinluo who was standing on the bone dragon waved his right hand, then the Karma transmigration made a slash. After that a cross-shaped undead slash appeared in the sky and advanced towards attacking Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou merely hit the ground with his right leg making a big ditch in that place, and immediately changed into a lightning light, then disappeared from that location. The attack of Yan Xinluo penetrated merely the after image which was left behind by Ren Tianyou and hit the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Ren Tainyou directly appeared in front of the 5 spectre knights who were in the process of charging, then lifting his head he revealed a cruel smile, \u201cYou should go ahead.\u201d Shortly afterwards he clenched his fist which was completely covered with lightning system chakra, and using the newly learned powerful strange fist of Tsunade, he hit at the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll for stopping I, your father!\u201d [T.L: don\u2019t know what he is saying.]</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A loud explosion sound rang out. When the fist of Ren Tainyou landed, the ground suddenly changed into pieces and pieces of debris spattered in the air. A deep crater appeared at that place, and the several cracks on the ground immediately advanced towards the direction of those 5 spectre knights.</p><br/><p>Knights, this profession at the moment charging, their strength is absolutely strongest. Although Ren Tianyou had never fought against knights, nevertheless he was well aware of this principle, and these 5 spectre knights possessed the power level comparable to Great swordmaster. But\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After Yan Xinluo saw the attack advancing towards those 5 spectre knights, almost simultaneously they pulled the reins, and the undead horse issued a horse braying sound. Shortly afterwards their bodies released a layer of deep grey colored death fog, then along with the undead horse, they changed into a light beam and sprinted towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath sprint!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish\u201d, \u201cswish\u201d, \u201cswish\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Tightly holding the spear in their hands, the 5 spectre knights darted towards Ren Tianyou, then waving their hands as they tried to stab Ren Tianyou with their spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Ren Tianyou coldly snorted. Then leaving behind afterimage he disappeared from that location and appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ren Tianyou who had jumped in the sky, those 5 spectre knights immediately tightly pulled the reins of their undead horses. Then urged their horses to stop, and made a circular formation, and simultaneously tilted their spear towards the sky. All 5 spears were pointed towards the sky, then all 5 spectre knights released a death energy and poured it into their spears. Gradually deep grey colored radiance appeared at the tip of the spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, let\u2019s see who is faster now.\u201d Looking at the movement below him, Ren Tianyou without a slightest bit of fear, snorted coldly. Then he speed up the movement of chakra in his body, and suddenly changed into light beam and quickly advanced downwards. When falling down in a high speed, Ren Tianyou raised his right leg, as if his leg had turned into a huge lightning axe, and chopped downwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Girochin Doroppu!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014Guillotine Drop!)</p><br/><p>\u201cCombination skill of spectre \u2014\u2014Death Obliterate!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

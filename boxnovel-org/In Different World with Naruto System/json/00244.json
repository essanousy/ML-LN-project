During this time period, please don\u2019t open your eyes, otherwise system will not be liable for any accident that may take place.\u201d The voice of system resounded inside the mind of Ren Tianyou. Shortly afterwards his system points were deducted by 2.5 million system points, and huge power flowed out from his brain and seeped into his eyes.</p><br/><p>When this huge power entered his eyes, Ren Tianyou felt peerless power was entering his eyes, slowly changing his eyeballs, which was accompanied by a kind of immense pain as if his eyeballs were crushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGroan!\u201d A muffled groan involuntarily came out from the nose of Ren Tianyou, while cold sweats were continuously flowing down from his forehead. And from those closed eyes of Ren Tianyou, two bloodstream flowed down his face.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was tightly clenching his hands above his leg while sitting cross-legged on the bed. One could easily see blue veins on that clenched hands. From this one could clearly see that Ren Tianyou was in the process of enduring extreme pain.</p><br/><p>With the perception of Ren Tianyou, he sensed all the original powers of Sharingan were in the process of being pulled out by a kind of mysterious power, and slowly assembling together. Tsukuyomi, Amaterasu, Kamui\u2026\u2026and so on, all of his doujutsu continuously assembled, and slowly under that soft mysterious power, formed a new power.</p><br/><p>This new form\u2019s power includes all the doujutsu of Ren Tianyou\u2019s previous Mangekyo Sharingan, moreover it gave birth to new additional doujutsu too.</p><br/><p>One might well say the power of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan which was now taking form had already surpassed all the Sharingan of Naruto world. Even the eyes of Uchiha Madara couldn\u2019t compare with this eye. From the beginning, Ren Tianyou had already exchanged eyes of Uchiha Itachi, Uchiha Sasuke, Uchiha Obito, and Uchiha Shisui, in addition to these, he had his own Mangekyo Sharingan too. So altogether he had power of 5 Sharingan. And now with the help of System, all the power of these 5 Sharingan were being fused together forming a new eye, so there was a qualitative change in the power of this new eye.</p><br/><p>Here saying the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan of Ren Tianyou had already surpassed Uchiha Madara\u2019s didn\u2019t mean the strength of Ren Tianyou was comparable to Uchiha Madara, rather saying Ren Tianyou\u2019s aptitude had already surpassed Uchiha Madara\u2019s. If afterwards Ren Tianyou grew up without running into unexpected mishaps, then his strength would definitely surpass both Uchiha Madara and Senju Hasirama.</p><br/><p>Along with the slow passage of time, Ren Tianyou sweated even more. Roughly after two hours, suddenly that inhuman pain he was feeling instantly disappeared. Shortly afterwards, he felt a kind of incomparably comfortable feeling. He felt a clear stream was continuously flowing in his eyes, slowly removing internal injuries of eyes which was caused when his eye power were being forcedly merge to take new shape. Even the hidden injuries that was caused when he had previously used doujutsu also disappeared.</p><br/><p>Along with this clear stream flowing, Ren Tianyou clearly sensed the power of his both eyes were in the process of stabilizing rapidly. While Ren Tianyou was being fascinated with this power, his two eyes quickly took shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis power\u2026\u2026\u2026is really strong.\u201d Feeling the power, Ren Tianyou thought inside his heart while being somewhat fascinated.</p><br/><p>In just this fashion, roughly half an hour passed, and the internal injuries of his eyes were completely removed by that clear stream. After that this clear stream slowly disappeared. And the power of his eyes also gradually stabilized successfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulation to host for awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. The power of Sharingan is further evolved. With eternal light, the darkness curse is completely removed, and the doujutsu are also further enhanced. Moreover now you can use full body Susanoo. Furthermore you opened Rinnegan exchange method.\u201d System voice resounded inside the brain of Ren Tianyou, pointing out the exchange of Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan was complete.</p><br/><p>\u201cSystem, can I open my eyes now?\u201d Ren Tianyou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can, now the powers of Sharingan have already merged completely, so there is no problem.\u201d System answered.</p><br/><p>Hearing System, Ren Tianyou slowly opened his closed eyes. And an unusually evil eyes slowly appeared in the room, sweeping away the little dark room.</p><br/><p>Now the pattern of Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes had already changed thoroughly. The current pattern of his Mangekyo was a pentagon pattern in the middle, with decorative patterns around the circular side\u2019s veins. It looked incomparably mysterious.</p><br/><p>After opening his eyes, Ren Tianyou clearly felt the changes. In his eyes, the world become even clearer. Ren Tianyou could even adjust the focus of his eyes. Moreover he could clearly see the movement of a fly\u2019s wings which was several tens of meters away. The little bit of dark environment inside the room wasn\u2019t able to obstruct his vision in any way, he could even see his image in the mirror clearly.</p><br/><p>Next there was doujutsu of his eyes. This as if vast ocean eye power really fascinated Ren Tianyou very much. This eye power was at least 10 times more powerful than previous. Moreover current eyes contain all the doujutsu of those 5 eyes he previously had.</p><br/><p>\u201cKamui!\u201d Ren Tianyou immediately used doujutsu of right eye. A spiral shaped space ripple came out from his right eye, and with his thought, this space ripple again disappear from this room.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty good, hereafter I don\u2019t need to keep on changing Sharingan.\u201d Feeling he could use any doujutsu as he please, Ren Tianyou nodded his head and said.</p><br/><p>Next the blindness values also disappeared. This means, after possessing eternal light, he don\u2019t need to worry about going blind.</p><br/><p>And to his surprise, he had unexpectedly refined another one-tenth of Forever Green\u2019s life-force. So, now the strength of his mokuton (Wood style) was also further enhanced.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, didn\u2019t System say the exchange method of Rinnegan is also open? Let\u2019s take a look at how it can be exchanged.\u201d Ren Tianyou consciousness immersed into the familiar doujutsu exchange tab.</p><br/><p>Originally dark Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan was already illuminating, and underneath it, there was Rinnegan exchanging method.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, exchanging Rinnegan is actually abnormal like this.\u201d Seeing the requirement needed to exchange Rinnegan, the complexion of Ren Tianyou blackened.</p><br/><p>This Rinnegan required whole 50 million system points to exchange, and this was only first condition. In addition to this, he actually must have the chakra of Senju Hasirama, in other words, he must first exchange Senju Hasirama\u2019s Mukuton (Wood Style) with 60 million system points. Altogether he unexpectedly required 110 million system points to exchange Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, must this be so black hearted.\u201d The complexion of Ren Tianyou suddenly become black, and he couldn\u2019t help but cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, how can I be this stupid ah, don\u2019t I already possess Forever Green\u2019s life-force? Now my physique has already changed into true sage body. And after I completely refine all the life-force of this Forever Green, my sage body will even surpass even Senju Hasirama\u2019s. This should be regarded as already meeting the prerequisite to exchange Rinnegan.\u201d Patting his own head, he slowly thought.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou asked this question to System. But the System answered only after remaining silent for a long while. And this answer instantly made Ren Tianyou excited.</p><br/><p>But looking at his current measly 5.6 million or so system points, he was still very far away from exchanging Rinnegan. This caused his enthusiasm to disappear by lot.</p><br/><p>After that adjusting his state of mind, Ren Tianyou wiped the blood trials on the corner of his eyes and face. Then got up from the bed and walked out from his room. He had hole up inside the room for nearly three hours. Now the sky was already dark and he was a little bit hungry too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he got a slap, he didn\u2019t felt any anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, are you okay?\u201d Seeing dazed Ren Tianyou, Wang Haiqing asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am fine.\u201d Shaking his head, he dispelled the miscellaneous thoughts within his heart. Then he start to watch the following matches.</p><br/><p>With the passage of the time, the next 2 match also ended very quickly. Yan Xinluo, this face paralyzed man had encountered Hai fu of magic court and depending on his strength, he easily defeated him. As for Wang Haiqing, he was knocked out by Feng Wu, and unfortunately he also stopped at quarterfinals.</p><br/><p>At this stage all the semifinalist were already determined. They were Yan Xinluo, Ren Tianyou, Wang Yanli and Feng Wu respectively. The semi-final matches would be held this afternoon, as for the championship match, it would be held tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Seeing the matches were over, Ren Tianyou turned around and leave the square, and when he arrived at the dining hall to eat, by coincidence he ran into Luo Mengwu and others. While having their meal, Ren Tianyou told them about the matches. Hearing Ren Tianyou had successfully entered semifinal, they were happy for him, and expressed that they will come to cheer him in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Then out of curiosity Ren Tianyou asked, why were they not going to cheer Tianxing, but who would have imagined they would say in the match of morning, the luck of Tianxing was not good and he encountered abnormally strong opponent and lost his match.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was a bit surprised hearing this, he had never thought that with the strength of Luo Tianxing, he actually was unable to enter semifinal. It seems there were also many people with high strength in second year.</p><br/><p>After eating their meals, Ren Tianyou and others sat down for a chat. While chatting, they also talk about the grand auction which will be held on 4 days later. Ren Tianyou got many information about this auction from Lan Yan.</p><br/><p>This grand auction which was going to be held by the Lan di Yin auction house of Lan Yan\u2019s clan could be said as a biggest auction held in last few years. It can be said that majority of people were interested in this auction for this power of god crystal. According to Lan Yan\u2019s narration, this time not only the all big clans from Di Feilu Empire would attend this auction, even the big power of other empire had heard this news and were rushing to attend this auction. According to Lan Yan, this news had already spread far and wide, and it was already fixed that the 6 super power would attend this auction, and other powers too would be attending. Such as Heavenly sword villa, Illusion cloud lake, and furthermore \u2018old acquaintance\u2019 of Ren Tianyou, Ximen clan and so on.</p><br/><p>When he heard the member of Ximen clan were also coming to attend this auction, the mind of Ren Tianyou suddenly shook, followed by a strong resentment sprang out from his heart. Ren Tianyou was surprised, and without losing any time he calmed down his mind and thought within his mind, \u201cRest assured, for your enmity I will absolutely take your revenge.\u201d After Ren Tianyou spoke these words within his heart, that resentment that had welled up in his heart suddenly dissipated.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was already aware, this resentment was the hatred of Ximen Tianlong towards Ximen clan which was carved inside his heart before his death. And even after Ren Tianyou had occupied this body, this hatred didn\u2019t disappeared and Ren Tianyou was powerless to do anything towards this hatred.</p><br/><p>Whoever hung the bell on the tiger\u2019s neck must untie it, only after destroying Ximen clan and getting revenge for Ximen Tianlong, this resentment would automatically disappear. This was also another reason for Ren Tianyou wanting to destroy Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>While they were catting, it was almost 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the matches would start very soon. So Ren Tianyou and others walked towards the direction of the square.</p><br/><p>After they arrived at the square, they saw countless students had already arrived at an earlier time and anxiously waiting for the start of the match. It was so because all 4 who had advanced to semifinal were extremely strong. Ren Tianyou with demonic speed and super strong attack, as if he didn\u2019t have any weakness; Wang Yanli with ultimate lava magic which was capable to destroy anything, give peoples a kind of visual sense of super powerful destruction; Yan Xinluo with grim face, and aura of undead, even standing before him make other people terrified; Feng Wu just like a phoenix soaring the highest heaven, bring out a new flame on the earth. So the next matches of semifinals would definitely be extremely awesome, as a result many students had arrived at an earlier time, afraid that they would miss the single moment of match.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou and others came all the way to the location where the class mates were located at. He greeted them and arrived at the side of Wang Jiafei then he placed his hand on the shoulder of Wang Jiafei and said, \u201cI said, come early to cheer for me. But didn\u2019t expect you were this concern about me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die? Remove your claw away from me.\u201d Seeing the hand on her shoulder, Wang Jiafei firmly yelled at him.</p><br/><p>Hearing those cold words from Wang Jiafei, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but shivered then with a smile he slowly move away his hand from the shoulder of Wang Jiafei. Trying to molest this woman was definitely his loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, your guts is quite large. You actually dared to molest our heart\u2019s hot rose.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou was defeated, Li Feng laughed without holding back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, little Li, do you think you can run wild just because you advance to second grade and think I won\u2019t punish you?\u201d Seeing that laughing Li Feng, Wang Jiafei said while making a snapping sound from her finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, please don\u2019t get excited teacher. I am not laughing at you.\u201d Seeing the appearance of Wang Jiafei, Li Feng hurriedly shook his hand and explained himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, you know each other?\u201d Seeing the reaction of Li Feng, he was a surprised and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, we have just recently advanced to the 2nd grade. You say don\u2019t we recognize our former teacher?\u201d Long You rolled his eyes towards the stupid question of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh.\u201d Hearing Long You, a sweat appeared on the forehead of Ren Tianyou. Now he also felt that he had asked a stupid question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, uncle Tianxing why are you here?\u201d From the side Wang Haiqing saw Luo Tianxing and others, not only was he happy he also rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Haiqing, just now you call I, your father uncle again, these several days I haven\u2019t given you any massage so you are already feeling itchy all over your body.\u201d Hearing that Wang Haiqing had called him uncle, a black line appeared on the face of Luo TianXing, and coldly said several words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, that\u2026\u2026\u2026ha ha, it\u2019s just slip of a tongue.\u201d Seeing the reaction of Luo Tianxing, without losing any time Wang Haiqing yielded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, why are you here, didn\u2019t you participate on the competition, Luoluo? Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t participate in the competition?\u201d Wang Jiafei was surprised to see Luo Tianxing and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t participate, only uncle Tianxing and big brother Li Feng participated. But both of them lost. So we came here to cheer big brother Tianyou.\u201d Long Luoluo explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, it\u2019s so unfair, when little Luoluo called you uncle, you don\u2019t have any reaction but when I call you, you burn up. This is unfair.\u201d Seeing Luo Tianxing didn\u2019t have any reaction even after Long Luoluo called him uncle, within his heart, Wang Haiqing shed the tears.</p><br/><p>When they were chatting, Long Feilu had already announced the official start of the competition. After he had announced, everyone stared at the huge magic screen which had started to flash with the names of the participants.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing!\u201d With the loud and clear sound, the 2 name appeared on the huge magic screen. \u201cFeng Wu VS Ren Tianyou!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Only after one hour had passed, the turn of Ren Tianyou came. This clearly shows the influence of \u2018Jealous Heaven\u2019 mercenary group. Merely recruiting members for the mission, and so many peoples were scrambling for registration.</p><br/><p>Noticing it was his turn, Ren Tianyou who was already sleepy due to waiting for a long time, immediately stepped forward in front of that sitting little girl who was wearing a purple colored clothing. As Ren Tianyou draw near that girl, suddenly those several experts jointly released a formidable aura and oppressed Ren Tianyou, as if they wanted to force Ren Tianyou to fall the ground. This was the first test.</p><br/><p>When a cultivator cultivates daily and increases their cultivation, their body would also forms a special force. This force doesn\u2019t count as an energy on its own, but can be understand as a kind of natural oppression. If people with low strength was exposed to this oppressing aura of people with high strength for a long time, then that oppressing force might directly break through the defense of the heart of that low strength people, turning him into a madman or even idiot. If some of the extremely high ranked experts released their aura, then those peoples with low strength won\u2019t even be able to come near that expert, and even all the animals and birds would scramble to escape from that place. As the proverb says, a dead, starved camel is still bigger than horse, even if high level experts was in dire straits, those weaker peoples are not capable to take advantage of that condition.</p><br/><p>Facing the oppressing aura of 4 or 5 Sword Master-ranked warriors, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t even have a slightest change in his face, just slowly advanced towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t expect that you with merely intermediate-ranked strength actually was able to withstand their oppressing aura, however we are sorry, our minimum requirement is having the Sword master-ranked strength. And it seems you do not meet our minimum requirement.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou with only the strength of intermediate-rank was able to withstand the oppressive aura of her guards, she exclaimed in surprise and also looked at Ren Tianyou with surprise written all over her face. But after a moment she thought that Ren Tianyou was relaying on some kind of mysterious alchemy item, to withstand the oppressive aura of her guards. But she absolutely would never thought that this intermediate-ranked warrior in front of her, had already stained his hand with the blood of 2 God-ranked experts and also a God-ranked dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntermediate-ranked warrior? Maybe so. But I am not interested on your commission and mission. I merely came here because you are going to God weeping region, and by coincident I also want to go there, so I want a ride on your boat.\u201d Hearing this young girl, Ren Tianyou helplessly shrugged his shoulder and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent, actually daring to speak like this to our family miss. You are courting death.\u201d Hearing what Ren Tianyou had just said, before that young girl in purple dress could speak, one of those guards on her side immediately roared, and he released his oppressing aura without holding back towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to use your boring oppressing aura on me again, it\u2019s useless against me.\u201d Sensing that guard was again trying to oppress his using his aura, Ren Tianyou just said dully without caring. \u201cAnd also when master is speaking, you small guards shouldn\u2019t interrupt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the face of that guard instantly become very red, then rays of light flashed on his body, and instantly changed into a cyan colored light beam and rushed towards Ren Tianyou. Then he had already took out his weapon as he appeared in front of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Aliu stop!\u201d When she felt energy fluctuation at her side, that young girl already knew that it was bad, so hastily yelled to stop that guard. But she was a step too late, the sword of that guard was already in front of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>At that time, when the people around them covered their eyes, and believed that a tragic event would occur, something unexpected appeared in front of their eyes. They saw that the sword of that guard had clearly pierced the body of Ren Tianyou, and also the body of Ren Tianyou had not moved even an inch, but that guard and his sword however had directly passed Ren Tianyou. To speak clearly, this guard and his sword had directly passed through inside the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>When everyone was being surprised seeing what had happened just a moment ago, the right hand of Ren Tianyou suddenly stretched backward, and this right hand directly grasp the neck of that guard and pulled him directly in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, uh.\u201d Feeing that his neck was caught, he tried to struggle free, but he instantly felt that it was very difficult to breathe, and very quickly he was out of breathe. Then he instinctively tried to struggle free, his hand and legs were constantly struggling, but he was not successful in struggling free.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou pulled this guard right in front of him, and his left eye which had already turned into Mangekyo Sharingan, suddenly started to quickly rotate, then the invisible eye power unceasingly flow out from his life eye. After that the continuously struggling guard immediately stopped his struggling, and both of his eyes became lifeless.</p><br/><p>Sensing that the guard had stopped struggling, Ren Tianyou smiled and released this hand. Then that fell on the ground and didn\u2019t had a single movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAliu.\u201d Seeing the scene in front of her, that young girl in purple clothing reaction was a bit slow. And only after that guard had fallen in the ground, that young girl exclaimed in panic and stood up, then ran towards that guard. And her remaining 4 Sword Master-ranked guards also rushed over, they all thought that Ren Tainyou had killed this Aliu, and were extremely angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, actually dared to kill a member of our Jealous Heaven mercenary group. You are courting death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After that all 4 of them pulled out their weapons in succession, and all of them had released their battle qi. And they release the oppressing aura of Sword Master without holding back, after that these 4 guards directly jumped towards Ren Tiayou.</p><br/><p>Looking at those incoming 4 guards, Ren Tianyou just smile with disdain, then he also jumped towards them. Very quickly Ren Tianyou meet them in the sky, seeing this those 4 guards had a ruthless smile on their face. Then without holding back they poured their battle qi on their weapons, after that stabbed their weapon towards the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But this time too, same strange thing happened. In everyone\u2019s vision, it seems the body of Ren Tianyou was nothingness. The weapons of those 4 guards directly passed through the body of Ren Tianyou without a bit of resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Those 4 didn\u2019t even feel the slightest bit of the resistance, when their weapons pierce through the body of Ren Tianyou. All of them didn\u2019t know what was happening before their own eyes.</p><br/><p>After that when the body of Ren Tianyou landed on the land, Ren Tianyou immediately used some force in his right leg and again quickly rushed back, and immediately overtook the 1st guard, and hit this guard with the elbow of his right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cKonoha Kaigansho!\u201d (Leaf Rock Crush!)</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Ren Tianyou hit this guard heavily and send him flying straight towards the ground. Then without reducing any speed he rushed towards remaining 3 guards. Seeing the miserable condition of 1st guard, remaining 3 guards just waved their swords towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>One of the guard and Ren Tianyou came in contact with each other, and his sword chopped towards Ren Tianyou, but strangely Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t even dodged his attack, but without reducing the speed, Ren Tianyou was coming towards him. When his weapon came into contact with Ren Tianyou, his sword just passed through the body of Ren Tianyu without a bit of resistance, and he felt as if he was just cutting through the air. After his weapon passed through the body of Ren Tainyou, the fist attack of Ren Tianyou came towards him. At that time, a mystical idea suddenly appeared inside his heart, \u201cCould it be his body is nothingness, like that his attack will also not hit me.\u201d Unfortunately this guy had forgotten the condition of his two companions, and directly faced the attack of Ren Tianyou, actually not even trying to block this attack. And the result was obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d The fist of Ren Tianyou directly landed on his nose, immediately cause his nose to bleed and directly sent him flying towards the ground with his head first. Before he lost his consciousness, his last thought was, \u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou hit this guy, Ren Tianyou was thinking why this guy wasn\u2019t even try to block or dodge his fist. And when the attack of Ren Tianyou was about to hit him, that guy had a smiling expression in his face too. Seeing this Ren Tianyou mistakenly believed that this guard had some kind of unique skill, so he was already prepared to use right eye\u2019s Kamui at any moment. But who would have imagines that the result was actually like this, seeing this result a thought flashed inside the brain of Ren Tianyou, \u201cCould it be this guy was M, or had some kind of IQ problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the remaining 2 guards were already near him, so he temporarily threw away this thoughts, and prepared to deal these remanding 2 guards. Just then the voice of young girl in purple dress suddenly came, \u201cAll of you stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice of their Miss, those 2 guard had no choice but to stop and withdrew their weapons. But when Ren Tianyou saw that these 2 guards had stopped, Ren Tianyou just smiled, and without reducing his speed he quickly rushed towards these 2 guards. Seeing this, there was grief and indignation on the eyes of these 2 guards, and all the onlookers had an expression as if they had seen something inconceivable. Under these gaze, Ren Tianyou changed both hands into a blade hand and \u2018peng\u2019 \u2018peng\u2019 hit the back neck of remaining 2 guards. Immediately after that both of these guards also lost their consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is too shameless, the family Miss of Jealous Heaven had already commanded to stop her guards, and those guards had also already withdrawn their weapons, but this guy still directly attacked defenseless opponent. That\u2019s too shameless.\u201d Seeing the shameless act of Ren Tainyou, the onlookers made a big fuss in succession.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that right, this guy is too shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t pay any attention to onlookers, he just turned his body and looked towards the direction of Miss of Jealous Heaven. As expected, seeing the shameless act of Ren Tianyou, even she who was cultured person couldn\u2019t help but had her face twisted, her lovely body quivering, and was ferociously staring at Ren Tianyou with her beautiful eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

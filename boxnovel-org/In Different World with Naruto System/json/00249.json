Mission reward: 1.2 million system points. Mission Failure: Seal host\u2019s Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan for one year.\u201d At that time, the voice of System suddenly wake up Ren Tianyou with a start.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, didn\u2019t expect System would take advantage of this time to make this even more exciting.\u201d Hearing the system prompt inside his mind, Ren Tianyou looked towards Dragon Emperor who had already become glittering golden light and said, \u201cNow I have one more reason to absolutely kill you all.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou decided to no longer delay to avoid further complications.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou raised his hands, then quickly made a series of hand seals, and circulated his chakra within his body, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Shinra Bansho! (Wood Style\u2014-All Creation!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, with his body as the center, the ground around began to violently shake rapidly, causing huge cracks to appear all round on the ground. After that along with several \u2018ka ka\u2019 disintegrated sound, countless long tree tendrils broke out from the ground, while Ren Tianou raised to the sky.</p><br/><p>And form the ground underneath Dragon Empire, countless tendrils broke out which quickly brandish towards the body of Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>As early as when the grounds began to shake, Dragon Emperor had already take precautions against Ren Tianyou\u2019s movement, so when tendrils broke out from the ground, Dragon Emperor had already seize that instant to waved his right hand\u2019s huge golden halberd and stuck it in the ground. After that he poured his powerful holy dragon power inside this golden halberd.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly Obliteration!\u201d After a loud roar of Dragon Emperor, with Dragon Emperor as the center, the surrounding of ten meters in radius was suddenly covered with golden radiances, and the tendrils created by Ren Tianyou\u2019s wood style was swept away by that golden radiance, causing them to instantly change into powder and dissipate in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, we\u2019ll also help His Majesty the Dragon Emperor to kill this wicked human.\u201d Those dragons in the sky far away, under the drive of one dragon, suddenly fly over towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Looking at those dragons, Ren Tianyou merely coldly snorted in disdain. After that he took out a huge scroll from his space ring, directly pulled it opened, then made series of hand seals to undo the seal.</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026..sound, several white smokes appeared. With the dissipation of these white smokes, seven huge shuriken appeared around him, which were picked up by the tendrils created by Ren Tianyou\u2019s Wood style.</p><br/><p>Then under the control of Ren Tianyou, these tendrils threw these several shuriken towards those dragons flying in the sky. And while these shuriken was still in midflight, Ren Tianyou immediately made a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinpo\u2014-Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Ninja Art\u2014-Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, those flying seven shuriken suddenly multiplied exponentially. And these thickly dotted over several thousand shuriken attacked towards those dragons.</p><br/><p>But those dragons were also not this easy to deal with. The dragons in the lead open up their huge dragon mouth and spat out their powerful dragon breath, drowning all of these shuriken. And under the effect of this blazing dragon breath, all of these shuriken changed into molten iron and fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>While Dragon Emperor had already arrived in front of Ren Tianyou with that huge golden halberd in his hand. And that huge golden halberd was glimmering with terrifying cold light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, give me a peace for a moment.\u201d Seeing Dragon Emperor, the Sharingan of Ren Tianyou spun rapidly. Then huge amount of eye power gushed out from his right eye, while his eye\u2019s perspective firmly stared at Dragon Emperor in front of him.</p><br/><p>Seeing the changed in the eye of Ren Tianyou, Dragon Emperor instantly had an ominous foreboding. From the beginning, Dragon Emperor was already paying attention to Ren Tianyou\u2019s those strange eyes, and seeing the changes in his eyes, he instantly became very alert, but it\u2019s too bad, he was already late.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoujutsu\u2014-The Other Side!\u201d Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, under his sight, the 5 meter space around Dragon Emperor was instantly sealed off, trapping his body inside invisible space prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Dragon Emperor who was flying at full speed instantly slammed into the invisible space barrier, knocking himself back. After he stabilized his body, he however discovered he was already trapped within a space of 5 meters in radius. No matter what he did, he was powerless to move even one step forward outside of this 5 meters space.</p><br/><p>Doujutsu\u2014-The Other Side was Ren Tianyou\u2019s own right Mangekyo\u2019s ability. Previously when he had just awakened his Mangekyo, the power of The Other Side could trap enemy in the space of 3 meters in radius, but now this limit was already extended to 5 meters. And previously he could trap enemy for only 10 seconds, but now that limit was also already extended to 30 seconds. These could be described as huge changes.</p><br/><p>And while Dragon Emperor was trapped, those dragons all around had already broken through the obstruction of Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu, and had already surrounded Ren Tianyou. As for Ren Tianyou, looking at these dragons who had already surrounded him all around, he grinned, then without any fear, he quickly began to make a series of hand seals while circulating chakra within his body. Then instantly huge amount of chakra was consumed, as he yelled, \u201cThese damned lizards, change into fertilizer for my wood style.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton\u2014-Kajukai Korin! (Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Bloom!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou had yelled, with him as a center, the ground around within the radius of one kilometers suddenly began to violently shook, and long and huge fissures appeared on the ground, as if something terrifying was about to break out from inside the ground.</p><br/><p>At this time, huge vines and tendrils suddenly break out from those fissures in large numbers, then as if bamboo shoots after spring rains, countless huge trees directly broke out, changing into sturdy trees grown from the ground. Now the surroundings of one kilometers in radius was instantly changed into dense forest.</p><br/><p>And among the dragons, those who were flying a little lower in the sky were directly caught and tied by those countless vines. Now they couldn\u2019t move even a bit, moreover what made them even more alarmed was, their dragon power within their body was actually no longer under their control anymore. Their power was slowly flowing out from within their body, and was being absorbed by these trees that had trapped them. And after absorbing their power, these trees were getting even sturdier, exactly as if they had changed into the fertilizer for these trees.</p><br/><p>The tailed beasts who were confronting those three princes were obliviously also paying attention to the circumstance of Ren Tianyou\u2019s side. After they saw trees instantly growing out from the ground, Ichibi Shukaku stutteringly said, \u201cIs this the Wood style which stabilized the troubled times? Truly too astonishing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShukaku, Matatabi, look at that petal at the top of the trees.\u201d At that moment, Yonbi Son Goku suddenly warned Ichibi and Nibi solemnly. Then their eyes slowly looked at that slowly blooming bright red flower on the top of the trees.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t expect that after so much effort, he still let her escape. That magic scroll, which was created by a space system magician, only needed to be crushed to activate and as long as it is activated it can transfer anyone to a random location. It is one of the most efficient items for fleeing to save one\u2019s life.This space transmission scroll, however, is extremely rare because you can easily compare the number of space system magician with that of the giant panda on the earth, which is one of a kind rare species.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who is she? Why was she monitoring me and lurking outside my room so late at night?\u201d Different questions started to rise in his heart, but no matter how much he thought he couldn\u2019t get any answers. \u201cForget it, everything will be alright, don\u2019t think about her.\u201d Ren Tian You decided to no longer think about this problem. Afterward, he got rid of his Rashomon Jutsu, the remaining 2 Rashomon gates burst into smoke, and disappeared. After that, Ren Tian You also changed into smoke and disappeared from that place, only the earth\u2019s surface which was riddled with holes was left as a prove of this big battle.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You returned back to his room, called maidservants of Heavenly fragrance restaurant, and made them exchange the window which was broken. After that, he lied on his bet and entered his dreamland.</p><br/><p>The next day, early in the morning, sunray shined on Ren Tian You\u2019s body, and then he slowly opened his eyes, got out from his bed, and began his morning duties.</p><br/><p>After he finished his morning duties, he went to 3rd floor only to discover that Lan Yan and the others were already at that place and were about to have their breakfast.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, did you have a good sleep last night?\u201d Seeing Ren Tian You had arrived, Lan Yan asked Ren Tian You with a broad smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but you all are really unusual, ah, each and every one of you are young masters and young misses of a large clan, but it is quite unexpected that you all woke up early in the morning.\u201d Ren Tian You found an open seat, sat down and curiously asked. Then he directly started to wipe out the breakfast on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing we could do. Today we have a very long distance to cover. We have to cross Caryl plain today. And at that place there is the frequent appearance of packs of wolves, as a result, we have to speed up and cross this plain before evening, and enter the territory of the imperial capital of Emperor Fei Lu. Just now we were about to head to your room to wake you up if you didn\u2019t arrive here.\u201d Li Feng answered while eating his breakfast.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo actually it was like that, then we should quickly finish eating.\u201d Ren Tian You increased his eating speed, and in a blink of an eye, he had already wiped out all his food along with the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, Tian You, just eat slowly. F**k, brothers we should also increase our eating speed.\u201d Seeing the eating speed of Ren Tian You, Luo Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes and then yelled towards Lan Yan and others to also start increasing their speed of eating.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJia!\u201d Ren Tian You and others finished eating quickly and without wasting any time, took their horses and carriage then left Eiffel capital and headed towards the direction of Caryl plain.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You who was riding the gale horse looked above towards the blue colored sky and started to think about the power he possessed now. Before arriving at this world, he would have never believed that he could have such power. Right now in his heart, there was an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, what happened, why are you staring blankly towards the sky?\u201d Li Feng felt strange as he saw Ren Tian You and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, just a little homesick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHomesick. Oh, that\u2019s right, I still haven\u2019t heard you mention about your home, where is your home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy home? it is very far, far away from me now. I don\u2019t know if I will have a chance to return there in my whole life.\u201d Ren Tian You looked towards the vast plain and said sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Tian You, I\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Li Feng didn\u2019t know what to say next.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. One day I will absolutely return.\u201d Ren Tian You eyes flashed with strong determination and decided to strive even harder to become stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, after having this, I might be able to return to Earth.\u201d Ren Tian You thought about the Naruto system in his mind and he slowly thought in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, no need to think twice, we are already brothers.\u201d Luo Tian Xing laughed and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, uncle you are right. I still have several good brothers.\u201d Along with a warm feeling in his heart, Ren Tian You spoke with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, don\u2019t call I, your father an uncle.\u201d Yelled Luo Tian Xing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You and others had run for almost half a day, then they stopped and began to eat their lunch. These were the food they had packed from Heavenly fragrance restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cHowl.\u201d\u201d\u201d Just when they were eating their lunch, they heard the howling of wolves. Immediately after that, the faces of Lan Yan and others changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, A pack of wolves. We should immediately leave this place.\u201d Luo Tian Xing immediately cried, got up and hastily rode his horse, and he didn\u2019t even pick up the food.</p><br/><p>After that, all of them left that place in a hurry, behind them they heard a big rumbling noise. All of them looked back to see, suddenly fear started to rise inside their heart. Because they could see a huge number of magical beasts advancing towards them. Only looking at the number, there was at least several thousand magical beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, like this we won\u2019t be able to escape. Get ready to dismount and fight.\u201d Luo Tian Xing quickly yelled to others to prepare to dismount from the horses. Inside his heart, he was bursting with anger, \u201cF**k, 4th elder and others left because something came up. And now we encounter these pack of wolves\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yesterday, 4th elder and others who were responsible for protecting them had left in advance because of some matter. So now they had only themselves to rely on.</p><br/><p>Over time, the distance between them and the pack of wolves was getting shorter. Ren Tian You was the only one who was relaxed because it was very simple for him to dispose of this pack of wolves. He had decided, however, not to dispose of these wolves directly because he wanted to see the fighting ability of Luo Tian Xing and others and wanted to train them. Although the strengths of Luo Tian Xing and others were extremely high, and also had good natural talent, without experiencing blood filled battle, they could only become mediocre. The elders had also seen this problem, so when these youngsters were going through the trial by fire in Magical beasts forest, they had protected them secretly without their knowledge. Those elders wanted these youngsters to grow up and became qualified warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar.\u201d Luo Tian Xing who was taking the lead, roared and a copper colored light started to flash through his body. \u201c7 stars broken bone blood lineage, now!\u201d Along with of Luo Tian Xing\u2019s shout, all of a sudden the aura around him changed. Ren Tian You discovered that Luo Tian Xing\u2019s body had grown tall again. Combined with his tall body and his huge sword in his hand, he looked just like a War God.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, today I will let you see the might of the Luo clan\u2019s 7 stars broken bone blood lineage and the power of the battle qi of \u2018bone refining heavenly star\u2019.\u201d Luo Tian Xing turned his head towards Ren Tian You and said. Followed by his body emitting a copper color battle qi, and from this battle qi, Ren Tian You sensed that this battle qi had the power to destroy everything, and also felt that this battle qi had completely abandoned all defense and only focused on attack and destruction. The members of the Luo clan inherit this 7 stars broken bone blood lineage and cultivates the supreme battle qi\u2014\u2014-bone refining heavenly star. This is also the reason why compared to general males, the males of the Luo family looked more mature. This power of blood lineage tempers their bones, as a result, their physical body became more mature quickly compared to other general males of the same age. When \u20187 stars broken bone Blood lineage\u2019 reached great success, they would achieve a hard body comparable to diamond. This is why \u20187-star broken bone Blood lineage\u2019 is one of the first-rate blood lineages. If not for the fact that it is extremely hard to cultivate, it would be classified as at least Saint rank blood lineage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly star 1st kill\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013earthquake start!\u201d Seeing that the packs of wolves had already arrived, Luo Tian Xing directly launched his killing move. Luo Tian Xing half squatted the ground, suddenly inserted his huge sword in the ground, and started to release his copper color battle qi to embed into his huge sword. Shortly afterward, the ground in front of him started to shake and dozens of towering yellow colored light erupted from the surface of the ground. These light hit the pack of wolves and made them fly in the air.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

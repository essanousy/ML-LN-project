And along with the explosion shockwave, dusts and smokes rose. And the instant this explosion rose, the eyes of Ren Tainyou shone, then he quickly flew towards the center of explosion.</p><br/><p>And at this time, a loud roaring sound of beast came from the center of explosion, and the surging powerful sound waves spreading out from the center of explosion dispersed all of the explosion dusts and smokes, revealing the circumstance inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026this is?\u201d Seeing the thing appeared before her eyes, the complexion of Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha blanked, and deep shock flashed in her eyes.</p><br/><p>In front of her, there was a gigantic beast with ten huge tails swinging behind it. The skin of this gigantic beast was as if withered bark, and the most peculiar thing was, its forehead\u2019s that one unusually evil eye.</p><br/><p>That was a blood red eyeball, and the eyeball had nine tomoe. This eyeball gave people a kind of unusually evil feeling. Just looking at this eye, the consciousness of people seemed to involuntarily sink in.</p><br/><p>This eye is the eye of the strongest tailed-beast Jubi\u2014-Rinne Sharingan, also was legendary Eye of the Moon.</p><br/><p>And the moment this Jubi was resurrected, Ren Tianyou had already arrived at its front. Then looking at the huge body of Jubi and sensing the suffocating chakra its body was emitting, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cIt indeed is worthy of the title of the strongest tailed-beast, this chakra alone is already truly strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sighing, Ren Tianyou no longer hesitated, his Rinne Sharingan emitted powerful eye power, and he simultaneously made a series of hand seals while circulating the chakra within his body, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to become host of Jubi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Jubi was resurrected, and relying on his Rinne Sharingan, he could completely control it, but that had no meaning to Ren Tianyou, because his goal was to become the host of Jubi, and obtain the power of Six Path. Thereby defeating this Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis big fellow is not a good news ah!\u201d Looking at distant Jubi\u2019s that huge body as well as sensing that oppressive chakra leaking out from its body, Yaorao standing inside Demonic Buddha felt danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What is that human doing?\u201d Just then, Yaorao suddenly noticed Ren Tianyou, standing in front of that magical beast with ten tails, was in the process of unceasingly making hand seals, as if he was preparing to do something.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe!\u201d Ren Tianyou finally maintained \u2018Rat\u2019 hand seal, then with chakra continuously circulating within his body and Rinnegan continuously emitting powerful eye power, he looked at Jubi in front of him, then loudly roared, \u201cCome in for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, Jubi\u2019s that huge body instantly changed into nine white colored chakra and flowed into the body of Ren Tianyou. And Ren Tianyou slowly absorbed it.</p><br/><p>Along with the absorption of these nine white colored chakra, the body of Ren Tianyou emitted dazzling white colored radiance, illuminating the entire horizon.</p><br/><p>And when that huge body of Jubi completely disappeared, and white colored light beam also dissipated, Yaorao deeply frowned clearly seeing the changes in Ren Tianyou. And her fists also couldn\u2019t help but tightened, \u201cIt seems it\u2019d have been wisest choice to kill him in the beginning ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Yaorao couldn\u2019t help but look towards the sky and muttered slowly, \u201cSince this is already the case, there is no need for the existence of this continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>And on the other side, after absorbing Jubi, the body of Ren Tianyou already had earthshaking changes. Now he was wearing black and white alternating windbreaker, and behind him, nine black colored chakra balls were slowly revolving in the mid-air.</p><br/><p>In the hand of Ren Tianyou there was a long scepter, and on one end of this scepter there were few black colored metal like substance making up iron hoop. And now his body doesn\u2019t seem to have any aura, but if one carefully probe then they would discover his power was as if vast ocean. This was the state of becoming the host of Jubi and obtaining the power of Sage of Six Path.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, Ren Tianyou firmly closed his eyes, because after sealing Jubi in his body, the consciousness of nine tailed-beasts had reawakened within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle You, you succeed. You finally obtained the power of old man Six Path.\u201d Within his body, the voice of Shukaku rang out speaking to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, not bad, you really didn\u2019t let us tailed-beasts down.\u201d Kuruma\u2019s voice also rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour consciousness finally restored, that\u2019s really too good, too good\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing the sound of tailed-beasts within his body, Ren Tianyou a little agitatedly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t get too sentimental now, boy, there is enemy in front of you here. Now show her our real strength.\u201d Nine tailed-beasts loudly roared towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there is a battle waiting for me.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly thought, then slowly beginning to open his eyes, he said slowly, \u201cDemon Empress Yaorao, let me show you my Six Path Mode power as well as the power of my new eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tainyou opened his eyes, two radiance seemingly shot out from his eyes, eradication this dark surrounding.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Ren Tianyou had also changed greatly. Now in his Rinnegan\u2019s ripple pattern, each of them had few tomoe. Altogether there were nine tomoe in each of his eyeball.</p><br/><p>This was precisely Ren Tianyou\u2019s evolved eyes, Rinnegan\u2019s strongest mode\u2014-Rinne Sharingan!</p><br/><p>The reason why he was able to awaken Rinne Sharingan was also related to the System within his body. After Ren Tianyou absorbed Jubi, becoming the host of Jubi, the voice of System resounded on the mind of Ren Tianyou, \u201cCongratulation to host for obtaining tailed-beasts true power, become host of Jubi, and awaken Six Path Mode, now you have awakened Sharingan\u2019s final form\u2014-Rinne Sharingan!\u2019</p><br/><p>After obtaining Rinne Sharingan, and he asked the System inside his body, then knew the requirements to awaken this Rinne Sharingan.</p><br/><p>First, must have Sharingan successfully evolved to Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>Second, also the most important of all, must obtain the approval of all nine tailed-beasts, and obtain their tailed-beasts origin power, otherwise even if you became the host of Jubi, there was no way to awaken.</p><br/><p>Third, i.e. absorb Jubi, becoming the host of Jubi.</p><br/><p>Six Path Mode, coupled with Ren Tianyou\u2019s Rinne Sharingan. This was the true Six Path\u2019s power that was stated by nine tailed-beasts at that time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then his fist which was originally going to hit Ren Tianyou, stopped and could no longer move forward as if it hit invisible barrier.</p><br/><p>The rioting chakra inside his body also slowly calmed down. After passing through this chakra rioting, his chakra level had unexpectedly increased, but the increase was not very high. After all it was not that easy to increase his strength after he entered the shadow level.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou slowly stood up while carrying the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er. After that completely ignoring Ximen Zhou, he directly passed by him, and arrived at the location where White Tiger and Void was sent flying by Ximen Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Tiger, Void, are you all right?\u201d Ren Tianyou scanned through the piles of rubbles, then yelled towards it.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou had yelled, White Tiger and Void who were buried under the rubbles suddenly shook. After that along with \u2018hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019 sound, two figures jumped out from the piles of rubbles, and landed at the side of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cChough chough. Zero, I\u2019m alright. But the fist of this old man truly is heavy.\u201d White Tiger wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and weakly answered. The gap between their strength was truly too big, as he a peak god ranked expert was actually sent flying with a single punch and had lost consciousness for a second there. Fortunately Ximen Zhou only wanted to beat them to pulp, then capture them alive, otherwise it was hard to say whether they could survive the single punch of him. Although Void didn\u2019t speak anything, nevertheless from the blood continuously flowing out from the corner of his mouth and his pale face, clearly shows that he was also not lightly injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better for you two to enter my kamui dimension. After I finish dealing here, I will let you out.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at the pale face of White Tiger and Void, then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Zero, here\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d White Tiger looked at Ximen Zhou and others and anxiously started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, they are still not strong enough to kill me. Don\u2019t forget my space abilities.\u201d Ren Tianyou interrupted White Tiger, then handed the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er to Void, and continued, \u201cWhen you all arrived to my kamui dimension, help me look after corpse of my elder sister Yue\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er, Void stared at Ren Tianyou, nodded his head and said, \u201cRest assured, I know what I should do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After handing over, the eyes of Ren Tianyou changed into the Mangekyo of Obito. After that along with the spiral shaped space ripple, Void, White Tiger and the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er were directly sucked into the kamui dimension of Ren Tianyou. After this, he slowly turned around, his eyes also again changed into that newly awakened his own Magnekyo Sharingan, then firmly stared at the 4 peoples of Ximen clan in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>At the moment when Ren Tianyou had opened his eyes, Ximen Zhou merely felt that something had suddenly change in the surrounding space. After that when his fist reached just about 5 centimeters away from the body of Ren Tianyou, he suddenly felt that his fist had hit an invisible barrier, and no matter how much he tried he was not able to advance forward his fist. Not only that, but after he withdrew his fist, tried to walked behind, but similarly bumped into an invisible barrier, stopping his path. It seems he was enclosed inside this less than 3 meters space prison, no matter which direction walked, he had no way out. And sensing something peculiar, Ximen Wuyuan slowly walked over, but what was unexpected thing for Ximen Zhou and other was, the body of Ximen Wuyuan unexpectedly passed through the body of Ximen Zhou without any resistance.</p><br/><p>And after about 10 seconds, Ximen Zhou once again sensed invisible space fluctuation just like that of before, and as if there was never a barrier around him, the barrier around him disappeared without a single trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026..what is going on here?\u201d After he was freed, continuously recalling that strange state, Ximen Zhou was confused inside his heart, and didn\u2019t understand what had just happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Feeling the abilities of his newly awakened eyes, furthermore continuously flowing in information on those abilities of his eyes, Ren Tianyou slowly opened his mouth, \u201cIt seems the abilities of my eyes are pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thanks to the extremely deep regret he felt due to killing his elder sister Yue\u2019er with his own hand, furthermore the disappearance of that portion of love from his heart, these sentiment of Ren Tianyou slowly reflected in his eyes, which finally cause Mangekyo Sharingan with his own pattern which only belongs to Ren Tianyou himself to appear in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The doujutsu awakened in his right eye was the ability that had something to do with space, that was the doujutsu he had used just a moment ago\u2014\u2014Other side. The principle of using this ability of his right eye was just like camera, his right eye would capture the figure of anything, and with that thing as a center a space with 3 meters radius is cut off from this space, and for a short time, this 3 meter radius space including that thing inside would stay in a cross-sectional state, thereby absolutely trapping the enemy for a short time.</p><br/><p>That is to say, at that time Ximen Zhou and 3 meter space around him was in fact already cut off from the original space by the ability of Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes. It means at that time, Ximen Zhou was not in the original space, rather moved to cross-sectional space by the ability of Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes. So Ximen Wuyan directly passed through the body of Ximen Zhou, naturally because the body of Ximen Zhou was already not in the same space as XImen Wuyan. This doujutsu consumed relatively small amount of eye power to maintain it for 10 seconds or less, but if he expend comparatively larger amount of eye power, then he could maintain this ability for as long as he wishes up to the maximum limit of 10 minutes. And this skill could also be used on own self too.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, the principle of this ability and kamui of Obito\u2019s right eye was similar, nevertheless this ability had more benefits than Obito\u2019s right eye. That\u2019s right the ability of his right eye can also affect the body of others, completely stopping them for a short time, and sending them away from reality world. In this brief moment when the enemy was trapped, he could do other matters, for example, attack another enemy, or just flee. And this ability could be used on himself too, causing the same kind of effect as kamui.</p><br/><p>And this ability could be launched instantly without any delay. Even if the enemy is already right before his eyes, he could instantly use this ability to stop this enemy, making this close proximity as if far away at the end of the world, with no means to touch, this is the origin of the name of this doujutsu\u2014\u2014Other side.</p><br/><p>But this ability also had a little downside, i.e. once you use this doujutsu, you can use this doujutsu again only after the cool down time of 20 seconds. So in this 20 seconds cool down time period, this doujutsu couldn\u2019t be use no matter what.</p><br/><p>And his right eye could clearly see through every dimensional cross-section around him, and Ren Tianyou could step on these cross-section he see with his right eye, making it possible for him to walk in the air. Because he is just stepping on the dimensional cross-section, walking in the sky is just like walking on the ground for Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>And the ability of Ren Tianyou\u2019s left eye was unexpectedly related to time. In Naruto world, with the exception of Madara who had doujutsu related to time, there was no another person who had the ability related to time.</p><br/><p>The ability of Ren Tianyou\u2019s left eye was called Solidify forever. This ability could stop, forward or rewind the movement of people and things for a sort duration. This ability could be used on oneself or on others, completely depends upon the intention of Ren Tianyou. But this doujutsu also had 5 second cool down time. Although currently he could only stop, forward and rewind time by very short time, but increasing the eye power of his left eye could increase this duration. Nevertheless the ability to control the time truly was excessively heaven defying ability. Ren Tianyou guessed that he would be able to maintain this doujutsu for only about 5 or less seconds even if he exert all of the chakra inside his body. But contrary to expectation, maintaining it for one second, didn\u2019t consume big amount.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>After sensing his ability, Ren Tianyou stared at Ximen Batian who was hiding behind Ximen Zhou and others, eyes flashed with dense killing intent. Regarding this person, no matter how, Ren Tianyou would not let him go. Thinking this, Ren Tianyou slowly walked towards Ximen Zhou and others. While walking, a large amount of eye power slowly gushed out from his both eyes, and slowly unusual purple lighting spark appeared around body, which slowly formed a huge skeleton.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

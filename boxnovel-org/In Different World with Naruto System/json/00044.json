He had already exerted his effort for more than an hour but he was still unable to completely cut off this single leaf. At most he had cut off only half of that single leaf.</p><br/><p>He stood up, he threw away the leaf inside his hand which was already changed into pieces. Looking around he saw that his shadow clones were still struggling hard. Inside his heart he sighed with emotion, \u201cAi, it seems like it would take a bit longer to completely master this nature change of wind element. And right now this waterfall is also useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease.\u201d Ren Tian You got rid of shadow clone jutsu, immediately all the shadow clones turned into smokes and disappeared. And Ren Tian You stood there with his eyes closed, and think over and absorb the experiences of the shadow clones. Of course the fatigue of all the clones were also passed over to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I still need to make a great effort to cultivate.\u201d All the unsuccessful experiences of shadow clones appeared in his mind, then he sighed. After that he concentrate his mind, all the surroundings around him start to distort. After his field of vision restored, he found himself sitting on the stone bed, back at his stone room.</p><br/><p>Then he get off from the stone bed, opened the stone door and exit the cultivation room.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Yun Leixiao who was sitting on the stool with his eyes closed, there was no one else in the training room.</p><br/><p>Hearing the sound of the door opening, Yun Leixiao opened his closed eyes. After seeing Ren Tianyou, he smiled and said, \u201cTianyou, how come you came out so early, there is still half an hour left for another class to start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yun Leixiao, Ren Tianyou came near Yun Leixiao, pulled up a stool and sat down next to him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m merely bored, nothing else. So I came out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, how was the effects of magic formations of the cultivation room, was it any good?\u201d Yun Leixiao asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, not bad, especially that illusion magic formation.\u201d Ren Tianyou spoke his honest feeling. Although ninjutsu had extremely large advantage, still these effect of magical formation, couldn\u2019t be created with ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the effect of this 6th cultivation ground is not that good. 1st to 3rd cultivation grounds have the best effects and all the magic formations there are many times stronger than here. But you need to fight on your own for those cultivation room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can you tell me more about this cultivation room ranking competition? Since I am a new student here, I am not that clear about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, I can tell you about that.\u201d Following that Yun Leixiao gave the detail explanation about the rules of the competition and finally said, \u201cLast time, in the cultivation room ranking competition, our class altogether result was too poor. So we were assigned this 6th cultivation room. Originally, 1st to 3rd cultivation room were prepared for the 3 special class of our Supreme light academy. But now actually\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026ah it\u2019s driving me mad.\u201d Yun Leixiao became angry while speaking about the last cultivation room ranking competition. It was so because, due to this matter, Yun Leixiao was many times ridiculed by other teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is like that.\u201d Hearing the detail explanation, Ren Tianyou clearly understood about this ranking competition. The competition of this Supreme light academy adopts the unconventional method. The most important factor of this competition was the accumulated points. This competition not only tests the strength of individuals, but also the overall strength of whole class. This was so because the teacher of Supreme light academy attach great importance to the development of strength of all the students, and not worship individualistic heroism. After all, if the strength of only one student is high and other all is mediocre, then that teacher is disqualified. As a result the top level of Supreme light academy implemented this rule in the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn last time ranking match, strongest student of our class obtained 3rd position. And among remaining 4, only 2 of them were within top 10, and remaining didn\u2019t make into top 10. So the overall result was extremely poor.\u201d Yun Leixiao sighed and carried on talking, \u201cThe one to obtain 1st position was Wang Yanli of magic court. He is peak magic master of fire system. 2nd was Li Xinyun of illusion court. He is also peak illusion master. Both of them are extremely strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou actually didn\u2019t care about the strength of these people. If he and that Yan Xinluo of undead clan took part in this competition, then it was guaranteed that the top 2 position would go to their class. Now experiencing the effects of magic formations of 6th cultivation room, Ren Tianyou was quite interested towards the 1st three cultivation rooms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still more than a month time from next ranking competition. Form the test before, I have the rough understanding about the strength level of both you and Yan Xinluo. I hope both of you will make an extra effort to get a good result for our class in next ranking competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, teacher. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered. Without regard for whether it for his personal feeling or for others, he would try his best. And after he had started learning ninjutsu, compared to before his heart desire for battle was very large. And he himself was doubting whether he had become more violent or not!</p><br/><p>At this time, a strong magic fluctuation spurt out from the cultivation rooms. Ren Tianyou and Yun Leixiao stopped their conversation, and looked towards the cultivation rooms.</p><br/><p>Along with the fluctuation of magic, all the stone doors of cultivation room opened and then all students inside came out one by one. Actually there was the time limit to use the cultivation room, you could only use 2 hours per day. If used 4 hours or more, then the magic fluctuation inside the room will alert the cultivating people. After all, maintaining these magic formation requires extremely large amount of energy. So no one knows how much resources or gold coins Supreme light academy spends daily in order to operate this magic formation daily. So this magic formation is not possible to use for infinite time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, everyone come here. Now I will explain about several combat skills.\u201d Seeing all the person had arrived, Yun Leixiao started to explain the content of the lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already know that, the combat skill of warriors are divided into heaven, earth, black and yellow\u2014these 4 grade and 16 rank. Combat skill is incomparably important for us humans, because combat skills maximize our strength. Even to the extent of 200% or even 300%.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe warrior cultivate battle qi and that is the source of all our strength. And combat skills guides us to use this strength efficiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give you an example. The most common low-yellow grade combat skill, Rolling stone fist. I believe everybody knows about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yun Leixiao asked about the Rolling stone fist, everyone nodded their heads. From this you could see that this Rolling stone fist cultivation manual was most common at Divine wind continent and most of the people possessed this cultivation manual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe principle of Rolling stone fist is to combine your battle qi with physical strength of your body. With this you can make a reasonable use of your physical strength. And I think I don\u2019t need to tell any more about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the principle of higher level combat skill is also similar. But the higher level combat skill consumes high amount of battle qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, I cultivate mid-black grade combat skill, thunderbolt hand. The principle of this skill is to compress violent thunder battle qi in your hand then hit your target. And destroy the target from inside, i.e. shaking and breaking everything inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigher the grade of combat skills, extremely larger the help in the cultivation. And also help cultivator to draw out more strength during the battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe might of heaven grade combat skill is even more monstrous. It can be combined with the power of void and can extinguish everything before the eyes. For example, the mid-heaven grade combat skill of our dean, Angry howl of Wind god. He had once used this combat skill against the low level Mythological beast, Violent lion of magical beasts forest. And this combat skill had directly killed it and a mile radius of the ground was completely flattened.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Actually there was nothing much to organize, as all the magical beast cores he got from killing magical beasts for 2 years, were kept within a storage scroll and then stored in his ninja backpack.</p><br/><p>As for this ninja backpack,it was even more mystical, obviously it was only palm sized, but capable to hold several shuriken, kunai and scrolls and still had room left. It had a quite similar effect as those spatial storage rings from the memory of Ximan Tian Long. It\u2019s just that the storage space of most of those rings were comparable to his own ninja backpack. He must get one of those.</p><br/><p>After arranging everything, he was ready to leave Magical Beasts forest, this would be his first official tour of Divine Wind Continent.</p><br/><p>But after he had travelled for half a day, he was starting to become a little dumbfounded as he found himself lost. He had only seen trees and even more trees in his journey. He didn\u2019t even see the shadow of a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, this is so pathetic.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at several trees that he had never seen before, the corner of the mouth twitched a few times, and he yelled at the sky with grief and indignation. On Earth, he had no sense of direction, he didn\u2019t expect this defect was also brought into this world. Although he had memory of Ximen Tian Long, but this fellow was always in the capital city \u2018Ka luo er\u2019 of Country of Emperor Ai le, and never been to the outside world. After he was expelled from the Ximan house and ran all the way here, before he could change his life, the assassins who were sent by his elder brother had killed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, I didn\u2019t find the path on the ground, now I, your father, will travel through the sky.\u201d He gloomily crushed and took out a scroll, quickly drew the picture of an eagle on it and quickly formed the hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinja Art\u2014Super Beast Scroll.\u201d After completing his jutsu, a black coloured ink eagle flew out from the scroll. He immediately jumped on its back, ordered the eagle to fly into the sky and flew away.</p><br/><p>The sight he saw when he flew into the sky almost caused him to fall. He could only see a vast expanse of trees, even to the extent that his Mangekyo Sharingan\u2019s couldn\u2019t see the end of this sea of trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I learn that I was at the outer surrounding of Magical Beasts forest from the memory of the former owner of this body? Now look at this, it doesn\u2019t resemble the outer surrounding but seems to be the inner part of Magical Beasts forest. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly he came up with a possibility, black lines start appearing on his face and his lips unconsciously twitched. If the memory of this body was not wrong then, just before, he had gone in the opposite direction, not only didn\u2019t he leave the forest, but on the contrary he had entered the inner part of the Magical Beasts forest.</p><br/><p>After understanding this, he ordered the ink eagle to fly towards the direction from where he had come. The ink eagle quickly flew towards the direction in which Ren Tian You wanted. After flying about 3 hours, he suddenly felt that the trees beneath him were becoming scarce, and were also not as sturdy and tall like before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, finally I\u2019m leaving this damned place.\u201d Seeing the changes, he happily laughed in the sky. He had spent more than 2 years in the forest without contacting another human, and living his life almost like a primitive savage. If it weren\u2019t for his goals, he wouldn\u2019t have enough willpower to stay in Magical Beast forest for such a long time.</p><br/><p>He removed his Super Beast Scroll, immediately the eagle which was under him and flying in the sky him turned into a mass of ink. His body made a beautiful arc in the sky and accurately landed on the trunk of a tree.</p><br/><p>He started to quickly run towards the exit of the Magical Beasts forest jumping from one branch to another. If he had blatantly left the Magical Beast forest while riding the beast from Super Beast scroll, then he would have definitely become the center of attention. And he didn\u2019t want to stand out. From his time on Earth, he knew that there were many advantages if he didn\u2019t stand out too much.</p><br/><p>Very quickly he saw other human beings, all of them were from a single mercenary party. There is no lack of parties and solo mercenaries. They all came to Magical Beast forest to obtain magical beast cores. Everyday many of the mercenaries are forever buried inside Magical Beasts forest. Also countless people would come here because they could earn their livelihood by hunting these magical beasts and also had the dream to earn fortune here and live without any worries for the rest of their lives. All these people are living their life on the edge of the knife.</p><br/><p>Before long these mercenaries discovered this youth with strange clothing, this youth had a kind of special charm on other people, but after they looked at this youth carefully, they found out that this youth\u2019s strength was only at intermediate fighter level, at once disdain appeared in their face. In their eyes, this youth was some youngster of a noble family who did not understands anything, and wanted to enter Magical Beast forest for experience and training, but after entering it, discovered the cruelty of Magical Beasts Forest and returned back. As a result these mercenaries ignored him.</p><br/><p>While on the other hand, Ren Tian You suddenly wanted to look up to the Heavens and roar one time to vent off the excitement in his heart, after seeing another human after a long time. Fortunately he suppressed this impulse, or else these peoples would have treated him as madman. After he discovered the ridicule in their eyes, he understood the ideas of these people and started thinking for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it seems my plan to disguise as wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing works as intended. All of these people haven\u2019t noticed my chakra.\u201d</p><br/><p>He touched his nose and thought. He didn\u2019t cultivate battle qi so this was the result. He had formulated a great plan to disguise himself as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing when he traveled through the Divine Wind continent, these people only saw him as an intermediate fighter and became careless, but when they fought with him, they would discover he is not that weak and small rabbit, rather a powerful tiger.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t waste any more thought on what they were thinking, and continued to quickly run towards the exit of the Magical Beasts forest. As he was too excited, he unconsciously ran at his full speed.</p><br/><p>The current speed of Ren Tian You was excessively fast. Even though he had not used his chakra, that speed was not the speed an ordinary person could catch up to , basically on Earth, this speed was comparable to the speed of a BMW. In a blink of an eye he disappeared from the eyes of these mercenaries, leaving only a dust cloud behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, boss, is this the speed of an intermediate fighter?\u201d The mercenary standing next to the boss could only stare in awe and ask stammeringly.</p><br/><p>The speed of Ren Tian You had also scared the boss. Damn it! Since when was the speed of an intermediate fighter, faster than I, your father, a great swordsman. His world view till now completely shattered. And hearing the question of his younger brother, he also stammeringly and uncertainty answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 possible\u2026 probably\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to his boss, he started to look at his boss with disdain. This is an intermediate fighter! This intermediate fighter is faster than you who is a great swordsman.</p><br/><p>Seeing the look filled with disdain in that younger brother eyes, the color of the boss\u2019s face suddenly changed with shame and humiliation.</p><br/><p>And yelled at his younger brother</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, what\u2019s with the look in your eyes? Actually you don\u2019t believe in the words of I, your father. Your commission of this month is confiscated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Ah, boss, I was wrong. Don\u2019t do this to me. My mother is 80 years old , and I have\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201dAfter hearing the words of his boss, the younger brother\u2019s face instantly collapsed and started whining.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You didn\u2019t know what had happened after he left, currently he was still running towards the exit of the forest, and finally he no longer saw trees and a path appeared before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, finally I, your father left. All the beautiful ladies of this world, wait for me to arrive!\u201d</p><br/><p>He roared, it startled countless birds and beasts, and his figure disappeared from this path.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

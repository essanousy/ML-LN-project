And I will let you all accompany me to dance together.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, Ren Tianyou suddenly dashed towards the soldiers in front of him without any fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you kill him for me!\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou had actually took the initiative to initiate the attack, Baluoda immediately gave order to attack. Hearing the command of Baluoda, all the demon soldiers tried to overcome the fear in their heart, and brazenly initiated assault towards Ren Tianyou again.</p><br/><p>As the distance gradually narrowed, and when Ren Tianyou and those soldiers of Demon clan were about to make contact, Ren Tianyou heavily stepped on the ground, then soaring high up in the sky, and raising the bone sword in his hand, he rapidly rushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018Puchi\u2019, \u2018puchi\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026the sounds of sword stabbing through the body resounded. The white bone sword in the hand of Ren Tianyou had stabbed through that seemingly hard armors of Demon clan, then along with dark red blood flowing out from their body, they lied on the ground motionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Step\u2019 sound. Ren Tianyou landed on the ground, then half-squatting above the ground, he looked at those soldiers of Demon clan all around him. At that time, the scene of those tortured and deformed humans he had seen at Soul Breaking Cliff appeared in his mind, and strong killing intent rose inside his heart, then spat out one word, \u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsubaki no Mai! (Camellia Dance!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, his body changed into a white light and rushed forward quickly. And coordinating with Ren Tianyou\u2019s exquisite taijutsu, the bone sword in his right hand gave rise to white light while cutting all the soldiers of Demon clan obstructing his path, including their seemingly hard armors. This bone sword of Ren Tianyou could cut through even iron and steel, let alone these armors.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, Hundred li Blood Killing Formation!\u201d Seeing the unscrupulous massacre in the middle of the crowd, the demonic intent within the body of these soldiers of Demon clan instantly set off. After that along with the roar of all the soldiers of Demon clan in unison, they raised their spear, then blood colored energy mist emitted from their body. Then horizontally holding the spear with their right hand, all of them changed into a blood colored light rushing towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Hundred li Blood Killing Formation was one of the most frequently seen battle formation. They would combine massacre energy which they had obtained from the war of all the year around within their body, then all of them would initiate unceasing assault towards their target, so that the enemy couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing rapidly rushing towards him soldiers of Demon clan, Ren Tianyou just snorted coldly in disdain. After that circulating chakra within his body, the muscles of the bear stomach and back of Ren Tianyou unceasingly wriggled, then sharp bones rapidly broke out from his body. Looking at current Ren Tianyou from far away, he would resemble a hedgehog with sharp thorns all over the body.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, the body of Ren Tianyou began to spin unceasingly, then advance in all direction rapidly towards those assaulting soldiers of Demon clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this, Karamatsu no Mai! (Larch Dance!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with those rapidly assaulting soldiers of Demon clan, and Ren Tianyou\u2019s that rapid spinning form sweeping away, a series of blood-curdling sound resounded. Countless bones had stabbed through the body of many soldier. Some had their thigh stabbed, some had their throat stabbed, and some even had their head stabbed. Right now the ground of this square was thoroughly dyed with dark red blood.</p><br/><p>When the blood-curdling screams stopped, Ren Tianyou also stopped spinning and stood on the ground. Now corpses of demon soldiers lied on the ground around him, and blood was still flowing out from their corpses\u2019 cuts. Right now there was only less than 50 demon soldiers who were alive and were capable of standing up.</p><br/><p>And those terrifying looking bones on the body of Ren Tianyou slowly sank into his body, and those cut opened on his flesh also revert back to the previous state without a trace of single scar.</p><br/><p>Then looking around the disaster he had created himself, an unusually evil smile appeared on the handsome face of Ren Tianyou, then he said, \u201cThis dance is very beautiful.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was standing in front of Wang Yanli and had blocked the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungster, don\u2019t take things too far. I will let go of this matter and the matter of you destroying the barrier, but from now on don\u2019t attack the participants.\u201d Long Feilu stroked his beard and looking at the lightning covered Ren Tianyou, then he said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cStep aside.\u201d Seeing Long Feilu was blocking his path, Ren Tianyou coldly call out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungster, just clam down. Don\u2019t get too angry.\u201d Hearing the cold shout of Ren Tianyou, Long Feilu didn\u2019t get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-just-get-out-of-my-way.\u201d Staring at Long Feilu, Ren Tianyou said word by word. Then his eyes involuntarily changed into Mangekyo Sharingan. A strong power was showed unintentionally, and a dark purple colored energy started to sprang out from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, stop.\u201d At this moment, suddenly he heard a voice from behind him. Then his dark purple colored energy quickly started to disappeared, and his eyes also turned back to normal.</p><br/><p>Sun Chuqian regained her consciousness, then seeing the confrontation between Ren Tianyou and dean, immediately she was utterly terrified, then without losing any time she yelled to stop Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Sun Chuqian had already regained her consciousness, Ren Tianyou took a glance at Long Feilu and Wang Yanli. Then he turned around and return back to the location of his classmates.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you, Chuqian? You all right?\u201d Arriving at the side of Sun Chuqian, Ren Tianyou asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. But Tianyou, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. Thinking back to the time jut now, when he was just about to use Susanoo, and destroy everything, he fell into a deep thought.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the eyes of Ren Tianyou flashed, and came up with a possibility. He remembered that before on the earth, when he was looking at Naruto anime, one time Sasuke had asked about the Uchiha clan to 2nd Hokage. At that time 2nd Hokage had said something. Ren Tianyou firmly remembered those things.</p><br/><p>According to explanation of 2nd Hokage, the strength of Uchiha and Senju clan were originally based on their strength in love, but there is no other clan that feels deeper love than the Uchiha clan, and that was why they suppressed and sealed it away. But once they know love and affection, it was almost like all of their emotions are released, and then awaken the profound love and power that surpass all. However when their loved person or maybe a good friend received any injuries or they lose that deep love, then that love was immediately disappear and replaced by an even stronger hatred. And this deep hatred manifest at their eyes, that is exactly the Sharingan. The stronger the hatred, the powerful the doujutsu becomes. Because of this, it gave rise to Madara. As a result Uchiha clan was also referred to as can possessed by devil.</p><br/><p>And now he owns a Sharingan, so perhaps his blood lineage had already transformed into the blood lineage of Uchiha clan. So at the time when he saw his close friend had received a serious injuries, thus simulating a very strong hatred towards Wang Yanli and wanting to destroy him regardless of anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I\u2019m all right.\u201d After thinking everything, Ren Tianyou expression changed back to normal.</p><br/><p>Passing the figure of Ren Tianyou, Sun Chuqian stared towards Wang Yanli who had a complicated expression on his face, then she said to dean Long Feilu, \u201cDean, I give up on this match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, although there was a minor incident in this match, still fortunately there was not any casualties. Now I announce Wang Yanli as the winner of this match. And let\u2019s continue the competition.\u201d After finish speaking, he took a quick glance at Ren Tianyou, then he disappeared from the arena.</p><br/><p>After this Ren Tianyou removed his illusion from the judge, and the judge could move again, but those demonic eyes will forever leave a deep imprint within his mind. The judge called earth system magicians, they restored the arena in its original state and after the barrier around the arena was renewed again with magical beasts\u2019 core, the start of 2nd match was announced.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Zhao, do you know the details of that kid who destroyed the barrier just a moment ago?\u201d At the VIP area, Long Feilu seriously asked towards Zhao Guanghui.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never see this kid and also am unable to see the origin of his combat skills, what\u2019s going on? Don\u2019t tell me he have a problem?\u201d Seeing the serious expression of Long Feilu, Zhao Guanghui seriously answered and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now I felt a chill from the demonic eyes of that kid, especially after his eyes changed and when he released that purple colored energy from his body, I actually felt a fear, even though that purpled colored energy had flashed for only an instant.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou at the audience, Long Feilu thought about the situation just a moment ago, and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing Long Feilu, Zhao Guanghui suddenly cried out in alarm. You should know that Long Feilu was a genuine mid-god class warrior, however now he was saying that he felt a fear from a 17 or 18 years old youth. How can he not feel surprise hearing this?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of the judge, the magical screen of the square started to flash with the names of remaining participants. Finally 2 names appeared on the screen. Ren Tianyou VS Li Xinyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, be careful. The illusions of Li Xinyun is not that simple. She was ranked second in the previous competition.\u201d Seeing the names on the screen, Wang Haiqing warned Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that easy to defeat, also you should know that I have promised our beautiful teacher to being back the championship, so there is no chance for me to lose.\u201d Ren Tianyou smiled and then moved towards the arena. \u2018Illusions, hei hei, I\u2019m sorry, I have this Mangekyo Sharingan. I don\u2019t feel a tiny bit of fear against illusions.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stepped on the arena, wait for a while, then a female wearing a white clothing came on to the arena.

Then without losing any time he calmed down his state of mind, and prepare to fight. This was not the time to admire the beautiful girls.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And seeing the flames in front of them were getting weaker, the rhinoceros blood beasts on the ground also quickly advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing that blood beasts were advancing towards him from both air and ground, Ren Tianyou did not panic, but he quickly made a series of hand seals with both of his hands. Within 2 seconds, he completed making the required series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuton\u2014\u2014Atsugai! (Wind style\u2014\u2014Pressure Damage!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with a rumbling sound, the body of Ren Tianyou released a powerful compressed hurricane towards the crowd of ferocious birds. This powerful gale blew off the big trees around him, and those ferocious bird blood beasts who were flying towards him were also blown off. And many of them were torn apart into pieces by this fierce wind.</p><br/><p>Just after he successfully used Atsugai (Pressure Damage), Ren Tianyou landed on the ground. Then looked towards innumerable rhinoceros blood beasts with red eyes who were advancing towards him while heavily trampling on the ground. The grounds were trembling as if huge cataract was advancing towards him.</p><br/><p>After landing on the ground, he quickly stirred the chakra inside his body, then the surface of the body was instantly covered by a layer of powerful lightning chakra, which slowly took the form of dazzling lightning armor. After that his right leg heavily stepped above the ground causing a huge crater to appear on the ground, then Ren Tianyou turned into a blur of lightning and disappeared form that location.</p><br/><p>Immediately after disappearing by leaving an after image in his original location, the figure of Ren Tianyou could be seen advancing towards the crowds of rhinoceros blood beasts. Ren Tianyou had already jumped in the sky and was spinning towards the middle of crowds of rhinoceros blood beasts. Just when he was about to land on the ground, the lightning light around his right leg suddenly changed into a huge lightning battle-ax, which straightly went down towards the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirochin Doroppu! (Guillotine Drop!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After the right leg of Ren Tianyou which had changed into a huge lightning battle-ax dropped towards the ground, the rhinoceros blood beasts which was directly below Ren Tianyou was immediately cut into 2 halves, and its body changed into a mist of blood which fell on the ground around it. But Ren Tianyou had used large amount of chakra to use this big move of Raikage, so how could this ninjutsu have so little effect.</p><br/><p>After his right leg split apart this rhinoceros blood beast, his right leg heavily landed on the ground. Then his right leg emitted out the powerful lightning chakra, which took the shape of spider web and spread in all direction very quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplode.\u201d After landing on the ground, Ren Tianyou raised his head, a pair of blood-red Sharingan showed a ruthless smiling expressing, then he lightly spoke a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d, \u201chong\u201d, \u201chongI\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Just after Ren Tianyou had spoken that single word, immediately the ground around send out a series of loud explosion sounds. After that the blood beasts surrounding him suddenly started to shriek miserably. And in the midst of this explosion, the limbs of countless rhinoceros blood beasts were blown into pieces, and were flying everywhere, and numerous bloods were splashing everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Only the sound of roaring could be heard all around the surroundings, after seeing the death of their own kinds, those rhinoceros blood beasts roared even loudly, then as if they were injected with simulant they became even more violent. And in the sky, under the Atsugai (Pressure Damage) of Ren Tianyou, losing many of their kinds, those ferocious birds were also not calm. Staring at Ren Tianyou on the ground with their fierce eyes, they also prepare themselves to rush down towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, this time I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Standing in the middle of the slaughtered blood beast, Ren Tianyou looked all around him, furthermore from his mental perception he could clearly sense that there were even more blood beasts who were violently rushing towards him. \u201cLooking at this circumstances, it seems I have attracted almost all of the blood beasts from all around this 1st domain. And if this goes on, sooner or later I will be torn into pieces and then eaten by these beasts. And furthermore I want to enter the 2nd floor of this Tower of Babel, and I don\u2019t know where the member of demon clan are sealed. So now I don\u2019t have any time to waste in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou was fighting, his mental perception had always covered the range of 100 meters around him, so even the minute activity within this range would alert him.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact what Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know was, precisely because of his this action, he had caused almost all of the blood beasts of this 1st domain to gather in this place, and greatly reduce the quantity of blood beast in other areas of this domain, this let other participants to smoothly travel all the way without encountering any difficulty and obstacles. And they had easily passed through this 1st domain and entered the 2nd domain already. If Ren Tianyou was to know that his current action had directly given a wedding dress to everyone else, then Ren Tianyou would definitely vomit a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must leave this place without wasting any more time.\u201d Looking at the continuously growing crowds of blood beasts, now he could see, not only these two types of blood beasts, but many other types of blood beasts too. Most of them were staring at Ren Tianyou with red eyes, and other low level blood beasts were eating the corpse of the dead blood beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar\u201d, \u201croar\u201d, \u201croar\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Those blood beasts roared, then they started to rush towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the blood beasts were rushing towards him from all direction, Ren Tianyou instantly became alert. In fact, he had thought to directly flee from this place using kamui, but the time required to absorb himself with his kamui of right eye was extremely slow. And in this current situation, he didn\u2019t have enough time to absorb himself with this speed. So Ren Tianyou had no other choice but to think of other way to flee from this place.</p><br/><p>When those blood beasts were about to arrive before Ren Tianyou, he heavily stepped on the ground with his right leg, then he jumped towards the sky. But those ferocious bird blood beasts were waiting for Ren Tianyou in the sky, they flapped their wings and violently advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must use a big move, and open up a path.\u201d Seeing that he was surrounded form all side, and furthermore seeing those ferocious birds flying towards him, the eyes of Ren Tianyou slowly changed. After that a powerful eye power slowly sprang out from his eyes, and suddenly a purple colored energy appeared above his body, which slowly condescend into a huge purple colored energy skeletal that surrounded the whole body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying beasts, now it\u2019s time to die.\u201d Looking at the bird blood beasts which had already arrived in front of him, Ren Tianyou smiled with a disdain. After that even more eye power sprang out very quickly from his eyes, and very soon a lofty skeleton demon god with a bottle gourd in its right hand, and shield in its left hand, whose whole body was emitting a purple colored flame appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cSusanoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked towards the ferocious birds before his eyes, then a pallid light flashed in his eyes. After that Sword of Totsuka suddenly appeared in the hand of Susanoo and its long fiery blade advanced towards those herds of flying ferocious birds.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

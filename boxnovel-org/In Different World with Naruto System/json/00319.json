Seeing this, the eyes of Ren Tianyou narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a big bosom\u2026\u2026\u201d Ren Tianyou swallowed a mouthful of saliva, while thinking. But at that time, a loud sound suddenly interrupted his thoughts, and attracted the gaze of everyone.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast, monstrous waves had directly hit the barrier surrounding the ship. Immediately after that the barrier unceasingly rippled, and the ship also shook on the sea surface, as if it would capsize at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d A loud roar issued by Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast caused the seawater around it to seethe unceasingly, as if there was a huge storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, it\u2019s Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast!\u201d Standing on the deck, Ling Weiwei supported Yun Muqing beside her and exert great efforts to stabilize her body. And seeing Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast was already close to her ship, she said in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, no need to worry, I will take care of this big fellow.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Ling Weiwei. Then large amount of chakra erupted from his body which rapidly covered the entire ship, make this unceasingly swaying big ship completely stable.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, he created a shadow clone, and left him on the deck, in case the battle outside spread to this place and injure Ling Weiwei and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy clone will stay onboard, and you all quickly sail away from this place in order to avoid the effect of the battle. I am going to resolve that big fellow.\u201d Finished speaking, he directly passed through the barrier and flew towards Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero!\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou flying towards Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast, Ling Weiwei anxiously yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no need to worry, with only the strength of this fellow, it can\u2019t even scratch him, so you can be at ease.\u201d Seeing the worried expression of Ling Weiwei, the clone of Ren Tianyou said with a smile. \u201cOkay, quickly sail away from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou flew out from the barrier, and seeing the ship was already far away from him, he bit the index finger of his right hand, then making a series of hand seals, \u201cSummoning Jutsu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the right hand falling down to the midair, a mysterious black colored rune appeared in the midair. After that along with \u2018peng\u2019 sound, large amount of white smoke appeared out of thin air.</p><br/><p>After this smoke dissipated, Sanbi Isobu had already appeared there in the waters, and its body was emitting powerful aura. As for Ren Tianyou, he was standing on its back with his hands folded in front of his chest.</p><br/><p>Although the strength of this Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast was nowhere near Ren Tianyou, and dealing with it was also not that hard, but this place after all was sea area, and here it occupies terrain advantage, moreover his water style was somewhat weaker too, so he decided to summon Sanbi to quickly deal with it.</p><br/><p>When all was said and done, Ling Weiwei and other were behind him, and to protect them, it was better to conclude battle as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsobu, I leave this big fellow to you.\u201dRen Tianyou said to Sanbi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Isobu answered. Shortly afterwards, its body emitted powerful chakra, rapidly stirring the sea surface beside it. Shortly afterwards, several huge waterspout changed into a huge water dragon, and advanced towards Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuiton\u2014-Suiryudan no Jutsu! (Water Style\u2014-Water Dragon Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast roared, then the surrounding sea water began to roll over and over rapidly. After that huge water wave appeared in front of it, and changed into a water barrier, blocking the water dragon attack.</p><br/><p>On the other side, on the rapidly sailing away ship, after they reached safe sea area, looking at the battle in the distant between Sanbi and Ocean Capsizing Heavenly Beast, everyone stared without being able to take their eyes off the distant battle. This type of battle was a very rare sight for these average people.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect you are actually already this strong.\u201d Ling Weiwei said to the clone of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it\u2019s just ordinary. Compared to those true experts, I am still very far away.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t lost himself and became arrogant because of the words of Ling Weiwei. Now he was at least weaker than Demon Empress Yaorao, in front of whom, even fleeing away was very difficult to accomplish.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask, have you ever been to God Weeping Region?\u201d At that time, Yun Muqing walked over and asked while looking at Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Yun Muqing in front of him. Her 1.6 meter height and frail stature gave people a kind of delicate feeling, provoking their tenderness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot to introduce you two, Zero, this beauty is my best friend, and her name is Yun Muqing. And she is the second Miss of Light Temple\u2019s Grand Marshal.\u201d Ling Weiwei pointed at Yun Muqing and introduced her to Ren Tianyou, then again pointing towards Ren Tianyou, she introduced him to Yun Muqing, \u201cQingqing, this scoundrel is called Zero. He is the leader of that most mysterious Akatsuki Organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Ling Weiwei bent over and whispered in the ear of Yun Muqing, \u201cIn addition this fellow is a big pervert. You should be careful around him, so that he wouldn\u2019t take any cheap advantage of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026!\u201d With Ren Tianyou\u2019s current level, how could this whispering of Ling Weiwei escape the ear of Ren Tainyou? So hearing this he could only cough few times. Then looking at Yun Muqing, he said, \u201cHow did you know that I have been to God Weeping Region? It seems we have never meet before. Weiwei, did you tell her about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t told anyone about this matter. Oh, that\u2019s right, Qingqing, how did you know about this matter?\u201d Ling Weiwei also asked curiously to Yun Muqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have really been to God Weeping Region, that\u2019s good, I have finally found you.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou had really been to God Weeping Region, Yun Muqing was excited. Shortly afterwards, to the surprise of everyone, she directly knelt down to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ren Tianyou instantly came over and helped Yun Muqing to rise.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, I finally found you.\u201d With pleasant surprise expression across her face, Yun Muqing said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor?\u201d Hearing Yun Muqing addressing to him like this, he was confused. He carefully looked at Yun Muqing again, and confirm that he had never met her before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

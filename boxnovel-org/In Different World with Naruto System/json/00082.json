This directly broke off the combination skill and his attack still advanced towards those 5 spectre knights.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Along with the violent sound of explosion, Ren Tianyou hit the blockade of the 5 long spear, and within the ring of encirclement of those 5 spectre knights, the shock wave of explosion directly send them flying.</p><br/><p>Landing on the ground, Ren Tianyou kneeled down on his one knee, and looking at those 5 spectre knights who were set flying, Ren Tianyou started to make a series of hand seals in a high speed. After less than 2 seconds, a lightning system chakra suddenly rose sharply in his right hand, and the sharp sound of birds crying suddenly rang out, which attracted the gaze of the audiences.</p><br/><p>\u201cChidori!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash the body of Ren Tianyou changed into lightning beam, and rushed forward. Then in an instant the lightning light of his right hand destroyed the head of one spectre knight, then immediately the death qi of that spectre knight dissipated, and its body changed into a pile of skeleton on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stopping his step, in an instance Ren Tianyou changed his direction, and advanced to yet another spectre knight. And following the same pattern, this spectre knight also was destroyed and became a pile of skeleton under the attack of Ren Tanyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou continued to rush towards yet another spectre knight which was retreating, but after few second this spectre knight stopped, and stood their firmly. Then looking at incoming Ren Tianyou, under the helmet the two hollow eyes flashed and it poured its death qi towards its long spear. Then it waved its long spear, and suddenly with an indomitable momentum stabbed the spear towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>The Sharingan of Ren Tianyou firmly stared at the stab of the spear, and just when the spear was about to stab his body, Ren Tianyou just tilted his body and move his body out of the trajectory of come spear. After that in a flash, he hit the head of spectre knight with the Chidori of his right hand, and finished it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren TInyou didn\u2019t stopped his step and continued to advance towards remaining 2 spectre knights. At that time, along with a loud dragon roar, a breath filled death qi advanced towards him from behind him. Sensing this, Ren Tianyou stepped up his speed, and only living behind his afterimage he disappeared from that location.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A grey colored dragon breath hit at the place where Ren Tianyou was just a moment ago, and immediately the corroding power of the breath corroded the ground.</p><br/><p>At several meters away, the figure of Ren Tianyou appeared. Then looking at the bone dragon and in addition Yan Xinluo who was already in front of remaining 2 spectre knights, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but make a wry smile. He hadn\u2019t expected their speed was this fast, just a moment ago he had increased his speed and power and wanted to dispose off all the spectre knights, but he didn\u2019t expect that there would still be 2 spectre knights left. Now Yan Xinluo would take precautions to some extent and would unlikely give him any chance to dispose the spectre knights easily, unless he could\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCertain kill with one hit!\u201d The eyes of Ren Tianyou flashed with a cold light, and immediately thought his next move.</p><br/><p>Looking at the three pile of bones on the arena, and remaining 2 spectre knights, gradually the expression of Yan Xinluo became serious. He didn\u2019t expect that due to his momentary error, unexpectedly he had such a big loss. And especially seeing that level of strength of Ren Tainyou, he was truly surprised as it had exceed his estimation. In less than 30 seconds after knocking him down from the bone dragon, he had passed through the blockade, then killed 3 spectre knights whose power level was comparable to Great Swordmaster. If he had not rushed over promptly, it was very likely that he would have lose these remaining 2 spectre knights too.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected you were this powerful, actually capable of killing my 3 spectre knights in an instant.\u201d Coldly looking at Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, there are still many things that you haven\u2019t thought.\u201d Ren Tianyou laughed, and sensed that his chakra was already reduced to nearly 1/3 of his chakra. \u201cNow is still not the time to use Hachimon Tonkou (The 8 inner gates), I should at least dispose off those remaining 2 spectre knights before using it.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou immediately began his next move, and in a flash leaving only afterimage, he disappeared for that location.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, still making same move, do you really think the same move will work on me twice?\u201d Looking at the disappearing Ren Tanyou, Yan Xinluo coldly snorted, and immediately urged the bone dragon to make a move. After understanding the command of its master, bone dragon issued a loud dragon roar towards the sky. Then the mouth of that huge bone dragon silently moved up and down, after that the surrounding air gradually become gloomy and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Ren Tianyou appeared next to the head of bone dragon, then waved his right hand which was covered with lightning light and punched towards the head of bone dragon. \u201cHumph, if you want to use magic, you should finish it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Ren TInyou suddenly sensed a movement above his head, then he instantly withdrew his punch and quickly retreated. After that a huge sword tip attacked at the location where Ren Tianyou was standing just a moment ago, and that attack landed on the ground creating a huge crack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible to have your way.\u201d Yan Xinoluo appeared at the place where Ren Tianyou was standing just a moment ago, he was holding Karma transmigration which was covered with undead battle qi and was firmly pointing it towards Ren Tianyou. Although his own speed was not equal to Ren Tianyou, nevertheless wanting to break through his blockade was also not that easy.</p><br/><p>Looking at the bone dragon who was in the process of chanting the magic, furthermore those 2 spectre knights hiding behind it, and in addition firmly defending Yan Xinluo, Ren Tinyou said, \u201cDo you really believe you will be able to block me like this? Excessively na\u00efve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tinyou press down on the ground with his right leg, and immediately rushed towards Yan Xinluo in a high speed. Looking at Ren Tinyou who was rushing towards him, the expression of Yan Xinluo became serious. \u201cIt is impossible to defend for a long period of time, so I should take the initiative to attack.\u201d Thinking this, he threw Karma Transmigration, then Karma transmigration immediately changed into a light beam and flew towards Ren Tinyou. Then Yan Xinluo himself too followed Karma transmigration and flew towards the direction of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Looking at Karma Transmigration which was flying towards him in a high speed, Ren Tinyou didn\u2019t stopped his steps, and continued to advance, as if he wanted to bump with the tip of Karma Transmigration. Just when Karma Transmigration was about to stab the body of Ren Tianyou, Ren Tinyou quickly formed a hand seals, and he suddenly disappeared from that location. And almost at the same time, the figure of Ren Tianyou appeared at the side of bone dragon and remaining 2 spectre knights. Actually Ren Tianyou had use Shunshin no Jutsu (Body Flicker Technique) to dodge the attack of Yan Xinluo, and instantly appeared next to bone dragon. Then looking at the bone dragon who was still in the process of chanting magic and furthermore spectre knights who were guarding it, Ren Tianyou revealed a cruel smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot Good!\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had disappeared from the original location, the pupil of Yan Xinluo firmly shrunk and he had an expression revealing he had seen something unthinkable. Then he waved his right hand, immediately interrupting his warrior skill, after that Karma Transmigration flew back in his hand, but he threw up a mouthful of blood. Because by forcedly interrupting a warrior skill, in an instant Yan Xinluo suffered severe internal injury. However now he already didn\u2019t had time deal with the injury, immediately turning around, he rushed towards the direction of Ren Tianyou, but it was a pity that he was already too late.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou instantly got rid of the 2 long spear of spectre knights, then he grabbed both of them from undead horse, then with both hands which was covered with lightning system chakra, he lifted them high in the air, then, using his extreme strength, he heavily smashed them head first onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Raiga Bomu!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014Liger bomb!)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This 5 dragon suppression domain formation, not only absorb the life-force of these 5 individuals, but also place an extremely heavy pressure. Even if this 5 dragon suppression domain formation didn\u2019t absorbed their life-force, with their physical strength, they won\u2019t be able to handle this pressure for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026..?\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at this huge blood colored light, and thought that they were about to flee. Because when he had fought against mysterious woman at Eiffle Capital, she had used a teleportation scroll to flee. So Ren Tianyou feared that they were also using some kind of method to escape. As a result, he immediately speed up and hurried towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone hurry up and get between us, we\u2019ll join our force and use Dragon blood sky transfer spell to send you away from here.\u201d Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo facing towards several younger generation of their clan, they spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat grandfather, second grandfather, the backlash of using Dragon blood sky transfer spell\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Ximen Yue\u2019er sadly stared at Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo, because she clearly knew the consequence of using Dragon blood sky transfer spell.</p><br/><p>This Dragon blood sky transfer spell was created by the first patriarch of Ximen clan, it could utilize the full power of user to cut open the space, then send the target to appointed location. And to use this spell, the user should at least have the strength level of God-rank, but using this spell would thoroughly destroy this God-ranked expert. Because even delivering a single human would exhaust all the energy within the body of this God-ranked expert, and also the battle qi core of this expert, because of forcedly drawing out all the power within the body, would thoroughly disintegrate. And this expert would downright become a cripple.</p><br/><p>And right now there were 7 individuals including Ximen Yue\u2019er, so even if Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu joined together to use this transmission spell, it could be estimate that, after using this spell, both of them would be thoroughly ruined.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake out all the space rings on your body, also take off all the items containing energies. We do not understand this space magic. We are just forcedly cutting open this space, so this space will be extremely fragile, and we cannot afford any other energy to corrode this space. If a single different energy enter this space, this space will thoroughly collapse, and every one of you will lose your life in the middle of the endless space.\u201d Ximen Shu seriously said.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they suddenly felt a violent fluctuation on the blood colored light which was surrounding them. They saw that the fiery red colored huge light sword of that huge demon god\u2019s giant hand had slashed on the blood red light. And along with the slash of that huge sword, a large amount of ripples appeared on the blood red light which was surrounding them. After that those 5 Saint ranked warriors who were sustaining the Wall of sigh formation, suddenly spit up a mouthful of blood simultaneously, and their complexion became even paler just like a paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, we don\u2019t have any time to waste. Quickly take off the things which contains any type of energy and space rings and give it to us. We will immediately get ready to use Dragon blood sky transfer spell.\u201d Ximen Xinbo immediately looked at those nervous younger generation of his clan and roared.</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiemn Xinbo, then again looking at the violently shaking blood colored light, and that huge Susanoo who was unceasingly attacking, all of them immediately started to tremble, and without losing any time they took off the space rings and hand it over to Ximen Shu.</p><br/><p>After taking those space rings, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo immediately stood opposite to each other, then simultaneously started to gather all the energies within their body. And they opened their mouth simultaneously and started to chant, \u201cI Ximen Shu/Ximen Xinbo with our blood, with its energy source, agree to exchange endless power, open blood abyss\u2019s generous first blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>After both Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo finished chanting, suddenly two, one gold and one white, two huge light beam simultaneously descended from the sky. At these two light beams, two huge energy dragons were unceasingly revolving around them and finally entered the body of Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo.</p><br/><p>Generous first blood, was a kind of taboo power which was within the blood abyss of everyone, and if opened, the blood power could materialized itself, and simultaneously recover all the exhausted energy instantly. And also can use all the power of blood. But once generous first blood is opened, only death awaits after a while.</p><br/><p>Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu had clearly understood form the beginning that they don\u2019t have enough energy inside their body to use Dragon blood sky transfer. So they had no choice but to open their Generous first blood. In any case, their one and only result in the end was death. Since they were going to die anyway, they might as well open Generous first blood to get a large amount of energy. This might increase the success rate of Dragon blood sky transfer spell.</p><br/><p>After opening Generous first blood, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo didn\u2019t have time to sense the endless extremely profound blood power inside their body. Without wasting any time, the hurriedly completed the preparation of Dragon blood sky transfer spell.</p><br/><p>After that Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo simultaneously lifted their hands, and all the energies within their bodies suddenly gushed out in beyond description pattern, then simultaneously huge gold and white energy dragon flew towards the sky, and suddenly the space of the sky gave out a \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound, then suddenly a huge black hole appeared above their head. Along with the appearance of this black hole in the space, the power of this black hole started to destroy the Wall of sigh formation. And those 5 Saint ranked warriors suddenly \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026..changed into 5 blood pools, without leaving even the bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone quickly enter.\u201d Looking at the appeared black hole, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo used all their power to maintain the balance of this black hole. Then they turned their head towards Ximen Yue\u2019er and others and roared.</p><br/><p>Ximen Yue\u2019er had a sad face looking at Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo who were exerting themselves to maintain this black hole, then she turned around and ferociously stared at Ren Tianyou with her eyes full of hatred. She resolutely stared at Ren Tianyou as if she wanted to imprint his appearance in her brain. Then yelled with her lovely voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d After that she jumped inside that black hole.</p><br/><p>When the Wall of sigh was broken, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t attack immediately to stop these peoples from leaving. He had intentionally let them leave this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, I am giving you face by letting them leave this place. But next time, when I come to Ximen clan, no one will be able to stop me. Those people who had injured me, humiliated and bully me, I must make them pay the heaviest price.\u201d Ren Tianyou muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Actually Ren Tianyou had already recognized the identity of Ximen Yue\u2019er, after all in the memory of Ximen Tianlong, she was the only one who had truly treated him fairly just like a family member. So this time to give some face to her, he had let the younger member of Ximen clan to leave. After all Ren Tianyou had chance to stop them, but he had let all of them leave this place intentionally.</p><br/><p>After last person disappeared inside the black hole, the black hole disappeared. And at the same time a cruel smile flashed on the face of Ren Tianyou behind the mask, then he directly waved Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade) towards both Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

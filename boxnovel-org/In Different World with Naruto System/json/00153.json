As long as you are willing, no one in this world can stop me from doing so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to leave with you, but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Wang Yuxin quickly said, but before she could finish speaking, Ren Tianyou interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you are willing to go with me, no one is able to stop us. I will deal with this matter first, so just wait for a moment.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou helped Wang Yuxin to sit on the high platform, then looked towards the people of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>Lying on the embrace of Ren Tianyou, and feeling that warm sensation from his body, Wang Yuxin slowly closed her eyes, \u201cForget it, just being able to see him in the last moment of my life, what else is there for regret?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the bottom, seeing his bride was lying on the embrace of Ren Tianyou, the face of Ximen Feng showed utterly discomfited expression, but due to the pain on his abdomen, he was continuously coughing, and was not able to speak anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s have a good talk about how you as a father treated me, this so-called son.\u201d Looking at Ximen Batian, Ren Tianyou blatantly said, \u201cIn those years, after you and my mother gave birth to me, my mother took me and live in the courtyard of servants. And as long as I could recall, I have never seen you set foot on the place where we lived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI as your son, because I didn\u2019t have the so-called saint dragon blood lineage of Ximen clan, from 3 years old started to chop woods, carry water\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..done this kinds of labors to earn food to eat. Because there was no one to take care of my mother when she gave birth to me, she suffered from illness, and lied on bed all year round, couldn\u2019t get up at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had no money, so not only couldn\u2019t I afford to buy a medicine for her, even for a little bit of food to eat, I had to exert my utmost to work and earn something. But even after working till dead tired, every day I got only a little bit of food, and if I don\u2019t work then I didn\u2019t get that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was 5 years old, my mother died leaving me behind. Ximen Batian, do you know how my mother died?\u201d Saying this, Ren Tianyou looked at Ximen Batian and showed a mocking smile, then continued, \u201cMy mother starved to death, yes was simply starved to death. Even as the member of this clan where you don\u2019t ever have to worry about food and clothes, your wife simply starved to death, this really is an extremely big joke. Did you know, when my mother died, my heart also died at that moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter my mother\u2019s death, you didn\u2019t even come to see her. I alone carried her on my back, and buried her behind the mountain outside the city. After that, just like before, every day I had to work extremely hard inside the clan, to get something to eat, and everyday I also had to receive the beating and humiliation from these so-called elite juniors of the clan. Every day I continuously received a new wounds on my body.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like this when I reached 15 years old, Ximen Feng i.e. my great elder brother slandered me.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Ximen Feng who was lying on the ground, and he didn\u2019t concealed his extreme killing intent at all and continued, \u201cHe slandered me by saying I do not possess bloodline of Ximen clan, and was not your son. I don\u2019t know what you were thinking at that time, and you actually believed him and expelled me form Ximen clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that I left Tianlong city, and roaming around I finally arrived at the edge of Magical beasts forest, but the unexpected thing for me was Ximen Feng still didn\u2019t let me go, he dispatched holy-ranked expert to chase and kill me. And inside the Magical Beast forest, he stabbed my chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut to your disappointment, I luckily didn\u2019t die at that time, but passing through that time\u2019s life and death tribulation, my blood lineage finally awakened. Naturally it was not that so-called garbage holy dragon blood lineage of your Ximen clan, rather my own unique blood lineage, i.e. my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I vowed to myself, one day I will definitely grasp enough strength, and at that time, I will absolutely return back to settle all the accounts with all the peoples who had humiliated and bullied me, without letting anyone of you run away. And from then I was no longer Ximen Tianlong, but named myself Ren Tianyou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I finally have this level of power, and several months ago, those 2 old bastards of Ximen clan also died from my hands. Now my organization\u2014\u2014Akatsuki have already arrived at Soaring dragon mountain villa, and all of them had already sneaked inside this villa, and are waiting for my order, to directly exterminate all the peoples of Ximen clan inside this villa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Ren Tianyou looked towards the people of Ximen clan who had a huge change in complexion, then he stood up, and looking below he said, \u201cWell, the reminisce ends here, now I\u2019ll only say one sentence, my revenge is directed against only the people of Ximen clan, so others are free to leave. After 5 minutes, we\u2019ll start our attack, goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, when Ren Tianyou prepared to use kamui of right eye to take away Wang Yuxin, Wang Yuxin in his embrace suddenly coughed out a mouth full of black colored blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Seeing Wang Yuxin had suddenly spitted out a blood, the face of Ren Tianyou immediately revealed worried expression, and seeing the lifelessly pale face of Wang Yuxin in his embrace, he roared anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, you don\u2019t need to worry, before I entered this hall, I had already taken a poison. I was powerless to refuse my parents for this wedding. So I agreed to them to join Ximen clan, but the only person I love is you, so how can I marry someone else? Although I couldn\u2019t do anything to refuse this wedding, but I myself am a human, and I can still decide my own future. Since they had forced me to marry, I simply wanted to give them my corpse as a present.\u201d Lying on the embrace of Ren Tianyou, Wang Yuxin smiled, and slowly said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t die like this, Little Yu, you had promised to be my bride.\u201d Seeing that Wang Yuxin was continuously losing blood, Ren Tianyou instantly became even more worried, and roared loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, idiot, I am already very happy to see you for the last time before I die.\u201d Wang Yuxin, stretched her right hand and stroke the side of his face. But at that time, the complexion of Ren Tianyou instantly changed, because he felt that her hand was already ice-cold, without any warmth of living person.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Little Yu, I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d Just when he tightly held Wang Yuxin in his embrace, a loud sound of dragon roar rang out, and a golden colored huge energy dragon shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d This huge dragon instantly arrived at this high platform, and along with a loud explosion sound, it hit that platform. Looking at the direction of the source of the attack, one could see Ximen Batian holding the huge sword with his right hand.</p><br/><p>After that explosion sound, Ren Tianyou who was holding Wang Yuxin jumped out from the middle of the smoke and dusts, and landed on the ground. Seeing both Ren Tianyou and Wang Yuxin were completely unscathed, Ximen Batian exclaimed in surprise, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you only 5 minutes of time, after 5 minutes we will instantly begin attacking, at that time all the people inside will become the targets of the attacks.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou directly used kamui on himself and Wang Yuxin and disappeared from that hall.</p><br/><p>At a mountain outside the Soaring dragon mountain villa, White Tiger and others were standing and attentively watching towards Soaring dragon mountain villa. After a while they saw many people were suddenly coming out from that villa, and were walking away.</p><br/><p>At this time, a spiral shaped space ripple suddenly appeared at their side, and Ren Tianyou who was holding Wang Yuxin appeared at their side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, Tianyou?\u201d Seeing the unconscious Wang Yuxin whose complexion was ghastly pale in the embrace of Ren Tianyou, White Tiger walked over and asked nervously. They had sneaked into Longtian city for several days, so they obviously knew the appearance of Wang Yuxin.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is poisoned, I have no time to speak. Jade Maiden come over here.\u201d Ren Tianyou hastily spoke, then asked Li Xinyun to come over.</p><br/><p>\u201cJade Maiden, as soon as I send you and Little Yu to my kamui dimension, feed her this flower, to detoxify her poison. After you took care of poison, please look after her. When the fighting is over, I will let you out.\u201d Ren Tianyou took out a strange flower with 7 colored petals from his space ring, handed it over to Li Xinyun and said. This naturally was the purple gauze magnificent sky flower he had obtained at God weeping region. Originally he had obtained 3 purple gauze magnificent sky flower, he had eaten one of them, and used other to fulfill the mission, and he had never expected that this final one would play such an important role here.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple gauze magnificent sky flower!\u201d Seeing a flower treasure in the hand of Ren Tianyou, they naturally recognized this flower, and its origin. Then after deeply looking at Ren Tianyou, Jade Maiden agreed.</p><br/><p>Immediately after Jade Maiden agreed, Ren Tianyou used kamui of his right eye and directly sent both of them to his kamui dimension. With the Purple gauze magnificent sky flower\u2019s ability to remove myriad of poisons, Ren Tianyou believed that the poison of Little Yu would be removed, so he sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>After that making the proper arrangements, Ren Tainyou looked towards Soaring dragon mountain villa, and his eyes flashed with pallid light, after that he said to White Tiger and others, \u201cOperation start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei hei, we are already ready.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and others made a fist and replied with a mischievous smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

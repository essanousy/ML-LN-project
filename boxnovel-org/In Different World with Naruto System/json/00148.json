After that he raised his head and looked over, and saw a huge flame inside the ravine which was few 100 meters away from his current location. And he could faintly hear a roaring sound from inside it.</p><br/><p>Just at that time, a loud sound of phoenix cry came out from within that huge fire, then a huge golden winged phoenix flew out from inside that huge flame. And he could see a figure of a woman standing at the back of this phoenix, but it seems the condition of her was not that good.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be her?\u201d Seeing this familiar phoenix, Ren Tianyou immediately guessed who that woman was, and sure enough, carefully looking the woman standing at the back of the phoenix was Feng Wu whom he had fought in ranking competition of Supreme Light Academy.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Feng Wu had never thought that she would actually encounter this terrifying demon in the 2nd floor of Tower of Babel, just a single strike and that was enough to severely injure both herself and her Little Gold, so she had no choice but to escape in a panic. Now Feng Wu began to regret not listening to the repetitive warning of dean Long Feilu.</p><br/><p>Originally she had passed through the 6 domain of 1st floor with great difficulty. After passing through, she saw a portal at the end of 6th domain, and then thought about the repetitive warning of dean to not enter the 2nd floor, but the curiosity inside her heart prevailed, so she stepped into the portal and arrived at 2nd floor. After arriving at 2nd floor, relying on her Phoenix god blood lineage and her battle companion Golden winged phoenix, she didn\u2019t encounter any dangers all along the road.</p><br/><p>But after she landed on this mountain, at this mountain she discovered a peculiar cave within the ravine. Becoming curious, she walked towards that cave, but who would have thought that when she had barely entered this cave, an incomparably powerful black colored magical power gushed out from inside the cave, and attacked her. Fortunately Little gold timely laid out Phoenix God shield, but even after that, she and Little gold, both of them were severely injured instantly by this single attack. After that she was forced to hastily use a move to temporarily obstruct the steps of that mysterious enemy, and simultaneously had to use her power of blood lineage to command Little gold to flee from that place without losing any time. Because she had entered 2nd floor, the transfer bead given to her by dean Long Feilu was also completely useless.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, a cold voice was transmitted out from inside the fire of the ravine, \u201cHumph, want to run, it\u2019s not that easy. Leave behind your life.\u201d Shortly afterwards, more than 10 huge black colored fire balls flew towards Feng Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cScorching Phoenix Slash!\u201d Seeing that more than 10 fire balls were advancing towards her, the beautiful eyes of Feng Wu firmly shrunk. Then she waved her Phoenix sword with her right hand, and send out a huge golden flame energy slash towards those huge black fame balls. But the unexpected think for Feng Wu was that her attack was not even able to create a small ripple and was directly swallowed by these flame balls.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing that her attack didn\u2019t even had a slightest effect, Feng Wu was extremely surprised. She was perfectly clear about the heat of her scorching phoenix slash attack, but now that attack was directly swallowed and was not even able to create a smallest effect. So seeing these flame balls still advancing towards her, she gave up all her hopes.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, she suddenly heard a voice, \u201cDoton\u2014\u2014Doryu Joheki! (Earth Style\u2014\u2014Rampart of Flowing Soil!)</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards she heard a \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound, and a huge earthen wall which was just like a city wall suddenly grew from the ground in front of her, and this wall blocked all those fire balls advancing towards her.</p><br/><p>A series of \u2018hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.loud explosion sound rang out. Although this earthen wall bombed for a while and countless pieces of earth fell down, nevertheless it successfully blocked all those black colored flame balls.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho saved me?\u201d Looking at the earthen wall in front of her, Feng Wu thought inside her heart, and she felt that the voice she had heard just a moment ago was a bit familiar. Just then heard that same voice again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Wu looked towards the source of the voice, i.e. at the top of that earthen wall. There she saw a spiral shaped space ripple, and a man wearing a black robe with red colored clouds printed on it came out from inside that space ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d Seeing that person, Feng Wu who was standing on the back of Golden winged Phoenix exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, it\u2019s me, didn\u2019t expect us to meet here beauty.\u201d Standing at the top of the earthen wall, Ren Tianyou looked at Feng Wu who was standing at the back of Phoenix, and laughing mischievously he said.</p><br/><p>After seeing that person was Feng Wu, Ren Tianyou was extremely surprised knowing that she had also came to 2nd floor. But seeing that she was unable to defend against the attack advancing towards herself, he immediately used high level defensive earth style ninjutsu to block this attack, and successfully rescued her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Hearing the flirtatious voice of Ren Tianyou, Feng Wu suddenly recalled the defeat she had suffered in the match against him, so she just coldly snorted, then she turned around and didn\u2019t even looked at Ren Tianyou. In Chinese there was a proverb, the only woman and the villain is also difficult to keep, just now he had rescued Feng Wu but he still received such cold-shoulder, So Ren Tianyou was awkward and touching his nose, he thought inside his heart, \u201cOur forefathers truly didn\u2019t deceive us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at that time, Ren Tianyou suddenly sensed a peculiar sensation from the ravine behind him, so he turned around and looked back. At that time, a black colored magic fog suddenly gushed out from the middle of the ravine and spread all over the place filling the whole ravine. And then it felt like these magic fog would rush out from this ravine and advance towards Ren Tianyou, so he slowly joined both his hand and when he was about to make his move, a strange change suddenly occurred.</p><br/><p>A gold colored energy barrier suddenly flashed and appeared in the sky, this huge barrier surrounded the whole ravine, and this barrier firmly blocked this magic fog from leaving this ravine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..? Seal?\u201d Seeing this huge barrier, Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes shone brightly, now he was 100% sure that the sealed demon clan he was persistently searching for was here. After that Ren Tianyou started to become excited, and a strong fighting intent emerged out from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, hateful Tower of Babel, hateful seal, sealing I, your father for several thousand years, and for several thousand year, I, your father have never got the chance to see the sun. All of you hateful mankind and you broken tower, just you wait, when our demon god arrive here again in this world, before all other he will destroy this World boundary magic treasure\u2014\u2014-Tower of Babel.\u201d Along with the loud roar, a lofty figure who was about 2 meters tall appeared from inside the magic fog. One could see a purple colored lines all over the skin of this person, there were 2 long sharp horned on its head, and he was holding a huge heavy spear in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei hei, I, your father finally find you. Finally I am able to complete my mission.\u201d Seeing that monstrous demon clan in the middle of the seal, Ren Tianyou twisted his neck and a clear \u2018kacha\u2019, \u2018kacha\u2019 cracking sound rang out, then he excitedly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you should properly hide somewhere far away, although this fellow is bounded within this ravine by the seal for the time being, nevertheless his attacks can still penetrate through this seal.\u201d Turning towards Feng Wu, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you?\u201d Hearing the warning of Ren Tianyou, the body of Feng Wu slightly quivered, then she turned towards Ren Tianyou and said, but her voice was little unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026..? Naturally finish off this fellow, besides I was searching for him for a long time.\u201d Hearing Feng Wu, Ren Tianyou looked towards the direction of that demon clan, and slowly said with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind? He is from the demon clan who had invaded Divine Wind continent in those years, all of them are monstrous, fierce, cruel and extremely evil things, do you want to die?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the face of Feng Wu immediately showed a worried expression, and then impatiently growled towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you concern about me beauty?\u201d Hearing Feng Wu, Ren Tianyou slightly smiled, turned around, stared at her and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little show off, who is concern about you, because you have saved my life just a moment ago, so I don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, furthermore seeing that Ren Tianyou was directly staring at her, the face of Feng Wu suddenly became red, and hastily argued. But because she was too anxious, this affected the internal injury of her body, so she suddenly groaned, and a small stream of blood flowed out from the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you might as well take the time and heal yourself.\u201d Seeing the blood of Feng Wu, Ren Tianyou advised her, afterwards he prepared himself to enter the ravine.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t watch you die.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou was intending to take action, Feng Wu suddenly got anxious inside her heart, then she hastily command Golden winged Phoenix to immediately rush towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, truly fussy.\u201d Hearing Feng Wu, and hearing the movement sound behind him, Ren Tianyou immediately turned around, caught her arm with his right hand and right eye instantly changed into Mangekyo Sharingan, \u201cYou might as well give me a break, I will let you out after I finish off this fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, under the surprise expression of both Feng Wu and Golden winged phoenix, a powerful eye power suddenly gushed out from his right eye, and a spiral shaped space ripple appeared all of a sudden, and this space ripple directly sucked in both Feng Wu and her Golden winged phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Feng Wu cried out in alarm, but was directly sucked in with his kamui. After absorbing Feng Wu to his kamui space, Ren Tianyou turned around and looked towards the ravine where the expert of demon clan was located. After that heavily trampling on the earthen wall with his right leg, he jumped directly towards the ravine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How can he came across her at this place, really a bad luck! The girl in front of him was Ximen Zi Yue, Ximen Tian Long\u2019s younger sister. From the memory of Ximen Tian Long, he learnt that when they were young they were extremely close, and during their younger days, she used to call Ximen Tian Long as \u2018Tian Long elder brother\u2019. But after she grew up, perhaps she became aware of reality and gradually distanced herself from Ximen Tian Long. Afterwards she started to treat Ximen Tian Long with freezing irony and burning satire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Ren Tian You frowned and asked. He never thought that he would meet someone from Ximen clan this fast after leaving Magical beasts forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, I didn\u2019t expect to come across you here!\u201d Ximen Zi Yue said with grinning. \u201cLook at your appearance, aren\u2019t you looking more comfortable! It seemed like leaving Ximen clan was best choice for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Yue, Who is he?\u201d A youth wearing a purple dress was following her. In addition to this youth, there were still 4 or 5 bodyguards following her. Seeing that Zi Yue was familiarly talking with Ren Tian You, he asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe used to be my elder brother, Ximen Tian Long, trash of Ximen clan. So our clan had expelled him from our clan.\u201d Ximen Zi Yue said with grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d That youth suddenly release the sound of understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cXimen Xi Yue, you better pipe down your mouth. First I would like to correct several things you said. First, I\u2019m not your brother, second, my name is Ren Tian You, and I don\u2019t have any relation with your Ximen clan. And each and every insult you have given me, I will return back to you all with interest. Third and also the last, don\u2019t utter the word trash, otherwise I will kill you.\u201d Hearing the insult of Ximen Zi Yue, the eyes of Ren Tian You gradually changed into a blood color, and gradually Sharingan became visible, and staring at Ximen Zi Yue he said every words clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ximen Zi Yua face was filled with anger, nevertheless seeing those abnormal eyes of Ren Tian You, a chill appeared inside her heart from nowhere. And even though she opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, impudent, you trash\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Ah!\u201d Hearing the words of Ren Tian You, the youth who was standing beside Ximen Zi Yue, suddenly spoke with disdain. But before he finish speaking, he only sensed something, then he felt a severe pain in his face, and after that he involuntarily gave a horrible shriek and flew backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Guang Lei!\u201d The bodyguards and Ximen Zi Yue suddenly cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I said I don\u2019t want to hear the word trash!\u201d Without even withdrawing his right hand, Ren Tian You spoke with complete indifference.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this pain is killing me, bastard, you all hastily capture him, and I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Zhao Guang Lei was screaming and rolling on the ground while holding his right side of the face and roared towards the bodyguards.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Those several bodyguards answered. But before they could take out their weapons, Ren Tian You had already started to take action. They could only see that Ren Tian You change into smoke and disappeared and suddenly above the area of those body guards the silhouette of Ren Tian You was seen along with the several horrible shriek. After that the heads of those bodyguards suddenly fell on the ground and the blood started to flow from their neck.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was standing behind Ximen Zi Yue while carrying snake sword in his right hand, and then Ren Tian You spoke in the ear of Ximen Zi Yue, \u201cYou better not get involved, otherwise you will lose your pitiful life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Hearing the cold voice, and again looking at the dead bodies of the bodyguards that were lying on the ground, suddenly caused her to be so scared that she didn\u2019t dared to even move.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you, young master Zhao, how do you want to die?\u201d Ren Tian turned around and looked at Zhao Guang Lei. And with a faint smile in his face, he slowly advance towards Zhao Guang Lei.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.don\u2019t come, don\u2019t come!\u201d Watching Ren Tian You advancing towards him with a sword in his hand, Zhao Guang Lei was so scared that he couldn\u2019t even retreat, and roared towards Ren Tian You with complete fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cStep aside, Step aside!\u201d Several voices started to come from behind the crowds of onlooker. Shortly afterwards, several armor wearing patrolling guards made their way inside. Seeing the guards, Zhao Guang Lei felt that he had seen his savior. And towards those guards he roared, \u201cYou all quickly come over here. I am Zhao clan\u2019s second young master, this person wants to kill me. He already killed all my guards, you all hurry over here and arrest him, no, directly kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d The guard saw the dead bodies lying on the ground, and questioned Ren Tian You while frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed some damn people, because loathe trouble!\u201d Ren Tian You didn\u2019t deny.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you should come with us. Defending imperial capital is our job, so today we must take you with us.\u201d After listening to Ren Tian You, even if he didn\u2019t have any good impression on Zhao Guang Lei, as he was the the protector of Imperial capital, he spoke to Ren Tian You, after that he waved his hand, then all the guards took out their weapons and pointed towards Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, I don\u2019t have any interest to take a walk with you. So you might as well stay in that place, Genjutsu Shibari! (Paralysis Genjutsu!)\u201d Seeing that those guards were approaching him, although he could kill all of them but he didn\u2019t do so because he not an indiscriminate killer and he only kills those, who he thinks are wretched. So Ren Tian You used his illusion of Sharingan. In the perception of guards, they suddenly found that a huge nails were inserted in their bodies, and couldn\u2019t free themselves, no matter how hard they tried. This was the illusion technique used by Itachi to bind Orochimaru. Even the great swords man and illusion master could not struggle free for this technique in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>After sorting them, Ren Tian You turned back to Zhao Guang Lei, just at time the voice of Ximen Zi Yue could be herd, \u201cXimen Tian Long, you shouldn\u2019t kill him. He is the second song of Zhao clan of imperial capital Ka Li Si. If you kill him, you won\u2019t be able to live in this city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, my name is Ren Tian You. Don\u2019t call me Xime Tian Long. In addition, when did you start caring about me?\u201d He didn\u2019t even turned around and walked towards Zhao Guang Lei, and at that moment, suddenly an attack came towards him. Ren Tian You slightly smiled and mumbled, \u201cFinally coming out?\u201d he used his snake sword to block.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d sound of metal colliding rang. Ren Tian You unexpectedly saw the old person wearing black clothes who was holding a board sword with the one hand. And Ren Tian You snake sword had collided with this person\u2019s board sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungster, who are you, and why must you kill the young master of our house?\u201d The old man asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBah, who I want to kill is not your concern, you just need to concern about yourself, old man!\u201d Ren Tian You said with disdain. After that he secretly made several hand seals with his left hands. Followed by the sounds of birds cry, a strong lighting suddenly appeared in his right hand and started to ccover his snake sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! Flame charge!\u201d That old man was surprised to see lightning appear in Ren Tian You hand, and shortly afterwards suddenly a flame ring appeared from his body and the impact spread all around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTut!\u201d Ren Tian You suddenly spat, and then used shunshin no jutsu (Body Flicker Technique)! After that he withdrew his snake sword and placed it inside the sheath, after that he used his right hand to make seal, \u201cKai! (Release!)\u201d Suddenly those city guards could move again. Then he said to Ximen Zi Yue, \u201cGo back and tell Ximen Ba Tian and Ximen Feng, within 1 year, I will come back to Ximen clan, ha ha!\u201d After finishing speaking, Ren Tian You turned into a smoke and disappeared. Shortly afterwards, another old man who was covered with purple lightning all over the body suddenly appeared there.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat grandfather!\u201d Seeing this old man, Zhao Guang Lei rushed towards that old man. That old man looked at Zhao Guang Lei and those dead bodies of bodyguards on the ground for a while, and suddenly asked with a cold voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Guang Lei immediately started to state the matters occurred here and also didn\u2019t forget to add more details, however Ren Tian You had already left that place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

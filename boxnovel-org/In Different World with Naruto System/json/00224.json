They did so because Ren Tianyou had stated that they might spend long period of time for the training of this time, because this time not only was his own training content very numerous, he also wanted great improvement in the strength of everyone else. As a result it was necessary for these livelihood items to keep up their needs. Ren Tianyou planned to take the members of Akatsuki, these formerly God\u2019s favored people to experience his previous savage life.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, why did you purchase so many groceries?\u201d Outside the town, flying in the sky, Vermilion Bird asked curiously. She didn\u2019t know why he got so many things.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei hei, you will know when the moment comes.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t answer directly, rather mischievously laughed while looking at Vermilion Bird and others, then said.</p><br/><p>Seeing the smile of Ren Tianyou, Vermilion Bird and others don\u2019t know why but felt chill, and their whole body shudder. And they also had a kind of bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no need to guess. Now let\u2019s speed up and hurry on with our journey. This time our destination is seas.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou immediately commanded the ink eagle he had created using Choujuu Giga (Super Beast Scroll) who was carrying Ren Tianyou, Muyue, and Little Yu to speed up. After that everyone else flying behind had no other choice but to speed up to keep up the pace.</p><br/><p>The place Ren Tianyou had chosen this time was sea region. In the sea area, far away from Divine Wind continent, everyone would be able to train without any disturbance, but the main point was, the sea area had many sea magical beasts. Ren Tianyou could take advantage of this to temper the strength of everyone.</p><br/><p>In addition, there was another reason, which was Ren Tianyou wanted to search the location of Dragon Island. Last time in Ximen clan, he had killed over 20 dragons at one go, so now he and Dragon clan were already mortal enemies. But currently he didn\u2019t know the location of this mortal enemy\u2019s base, which was very passive for Ren Tianyou. As a result, Ren Tianyou wanted to take advantage of this chance to find the location of Dragon clan, then when he possess sufficient strength, he would completely destroy whole Dragon Island in one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>After flying for nearly 5-6 hours, everyone arrived above the open sea. And after carefully searching, Ren Tianyou and everyone finally found a suitable island.</p><br/><p>On this island, trees stood in great numbers, and loud roars of magical beasts resounded frequently. There was a large sandy beach outside the woods, and one several tens of meters tall small mountain behind the woods.</p><br/><p>Everyone descended and landed on the top of that small mountain. After Ren Tianyou scanned the surroundings all around him, he nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, this is where we will live and strenuously cultivate hereafter. My sole demand is for everyone to reach at least Peak-God rank or even boundary of God\u2019s domain.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at everyone, and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how long will we live here?\u201d Jade Maiden glanced around the remote and deserted surrounded, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo years, at least two years or longer.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly answered. He needed the time of at least two years to complete the training plan he had arranged for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You want us to stay in this deserted island for two years, don\u2019t joke around, Zero?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the complexion of Vermilion Bird suddenly become bitter. This place belongs to the category where her nature was most unsettled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking around, I am speaking truth.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where do we live? Don\u2019t tell me you want to let us beautiful women sleep in open mountain with you all smelly men.\u201d This moment the complexion of Jade Maiden also blackened, then pointing the desolate surroundings, she said. Vermilion Bird and other looked over towards the direction Jade Maiden had pointed, and saw nothing but rocks and desolate all around. Thinking about sleeping in open in this place, even Little Yu shivered and resentfully glared Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, all of you rest assured, how can I be willing to let all of you beautiful women sleep out in this open mountain.\u201d Seeing Little Yu resentfully glaring at him, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but wipe the sweat from his forehead, then walking forward, he began to make a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton\u2014- Shichuka no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Four Pillar House Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front of him began to shake violently, and huge crack spread all around the ground. After that a huge tree grew out from the ground before the eyes of everyone, then under the control of Ren Tianyou\u2019s mokuton (Wood Style), quickly took the shape of huge wooden house.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the rapid rise of the wooden house, Vermilion Bird and others were completely dumbstruck. If they didn\u2019t misremember, then the ability of controlling plants and nature magic ought to be exclusive to the people of Elven clan. But how was Ren Tianyou able to use it?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, don\u2019t look at me like this. After I took Spring of Life, luckily I obtain this ability to use nature magic.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to everyone while feeling his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, why is it that we don\u2019t and only you got it, this is not fair ah.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Great Bear said with depressed expression. They had also taken the Spring of Life Ren Tianyou had given them, but none of them obtain this ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, this is personal character issue.\u201d Hearing everyone, Ren Tianyou a bit arrogantly said. But hearing this sentence of Ren Tianyou, the complexion of everyone blackened. \u2018What? According to you, our character is very poor.\u2019 Thinking this, everyone firmly glared Ren Tianyou with hostile eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing the gaze of everyone, Ren Tianyou involuntarily shivered all over, then stutteringly said, \u201cHaha, that, I will first create rooms for all of you.\u201d Finished speaking, he immediately stepped into the house. After entering inside, he made a series of hand seals. Following the same pattern of just a moment ago, again several wood rose up, making enough room for everyone to reside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since we have journeyed for whole day, let\u2019s rest for today.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou walked over to Little Yu. But who would have thought that Little Yu had already taken precaution against Ren Tianyou. When she saw Ren Tianyou looking over to her direction, blushing she immediately pulled Muyue, Jade maiden and Vermilion Bird, then walked into another room.</p><br/><p>How could Little Yu not understand the scheme inside the heart of Ren Tianyou? She really couldn\u2019t live inside one bedroom with Ren Tianyou brazenly in front of everyone, so she slip away in advance.</p><br/><p>Looking at the back of Little Yu leaving in flurried, Ren Tianyou gloomily touched his nose. Now with no other solution, he alone walked inside the room alone. First spread across the bed, then took out certain livelihood necessities. After that he sat cross-legged on the floor, and his consciousness sunk and entered system. Now he was preparing to train on his training plan\u2019s first ninjutsu\u2014-Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Raijin Jutsu)!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

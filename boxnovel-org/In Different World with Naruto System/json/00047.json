Since it is already like that, you can stay here.\u201d Zhao Yunyun said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yunyun, do you really intend to let him live here ah, he is male, so it will be inconvenient for us if he lives here ah.\u201d A female student pulled the arm of Zhao Yunyun and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you have any better solution? After all this matter is not his fault, and we also don\u2019t have authority to deprive other person\u2019s right to stay here ah.\u201d Zhao Yunyun whispered back helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, then I\u2019ll take a rest inside my room.\u201d Hearing the conversation between that female student and Zhao Yunyun, Ren Tianyou smiled wryly inside his heart and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll not disturb you any further, schoolmate Ren Tianyou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou entered his room and then shut the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew.\u201d Inside the room, he released a long sigh of relief. \u201cThat was truly dangerous, almost died back there, but form now on I can brazenly enter this female student\u2019s dormitory. Ha ha, so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>On the outside of the door, after seeing Ren Tianyou entered inside the room, towards all the female students who were still there, Zhao Yunyun said, \u201cEveryone, you all are dismissed. Hereafter be careful while doing any matter in dormitory, after all a male student is living here from now on. It won\u2019t be as convenient as in the past.\u201d After saying this, she walked towards her own room. Seeing Zhao Yunyun leaving, all the female students also dispersed.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Ren Tianyou lied on the bed. After intense training of nature change of wind attribute in the morning, he was mentally tired. So lying on the bed, he fell into a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>When he woke up, it was already afternoon. He looked at the time, but was still too early to sleep again. \u2018What should I do? Should I go to the cultivation room for more training?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Since this Supreme light academy is extremely large, there must be a dedicated library. Since I am free now, I will just go to the library and have a look.\u201d Ren Tianyou muttered to himself, then he got out of the bed and move out form his door. After that he walked towards the direction of library.</p><br/><p>After walking for almost 20 minutes, he arrived in front of the library of academy. In front of him, he saw a 5 storey ancient style building. And also saw that many people were entering and leaving that building through the main entrance of that building. It seems pretty lively inside the library.</p><br/><p>Walking inside the library, he saw a huge space where many rows of bookshelves were standing and within those bookshelves, there were many books. There was a counter next to the entrance, and a 17 or 18 years old young girl was busily registering the books to lend.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou walked towards the counter, spoke to that girl, \u201cHello, my name is Ren Tianyou and I am newly-arrived student. Can you tell me a brief introduction about this library?\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing her work, she lifted her head and she discovered a young man dressed in a strange clothing was standing in front of her, then she said, \u201cMy name is Xie Tingting, are you a new student?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, yes. Can you tell me a general information on this library, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. This library have all together 5 floor and each floor contains different books. 1st floor contains some miscellaneous writings about the incidents of this continent, history books and other similar books. 2nd floor and above contains manual books of battle qi, illusion and magic. But the stairs leading to this floor have a barrier. Only the person having enough strength can pass through. You should have at least the strength of great swordsman level to enter 2nd floor. To enter 3rd floor, you should have the strength of Swordmaster. To enter 4th floor, you should have the strength of Saint Level. And finally 5th floor is restricted area, without the permission of dean and vice-dean, no one can enter.\u201d Xie Tingting sat on the stool and slowly explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo borrow the books, you must register the book from me first. The books of 1st floor can be borrowed for 7 days. 2nd floor books for 3 days. And it is forbidden to take away the books from 3rd floor and above. And the books must be returned within the stipulated time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is like that. May I ask, is there any particular book you recommend which introduce all the big incidents of Divine wind continent?\u201d Currently he didn\u2019t want any secret manuals, he was more interested on finding the book about all the big incident of this continent, so that he could clearly understand this Divine wind continent. After all, the original owner \u2018Ximen Tianlong\u2019 also never before left imperial capital of Aile Empire. So he was also not too clear on the affairs of this continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can read \u2018chronological history of continent\u2019 book. This book is at the 5th row of bookshelf no. 3 in the 1st floor. You can go and look for it.\u201d Xie Tingting recommended the book to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Ren Tianyou thanked her, the turned around and walked towards the bookshelves. After he arrived before bookshelf no. 3, he found \u2018chronological history of continent\u2019 book on the fourth row of that bookshelf. This was extremely thick book. He estimated that it would take several days to finish reading this book.</p><br/><p>He took out \u2018chronological history of continent\u2019 book from the bookshelf, and placed it on his hand. Then he again he carefully looked through the remaining books in other bookshelves. Finally in the bookshelf no. 7, he discovered the book named \u20185 great danger spot of continent\u2019. He took out that book too, then he walked towards the entrance. Arriving before Xie Tianting, he handed these 2 books to her and said, \u201cI want to borrow these 2 books.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, Xie Tingting brought those books in front of herself and said, \u201cTake out your student card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took out his student card from his ninja backpack and handed it to Xie Tingting. Then she took out a register card of those 2 books, after a while, registration was complete. Xie Tingting again picked up an item from the side desk which resemble a stamp, then turned over the 2 books. On the bottom right of the back of the book, there was a small-sized purple colored pattern seal. There was a light fluctuation of magic from this seal.</p><br/><p>This was a special magic formation to prevent students from stealing the books. If someone tries to take out any book from the library entrance without registration first, then this magic formation on this book would release an ear-piercing screech. As there is also a magic formation on the entrance of library, and magic formation of all the books resonance with it, and when they are within a certain range with each other, an ear-piercing screech will rang out. Only that special alchemy item in the hand of Xie Tingting can temporary suppress the magic formation of the books.</p><br/><p>Xie Tingting used that item and placed a mark above that purple seal of the books. Then she handed back the student card along with those 2 books to Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cWell, now you can take away these 2 books. Remember to return the books within stipulated time, otherwise you will be punished. Furthermore, do not damage these 2 books.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, I got it. Thanks a lot.\u201d Ren Tianyou thanked and then took those 2 books and walked towards his dormitory. Since he borrowed the books, it\u2019s necessary to take a good look at these book.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

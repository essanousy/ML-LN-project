Then a powerful aura leak out from that fissure and spread all over the entire arena. Because Zhao Guanghui had already fixed the barrier around the arena, this didn\u2019t affect any individuals from the audiences.</p><br/><p>Then a piercing phoenix cry rang out, and simultaneously a golden wing phoenix appeared, and it flew in circle inside the arena. After that the fissure in the sky slowly closed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2026\u2026f**king\u2026\u2026summoned\u2026\u2026\u2026a\u2026\u2026\u2026beast.\u201d Seeing that thing continuously circling in the air, and firmly staring at him with a vengeful eyes, Ren Tianyou nearly threw up a mouthful of blood as he sensed a genuine aura of saint class magical beast.</p><br/><p>F**k, did I make a mistake, this is merely a competition, but what is the point of going all out regardless of danger to one\u2019s life? Summoning a saint class magical beast, aren\u2019t you afraid you will provoke a god class teacher? F**k, last time, I had finished off a saint class magical beast \u2018Raging flame cloud lion\u2019, and it cost me a great amount of effort to KO it. Now you have summoned yet another magical beast comparable to \u2018Raging flame cloud lion\u2019, do you really want everyone here dead?</p><br/><p>Thinking about this the mental state of Ren Tianyou became a bit agitated. \u2018F**k, if I, your father was able to summon a tailed beast, then I would have let it use its Bijudama (Biju Bomb) and send your little golden wing phoenix flying, without giving you any chance to talk over.\u2019 But it\u2019s too bad, Ren Tianyou still had not exchanged any tailed beasts.</p><br/><p>Actually Ren Tianyou had considered to sign a contract with saint class magical beast first, then wait for the time until he had enough system points to exchange a tailed beast. But later he gave up this thought, because he was cultivating chakra not the cultivation system of this world, and at the same time saint class magical beast was not that helpful to him.</p><br/><p>However now seeing the golden wings phoenix circling in the air, Ren Tianyou felt a bit of regret within his heart regarding his that decision. At that moment the golden yellow colored flame beam surrounding Feng Wu slowly weaken and disappeared. Then Feng Wu appeared.</p><br/><p>The body of Feng Wu was surrounded by a layer of golden yellow colored phoenix wings armor, the fire phoenix sword on her right hand was also encircled by a layer of golden yellow colored radiance, and originally fiery red color battle qi had changed into a golden yellow in color. The most important change was her pair of eyes, you could see a golden yellow colored flame was flashing through the pupil in her eyes. Rising his head, Ren Tianyou caught the sight the circling phoenix, and Feng Wu who had spread open her wings of phoenix, then she suddenly changed into a golden yellow colored light and flew behind the phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle gold, the opponent this time is that person. Don\u2019t underestimate him, he is extremely strong. And also the most important thing is his speed is extremely fast. You have to be careful of his speed.\u201d Standing at back of golden wings phoenix, Feng Wu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it a\u2019Wu. Let\u2019s go with old tactics, first change the surrounding environment.\u201d Golden wings phoenix replied. Then it spread open its two wings, and the golden flame fell. Then the arena immediately ignited with golden yellow color huge flame, and under the control of Golden wing phoenix, the flames gradually encircled the whole arena. Even the shadow of Ren Tianyou was swallowed by this flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou!\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou was swallowed by the flame, Luo Tianxing and others in the audience had a worried expression in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou was swallowed by the flame, a grey colored light flashed in the eyes of far-off Yan Xinluo, \u201cMember of Flame phoenix villa? What will you do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the member of Flame phoenix villa also entered the world.\u201d Seeing the circumstance in the arena, Long Feilu and Zhao Guanghui looked at each other, and a light flashed in the eyes of both, then they turned around and continued to look towards the arena.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After getting swallowed by the flames, Ren Tianyou felt a high temperature even through his Raiton Chakura Modo (Lightning Style Armour), and a sharp light flashed through his eyes, \u201cChanging the environment into something suitable for itself? Since this magical beast is your summoning beast, isn\u2019t it okay to dispose off it first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, the lightning around the body of Ren Tianyou suddenly rose sharply, the form of Raiton Chakura Modo (Lightning Style Armour) become even more distinct.

He appeared beneath the body of Golden wings phoenix, and simultaneously quickly drop towards the ground, as there was no stepping place in the sky.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou place his hand on his ninja backpack on his leg and took out 2 kunais, then he threw one kunai beneath his feet and using it as a stepping stone, he suddenly continued to advance towards golden wing phoenix in the air.</p><br/><p>While darting towards Golden wings phoenix, he threw the remaining kunai towards the Golden Wing phoenix, then both hand quickly make a series of hand seals, \u201cNinpo\u2014Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!\u201d (Ninja Art\u2014Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!)</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Along with the muffled voice of Ren Tianyou, the quickly flying kunai started to continuously multiply, after a short while the whole sky was covered with the kunais.</p><br/><p>But the attack of countless kunais at \u2018Phoenix god shield\u2019 of Golden wings phoenix only released \u2018ding ding\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019sound, each and every kunai fell down from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the defense of this beast to be this outstanding. But\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Finished speaking, the silhouette of Ren Tianyou disappeared from this location, and when he once again appeared in the sky, he was already above the head of Golden wings phoenix, then he took out a Kibaku Fuda (Paper Bomb) and pasted it at the energy barrier of Golden Wings phoenix. Simultaneously his right leg flickered with huge amount of strong lightning chakra, then with his right leg he which was covered with strong lightning chakra attacked the head of Golden wings phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!

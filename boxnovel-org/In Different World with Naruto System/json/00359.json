Shortly afterwards, he made a series of hand seals, and because his speed of making hand seals was too fast, only the afterimages of hands was seen in front of his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton Hijutsu\u2014-Jukai Kotan! (Secret Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Creation!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, with his body as a center, the ground around within the radius of 100 li suddenly burst one after another, and huge trees accompanied by long sturdy vines broke out of the ground, then grew rapidly, instantly changing the surroundings of 100 li into a vast forest.</p><br/><p>After completely refining the power of Forever Green, the strength of Ren Tianyou\u2019s wood style had already surpassed First Hokage Senju Hasirama, and now his wood style was definitely number one in the world. Although Senju Hasirama was the reincarnation of Asura, but his strength was also not as strong as the wood energy crystallization of entire universe.</p><br/><p>Moreover the most important matter was, the current wood style of Ren Tianyou still possessed the possibility of growth, don\u2019t forget that Ren Tianyou still had yet to exchange Senju Hasirama\u2019s complete Wood Style and Sage power from the System. Once Ren Tianyou merge Senju Hasirama\u2019s Wood style with his own, his strength would definitely have a growth in quality.</p><br/><p>Furthermore although to exchange kekkei genkai of Senju Hasirama, he required 60 million system points, but currently Ren Tianyou had more than enough system points. Far exceeding this figure, he already had 130 million system points.</p><br/><p>He had obtained these system points after he completely wiped out over 30 million demon soldiers with Tengai Shinsei (Heavenly Obstacle Quaking Star), but now he didn\u2019t have time to exchange wood style.</p><br/><p>But even so, compared to before, the current Deep Forest Creation used by Ren Tianyou instantly created dense forest within 100 li surroundings, moreover the binding power of wood style was also far stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Now under the control of Ren Tianyou, those huge vines rapidly extend towards that huge body of Abyss Hydra and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Abyss Hydra roared loudly, and one of the snakehead spat out a huge flame towards underneath vines. A number of vines directly changed into ashes under this raging flames, but even more vines extinguished the flame and continued to extend towards Abyss Hydra.</p><br/><p>As for Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, it nevertheless stood blankly at the same place, without any moment, as if he didn\u2019t see any attacks around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Do you think it\u2019s easy to burn down my wood style? Now these vines are as solid as iron and steel, cutting gold and breaking jade is also not difficult.\u201d Seeing the action of Abyss Hydra, Ren Tianyou with his palms put together sneered, then directed even more vines towards Hydra and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, damn human!\u201d These sturdy vines extended over to the body of Abyss Hydra, then immediately bound up its body tightly. After that a trail of blood came out from Abyss Hydra\u2019s that comparable to steel hard body, instantly causing Hydra to roar, and it unceasingly struggled to break free from these vines, but it was not so easy.</p><br/><p>And at that time, Yaorao who was standing on the head of Hydra flew up, then waving her left hand, that strange mirror in her waist flew to her palm.</p><br/><p>Yaorao held this mirror with her left hand, then releasing purple colored radiance in the fingertips of her right hand\u2019s index and middle finger, she drew a mysterious purple colored rune on the mirror, which directly entered inside this mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cAssimilate!\u201d At this time, Yaorao coldly shouted loudly, and a hazy light beam shot out from that mirror, directly entering into the forehead of underneath Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d After this radiance entered into the body of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, it let out a loud roar, and huge sound wave spread in all direction. Moreover large amount of energy appeared around its body, and it struggled unceasingly, unexpectedly beginning to break those vines bounding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, this Thousand Eyes Evil Beast is worthy of being ancient ferocious beast, compared to Abyss Hydra, it\u2019s far too strong. Even compared to Yaorao, it\u2019s not that weak. Now my wood style wouldn\u2019t be able to bind it for a long time.\u201d Feeling the struggle of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, the complexion of Ren Tianyou suddenly became a little unsightly. Then rapidly circulating large amount of chakra within his body, sturdy vines broke out from the ground and extended to Thousand Eyes Evil Beast\u2019s body to suppress it.</p><br/><p>At that time, a number of eyes of Thousand Eyes Evil Beasts looking towards Ren Tianyou suddenly flashed with pitch-black radiance, and powerful energy gathered in those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath ray!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish\u201d, \u201cswish\u201d, \u201cswish\u201d\u2026\u2026wind breaking sound unceasingly resounded, as a thick pitch-black light beam was shot out from those eyes. All the vines around were pulverized, and the 100 li tree domain around them was also instantly destroyed and disappeared. The vines binding both Thousand Eyes Evil Beast and Abyss Hydra also disappeared immediately, restoring their freedom.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, these light beams without any reduction in strength continued to fly towards Ren Tianyou, seemingly wanting to shot though his body.</p><br/><p>Seeing those quickly flying towards him light beams, Ren Tianyou bit the index finger of his right hand, then after quickly making a series of hand seals, he heavily slammed his palm on the ground, and a black colored rune spread around the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose\u2014-Goju Rashomon! (Summoning\u2014-Five-Layer Rashomon!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front of him shook violently, then along with \u2018ka\u2019, \u2018ka\u2019, \u2018ka\u2019\u2026\u2026 five ground cracking sound, five huge iron gate broke out of the ground, blocking the front of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>After those light beams shot at Rashomon, the first gate was immediately broken, and with the surplus power, they broke through another two Rashomon in succession. After that in front of fourth Rashomon, the energy of those light beams disappeared.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou jumped and arrived above the Rashomon, then emitting a special chakra from within his body, a special pattern appeared in his face, \u201cSage Mode, open!\u201d</p><br/><p>After entering into Sage Mode, the perception of Ren Tianyou immediately linked with the sky around him, and everything of surroundings were transmitted into the brain of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpo\u2014-Myojinmon! (Sage Art\u2014-Gracious Deity Gates!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou rapidly made a series of hand seals, then ten huge red colored wooden torii suddenly fall down from the sky above the head of Abyss Hydra and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast. Nine huge Gracious Deity Gates fell on the nine snakeheads of hydra, completely suppressing it. And Thousand Eyes Evil Beast was also suppressed firmly by the power of remaining Gracious Deity Gates for the time being. [T.L: torii = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii]</p><br/><p>Even though they were unceasingly struggling, but with the sealing power of these Gracious Deity Gates, they were temporarily unable to free themselves.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, huge wind shrunken appeared in each hand of Ren Tianyou. These two shuriken were no less than two meters in diameter, and sharp ear-piercing sound was unceasingly ringing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpo\u2014- Choodama Rasenshuriken! (Sage Art\u2014-Massive Rasen shuriken!)\u201d [\u2014\u2014]</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou threw these two huge rasen shuriken, and they immediately flew out towards Abyss Hydra and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast suppressed by Gracious Deity Gates.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After the storm gradually stopped, smoke and dusts also dissipated, and the vision of everyone also revert back to normal. After their vision revert back to normal, everyone impatiently looked over towards the direction of center of explosion. And the first scene they saw caused them to unconsciously wide open their mouth which was wide enough to swallow an entire egg, and for a long time they forget to close it.</p><br/><p>In front of them, the original plain had already disappeared, instead there nevertheless was one huge crater with a diameter of about one kilometer. A thin smoke was in the process of unceasingly rising from the middle of this crater, and in the sky above this crater, a figure of a person was floating, carefully looking, who it could be if not Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>And that originally terrifying Earth Hydra had already disappeared and Ling Yanqi also had similarly disappeared without a trace. Seeing this scene, everyone had a single thought inside their heart. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that he already won? Yes, I would like to ask, who can stop such terrifying attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them naturally considered Ling Yanqi was dead, however, if Rasen Shuriken had hit him, with his current strength he would not be able to escape certain death, but was he hit?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, how long are you going to keep hiding, still not rolling out?\u201d Just then, Ren Tianyou who was floating midair couldn\u2019t help but berated in a stern voice, with his pair of Mangekyo Sharingan emitting a cold light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That old man is still alive? How is that possible?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, everyone cried out in alarm inside their brain in disbelief, even Bu Feng was thinking this. Because he clearly knew that even with his speed, it was very difficult for him to dodge that attack of just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>You should know that he depended on his speed to survive till present, and even he would have a hard time in dodging this attack or had 100% certainty to dodge, no need to mention about short legged magicians. That was basically impossible.</p><br/><p>But the matter in front however was intriguing. Next from the void, a figure of a person gradually appeared, if this figure was not Ling Yanqi then who it could be. And everyone looked at Ling Yanqi with disbelief, they were unable to understand how he was able to escape through that terrifying attack.</p><br/><p>And looking at Ling Yanqi, with the exception of pale face because of huge magical power consumption, and exhaustion of his spirit power, he had not received any injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally willing to come out?\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of Ling Yanqi, Ren Tianyou coldly said without a shred of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know that I was not dead?\u201d Floating in the midair, Ling Yanqi drank a bottle of magic potion to recover his magical power, and asked with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, although the speed of your dodging is very fast, but all your movement nevertheless didn\u2019t escape my eyes.\u201d Ren Tianyou pointed at his own eyes, and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Seeing those strange scarlet eyes of Ren Tianyou, Ling Yanqi suddenly understand inside his heart, \u201cIt seems the blood lineage of this guy is his eyes, so hateful, originally I planned to make him believe that I was dead, then after he left, I can sneak away, but now however it will take greater effort.\u201d After seeing the might of that Rasen Shuriken attack of Ren Tianyou, Ling Yanqi basically didn\u2019t have any confidence to beat Ren Tianyou, so now he was only thinking about how to quickly run away from this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, under my Odama Rasengan, you suddenly disappeared, and my rasengan hit empty air. At that time, all your movements were already unreservedly caught by my eyes.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly spoke. As a matter of fact, he also knew that this old man was seizing this moment to recover his magical power, but he didn\u2019t have any intention to do anything about it. Because after going through this battle, he had already consumed one-third of his chakra, so he himself was also seizing this moment to recover his chakra, as there was still one enemy present.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut at that time seeing you disappear, I mistakenly believed you can use space magic, so you had the ability to disappear out in the thin air to dodge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the later series of your movements however made me dispel that conjecture. First, you as one of the four leader of Magic Domain, one might say you are well known, but everyone knew that you are only earth system magician that\u2019s all, basically you don\u2019t know any space system magic. And even if space system magic is your unique skill, but with your reputation, it is impossible for everyone to not know it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, when I use lightning dragon, facing my this move, you could have directly used your space magic to easily dodge it, yet you however did not, rather selected to expend huge effort to use forbidden defense magic spell to protect yourself, at that time I wondered, why did you behave in that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I decided to use Rasen Shuriken to see in the end what is your that magic spell. Sure enough, under my Rasen Shuriken, you immediately use this move again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever at that time, you however made an unnecessary move, i.e. jumping down from the head of Earth Hydra and only after you reached the ground, you used this move. Just then I understood in my heart, because space magic didn\u2019t receive any restriction of area. And at that time I gain looked carefully, every time you use this move, you stood on the ground, and light yellow colored radiances appeared on your body. After that carefully thinking, I determined, your this move is basically not space magic, rather earth system magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd as for why did you take the risk to jump off the head of the Earth Hydra to the ground, I think the user must stand on the ground in order to use this move.\u201d Although Ren Tianyou guessing, but his tone however was full of certainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, I have to say that you are very intelligent, I have only use this move twice, and you were able to see through it. This move is indeed my earth system secret skill \u2018earth travelling technique\u2019, and also indeed must stand above ground to use it. But even if you understand it, as long as I stood on the ground, I can use it anytime, what can you do?\u201d Ling Yanqi descended to the ground and standing on the ground, he stared at Ren Tianyou who was similarly descending on the ground, and said with disdain. But although he had said those things, Ling Yanqi was firmly holding his magic staff, and that mysterious earth system crystal on the magic staff was glimmering with light yellow colored earth system magical power.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, if it is like you said then I just have to make you leave the ground, no?\u201d Landing on the ground, Ren Tianyou indifferently said, but inside his heart he nevertheless thought, \u201cIf I want to make this bastard leave the ground, then I can only use water style which I am most unskilled at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished thinking, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cSuiton\u2014-Dai Bakusui Shoha! (Water Style\u2014-Super Exploding Water Shockwave!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished making hand seals, Ren Tianyou inhaled a deep breathe, and his mouth quickly puffed up, then lowering his head, he spat out endless fresh water from his mouth which quickly spread in all direction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

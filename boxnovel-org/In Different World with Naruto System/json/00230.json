Then with a wave of her right hand, that Dazzling Light Mirror immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, now the challenge is done, we will take action after 5 days.\u201d Seeing Jade Maiden had woken up, Ren Tianyou slowly said to everyone on the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, how can you be sure that Ximen clan and Dragon clan will absolutely come?\u201d Vermilion Bird couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, Vermilion Bird, how can you be so stupid?\u201d Before Ren Tianyou could answer, White Tiger said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Vermilion Bird was slightly dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t understand the meaning of White Tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Whiter Tiger meant is, the people of Magic Domain will transmit this news for us.\u201d Draining the cup of alcohol in one gulp, Void opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? If Magic Domain gave out this news then wouldn\u2019t they lose their face? So why would they do this?\u201d Vermilion Bird was even more confused. She didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think Magic Domain which is so big is completely clean? They definitely have spies of other power. Toady Jade Maiden stirred up trouble like this, which was seen and heard perfectly clear by everyone of Magic Domain. Wanting to keep this news a secret is basically impossible, so very soon this matter that we are going to invade Magic Domain will be spread by these spies. At that time, will Ximen clan not obtain this news? And after Ximen clan obtained this news, they will absolutely tell Dragon clan too. So we don\u2019t need to worry about the experts of Dragon clan not coming.\u201d White Tiger slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and the reason why I set up five days gap to attack is to give preparation time to Ximen clan and Dragon clan. And at that time when they gather in Magic Domain, we will take action.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head and agreeing to White Tiger he said. \u201cBut you should also remember that, the main target of the action after five days is only disruption, not killing. Ling Yanqi this person will be handled by Great Bear, Vermilion Bird and Jade Maiden. Void and White Tiger will be responsible to obstruct other people of Magic Domain. All remaining things, leave it to me, I will finish them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about us, Little You?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t call out her and Little Yu\u2019s name, Muyue couldn\u2019t help but ask. As for Little Yu, Ren Tianyou had already told about this plan, so she didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, Little Yu is not too well these few days, so I want to trouble you to take care of her.\u201d Ren Tianyou said the good excuse he had already prepared.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want Muyue to join this operation, because after 5 days, Ximen clan would most likely appear in Magic Domain. Although she had already lost her memories, but everyone of Ximen clan however hadn\u2019t. So Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want to make any unexpected mistake. And previously, the relation between Ximen Yue\u2019er and every one of Ximen clan was unlike his, she didn\u2019t have any hatred towards them, so Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want to let her hands contaminated by the blood of Ximen clan, as that would be very unfair to her.</p><br/><p>As a result, Ren Tianyou requested Little Yu to help him in concealing this matter when they were on the way. And asked her to stay with elder sister Yue\u2019er in Dark Capital until they resolve the matter of Magic Domain. After that they would return to Dark Capital and all of them will leave this place together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you, Little Yu? Where are you feeling unwell?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, as expected the attention of Muyue shifted to Little Yu and she asked with concern while sizing up her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I also don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, these past few days, my head always feel dizzy and I cannot exert strength as if I have no strength at all.\u201d Sure enough, after hearing Ren Tianyou, Little Yu immediately held her forehead and feign to be unwell.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that is the case, I will stay to take care of you. I will also not be in ease if I leave you alone here.\u201d Seeing Little Yu\u2019s that feeling unwell appearance, Muyue immediately said worriedly. She didn\u2019t insist on going to Magic Domain with everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u201d Seeing she no longer insist to go to Magic Domain, Long Yi heave a long sigh of relief while wiping out the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in that case, here and now dismiss. Everyone do your respective activity and wait for the arrival of the day after five days.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at everyone, then said after standing up.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the imperial capital Tianlong city of Ailer Empire, inside a mansion, Ximen Batian hit the table. Along with the \u2018peng\u2019 sound, this table was directly smashed into pieces. And the teacup on the table also shattered after falling on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally found that beast after three years, didn\u2019t expect he would actually come out on his own initiative.\u201d Ximen Batian coldly said with his face filled with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cClan head, according to the news received from spy, Akatsuki organization will invade Magic Domain after 5 days, what should we do?\u201d In the hall, one spy kneeling in front of Ximen Batian said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I won\u2019t let this beast have an easy time.\u201d Ximen Batian snorted coldly, and waved his hand to signal this guy to retreat. After that guy retreated, Ximen Batian turned around and walk to cella. He was going to arrange a plan for after five days.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Inside Flame Phoenix Villa of Light Empire, Feng Yunmeng was reading the intelligence report. Finally she slowly placed it down and sighed, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect after three years, this little fellow actually got mad like this, moreover this time my daughter is also following him to Magic Domain. His gallbladder truly have enough guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVilla Master, should we sent reinforcement?\u201d An old woman standing by the side of Feng Yunmeng politely asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I will personally go for a round trip, but unless it is out of absolute necessity, I will not raise my hand. Moreover I, Feng Yunmeng\u2019s daughter is also not weak, beside that kid is also not that simple.\u201d Feng Yunmeng shook her hand to signal her to not worry,</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>In Elf Source, when Elf Queen heard the reported news from the elder, her matchless beautiful face exposed a smile, \u201cThat kid is actually planning to fight Magic Domain. Very good, this time I will go personally and see this kid\u2019s and his organization\u2019s means.\u201d Finished speaking, the body of Elf Queen changed into green colored radiances and disappeared from this main hall.</p><br/><p>While at the same time, all the big forces of continent had basically received the news about Akatsuki organization invading Magic Domain after 5 days which suddenly shocked the entire continent. They had never thought that the organization that had invaded the Ximen clan last time was actually going to appear once again, moreover their target this time actually was Magic Domain which was scared place for all magicians. All the big forces immediately sent someone to Dark Empire planning to take a look at the strength of Akatsuki.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

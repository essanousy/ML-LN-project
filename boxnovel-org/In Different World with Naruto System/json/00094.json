Then along with the \u2018ka ka\u2019 clear sound of freezing, this layer of ice rapidly froze this Rashomon and this freezing quickly extend towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d The eyes of Ren Tianyou flashed with shock, then the space ring in his right hand immediately flashed with radiances, and a picture scroll and writing brush appeared in his hands. After that Ren Tianyou immediately opened the picture scroll, and using the writing brush with his right hand, he quickly started to draw. Very quickly the drawing took the form of an ink colored eagle. Then throwing away writing brush he quickly made hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinpo\u2014\u2014 Choju Giga!\u201d (Ninja Art\u2014\u2014 Super Beast Scroll!)</p><br/><p>Along with the completion of this ninjutsu, the painted eagle looked like it suddenly came back to life, immediately flapped its wing and flew out from the scroll. Then it carried Ren Tianyou on its back and quickly flew in the sky. Just after Ren Tianyou had flew in the sky, the Rashomons on the ground were completely frozen, after that with a \u2018kacha kacha\u2019 sound, it shattered into small pieces and dissipated into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a terrifying ice system energy, actually capable enough to freeze and disintegrate my Rashomons.\u201d Looking at the disintegrated Rashomons, Ren Tianyou was shocked. With regard to the defense capacity of Rashomons, Ren Tianyou was perfectly clear, but now this ice system energy was actually able to completely freeze and disintegrated it. From this it was thus clear that to what extent the cold was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all stay here, you must not set foot inside my layer of ice.\u201d Ximen Xinbo turned his head towards the younger generation of Ximen clan, and said. Then he, Ximen Shu and other 3 Saint-ranked warriors directly flew after Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber two, did you notice?\u201d In the sky, Ximen Shu suddenly came next to Ximen Xinbo and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, from the very beginning this guy have already used Sand system, wind system and fire system, these 3 types of energies. And with the exception of Wind system, other 2 is already at the level of at least God-rank standard. But from the very beginning this guy had never flew in the sky, and it is a common knowledge that after reaching a minimum of Saint-rank, anyone can be able to fly freely.\u201d Ximen Xinbo nodded his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, for the beginning we are attacking him in succession, but he never flew in the air. And when your \u2018Freeze over thousand li\u2019 appeared, finally he summoned this strange bird, and sitting on its back he flew in the sky. This clearly explain the reason behind why he isn\u2019t flying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that it\u2019s not like he don\u2019t want to fly, but he can\u2019t fly.\u201d Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo simultaneously said in unison. After that both of them looked at each other, \u201cAlthough this guess is extremely hard to believe, nevertheless it\u2019s extremely possible. We can use this weakness against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ximen Xinbo answered. Then immediately started to chant an incantation, and Ximen Shu also immediately send the gold colored sword energy slash flying towards Ren Tianyou, no, towards the huge bird beneath Ren Tianyou. And the 3 saint-ranked body guards also got command from Ximen Shu, so they also immediately send out several battle qi slash towards that huge bird beneath Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Seeing the target of their attack, Ren Tianyou was surprised and bewildered, then he immediately commanded the ink eagle to quickly dodge, and was successfully able to dodge their attacks in succession. But at that time, suddenly the \u2018breaking through the void\u2019 sound came from behind him, looking behind, he saw a huge ice system ice dragon had appeared behind them. And it was advanced towards Ren Tianyou in a high speed by flapped its huge wings.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou who was riding on the back of ink eagle, immediately jumped down in the air. Just after he had jumped out from its body, the huge ice dragon swallowed this ink eagle. \u201cSuccess.\u201d Seeing his magic had successfully destroyed its target, Ximen Xinbo was excitedly yelled. But this excitement of his was suddenly interrupted by the following change.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou again took out a picture scroll, and again using Ninpo\u2014Choju Giga (Ninja Art\u2014 Super Beast Scroll), another ink eagle flew out and Ren Tianyo just landed on its back and flew again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The smile of Xmen Xinbo thoroughly froze, and he didn\u2019t dared to believe what he was seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems they already discovered.\u201d Standing on the back of ink eagle, Ren Tianyou thought, and inside his heart decided to become serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt cannot be delayed any longer, let\u2019s kill this annoying mage first.\u201d Ren Tianyou firmly stared at that God-ranked Ximen Xinbo. The magic of this fellow was extremely troublesome for Ren Tianyou. So he decided to kill this mage first. \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, before anything let\u2019s use this move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Underneath the mask, the right eye of Ren Tianyou suddenly released a formidable eye power, then his right eye became bloodshot, and looked extremely frightening, however the mask had obstruct other from seeing this, so no one could see this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoujutsu\u2014\u2014-Amaterasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the space around the left hand of Ximen XInbo suddenly started to fluctuate for a moment, and a black colored flame suddenly appeared, then that black flame immediately covered the left arm of Ximen Xinbo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh!\u201d Along with this sudden appearance of flame, Ximen Xinbo gave a horrible shriek. And he immediately released a huge amount of ice system magical power towards his arm to put out this flame, but the unexpected thing was this flame didn\u2019t get extinguished even after it encountered his formidable ice system magical power, and the fire actually was getting bigger and bigger and already surrounded his entire left arm.</p><br/><p>This was indeed one of the power of his two eyes, doujutsu of right eye\u2014-Amaterasu! This jutsu produces a black colored flame at the focal point of the user\u2019s vision, once this flame starts to burn, it couldn\u2019t be extinguish with anything. And until it didn\u2019t burn to death its target it would never extinguish, and everything in this world including energies were just a burning ingredient for this flame, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber two!\u201d Seeing the miserable condition of Ximen Xinbo, Ximen Shu cried out in alarm, and hastily flew at his side. And then he thought to use his hand covered with battle qi to extinguish this flame in the hand of Ximen Xinbo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come here.\u201d But he didn\u2019t expected that Ximen Xinbo would yell in a painful voice to stop his steps, then he said, \u201cNumber one, don\u2019t use energy, this flame is quite strange, just cut off my arm quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut number two\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hearing Ximen Xinbo, Ximen Shu hesitated, must he really cut off the hand of his own younger brother with his own hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly ah number one, wait until this flame swallow my entire body, and I am dead. Compared to losing a life, losing a hand is much better.\u201d Ximen Xinbo cried, and urged Ximen Shu to quickly move.</p><br/><p>Ximen Shu gritted his teeth, harden his heart, and with a quick slash from the dragon sword in his right hand, the left arm of Ximen Xinbo which was covered with black flame was immediately cut off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh.\u201d Ximen Xinbo let out a blood-curdling scream. And the blood started to unceasingly flow out from the cut off left arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber two.\u201d Ximen Shu hastily flew to the side of Ximen Xinbo, caught his body, then poured his battle qi on the wound of left arm of Ximen Xinbo, temporarily preventing the blood loss from the wound.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou got down on one knee on the back of ink eagle, then right hand covered the right eye location of the mask. Now he was feeling a stinging pain in his pupil of right eye, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect even after the system had eliminated the side effects, the pain is still this strong, after using this doujutsu. I truly couldn\u2019t imagine if the system had not reduced the pain and normal side effects, what kind of sensation I would be feeling after using doujutsu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill.\u201d Ren Tianyou stared at the cut off arm of Ximen Xinbo, and the corner of his mouth started to twitch unceasingly, \u201cI never expected amaterasu would miss the target, I originally wanted to hit his head and finish him off, but it instead hit on his arm. It completely missed the target, is it because this is the first time I have used Amaterasu? Even so he at least lost his arm, and his fighting capacity greatly reduced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond grandfather, are you okay?\u201d Ximen Yue\u2019er flew at the side of Ximen Xinbo, and asked nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay Yue\u2019er. You should so down, you are not capable enough to take part in this battle.\u201d After his blood flow from his wound was stopped, Ximen Xinbo got up, and looking at Ximen Yue\u2019er with a pale face, he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo down.\u201d Ximen Xinbo coldly snorted and interrupted XImen Yue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ximen Yue\u2019er couldn\u2019t help but retreat and go down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one, summon them.\u201d Ximen Xinbo turned his head towards Ximen Shu and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that is our only choice.\u201d Ximen Shu couldn\u2019t help but agree, he had never thought that this matter would developed to current condition.</p><br/><p>After finished speaking, Ximen Shu and Ximen XInbo looked at each other, then they simultaneously released a huge amount of energy, and gradually two huge black hole appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out, our partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cAooooooo!\u201d, \u201cAoooooo!\u201d [T.L: roar of the dragon.]</p><br/><p>After both Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo yelled, two extremely loud dragon roar suddenly came out form inside that two black hole.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

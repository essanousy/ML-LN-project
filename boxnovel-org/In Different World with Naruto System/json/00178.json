Now they finally understood clearly why Vermilion Bird was so fearful of her mother. Just hearing about the reaction of her mother, they absolutely believed that her mother had the temperament of a Tyrannosaurus, so who would be fearless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Vermilion Bird, don\u2019t think of slipping away. This matter is related to my elder sister Yue\u2019er, so you should slightly sacrifice yourself, and accompany me in this visit. \u201dWhen he saw that Vermilion Bird wanted to flee, Ren Tianyou immediately got anxious.

And sensed the unbridled stares of his companions behind him, Ren Tianyou\u2019s thick-skinned face also instantly become red all of a sudden. Only after noticing that Little Yu was not angry did he sigh in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, they are\u2026?\u201d Seeing the intimate action of Ren Tianyou with their family\u2019s Miss, and the Miss\u2019s unexpected lack of any form of resistance, Xiao Lan and Xiao Mei glanced at each other, and saw the surprise on the face of each other, then curiously asked Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are my friends, I brought them here to have fun in our house. So let them enter and look at our Flame Phoenix Villa for a while.\u201d Vermilion Bird adjusted her state of mind, then continued speaking, \u201cNow I\u2019m going to take them to meet my mother, so make way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Miss, the Villa Mistress commanded us not to let any outsider enter our Flame Phoenix Villa, so if we let them enter like this, Villa Mistress will blame us.\u201d Xiao Lan looked at Feng Wu with a miserable expression on her face, as she replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are so foolish.\u201d Hearing Xiao Lan, Vermilion Bird used the finger of her jade hands to point at their heads, and continued, \u201cIsn\u2019t Villa Mistress my mother?

Unusual fiery red colored trees were grown inside the villa, and many fiery red colored leaves of trees were emitting a pale red light, and from a far, it looked as if these trees were emitting flames. Across the front courtyard, there was a courtyard for practicing martial arts. Many young girls wearing skin tight training dresses were currently dancing with long swords in that courtyard, making a beautiful scenery.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, isn\u2019t this a kingdom of women? Wouldn\u2019t it be very pleasurable to stay here?\u201d Seeing these young girls on the training courtyard, Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes lit up, as he madly howled inside his heart. Fortunately his face was covered with a bamboo hat, otherwise his drooling face would have been exposed for all to see.</p><br/><p>After these young girls saw Feng Wu, each and every one of them stopped what they were doing and greeted her. Feng Wu also smiled and greeted everyone back. Under the strange gazes of everyone, she continued to lead Ren Tianyou and the others.</p><br/><p>After passing the training courtyard, they continued to walk for several minutes, only then did they arrive to their destination, the hall! Vermilion Bird took Ren Tianyou and the others and entered the hall, however inside the hall, with the exception of a few maids, there was nobody else.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Seeing the figure of Feng Wu, the few maids also had a look of surprise and delight, they bowed towards Vermilion Bird, and greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go and make several cups of tea, you go and notify my mother about my arrival, just say that I have returned.\u201d Vermilion Bird instructed the two maids.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss!\u201d Replied the two maids, then respectfully stepped back, then went to do as Feng Wu\u2019s instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Vermilion Bird, from your current appearance, it seems you are not afraid to meet your mother.\u201d After Ren Tianyou and the others respectively sat on the seats in the hall, White Tiger looked at Vermilion Bird and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am still afraid, but what can I do, after all I won\u2019t be able to hide from her forever.\u201d Vermilion Bird slowly opened her mouth. She also knew that no matter how well she hides, she would have to meet her mother someday, as it would be impossible for her to hide for her entire life.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, our beautiful Vermilion Bird wants to communicate.\u201d Hearing Vermilion Bird, Ren Tianyou said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and the others also laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou and the others were laughing, Vermilion Bird snorted coldly, and no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while, the maid came back holding a few cups tea, and gave everyone a cup and retreated. After that Vermilion Bird and the others sat there slowly drinking tea, waiting for Feng Wu\u2019s mother\u2014\u2014-Feng Yunmeng\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>After waiting for about five minutes, Ren Tianyou who was sitting suddenly sensed someone, and looked towards the entrance of the hall.</p><br/><p>At that time, a figure emitting golden colored flames suddenly entered from outside the hall, blazing heat spread all over the hall. Everyone\u2019s vision blurred for a moment, and after their vision was restored, they all saw a well-developed beautiful woman about thirty years of age had appeared in front of Vermilion Bird, and the face of this beautiful woman and the face of Vermilion Bird were very similar.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wu, so you actually know how to come back? Good, and you also know that running away from the mountain would really anger me, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d The beautiful woman looked at Feng Wu who was sitting and drinking a tea, and one stone inside her heart fell down (ie .relieved). However she nevertheless berated her (Feng Wu) with her (Motherly) mouth, also she extended her right hand to hit the head of Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, mother, I will never dare to run away again anymore, please forgive me, pretty please?\u201d Seeing the gesture of this married woman, Vermilion Bird immediately knew her next move, so she immediately placed the tea cup on the table, and threw herself into the bosom of her mother and started acting like a spoiled child.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, you!\u201d Feeling Feng Wu in her embrace, this beautiful woman, i.e. Feng Wu\u2019s mother, Feng Yumeng couldn\u2019t help but smile and stopped the movement of her right hand. After that, she returned her extended hand.</p><br/><p>Only after this she suddenly discovered Ren Tianyou and others who were also sitting inside the hall, so she asked with surprise, \u201cWho are you people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Feng Wu could introduce them, Ren Tianyou took the initiative to stand up, and took off his bamboo hat.

So, 3 days later, all the participant give it your best to obtain the best result. Now let\u2019s begin our today\u2019s lesson.\u201d After the announcement, Wang Jiafei started the lesson.</p><br/><p>As the time went by, the lesson also ended. After the lesson was finished, Wang Haiqing and Sun Chuquan came at the side of Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cTianyou, is there any certainty that you can win the competition?\u201d Wang Haiqing asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I am also not sure. Only after the competition ends, I will know the result.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head saying he was not certain. Ren Tianyou was speaking truth. Because he was from warrior court, if during the competition he use 5 element ninjutsu, then at that time he won\u2019t be able to explain well about it to the authorities. So he had to use only taijutsu in this competition, so he was not too sure whether he could win or not. No need to speak about other student of different class or department, he didn\u2019t have 100% certainty to defeat Yan Xinluo who was also the student of same class with only taijutsu. After all member of Sishen clan which was one of the 100 ancient clans is not that simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, in the competition you must be careful against someone.\u201d Suddenly Sun seriously said towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, who?\u201d Seeing the serious expression of Sun Chuqian, Ren Tianyou curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Yanli, member of the Magic court and the champion for grade 1 in the last competition. In the last competition I fought against him, but under his magic attacks, I didn\u2019t last even 30 seconds and was defeated. You should know that my water spirit battle qi suppress his fire system magic, however even if it was like that I was defeated under 30 seconds.\u201d Recalling the match between her and Wang Yanli and also recalling that overwhelming fire system magic, involuntarily a trace of fear appeared in the eyes of Sun Chuqian.</p><br/><p>Hearing the narration of Sun Chuqian, the facial expression of Ren Tianyou and Wang Haiqing became a bit serious. Sun Chuqian had water spirit battle qi and her strength is already at peak swordmaster level. Also water system suppress fire system but even with this advantage, she unexpectedly didn\u2019t even last even 30 seconds against the fire system magician. This shows how terrifying the strength of Wang Yanli is.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Chuqian. I am also not to be trifled with, when the moment comes I will avenge you.\u201d Ren Tianyou patted the soft shoulder of Sun Chuqian, and gave her a reassuring look. \u201cMoreover, our class still have an abnormal, Yan Xinluo. The strength of that man with paralyzed face is not that weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>They chatted for a while, after that Ren Tianyou left the classroom. Seeing Luo Tianxing and others, he told them that he will be participating in the competition. They were extremely happy to learn about his participation, and pledged that, at that time they will come to cheer him.</p><br/><p>In the remaining 3 days, Ren Tianyou spend all his time in intense training of Naruto\u2019s Wind style\u2014Rasen Shuriken. He had finally mastered nature change of wind attribute with a great difficulty, so it was natural for him for wanting to learn this S ranked ninjutsu which he had coveting for a long period of time. Even after 3 days of intense training, Ren Tianyou still couldn\u2019t completely mastered this Wind style\u2014Rasen Shuriken. But mastered the prototype of this ninjutsu. Even if this was a prototype, compared to the power of ordinary Rasengan, it was several times more powerful. Just like in the original Naruto world, Naruto using this prototype rasen suriken completely destroyed the ordinary rasengan used by Kakashi and almost wasted the right hand of Kakashi.</p><br/><p>9th day of 3rd month, this was the day when everyone\u2019s most anticipated \u2018cultivation room ranking competition\u2019 begins. This day several tens of thousands students were gathered at the square of Supreme light academy and waiting the start of the competition.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou and the other students of his class were following Wang Jiafei and Yun Leixiao and arrived at the square. They saw that several tens of thousands students were already gathered to watch the competition and the square was filled with the sound of discussions.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou followed the other students of his class and waited for about 20 minutes, only after that 2 old men with white bread suddenly appeared above the arena of the square. Among that 2 old men, the taller one wearing a magnificent dress took a few steps forward and said, \u201cEvery students of Supreme light academy, good morning! I am dean of Supreme light academy, Long Feilu. Our academy\u2019s \u2018cultivation room ranking competition\u2019 is about to begin. Everyone coming from different clans, or coming from different region of Divine wind continent, will have the chance to display their strength in this arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs all of you were able to enter Supreme light academy, I believe all of you are outstanding. And you have already cultivated inside this academy for a long time, so today\u2019s test is to examine the result of your cultivation. So today is the best opportunity for you to display the result of your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I declare the official start of cultivation room ranking competition. All the teacher, please guide the participant of your class towards the arena and let them draw out the number for the match sequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, other people dismissed. All 5 participant follow me to the front to draw the number.\u201d Wang Jiafei turned her head towards students and said and started to walk towards the arena.</p><br/><p>Several students had already arrived here and already drew the numbers. Wang Jiafei walked towards the middle-aged man who was sitting at the side of the box and said something. Then Wang Jiafei facing Ren Tianyou and others beckoned to step forward, \u201cWell, draw out a number from that box. Then register here. Then take care of your drawn number plate. During the competition this number plate will be your proof of identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tian you and other all advanced towards the box, then Ren Tianyou put his hand inside that box and fumble once. Then he casually drew out a metal plates, a gold colored metal place was in his hand within which number 61 was written. The he returned to the side of Wang Jiafei, and handed that plate to her. Seeing the number written in the number plate drawn by Ren Tianyou, that middle-aged man took out a mystic mirror screen, then added the number 61 at the side of the name of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you can go to rest, Tianyou. Wait until your name appears in the magic screen of square, then go to the arena displayed there.\u201d Seeing that the registration of Ren Tianyou was complete, Wang Jiefei allowed him to go for a rest.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stepped down from the arena, then walked towards the empty corner, then closed his eyes to rest. Almost an hour later, along with the sound of weapon colliding, the cultivation room ranking competition was officially started. Ren Tianyou was bored looking at the matches in the arena. Again nearly an hour later, in the huge magic screen at the side of arena appeared the name of Ren Tianyou and his opponent. His opponent was from magic court named Li Yi and their match was at arena number 6.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou stepped on the arena, that person called Li Yi was already on the arena waiting for him. Ren Tianyou moved towards the one side of the arena and waved his hand signaling the judge that he was ready.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, both opponent are present. First I will tell you the match rules. In the middle of the match, if any party fell outside the arena, admit defeat, or when I decided unable to continue, that one will lose. In the middle of the match, one must not intentionally harm or disable the opponent. The violator of this rule is directly expelled from this academy. Well, match start.\u201d The judge of the match told them the rule first, then announced the start of the match. Just after the judge announced the start of the match, a magic barrier completely surrounded the arena.</p><br/><p>Along with the announcement of match start by the judge, in a flash Li Yi started to noiselessly chant the incantation. A strong magic fluctuation started to well up at the magic staff he was holding in his right hand.</p><br/><p>Magicians had zero close combat capacity. As a result in a match against warrior, first thing they must do, was to distance themselves from that warrior and release the magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSudden fierce wind dance.\u201d Completing his chant, suddenly a strong wind blew up towards the sky from the magic wand of Li Yi. Then after 2 or 3 second, a strong tornado appeared on the arena. And by the control of Li Yi, that tornado advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly Ren Tianyou stood there motionless, and looked like he didn\u2019t plan to dodge this attack of Li Yi. Then the attack of Li Yi completely covered Ren Tianyou. Li Yi felt surprised to win this easily, just at that time, he suddenly felt pain behind his neck. Shortly afterwards he fell unconscious without knowing anything. Ren Tianyou was supposed to be at the place of the magic attack of Li Yi, but unexpectedly he was already behind Li Yi and now his hand was stretched in the form of knife.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the match of Ren Tianyou, suddenly everyone cried out. No one was clear about what had just happened. Only the eyes of these experts present became serious. Only they had clearly seen what had happened. When that magic had almost hit him, in a split second he had arrived behind Li Yi with a very fast speed, then he hit the backside of the neck of the Li Yi by making his hand knife shaped.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He intend to use the ability of susanoo\u2019s Sword of Totsuka to completely seal it.</p><br/><p>Seeing the huge giant that had surrounded the body of Ren Tianyou, the face hidden behind the head gear of that mysterious man who was standing behind the beast of resentment was filled with shock. From this body of huge giant, extremely powerful pressure was spreading in all direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the ultimate doujutsu of Uchiha clan\u2014\u2014\u2013Susanoo.\u201d Shukaku who was nearest to the Susanoo of Ren Tianyou could clearly feel powerful pressure. Previously in the naruto world, it had only heard about the terrible might of susanoo, but it had never personally seen it, and had never thought that he would be able to see this susanoo in another world.</p><br/><p>Sensing the strong power of Susanoo all around his body, Ren Tianyou was full of self-confident inside his heart. Then he waved his right hand, and from inside the bottle gourd, suddenly a powerful fiery red sword blade came out, this was one of the 3 magic treasure, Sword of Totsuka which had the powerful ability to seal anything it cuts.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou walked towards that beast of resentment step by step, and then susanoo who was emitting a powerful pressure, waved its right hand which was holding Sword of Totsuka, and the Sword of Totsuka directly stabbed the body of that beast of resentment.</p><br/><p>Just when Ren Tianyou wanted to use the sealing ability of Sword of Totsuka, he discovered that there was no movement in his Sword of Totsuka. Then Ren Tianyou calmly looked in front, and discovered that although Sword of Totsuka had entered the body of beast of resentment, nevertheless it was basically powerless to seal it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Seeing that the ability of his Sword of Totsuka was also failure, Ren Tianyou was greatly surprised. Just then a terrifying roar directly resounded inside his mind, this violently shook his mind, and he suddenly threw up a mouth full of blood. Due to the violent shaking of his mind, he could no longer mantain susanoo, and the susanoo gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>And just at this time, beast of resentment attacked Ren Tianyou with its right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Seeing that the susanoo of Ren Tianyou had disappeared, furthermore that beast of resentment was attacking at that time, Shukaku exclaimed loudly. Then it instantly made its move, it released a huge amount of chakra and instantly control the sand underneath Ren Tianyou, this sands quickly warped Ren Tianyou and retreated along with Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou who was surrounded by sand flew back on the head of Shukaku. \u201cBoy, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sorry for the trouble.\u201d Slowly calming down his state of mind, Ren Tianyou wiped out the blood from the corner of his mouth. Then he answered Shukaku.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do now? Your susanoo is also of no use here, now should I use Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb)? Even though it is just a huge collection of energy, after I use my Bijudama, it would not be completely unscathed.\u201d Shukaku said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Hearing the suggestion of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou thought for a while, he had seen this Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb) only in anime, so he was not certain about the true might of this attack. So after a careful thought, Ren Tianyou decided to let Shukaku use Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb) and see its true might.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianou carefully thought once again, and decided to not let Shukaku use Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb), because it was still not time for using that move, \u201cNo need to use Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb) for now, I want to use one ninjutsu to see whether this will have any effect or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this Shukaku, if my ninjutsu didn\u2019t work, then you can use Bijudama (Tailed Beast Bomb).\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Shukaku. After that he suppressed his internal injury and jump down from the head of Shukaku.</p><br/><p>Looking at the huge body of beast of resentment, Ren Tianyou he quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cKaton\u2014\u2013Goryuka no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014\u2013Dragon Flame Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the voice of Ren Tianyou, a huge fiery dragon was spit out from the mouth of Ren Tianyou. This flame flew over the head of that beast.</p><br/><p>This huge fiery dragon flew towards the sky and rapidly dissipated, and huge quantity of heat appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, dumb idiot, can it be that the condition of your injury is so serious that you can\u2019t even control your own magic spell. You are actually attacking the empty sky, ha ha.\u201d Seeing that powerful fiery dragon actually dissipated in this way, that mysterious person burst into a loud laughter, and ridiculed Ren Tianyou. Even Shukaku was wondering what was wrong with Ren Tianyou, and whether the injury of Ren Tianyou was really that serious.</p><br/><p>No, of course not. Ren Tianyou had missed this ninjutsu in a purpose. Now above all of them in the sky, suddenly dark clouds were gathering, and lightning were unceasingly moving inside these dark clouds. And rain stated to slowly fall from these clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cShukaku, you move back a little, I am not that good in controlling this ninjutsu, I fear this ninjutsu may accidently hit you if you are there.\u201d Looking at the thunder clouds that was gathering in the sky, Ren Tianyou warned Shukaku. After that he made a series of hand seals, \u201cDoton\u2014\u2013Chidokaku! (Earth Style\u2014\u2013Mobile Core!)\u201d Ren Tianyou yelled and slammed his right hand on the ground, then the ground underneath Ren Tianyou suddenly stated to shake, after that the ground around him suddenly started to rise towards the sky. Now Ren Tianyou was high in the air, he had almost reached those dark clouds in the sky.</p><br/><p>After Shukaku heard Ren Tianyou, it looked at the movement of Ren Tianyou, and immediately retreated back. And seeing this scene, that mysterious man also stopped laughing, he didn\u2019t know what Ren Tianyou was up to now.</p><br/><p>At this time, a sharp bird cry suddenly resounded from above, as a strong lighting light sprang out from the right hand of Ren Tianyou, this was his chidori.</p><br/><p>After that he raised his right hand towards the sky, and from the middle of this dark clouds, huge natural lightning power were drawn towards his right hand\u2019s chidori, and started to gather in the space above him in succession.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was continuously waving his right hand, and these lightning were continuously drawing above him, and under his control, this gathered lightning were slowly taking the form of huge creature. If any of the Chinese had seen this huge creature\u2019s form, then they would absolutely cry out in alarm, \u201cQilin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, the lightning that was continuously rolling over and over inside the dark cloud was precisely qilin made up of lightning. After Ren Tianyou had mastered the nature change of lightning system, all along he had made a great effort to learn \u2018Lightning style\u2014Kirin\u2019, the super level ninjutsu. Finally not too long ago, Ren Tianyou had managed to learn this move with great difficulty. And in this trip to the God Weeping region, he had reached the kage level, also had his doujutsu enhanced significantly, this made the chakra control of Ren Tianyou even more precise. And after discovering even his Susanoo was useless against this enemy, Ren Tianyou instantly thought of Sasuke\u2019s Kirin. He thought that due to the ultra large attack range of this ninjutsu, he could instantly destroy this terrifying ferocious beast.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou indifferently looked at this beast of resentment and mysterious man. Now he didn\u2019t care about capturing this man alive, he just want to settle this fight.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou waved his right hand and pointed towards the beast of resentment. Suddenly the qilin in the sky instantly advanced towards the ground with overbearing aura in a very high speed. It was so fast that Shukaku could only see a flash of bright light and it immediately heard an extremely loud sound of explosion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning style\u2014\u2014Kirin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d An extremely loud sound spread all over the surroundings, and this powerful explosion soon spread to the whole island.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

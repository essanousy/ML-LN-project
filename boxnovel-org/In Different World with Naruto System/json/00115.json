And the water of this lake was not transparent, but was actually completely black in color.</p><br/><p>And around this lake, there were many multi-colored small grasses, which was emitting an enchanting aura. However, looking at these small grasses Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t even had any excited expression, because he knew that, in reality the more beautiful things the more dangerous.</p><br/><p>Just then, a pure and fresh fragrance assailed his nostrils, then the originally depressed heart of Ren Tianyou because of the environment of God Weeping region couldn\u2019t help but shook. After that Ren Tianyou followed the direction of this fragrance, and saw 3 flower whose whole body was purple in color. And when he looked at it carefully, he noticed that this was an exotic flower with 7 colored petals.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple gauze sky magnificent flower!\u201d After he noticed that this flower was exactly same as the flower picture he had seen in the academy, Ren Tianyou exclaimed. And the unexpected thing for Ren Tianyou was, there was actually 3 purple gauze sky magnificent flower. So Ren Tianyou was really surprised.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou carefully advanced towards the direction of these flowers step by step. Although Ren Tianyou was pleasantly surprised after he saw 3 purple gauze sky magnificent flower, nevertheless Ren Tianyou was also extremely vigilance as the guardian of this purple gauze sky magnificent flower had not come out yet.</p><br/><p>All the way, he didn\u2019t come across any danger, and that thing also still didn\u2019t show up. \u201cWant to take advantage of the moment I pick up and kill me in a single hit? I will do your wish.\u201d Noticing that 7 rings silver twisted snake still hadn\u2019t showed up, Ren Tianyou thought for a moment, and easily understood the intention of this magical beast. Then Ren Tianyou quickly bent towards purple gauze sky magnificent flower and stretched out his right hand. Just when the right hand of Ren Tianyou was about to reach purple gauze sky magnificent flower, he suddenly heard a peculiar movement sound, and the earth beneath his feet suddenly loosen up, and 7 colored light launched towards the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Sensing the abnormal movement under his foot, Ren Tianyou immediately knew what was going on. Then he immediately used Kamui of right eye, and then the 7 colored light pierced through the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Using kamui, Ren Tianyou successfully dodged the surprise attack of 7 rings silver twisted snake, and then he immediately opened up a distance between himself and purple gauze sky magnificent flower. After that he looked in front and saw a long snake which was more than 30 centimeters in lengths, and its body had the long strips of red, orange, yellow, green, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026and so on, 7 colored rings of light. And on its head there was also 7 colored crest which had the shape of small snake. This was the terrifying magical beasts which was the guardian of purple gauze sky magnificent flower\u2014\u2014\u20147 rings silver twisted snake.</p><br/><p>7 rings silver twisted snake coiled its body, and started in front and paid full attention at the human who wanted to take its treasure. And surprise was flashing in the pair of its eyes, it couldn\u2019t understand why was this human still able to stand after it had pierced through his body.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou actually was also surprised, he had never thought that this magical beast was actually this smart. It had actually concealed its presence, and attacked from unexpected place, if not for his kamui, he would have really fallen into deep trouble.</p><br/><p>Just then, Ren Tianyou suddenly saw that this 7 rings silver twisted snake was making its move. He saw that it had opened its mouth, and exposed its long fangs, then a pitch black venom was shot towards Ren Tianyou. After that Ren Tianyou immediately smelled a foul smell from the atmosphere, which immediately caused the body of Ren Tianyou numb, and immediately felt powerless throughout his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, the smell of this venom is also poisonous.\u201d Feeling the unusual condition of his body, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but exclaimed inside his heart. He really had never thought that the venom of this 7 rings silver twisted snake was actually this toxicity, just the smell was extremely poisonous.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou hastily closed his nose, he used his chakra to temporarily slow down the spread of the poison inside his body, then an eye power gushed out from his right Mangekyo Sharingan, and the incoming venoms directly passed through his body. Just at that time, from the corner of his eyes he saw a 7 colored light beam advancing towards himself, so he immediately used kamui again and dodged 7 rings silver twisted snake. And the venoms that had passed through the body of Ren Tianyou fell in the ground behind him, and the ground was immediately corroded, and a green smoke started to rise from that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, I can\u2019t continue to drag on. And this guy is too fast.\u201d Seeing the speed of 7 rings silver twisted snake, Ren Tianyou made a wry smile. Its speed was basically comparable to his own speed after he opened his 6th gate, really too fast, and also\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>He was feeling the gradual loss of his strength inside his body. The poison inside his body was gradually showing its effect, but fortunately, he had only smelled a trace of the venom smell. The venom of this 7 rings silver twisted snake was really powerful, and even the trace of the its venom should not be underestimate, due to this trace of the venom, Ren Tianyou had fallen in disadvantageous position. Now he had no choice but to think of a way to finish off this 7 rings silver twisted snake as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst I need to lure this guy far away, or else careless use fire style ninjutsu may destroy purple gauze sky magnificent flower. That would make me even more miserable.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought for a moment, then prepared his next move. That was to lure this magical beast away from here.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ren Tianyou was running away, that 7 rings silver twisted snake had a little bit of hesitation on its eyes, after that it changed into a light beam and rushed after Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Sensing that 7 rings silver twisted snake was chasing after him, Ren Tianyou was delighted. Then he accelerated his speed even further and ran forward. After running for more than 500 meters, thanks to the poison, the 7 rings silver twisted snake was already catching up to him.</p><br/><p>Just then, extremely thin light flew from the hand of Ren Tianyou towards 7 rings silver twisted snake. Carefully looking this was Nuibari (Needle sword) which was one of the 7 sword of the mist, which Ren Tianyou had exchanged previously.</p><br/><p>But 7 rings silver twisted snake\u2019s speed was as fast as lightning, and as a high rank 7 magical beast, it used the minimum movement to easily dodged the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Do you think it is this easy to dodge?\u201d Seeing that his attack was easily dodged, Ren Tianyou snorted, then he stopped running. Then he moved the string on his right hand which was tied to the end of the needle sword, then under the control of Ren Tianyou, the needle sword suddenly changed its direction, and continued towards 7 rings silver twisted snake.</p><br/><p>7 rings silver twisted snake displayed its nimble movements, it quickly twisted its body and the needle sword just lightly touched the body of 7 rings silver twisted snake and flew passed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Ren Tianyou again snorted, then moved the string again. Then needle sword again changed its direction and the strong thread attached to the end of needle sword suddenly coiled around the body of 7 rings silver twisted snake, and its body was tightly tied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess.\u201d Seeing that he had already caught this 7 rings silver twisted snake, Ren Tianyou exclaimed with excitement. But the next scene completely froze his excitement. From the surface of the scale of this snake, a liquid was spilling over, then under the lubrication of this liquid, this snake quickly slipped through its binding. Then it suddenly changed into a light beam and quickly rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d the body of this snake again penetrated through the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuiton\u2014\u2013Bakusui Shoha! (Water style\u2014\u2013Exploding Water Shock Wave!)\u201d After dodging the attack of that snake by using kamui, Ren Tainyou quickly made a series of hand seals, then he spit out a great volume of water from his mouth, which gradually formed into a small-size lake, and the 7 rings silver twisted snake was completely inside this water. But without even the hint of obstruction, this snake swam inside this water towards Ren Tianyou who was standing on the surface of water. But Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t use this ninjutsu to finish off this snake, rather as a \u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Since you are coming, you won\u2019t be able to escape. Riton\u2014-Jibashi! (Lightning Style\u2014-Earth Flash!)\u201d Looking at the incoming 7 rings silver twisted snake, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly. Although the water didn\u2019t have any effect on its combat abilities, but inside the water, its seed was a clearly somewhat reduced. Inside the water, its speed was still fast, but due to the resistance of water its speed had clearly dropped, and was nowhere near to its previous speed.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou inserted his hand which was sparked with lightning inside the water, and the lightning immediately spread throughout the water, and also reached the body of this snake, which paralyzed its body.</p><br/><p>Seeing the paralyzed body of that snake sinking down to the bottom of the water, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t waste this chance, and immediately took advantage of this moment and attacked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuiton\u2014\u2013Suiten Hofutsu! (Water Style\u2014-Liquid Memory!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the water, a huge water ball was suddenly formed, and surrounded the body of that snake, completely trapping this snake inside it. And this water ball with the 7 rings silver twisted snake inside it started to rise towards the surface of water.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Ren Tianyou, the water ball floated on the surface of the water and appeared before the eyes of Ren Tainyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to die, you f**king beast. Lightning Style\u2014\u2013prison light gun array!\u201d Because of poison his body was already getting numb, so Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals. Then a strong lightning sparks appeared and numerous lightning immediately advanced towards the water ball with 7 rings silver twisted snake. Then this lightning split open the water and finished off the life of this snake.</p><br/><p>Lightning Style\u2014\u2013prison light gun array, was the original lightning style ninjutsu created by Ren Tianyou. This ninjutsu can create lightning guns to shoot lightning, and as long as he had sufficient charka, theoretically numerous lightning guns could be formed. And also according to will of Ren Tianyou, these lightning guns could be differently lined up, it was a pretty good ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>After he had finished off the 7 rings sliver twisted snake, Ren Tianyou relaxed. But at that time, the poison of that snake inside his body had already spread all over his body, and gradually his whole body was paralyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Ren Tianyou body fell into the water, and gradually sunk towards the bottom of the water. He felt completely powerless and couldn\u2019t even move his finger. Ren Tianyou helplessly closed his eyes, \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>The image of his father, mother, little sister and all the loved one started to appear in his mind, in addition the panic he felt when he first appeared on this Divine wind continent, excitement he felt when he first discovered naruto system inside his body, as well as the desire to find the way back home, appeared in his brain in succession. \u201cNo, I absolutely can\u2019t give up here. I have yet to find the way back home, and see my parents and sister. I absolutely most not die here.\u201d Ren Tianyou constantly yelled inside his heart, after that he, exerting all of his strength, with great difficulty he barely gathered a little bit of chakra. Then his eyes suddenly transformed into Mangekyo Sharingan, and suddenly a space ripples started to appear around him and Ren Tianyou disappeared from that place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

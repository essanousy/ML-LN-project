Although if he fought for real then, Wang Li was not his opponent, but he thought that Wang Li was perfect opponent to test his taijutsu.</p><br/><p>After leaving the magical beasts forest, he had defeated 2 opponents. First opponent was illusionist master, this opponent was defeated in a flash by using Tsukuyomi of Mangekyo Sharingan. Second was that mysterious woman, but to defeat her he mostly used ninjutsu! His taijusu was also not weak, although his taijutsu still not reached the level of Maito Guy, still it was already at the level of later stage Rock Lee.</p><br/><p>Also he had no opportunity to test his taijutsu till now, so he thought that this was a good chance. Wang Li was earth system warrior, so his physical strength was stronger compared to others, and the earth system warrior rely on their own inner earth qi and earth element, unlike the other element system warriors who mostly relay more on their own inner element.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Wang Li issued the roar of excitement, after that he started to advance towards Ren Tian You step by step with the huge sword in his hand. And when he arrived near Ren Tian You he slashed with the huge sword towards Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>With the help of Sharingan, Ren Tian You clearly saw every action of Wang Li. Ren Tian You also clearly saw the path of the sword attack, and after seeing that, Ren Tian You just shift all his weight to his right leg and spin to dodge the attack. After dodging he place both of his hands on the ground and quickly kicked Wang Li.</p><br/><p>Kohona Severe whirlwind!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Ren Tian You heavily kicked Wang Li. But he saw that the element armor that was covering the body of Wang Li flashed with rays of lights, and that flash of light only slightly shook but the body of Wang Li remained stable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ren Tian You was surprised to see that his attack didn\u2019t worked. At that time Wang Li again slashed with his huge sword towards Ren Tian You. As if Ren Tian You had expected the attack, he bent his hands and rolled on the ground immediately. After that he firmly land on the ground, and with an imposing looks, he looked at Wang Li who was surrounded with earth element.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a tortoiseshell, it is just like the sand armor of Garra.\u201d Ren Tian You spoke and in his heart, he thought, \u201cIf I had known about this earlier, I would have learnt Tsunade\u2019s unusual powerful fighting styles, which could destroy many things with just single punch or kick. Ai, it\u2019s too bad I didn\u2019t learnt it.\u201d Ren Tian You regretted in his heart. \u201cSince it is like this, I can only use Omote Renge (Primary lotus) of Lee which I have learnt. However before that I should test some other moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, boy, I admit that your speed is very fast, and I can\u2019t compare with you in terms of speed. But I have earth blood lineage as well as I have the earth element battle qi of peak level great sword master, and my defense is also not to be trifled with. As long as you can\u2019t break through my defense, I am invincible against you.\u201d Wang Li heartily laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you are wrong about a single matter!\u201d Ren Tian You indifferently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat matter?\u201d Feeling surprise, Wang Li asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the speed reach maximum, the attack power also sharply increase.\u201d Ren Tian You eyes flashed and he raised his leg and started to spin rapidly.</p><br/><p>Doubt started to flash in the eyes of Wang Li, seeing the movements of Ren Tian You, and he didn\u2019t understand what the purpose of Ren Tian You was. But very quickly the doubts disappeared, and forced him to think deeply.</p><br/><p>Wang Li could see that along with the rapid rotation of Ren Tian You, a whirlwind was appearing around the body of Ren Tian You. The faster Ren Tian You roated, the powerful the whirlwind was becoming. After some time the overflowing chakra from Ren Tian You took the shape of white colored dragon.</p><br/><p>Konoha Ryujin! (Leaf Dragon God!)</p><br/><p>Along with the big shout, Ren Tian You disappeared and huge white colored dragon which was completely made from whirlwind replaced his place! This dragon resembled the ancient dragon, and its eyes were flashing with light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing the move of Ren Tian You, Wang Li was completely solemn, but his battle qi was still shining. And Li Yun and that guard who were watching the match from the sideline were also completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYin!\u201d The white dragon issued a roar filled with excitement, and quickly advanced towards Wang Li. Seeing that the white dragon was advancing towards him, Wang Li hold his sword in battle ready stance. Very quickly the white dragon appeared before Wang Li, at that moment Wang Li slashed his huge sword towards that white dragon. But an unimaginable matter occurred, unexpectedly the huge sword of Wang Li penetrate the huge body of that white dragon without any resistance. This white dragon was purely formed from the whirlwind created by the rotation of Ren Tian You, so it didn\u2019t have solid body! Shortly afterwards, this white dragon collided with the body of Wang Li, after this suddenly countless powerful force of whirlwind rushed towards Wang Li. This powerful force met with the earth element armor of Wang Li, as the time was passing, the body of the white dragon started to quickly shrink, followed by the earth element armor of Wang Li becoming thinner. At this rate the Earth element armor of Wang Li will break first before the disappearance of white dragon.</p><br/><p>Wang Li had also discovered this problem. With great difficulty he inserted his huge sword on the ground, and stabilized his body. Shortly afterwards the earth essence started to float in the air from beneath Wang Li and started to enter the body of Wang Li, and all the energy that he had consumed started to recover. No! Not only his earth element energy was recovering, the yellow colored light armor of earth was already recovered and started to become solid like a real armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth battle armor!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the completion of earth battle armor, the Leaf dragon god attack of Ren Tian You already cannot harm Wang Li. And this white dragon also gradually disappeared and the figure of Ren Tian You started to appear at the same place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, boy, I admit I was still underestimating you. But I myself am an earth element warrior, focus on defense, and I possess earth blood linage which granted me an ability to continuously absorb the earth element power from the earth to maintain this earth battle armor as long as I touch the ground. Unless you break through my defense, you can\u2019t defeat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, I\u2019ll try!\u201d Ren tian You slightly smiled. From inside his leg ninja backpack, Ren Tian You took out 2 rolled up special nature bandages and started to wind both bandages in each hands and leave behind 2 long strip in each hands. After doing this, he slightly bend his body and both of his Sharingan was locked on to Wang Li, \u201cHere I come.\u201d Currently Ren Tian You plans to use Omote Renge (Primary lotus), and see if this could break through his defense, if not he would open Hachimon (The Eight Inner Gates) and use Ura Renge (Hidden Lotus).</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, feel free to use any tricks you have, boy!\u201d Wearing the earth battle armor, Wang Li was laughing. He was holding the huge sword in his hand and waiting for Ren Tian You to attack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

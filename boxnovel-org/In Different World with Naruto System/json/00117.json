And the first one to be affected by this shockwaves were those 2 blood red colored bones of dead ferocious beasts. Due to this huge shockwave, these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts were forced to retreat back, and return back to the side of that mysterious person.</p><br/><p>After the white smoke dissipated, all of a sudden a raccoon dog who was more than 20 meters tall appeared at that place. This raccoon dog was earth yellow in color, and there were violent colored tattoos all over its body, this was one of the 9 tailed beast of naruto world, one tailed Shukaku, who had the power to control wind and sand. And right now Ren Tianyou was standing on its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, where is this?\u201d After looking around its surroundings, Shukaku asked Ren Tianyou who was standing on its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place which I have told you before. This is the isolated island I have come for experience and training. Shukaku you must be a bit more careful, that mysterious person wearing black clothes is strange.\u201d Standing on the top of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou answered with serious expression. Before speaking about the strength of this mysterious person, from the speech of this person just a moment ago, Ren Tianyou believed that this environment of this God Weeping region was probably created by this mysterious person. And even the eyes of Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t see through the ash colored clouds above his head, so he couldn\u2019t help but to be extremely careful against such enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? A large amount of resentment power!\u201d At this time, Shukaku suddenly let out a startled voice. Then it lifted its head and carefully swept all around its surroundings with its eyes. And when he saw the ash colored clouds in the sky, it immediately exclaimed loudly, \u201cWhat? Someone is gathering resentment power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this resentment power?\u201d Hearing the words of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou instantly asked, and thought, \u201cCould it be Shukaku know what is going on with the energy around here? But it\u2019s not possible ah, this guy was exchanged not a long time ago, so how could Shukaku clearly know the energy of this different world?\u201d</p><br/><p>But after the explanation of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou understood what resentment power was. According to the explanation of Shukaku, resentment was a kind of special energy that was naturally radiated by the body of everyone including beasts after their death. This energy was extremely faint, the naked eyes of ordinary person could never see this energy, and this energy also would not cause any damage to human body. But if it is on the huge battlefield or someone used a special method to artificially gather a large amount of this resentment power, then that should be regarded as a different matter.</p><br/><p>Once a huge amount of resentment power was gathered, that would create a powerful oppression sensation on the minds of the peoples, making peoples feel very uncomfortable and depression. And if anyone is exposed in this energy for a long period of time, then that would cause extremely huge damage to the body.</p><br/><p>And according to Shukaku\u2019s explanation, these resentment power was gathered by this fellow by making use of this ancient battle field as a base. He had used a special method to ruthlessly summon these dead spirits of the brave departed, and they were stranded inside these bones of the dead, this was the cause for the appearance of the bones of dead ferocious beast in this God Weeping region. And the trapped \u2018spirits of brave departed\u2019 in the body of \u2018bones of dead ferocious beast\u2019 at all times emits a kind of resentment, which also increase the power of gathered resentment power. And those bones mountains and the bones on surface of the ground all over this island which were seen by Ren Tianyou were very probably the failed items during the creation of bones of dead ferocious beast by this fellow or the skeletons bones of dead ferocious beast which were killed by the mercenaries who had come here for exploration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the rumor that Shukaku was born from the resentment of the dead souls of those who died because of sandstorms was not necessarily false. No wonder it could able to recognize this resentment power only with a single glance.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Shukaku who was beneath him and thought inside his heart. Then when he looked in front towards that mysterious person, a powerful killing intent flashed in his eyes, and his eyes slowly transform into Mangekyo Sharingan. Now his body was releasing a thick killing intention without any reservation, this was the first time that Ren Tianyou really wanted to kill someone, \u201cYou bastard!\u201d Then he directly rushed towards that mysterious person, without even taking a single glance at those 2 blood red bones of dead ferocious beasts. \u201cShukaku, you take care of these 2 bones of death ferocious beast. As for this fellow, I will personally kill him with my own hand. This guy dared to insult the spirits of the brave departed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Shukaku answered. Then suddenly innumerable yellow colored sands closely follow Ren Tianyou and advance towards those 2 blood red bones of dead ferocious beasts.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the another edge of God Weeping region, the group of Ling Weiwei had just finished off the saint ranked bones of dead ferocious beast, and after that pick up the precious medical herbs at the side. But just when they were about take a rest, they suddenly felt the violent tremor of the ground, afterwards suddenly a powerful shockwave advanced towards them. Fortunately this shock waves was not that powerful when it arrived at their location, it just scattered their groups. Many of them had unstably fell on the ground due to this shockwave, but no one was injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that just now? What is going on here?\u201d Guarding Ling Weiwei, Wang Qingfeng thought inside his heart, after the shockwave dissipated. Wang Qingfeng spread his magical power to support Ling Weiwei to stand up. After that Ling Weiwei looked towards the interior of this island, and then her brows instantly shrunk, and was greatly surprised. She saw a huge earth yellow colored raccoon dog had appeared at the center of the island. Even when they were far away, Wang Qingfeng and others was still able to sense its powerful oppressing pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this terrifying magical beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this huge raccoon dog, the beautiful face of Ling Weiwei was filled with surprise, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! We need to quickly get off this island. Run, everyone hurry.\u201d Wang Qingfeng seems to think about something, and his complexion immediately became ghastly pale. Then he roared towards his group of mercenaries.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Zero is not back yet, if we return now, then he won\u2019t have any boat to return to the continent.\u201d Hearing Wang Qingfeng, Ling Weiwei immediately worriedly thought about Ren Tianyou who had separated from their group. So she spoke anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is not time to wait for him. Besides that boy has already stated that, he would find another method to return to the continent. We should leave this island at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will go to look for Zero.\u201d Ling Weiwei shook her head, then turned around towards the interior region of this island, and started to run to search for Ren Tianyou. But she suddenly felt a pain on the back of her head, and instantly lost her consciousness.</p><br/><p>Wang Qingfeng supported the body of Ling Weiwei. After that looking at the fainted Ling Weiwei, he shook his head and sighed, \u201cAi, Weiwei, this time your grandpa Qingfeng really am sorry. We really do not have any more time to consider about that boy, and if we do so then we also won\u2019t be able to leave this island.\u201d After that he turned around and roared towards the group of mercenaries, \u201cWe are leaving this God Weeping region at once, everyone keep up the pace with me.\u201d Finished speaking, Wang Qingfeng quickly hurried back towards their boat, and all the mercenaries also hurriedly followed after him.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Somewhere in the endless sea, there were mysterious islands, and in one of the cave of the island, a middle-aged person who was wearing golden colored battle armor suddenly opened his eyes, and a horrifying aura spread all over the surroundings, and then he yelled towards the outside of the cave, \u201cTell Apalaisi, the murderer of Adelaide is already at the endless sea. Now he is in God Weeping region, that ghost place. Let him have a several more people, and tell him that he must kill that bastard human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Another voice came from outside the cave, and then slowly faded away. After that that middle aged person again closed his eyes. After a while, several shadow flew from this islands towards the direction of God Weeping region.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After that Ren Tianyou indifferently said to Dragon Emperor who was vigilantly looking at his every movement.</p><br/><p>Before Dragon Emperor could get angry because he was called big lizard, he was startled on hearing the loud dragon roar coming through underground. After that Dragon Emperor looked downward with startled as well as disbelief expression in his big dragon eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton\u2014-Mokuryu no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Dragon Jutsu!)\u201d Ren Tianyou standing on the same place with his right hand\u2019s thumb, ring finger and little finger tightly curled, and index finger and middle finger standing straight in front of his mouth, he called out. Then the ground in front of him suddenly burst, and huge fissure break open on the ground. From inside this fissure, ear-deafening dragon roar came through, reverberating the whole horizon.</p><br/><p>Along with the loud dragon roar, a huge wooden dragon broke out from inside the ground, and coiled in the sky, emitting a powerful aura from this wooden dragon\u2019s more than 30 meters long body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of wooden dragon, Dragon Emperor who was flying in the sky was shocked, and very soon his gaze was filled with solemn expression.</p><br/><p>Mokuton\u2014-Mokuryu no Jutsu (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Dragon Jutsu) was secret technique of Wood style. And other than Senpo Mokuton (Sage Art\u2014Wood Style) and that Mokuton\u2014-Mokujin no Jutsu (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Golem Jutsu) which could catch even the bijudama of tailed beast, this Mokuryu no Jutsu (Wood Dragon Technique) was strongest Wood style technique.</p><br/><p>This Mokuryu no Jutsu (Wood Dragon Technique) possessed strong binding ability. Once it bind, then even tailed beasts were unable to struggle free from its binding, moreover the power within their body would be continuously absorbed by this wooden dragon.</p><br/><p>When Senju Hasirama used this technique, this technique was basically able to match with the existence like Tailed beasts and Susanoo.</p><br/><p>But now when Ren Tianyou used this technique with his current level of strength, it was a lot weaker compared to Senju Hasirama\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Senju Hasirama in his prime could basically dispatch Orochimaru this kage level expert instantly, and only with the overflowing aura of his body, he could completely suppress common elite ninjas, making them unable to move.</p><br/><p>But although the strength of Ren Tianyou was not comparable to Senju Hasirama\u2019s in any way, nevertheless Wood style was after all Wood style. This Mokuryu no Jutsu (Wood Dragon Technique) was also not so easy to come by ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp!\u201d Ren Tianyou used his thought to control this wooden dragon in front of him, making it start to move.</p><br/><p>After getting the command of Ren Tianyou, this wooden dragon immediately swayed its huge wooden dragon body, and flew towards Dragon Emperor in the sky.</p><br/><p>Seeing wooden dragon, Dragon Emperor opened his mouth and quickly began to chant magic incantation in dragon language. Along with the incantation, powerful holy elements began to gather in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cForbidden magic spell\u2014-Doomsday Catastrophic Explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just within extremely short time of 4 or 5 seconds, he completed the preparation of terrifying forbidden magic. This shows just how terrifying the strength of God King realm Dragon Emperor was.</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Dragon Emperor, huge amount of holy elements gathered in the sky forming a huge tornado storm in the sky. Huge rocks scattered here and there on the ground around were directly swept away by this terrifying storm. And this storm ran into wooden dragon with heaven destroying and earth exterminating momentum.</p><br/><p>That huge body of wooden dragon was immediately engulfed by this holy energy storm, and was directly swept away as if it didn\u2019t have any power to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt succeed?\u201d Seeing that wooden dragon had disappeared into the storm, Dragon Emperor who was floating in the sky far away muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, too na\u00efve, it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d While standing on the ground far away, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted in disdain, as if he was not worried about wooden dragon even a bit. After that he gathered the remaining little bit of chakra inside his body, and began to make a move.</p><br/><p>At that moment, suddenly a loud dragon roar came from inside that huge golden colored energy storm. Shortly afterwards its sturdy dragon tail directly cut open this storm, then under the control of Ren Tianyou, this dragon tail slide downwards, as if wanting to cleave this storm into two.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing the sudden changes, Dragon Emperor exclaimed suddenly. Shortly afterwards, he was about to control this forbidden magic spell, but he however was already too late, as this huge wooden dragon had already split open this forbidden magic and was flying towards him.</p><br/><p>But even after seeing this wooden dragon had already arrived not far away from him, Dragon Emperor didn\u2019t have any fear in his face, instead he controlled his huge dragon body and prepared to receive it head on. It seems Dragon Emperor wanted to compare their ** strength, as he didn\u2019t fear anyone. Because as a God King realm expert, as well as, as a Dragon clan, they possessed powerful dragon body, so they dragon clan truly didn\u2019t fear anyone else in ** strength. But was this matter really as simple as the thought of Dragon Emperor?</p><br/><p>Seeing Dragon Emperor was intending to receive his wooden dragon head on, Ren Tianyou sneered, then concentrated to control movement of wooden dragon.</p><br/><p>Just when Wooden Dragon was about to collide head on with Dragon Emperor, the wooden dragon suddenly turned its body, avoiding the head on collide with Dragon Emperor. After that again turning around arrived at his flank, then quickly circling around the Dragon Emperor\u2019s body, it firmly bounded Dragon Emperor with its wooden body.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Ren Tianyou, this wooden dragon nimbly bound the body of Dragon Emperor. Feeling his body was bound by this wooden dragon, Dragon Emperor swung his front two huge dragon claw and firmly caught the body of this wooden dragon, and also used his dragon mouth to firmly bite this wooden dragon, wanting to rely on his powerful strength to directly smash this wooden dragon into pieces.</p><br/><p>Dragon Emperor showed a cruel smile seeing the cracks gradually appearing on the body of wooden dragon where he had caught with his claws and mouth, but before he could be happy for a long time, the smile on his face suddenly stiffened, and he became alarmed. Because he suddenly discovered that the energy inside his body was being continuously absorbed by this wooden dragon binding his body, moreover he could do nothing about it. Now his strength was gradually weakening, but he however found that he was basically powerless to struggle free from the binding of this wooden dragon. Furthermore he saw those cracks on the body of this wooden dragon caused by his claws and mouth were healing rapidly, not only that but, after absorbing his energy, the body of this wooden dragon was gradually becoming bigger, and the binding was also becoming more and more powerful, moreover on the body of this wooden dragon, trees were slowly sprouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I had thought too highly of this God King realm expert. Originally I thought I had to use that move, but didn\u2019t expect, relying on this incomplete wooden dragon, I am able to settle this.\u201d Seeing Dragon Emperor who was already unable to move, Ren Tianyou thought inwardly. After that he temporarily abandon his control on wooden dragon, as Dragon Emperor was already suppressed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took out a scroll from his space ring and spread it out, then used summoning technique. Along with the disappearance of white smokes, a clone of himself appeared in front of Ren Tianyou. And after Ren Tianyou released this clone, the chakra inside his body was instantly replenished completely.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, Dragon Emperor who was being suppressed by wooden dragon suddenly roared loudly, \u201cHoly law\u2014-Holy Assimilation!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

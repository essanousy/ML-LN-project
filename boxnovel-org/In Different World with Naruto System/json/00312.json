He had never expected that this barrier actually had the ability to seal the space too.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow there is no other choice other than running to the edge of this barrier and use kamui to pass through this barrier, or break this barrier.\u201d Looking towards that barrier emitting powerful energy, Ren Tianyou thought inwardly. But breaking open this barrier was easier said than done.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you failed to appreciate my kindness, I am forced to catch you personally.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou who was continuously scanning the barrier, Yaorao naturally realized the thoughts of Ren Tianyou, but would she give him any chance.</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Yaorao immediately begin to take action.

Now there was no other way, so he could only stall Yaorao for the time being, while looking for an opportunity to leave this place.</p><br/><p>Along with the completion of making hand seals, he spat out huge blazing flame from his mouth. The might of the current Fire style ninjutsu coupled with Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan of Ren Tianyou was incomparably more powerful than before.</p><br/><p>Although the might of Vast Baleful Heaven of Yaorao was strong, and that unique power of her body\u2019s Purple Yuan Baleful Heaven was even more extraordinary, but the fire style of Ren Tianyou was able to firmly resist it.</p><br/><p>And at that time, on the other side, Yaorao suddenly began to rapidly wave her hands in front of her chest, then purple colored radiance appeared around her body. And along with the rapid movement of her hands, purple colored huge six edged star formed in front of her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSix Edged Purple Killing Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Yaorao, that purple colored six edged star in front of her chest instantly became larger, and this six edged star emitted purple light.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yaorao pointed at this six edged star with her right hand\u2019s index finger, then softly spat out one word from her sexy lips.

Strong purple colored magic lights came out from this six edged star, unceasingly pounding the wooden stakes in front of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo na\u00efve!\u201d Seeing the action of Ren Tianyou, a sneer appeared on the mouth of Yaorao, then stretching straight right hand\u2019s index finger and middle finger side by side in front of her body, she began to noiselessly chant incantation. After that on the fingertips of right hand, purple colored light appeared.</p><br/><p>Along with the chanting of Yaorao on this side, that huge purple colored six edged star suddenly changed. Purple colored lights suddenly flew out from the six edged star, then rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Ren Tianyou cursed, then with his Sharingan spinning rapidly, the movement path of these energy reflected in his eyes. After that using his exquisite taijutsu accompanied by the power of Sharingan, he was able to dodge the surprise attack of these several energy beams.</p><br/><p>And at this time, under the unceasing bombardment of powerful energy waves which were condensed from that purple colored six edged star, cracks appeared on that huge wooden stakes.</p><br/><p>Seeing this situation, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Mokuryu no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Dragon Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, loud sound of dragon roar came for under the ground, then the ground began to shake violently. After that with the appearance of huge fissure, a huge wooden dragon broke out from the ground. And under the control of Ren Tianyou, that wooden dragon charged towards the six edged star.</p><br/><p>At that time, that purple colored six edged star had already smashed the wooden stakes created by Ren Tianyou to pieces, and was advancing towards Ren Tianyou. But wooden dragon nevertheless went first and collided against that six edged star. After that along with \u2018ka ka\u2019 scattering sound, that six edged star directly scattered and changing into energy, it disappeared under the violent ramming of wooden dragon.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, under the control of Ren Tianyou, that wooden dragon continued to advance towards Yaorao.</p><br/><p>Seeing wooden dragon advancing towards her, Yaorao immediately rose to the sky to dodge. But the wooden dragon nevertheless closely followed after her.</p><br/><p>Seeing this wooden dragon was closely following her, Yaorao\u2019s eyes flashed with purple light. After that placing her hands in front of her chest, she gathered purple colored magic light in her hands, changing it into a huge purple colored ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Broken Yuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Yaorao, this huge purple colored energy ball directly shot towards wooden dragon. It directly landed on the mouth of wooden dragon, and the powerful energy of this ball directly smashed the head of this wooden dragon to pieces, and advance towards the body of this wooden dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Mokuton\u2014-Mokujin no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Golem Jutsu!)\u201d Seeing this circumstance, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly. And with the completion of making hand seals, in the broken down body of wooden dragon, suddenly a nearly thirty meters huge fatty came out. This fatty extend right hand and directly caught that huge purple colored ball, then under the control of Ren Tianyou, this ball was directly thrown back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A huge explosion rose and the explosion waves and wind swept all around.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he was very fast, but there was no sound at all, and even when he passed by those demon guards right in front of them, they didn\u2019t notice anything. This was a special ability of Aierke called Night Ghost.</p><br/><p>Inside the city, White Tiger and others were able to see all the action of Aierke through that light mirror created by Jade Maiden Li Xinyun. And seeing that special ability of Aierke, all of them couldn\u2019t help but clicked their tongue in wonder. Having such mystical concealing ability, coupled with the ability to enter into shadow and move, this fellow could really became the nightmare of his enemy. If you became enemy with him, then later on when you walk out in the night, then you should take every steps carefully, because with this kind of highly skilled assassin targeting you, as long as, if your strength is far higher than him, then he would have at least several tens of ways to play you to death.</p><br/><p>Arriving at the centermost location of campsite, there was a huge courtyard which was brightly lit. Seeing this, Yue\u2019er who was controlling Aierke instantly understood that the destination had arrived. Now that Yue\u2019er had used Edo Tensei to resurrect Aierke, she naturally wouldn\u2019t target those ordinary demon soldiers, her primary targets were those God King realm experts and those three Demon Generals, and also conveniently spying this campsite of Demon clan to determine whether Demon Gods were present or not.</p><br/><p>Aierke immediately sneaked into this courtyard, only to see that this courtyard was empty. There were several rooms inside, and the centermost hall was brightly lit, and indistinct sound was coming through this place.</p><br/><p>Yue\u2019er controlled Aierke very cautiously and walked towards the front of this hall\u2019s door. Then looking inside from the crack of the door, she saw there were ten or so individuals inside this hall. All the God King realm experts of Demon clan who had taken part in today\u2019s war were present here. But there was two people whom Yue\u2019er didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>One was a demon youth wearing white colored robe whose face revealed evil qi. Although he looked young, and Yue\u2019er couldn\u2019t see through his strength, but Yue\u2019er estimated that the strength of person was at least God Lord realm in strength.</p><br/><p>Yes, this person not only had God Lord realm power, furthermore his identity was also not simple. He was one of the three Great Demon God, Baleful Heaven Demon God, Busike.</p><br/><p>No one would have thought that, one of the three Great Demon God Busike was actually present here in this battlefield. One should know that the strongest person within humanity and 100 clan allied army was Holy Sword clan\u2019s Clan Head, father of White Tiger, Li Tianjian. And he was high God Lord realm in strength. Moreover now he was leading second division to second battlefield, so currently in the army of White Tiger and others, there wasn\u2019t any God Lord realm expert, with the exception of Aierke who was resurrected by Edo Tensei.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, never thought that Demon God would really appear here. It seems we must change our fighting plan for tomorrow.\u201d Hearing Yue\u2019er saying that she believed that youth was Demon God, the complexion of White Tiger Li Jianrong became a little solemn and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how, tomorrow we must quickly finish off those Demon Generals. Everyone, tomorrow it would be best to activate our power of blood lineage to quickly finish off the battle in the shortest time possible. Then we six should combine our power to jointly attack that Demon God, and stall him as long as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, who is that fellow?\u201d Just then, Little Yu suddenly said, pointing at mirror\u2019s that person whose body was thoroughly covered with black robe. After that others also looked towards the direction where Little Yu was pointing, and saw that mysterious shadow.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, Yue\u2019er controlled Aierke to take a step forward, then looked at that mysterious person whose entire body was covered with black robe. But compared to that Demon God whose strength she could indistinctly perceive, Yue\u2019er however couldn\u2019t feel any energy fluctuation in this person. Moreover, Yue\u2019er clearly sensed extremely dense death qi which could suffocate people, as if was from a dead person.</p><br/><p>But just then, something unexpected happened. Just when the gaze of Aierke landed on the body of this person, this black robed person instantly looked towards outside the door, and his eyes shone, seemingly seeing through the stealth of Aierke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow good!\u201d Yue\u2019er instantly thought, she had never thought that the vigilance of this mysterious person was actually this high. She had merely looked at him, and he had already noticed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Along with the hoarse voice which could cause people to have goosebumps, a black colored light suddenly shot out from the body of this mysterious person, and directly collided with the door.</p><br/><p>In this imminent peril, Yue\u2019er instantly controlled Aierke, making him directly dive into the shadow, then following the shadow, he rushed to the roof, firmly hiding there without any motion.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, the entrance door was directly smashed into pieces by this black light. Shortly afterwards, this mysterious person directly rushed out, and standing on the courtyard, he carefully looked all around, seeing whether there was any suspicious aspect or not.</p><br/><p>And at that time, Busike and those Demon Generals also came out, and arriving beside this mysterious person, Busike respectfully said: \u201cYour Excellency Mo Yun, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now there seemed to be someone outside the door.\u201d No one would have ever thought that, this mysterious person was Demon clan\u2019s that mysterious Mo Yun. At that time, leaving the place of Yaorao, he had come here. No one knew what his aim was and also his identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Someone?\u201d Hearing Mo Yun, Busike was startled, then he immediately spread his divine sense covering the entire courtyard, but discovered nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to look, there is no one inside the courtyard, just now, it might be my misconception.\u201d Mo Yun waved his hand, and said. Then he again said to all the people around, \u201cOkay, remember all the things I have said just now, now it\u2019s very late, so all of you go and rest for the night, and prepare yourself for the fight tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Excellency Mo Yun.\u201d Hearing Mo Yun, everyone simultaneously answered, then separately went their own ways. After everyone left, Mo Yun again glanced around, but still noticing nothing, he entered the hall.</p><br/><p>And after everyone had left, Aierke\u2019s body slowly walked out from the shadow in the roof. Then after looking all around, he disappeared. He didn\u2019t leave this place, rather was intending to capture a person among those people present at that time.</p><br/><p>Although White Tiger and other didn\u2019t recognize Mo Yun, but seeing the sudden appearance of such strong expert, they naturally want to know some information regarding this person, and the best method to obtain this information was naturally from the mouth of these people.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

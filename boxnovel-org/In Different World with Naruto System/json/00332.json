One should know that, flying was forbidden within this capital city, but right now someone was daring to brazenly fly here like this.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, a stars radiance closely followed behind that shadow, chasing after that front shadow in a very high speed. The speed was so fast that everyone on the scene felt only a blur before their eyes, and this stars radiance had already disappeared from their view.</p><br/><p>Next another five lights chased after the first two. This dazzled all the people underneath, they didn\u2019t know what had happened before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Southern Dipper closely followed that shadow in the front, although the speed of that fellow was also not slow and had fled in advance, but compared to the speed of Bu Feng, his speed was very far away. Not far away above the street outside the city, Bu Feng almost caught up to this shadow.</p><br/><p>Seeing he was already about to catch up to the shadow, the eyes of Bu Feng flashed with pallid lights, then his body immediately changed into a meteor and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Step\u2014-Star Transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu\u201d, Bu Feng directly appeared in front of this shadow, then heavily kicked towards the head of this shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng\u201d This shadow raised his hands and firmly blocked the kick of Bu Feng. But this one attack also prevented the shadow from escaping. This shadow back flipped several times and landed on a huge tree not far away beside the road.</p><br/><p>And after blocking this shadow, Bu Feng also landed on the top of another tree, then folding his hands in front of his chest, he stared at that shadow in front of him.</p><br/><p>That person was about 1.6 meters in height, and his whole body was covered with loose-fitting black robe, so he was not able to clearly see the appearance of this person, furthermore he couldn\u2019t even tell whether this person was male or female.</p><br/><p>And this road beside them was the only path leading to imperial capital city, so there was unending numbers of people travelling this road. As a result, after they landed there, soon the street was filled with a number of onlookers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the hell are you? Actually eavesdropping our conversation, I see you are still earnestly holding that black robe to cover your body.\u201d Standing on the top of a tree on the tiptoe of his right foot, Bu Feng coldly said while staring at that mysterious person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, never thought that with only peak God King realm strength, you have such fast speed, but what a pity it is that you shouldn\u2019t have chased me by yourself.\u201d Hearing the question of Bu Feng, the hoarse voice of that mysterious person transmitted out from under the black robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDress up as God, play the devil!\u201d Bu Feng coldly snorted. And he wanted to attack, but just then, five figures flying towards him appeared not far away, precisely were Ren Tianyou and others. All of them encircled this mysterious person to prevent him from fleeing. [Dress up as God, play the devil (idiom) = deliberately mystifying/deceiving people]</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect you all to arrive this quickly, it seems I still looked down upon you all.\u201d Seeing he was already surrounded, this mysterious person sneered as if he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, why were you eavesdropping our conversation? Furthermore\u2026\u2026\u201d Looking at that mysterious man in black robe, Ren Tianyou coldly asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you a person of Demon World?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, you asked me a question, but I am powerless to answer ah, what\u2019s to be done now?\u201d Hearing the question of Ren Tianyou as well as sensing the killing intent overflowing from the body of White Tiger and others, this middle-aged man merely smiled coldly and said as if he didn\u2019t sense any danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cActing recklessly!\u201d Hearing this middle-aged man, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly, then his eyes instantly changed into Rinnegan, then extending his hand towards this mysterious man, \u201cBansho Ten\u2019in! (Universal Pull!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, this middle-aged man suddenly felt great attraction force on his body, then his body was automatically pulled towards the direction of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d This mysterious person had never thought that Ren Tianyou actually had such strange move, unexpectedly, from so far away, his own body was attracted towards him.</p><br/><p>But before he could react in any way, White Tiger instantly made his move. Along with the sound of sharp sword unsheathing, and all the people on the scene sensing only cold sword light flashing, and White Tiger had already appeared behind that mysterious person.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, Ren Tianyou also stopped his Bansho Ten\u2019in. And this middle-aged person stopped in the midair for a brief moment, then gradually changed into black colored mist and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure enough, it was a clone, never thought that this fellow was so crafty, he unexpectedly used clone to probe us first.\u201d Seeing this mysterious person had disappeared, Ren Tianyou slowly thought. When he had just caught up to them, his Sharingan had discovered unusualness in his body, coupled with his reaction when he was heavily surrounded, Ren Tianyou had already estimated that this fellow in front of them was not true body.</p><br/><p>And simultaneously, in a dark mysterious place, a voice suddenly resounded, \u201cNever thought that I was still looking down upon Akatsuki, they unexpectedly discover my clone that quickly, really is not simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, because you all are not simple, you all are worth using. I hope after six months, you will let us see the desired results.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect that fellow was unexpectedly a clone.\u201d Southern Dipper walked forwards and said feeling a little bit disappointed. Seeing the disappearance of that middle-aged man, all of them clearly understood that that person was merely a clone.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s go back first.\u201d Looking at the onlookers around, Ren Tianyou frowned, then said to White Tiger and others.</p><br/><p>But just then, a voice came from underneath, that made Ren Tianyou and others to stop their step.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if you all are people of Akatsuki?\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou and others, a middle-aged person among the onlookers asked.</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of middle-aged man, everyone in the crowds began to talk in whisper. They had never thought that they would run into the people of Akatsuki here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we are, so?\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head. With current strength of Akatsuki, there was nothing he was afraid of, so he didn\u2019t deny it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s truly great, I\u2019ve been looking everybody for a while.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou confirming it, that middle-aged man excitedly said. Right now his face revealed an excited smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSearching us?\u201d Ren Tianyou curiously asked. He didn\u2019t recognize this person at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am from Shadow clan. After seven days, Light Empire will be holding a distinguished gathering. For that, invitation cards were issued to all the powerful people in the continent to invite them to join this gathering. Because of our Shadow clan\u2019s peculiar blood lineage, we are responsible to deliver the invitation cards. But sire and others appear and disappear unpredictably, and there was no fixed place, so even after searching everybody for nearly three months, I was not able to find. As a result I could only give up. But never thought that I\u2019d encounter everybody here, truly lucky ah.\u201d Finished speaking, this middle-aged man took out a golden invitation card and threw it to Ren Tianyou. \u201cThis is invitation card, at that time, if everybody has time, there is no harm in attending. I think that will not disappoint any of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, we know this matter, at that time, we\u2019ll definitely be there.\u201d After looking at the content of the invitation card, surprise flashed in the eyes of Ren Tianyou, then said to that middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat being the case, then I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d Finished speaking, that middle-aged man slowly merged into his own shadow and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll talk about this after returning.\u201d Ren Tianyou waved his hand towards White Tiger and others, and said, then flew towards Dark imperial capital.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

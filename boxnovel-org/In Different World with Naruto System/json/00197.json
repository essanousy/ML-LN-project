It doesn\u2019t have a kind of relaxedness of Byakugan.</p><br/><p>Along with his perception merged with entire wall membrane of the barrier, all the scenes inside the barrier appeared one after another in the brain of Long Yi just like animations.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026..how could this be?\u201d When he saw the circumstance inside the Tree of Life, Ren Tianyou exclaimed aloud inside his heart. A look of disbelief appeared on his face, and his tightly closed eyes suddenly opened in which trace of shock was flashing.</p><br/><p>Inside this Tree of Life, just as Ren Tianyou had expected, the deeper he went, the denser that green colored fog of life was, and the energy was also bigger and bigger, but after he pierce through nearly 500 meters inside the trunk, there nevertheless appeared a mysterious space inside the Tree of Life which was filled with light green colored aura.</p><br/><p>No one would have ever thought that this towering Tree of Life\u2019s trunk was unexpectedly hollow inside, and actually had this big space inside it. This might be something unexpected to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Tree of Life is really mystical, its outward appearance has such big trunk filled with life-force which could easily intoxicate people, and possess indestructible trunk which I guess not even so-called magic weapons could damage it a tiny bit, but it possess such big space inside it.\u201d Recalling that mystical huge space, Ren Tianyou thought aloud. After that along with the disappearance of chakra of Ren Tianyou, the huge spherical barrier of Kekkai\u2014-Tengai Hojin (Probe Barrier) in front of him slowly began to distort, and finally along with \u2018pa\u2019 sound, it scattered and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince there is this space, there definitely must be a reason behind it, or perhaps there might be a treasure too.\u201d Thinking about that mysterious space, a thought suddenly appeared in the brain of Ren Tianyou, and he could no longer remain unperturbed. Even a random treasure from this Tree of Life would definitely be a priceless treasure for him.</p><br/><p>After thinking this, his eyes rotated and changed into the Sharingan of Obito, then along with the appearance of spiral shaped space ripple from his right eye, which surrounded him, he disappeared from that place.</p><br/><p>In the space inside the Tree of Life\u2019s trunk, along with the sudden appearance of spiral shaped space ripple, Ren Tianyou appeared there.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou slowly descended down from the sky and landed on the ground, \u201cHere ought to be the location of Tree of Life\u2019s root.\u201d Afterwards, he lifted his head and scanned all around him, then he discovered that this whole space was filled with light green colored fog which could be clearly seen with naked eyes.</p><br/><p>Spreading his arms, Ren Tianyou inhaled a deep breathe. This light green colored thick fog surrounding his body entered inside his body from his nostril. Then a fresh, lively, a hard to clearly understand feeling appeared inside his heart. Although the effect of this aura was not comparable to the effect of that bottle of Spring of Life which he had taken just some time ago, but he dared to confirm, that the effect of living in this place for more than half a year was better than drinking a bottle Spring of Life.</p><br/><p>Because the thick fog here was Fog of Life which was emitted from inside the Tree of Life. If a person stayed here for a long time, he/she would inhale this thick fog along with breathing, which would slowly change his/her body. This subtle changes was far more powerful than that split second changes after you drink Spring of Life.</p><br/><p>Because drinking Spring of Life was equivalent to, let\u2019s say instantly changing oneself relying on a drug, exactly as if eating at one go to turn into a fatty. But this place had imperceptible influence, thread by thread changing your body over the period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly too miraculous.\u201d Seeing green colored qi all around him, the eyes of Ren Tianyou displayed unconcealed excitement. This was definitely a treasure land for cultivation, and cultivating here would also slowly change his body towards successfully becoming the Sage body just like Senju Hasirama, and would also possess massive strength like him. But he should spend much more time in here for that to happen, even 180 years was merely wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Just at that time, Ren Tianyou exclaimed. He suddenly discovered life aura was slowly gathering and moving towards one direction, it seems there was something attracting them in that direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me there really is treasure here?\u201d Ren Tianyou exclaimed inside his heart, and instantly came up with this possibility. Then without hesitation he immediately used his Mangekyo Sahrangan, and carefully sized up the direction where these light green colored life aura were flowing, then quickly ran towards that direction.</p><br/><p>Throughout the way, Ren Tianyou ran side by side with this flowing life aura. After about half an hour, he finally arrived at the place where these life aura were attracted.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou saw a tree stump which was as tall as half-adult human in front of him. And what attracted the attention of Ren Tianyou was not this tree stump, rather half-twig which was on that tree stump.</p><br/><p>Yes, that\u2019s right twig. This half-twig obviously had already broken off from the tree it had grown, but it still was full of vitality. And light green colored radiance was still floating above this twig, and alluring life aura was spreading all around from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Seeing that half-twig, Ren Tianyou instantly thought this question. Could it be that this half-twig was attracting these life aura, or am I mistaken? Ren Tianyou doubtfully walked over, then picked up that unassuming twig, but the unexpected thing for Ren Tianyou was, just when he picked up this severed twig, suddenly the system voice was directly transmitted inside his brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to host for discovering universe\u2019s sole Wood Essence\u2014Forever Green. If host agree to let system absorb the energy inside it, system will reward host with 100 million system points, moreover all the seals of system will be lifted, and system will automatically upgrade to its highest, may I ask whether host agree or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha\u2026.what?\u201d Hearing the system voice inside his mind, Ren Tianyou felt as if lightning struck his brain, and looked at the half-twig in his hand with disbelief. The value of this broken thing was unexpectedly 100 million system points. And he no longer had to work laboriously to gather those materials to level up his system with this broken thing in his hand. This broken thing unexpectedly yield him such massive amount of system points overnight.</p><br/><p>After having 100 million system points, he could exchange mokuton (Wood style) which he was longing for day and night, and he might even be able to awaken his own Rinnegan too. This thing in his hand was absolutely capable of making him powerful expert instantly. Ren Tianyou felt this was just a dream.</p><br/><p>After pinching himself, he felt pain, so he was sure this was not a dream. Could it be that today his fortune was so big that he encounter such as large as the heaven good thing? Ren Tianyou opened his mouth intending to agree with system, but just at that time, he suddenly recalled the first words that system said, so forcibly stopping himself from agreeing, he swallowed back his answer. Because he recalled system words \u201cuniverse\u2019s sole\u201d, \u201cWood Essence\u201d\u2026\u2026.so on words, he decided to ask about these words.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou again opened his mouth and asked in trembling tone, \u201cSys\u2026..system, what the hell is this thing? Actually having this high value? Having 100 million system points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is called Forever Green. Condensed life essence of the sole Tree of Life since the birth of the universe, which contains life law.\u201d With regarding to Ren Tianyou not answering its question, and instead asking the information of this item, system sighing as well as glad voice was transmitted in the brain of Ren Tianyou. Glad because Ren Tianyou was capable of resisting the temptation and calmly asked more information. Sighed because after it tell about the uses of this thing, it knew that it would definitely not be able to absorb this Forever Green. But with regarding to the question of Ren Tianyou, system still explained from the beginning to end, \u201cJust like Forever in its name Forever Green, this would not form even after the time period of 100 million years. Forever Green is condensed energy after the slow accumulation of these life aura inside the Tree of Life over a long period of time. There is only one of this in this entire world, no, this is the only one in this entire universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Forever Green is congeries of life law, the heaven and earth permit the existence of only one of it at a time, or because of external forces, only after first one is destroyed or used by human, then second one would form. After you use this Forever Green, Tree of Life needs unknown numbers of years to form second Forever Green.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Forever Green only have two effect, first is long life. As long as you absorb the energy inside, you will live forever and never grow old. Your lifespan will be everlasting. Unless you are killed, you will never die due to old age. So as long as you take in this thing before your eyes, you will get very long life.\u201d The system voice slowly transmitted inside his brain, instantly causing Ren Tianyou to firmly stare at the Forever Green in his hand with his very red eyes. He couldn\u2019t wait to swallow it right now.</p><br/><p>Mostly this effect was too tempting for Ren Tianyou, before the matter about how his ninjutsu was not able to give him long lifespan, unlike the cultivations of this world was troubling him. Once the cultivator of this world enters God domain, they would receive at least 10,000 years of lifespan, and along with the increase in their rank, such as when they stepped into God King rank, they will not die out due to old age, as they would have long lifespan equal to the lifespan of universe.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou was powerless regarding this matter, but this Forever Green before his eyes could thoroughly fulfill his this wishful thinking, making him able to live forever. After that he would have sufficient time to seek the truth of ninjutsu, also will have enough time to accomplish all of his dreams. This was the temptation which Ren Tianyou would never be able to resist, this was also the reason why system had sighed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

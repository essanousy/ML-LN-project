After that he hastily opened his mouth to explain, but before he could finish talking, his mouth was covered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me to drive him away, all right?\u201d Luo Meng Wu covered the mouth of Ren Tian You and then whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu wu\u2026\u2026\u201d Pointing at the covered mouth and nose, Ren Tian You tried to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Immediately without losing any time, Luo Meng Wu released her hand. After that Ren Tian You took a deep breath and said, \u201cSo am I going to become a cannon fodder every time? Why don\u2019t you just find a real boyfriend or find another person to act as a fake boyfriend or something else? If this continues on, then even if I have 9 lives, it won\u2019t be enough?\u201d Ren Tian You put on a long face and said to Luo Tian Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, among all my friends, you are the only one he don\u2019t know. So you are the only one qualified to become my fake boyfriend. Also, if you don\u2019t help me, do you believe that I will tell everyone you molested me.\u201d Luo Meng Wu was annoyed and rolling her eyes she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026, *sigh* since you say so, what I say anymore?\u201d Ren Tian You put on a long face and looked at Luo Meng Wu, and inside his heart, he wailed, \u2018I know you are different type of person than your brother. Unlike your brother who is black in skin color, you have a black belly. Ah, oh god, why did you let me meet these evil friends, ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, little Wu Wu is correct. I\u2019m her boyfriend.\u201d After speaking, under the stupefied gaze of Lan Yan and others, he encircled his right hand on the body of Luo Meng Wu and embrace her against his bosom and thought, \u201cGa ga, I, your father may not become your shield for nothing, at least I can take some interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.you actually take advantage of me.\u201d At the bosom of Ren Tian You, the whole body of Luo Meng Wu was stiff. Till now with the exception of her close family member, no other man had ever embrace her. As a result her body was stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, but currently I am your boyfriend. Embracing, hugging and cuddling is quite normal. I still haven\u2019t kissed you yet, why are you so overwhelmed.\u201d Inside his heart, Ren Tian You was laughing evilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare!\u201d Hearing Ren Tian You still wanted to kiss her, immediately Luo Meng Wu glared at him. Inside her heart she was deeply regretting, about why she asked this big lecher to become her fake boyfriend.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.you guys!\u201d Staring at Ren Tian You and Luo Meng Wu with burning eyes, Lan Yin didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tian You, he is my younger brother. Don\u2019t play too much.\u201d Lan Yan passed by Ren Tian You and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I am also being forced to do this by this black belly woman. She is blackmailing me by saying that she will shout out that I molested her, if I don\u2019t do this. So, I will try to do what I can.\u201d Ren Tian You explained with wry smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi.\u201d Lan Yan sighed and shook his head, and didn\u2019t know that to say anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dared to snatch away my most loveable little Wu. I want to have a duel with you.\u201d Lan Yin yelled full of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou coward, do not even dared to accept my duel. Are you still a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know whether I am a man or not, besides I think she is clearer about this matter, right Little Wu Wu!\u201d Ren Tian You lewdly smiled and looked at Luo Meng Wu in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Luo Meng Wu immediately gnash her teeth and didn\u2019t know what to say. Now she was really regretting the she asked Ren Tian You to become her fake boyfriend.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you guys actually\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Lan Yin trembled all over and pointed towards Ren Tian You and Luo Meng Wu and was speechless.</p><br/><p>Luo Tian Xing and others were covering their face, they felt disgraced, and were asking themselves why they met such an evil friend! And especially Luo Tian Xing, if this case was not for the sake of his younger sister, he would have already chopped Ren Tian You to death. It was obvious that this couldn\u2019t be dismissed by saying it\u2019s a simple harassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you bastard, I want a duel against you.\u201d Lan Yin roared while glaring Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, again duel, don\u2019t you have any other fresh trick! I\u2019m not interested in duel.\u201d Ren Tian You picked his nostrils and said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, its already this late, we should rest. Little Wu Wu, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Saying this Ren Tian You turned around and walked away while still holding Luo Meng Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, hold it right there.\u201d Seeing Ren Tian You and Luo Meng Wu walking towards the dormitory, Lan Yin thought they were going to have an affair. In a flash, anger suddenly rose sharply, \u2018grandfather\u2019s, no need to mention about snatching I, your father\u2019s most treasured woman, still brazenly showing off affection in front of me!\u2019 Lan Yin directly took out his sword and attacked Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the sound of blade entering the body, everyone was stunned. They could only see that the sword in the hand of Lan Yin had stabbed through the body of Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You!\u201d Luo Meng Wu cried out in alarm, and from the side Lan Yan and others directly dashed towards Ren Tian You. Just at that time, they saw that the body of Ren Tian You suddenly turned into 4 black crows and scattered towards Lan Yin. This was the unique skill of Uchiha Itachi\u2014\u2014\u2014 Magen\u2014Shinkarasu (Demon Illusion\u2014Mirage Raven).</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Lan Yin looked all around him and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my world!\u201d Suddenly the space in front of Lan Yin twisted, and Ren Tian You appeared before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you didn\u2019t die?\u201d Seeing Ren Tian You, Lan Yin was frightened and asked stammeringly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Of course, I didn\u2019t die. I brought you here to talk to you about something.\u201d Ren Tian You said grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat something? Between us there is nothing left to talk.\u201d Lan Yin replied with a disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to talk about the matter of Luo Meng Wu. Actually, honestly speaking, there is nothing between me and Luo Meng Wu. We are just good friends, but\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Ren Tian You said slowly, but before he could finish speaking, the pleasantly surprised voice of Lan Yin interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo kidding, without doubt it\u2019s real. In addition I discovered that, although you like Luo Meng Wu, but she seemed to be too cold towards you.\u201d In a bad mood, Ren Tian You said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been pursuing her for almost 3 years, but she always treat me like a younger brother and never before responded to my feelings.\u201d Lan Yin said very depressingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you like her?\u201d Ren Tian You stared the eyes of Lan Yin and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I like\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Lan Yin stammered and couldn\u2019t tell even a single reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you really don\u2019t like her, you just purely wanted to obtain her, nothing more. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Ren Tian You said. Inside his heart he was secretly sneering, \u2018didn\u2019t expect these pick-up lines that I had browsed on the internet on the Earth, to be useful in this different world.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Lan Yin complexion became ghastly pale, and tried to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou merely deceived yourself into thinking you liked her, nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Lan Yin sat on the ground. But he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Luo Meng Wu is already aware about this matter so she had been refusing you all this time. If you want Luo Meng Wu to really accept you, first of all give yourself a reason to love her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026..got it!\u201d Lan Yin lowered his head and spoke</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, oh, that\u2019s right! You should hurry up, otherwise Luo Meng Wu may like someone else and you won\u2019t even find a place to cry. For example me ah, I am such an outstanding guy, so I can\u2019t guaranty you that she won\u2019t fall in love with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Lan Yin lifted his head and was about to curse Ren Tian You, only to find the space was around him was gradually twisting. When he regained his vision again, he discovered that he was still standing at his original location. His sword was still inside his sheath and his brother and others were also standing at the side without moving from their place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Lan Yin tried to think, but he didn\u2019t know the matter just now was real or not. He even started to think that all the matters happened before were his fantasies.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was my illusion skill, and the things we talked with each other just now, I hope you will think about that carefully.\u201d Ren Tian You said to Lan Yin while covering his left eye with his hand, as his left eyes was a bit tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lan Yin thought for a while, then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tian You, what\u2019s going on? Why did my brother leave so suddenly?\u201d Lan Yan came towards Ren Tian You and curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, secret.\u201d Ren Tian You laughed. Then he turned towards Luo Meng Wu and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, darling little Wu Wu. It\u2019s already late, so we should go to bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d In a flash, the face of Luo Meng Wu was filled with dark clouds, and with a strong murderous look she lifted her long, slender and beautiful legs and kicked Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Ren Tian You made a beautiful arc in the air \u2018peng\u2019 and fell on the flower bed on the side of the path.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa ha ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the miserable condition of Ren Tian You, suddenly each and every one of them cannot help but laugh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then his gaze firmly fixed on distant Yaorao\u2019s that as if life exterminating giant Demonic Buddha and he slowly muttered, \u201cFirst I should split open the body of this big fellow ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, lend me your strength.\u201d Ren Tianyou yelled towards Son Goku within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Son also loudly replied back to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>After getting the answer of Son, Ren Tianyou slowly raised his right hand. Then he began to gather his boundless chakra within his right palm, and Son Goku also send out the power of Yoton (Lava Style). After that, along with sharp ear piercing sound, a super huge shuriken formed by wind energy rapidly rotated in the palm of Ren Tianyou. And in the center position of this Rasen Shuriken, there was a magma like energy ball, this was the power of Son\u2019s Lava Style.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this, Senpo\u2014-Yoton Rasenshuriken! (Sage Art\u2014-Lava Style Rasen Shuriken!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the loud roar of Ren Tianyou, this super Rasen Shuriken created by the fusion of power of Six Path and the power of Son\u2019s Lava Style directly shot towards Yaorao\u2019s giant Demonic Buddha. Sensing the energy contained within this move, even Yaorao felt apprehensive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Heaven Defying Mirror!\u201d Looking at this rapidly approaching giant Rasen Shuriken, Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha coldly snorted, then gathering boundless Purple Yuan Power within her body, she directly moved all the energy of this Demonic Buddha to one of the four Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, Heaven Defying Mirror!</p><br/><p>Along with the support of the energy of Yaorao, that huge Heaven Defying Mirror in the left arm of Demonic Buddha directly flew up, then rapidly became huge in the sky, changing into an even larger shield, and as if a real heaven concealing shield, it blocked Rasen Shuriken.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d That huge Rasen Shuriken directly collided with this shield, and unceasingly clashed against it, wanting to break through this shield, but it was powerless to break through this shield\u2019s obstruction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, it\u2019s not so easy!\u201d Seeing his Rasen Shuriken was blocked, as well as seeing Yaorao looking at him with disdain, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then looking towards his Rasen Shuriken, he lightly said, \u201cExplode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, that Rasen Shuriken exploded with a loud bang. A loud sound of explosion resounded throughout the entire horizon, and a huge explosion shockwave with rolling hot magma spread all around. Countless things were instantly destroyed, and the destruction degree of earth became even more critical.</p><br/><p>And just at this time, suddenly wind breaking sound came from his right hand side. Ren Tianyou turned his head, and saw thick black colored light beam was straightly shooting towards him. And the attacker was precisely Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Beast!\u201d Looking at the attack of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted in disdain, then waved his right hand, two of the Gudodama (Truth-Seeking Balls) behind him flew out. After that, under the control of Ren Tianyou, both of them fused together, and rapidly changed the form, changing into a huge black colored light mirror in the sky.</p><br/><p>When that thick black colored light beam hit this shield made up of Truth-Seeking Balls, no sound resounded, rather a mysterious power quickly melted that black colored light beam. After that along with the rapid disappearance of the energy of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, this black colored light beam thoroughly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, that black colored light mirror again changed into two Truth-Seeking Balls and flew back to the back of Ren Tianyou, then began to again slowly revolve with other seven Truth-Seeking Balls.</p><br/><p>These Truth-Seeking Balls can freely change their shape according to the will of user. It could change into liquid state form, and again change into solid state matters to defend and attack, moreover they could nullify all the ordinary attacks.</p><br/><p>Although the energy contained within the attack of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast was strong, but it still belong to the five elements, not a special energy attack, so it has no effect on Ren Tianyou\u2019s Truth-Seeking Balls. Truth-Seeking Balls directly nullified the energy of that attack, erasing it from this space.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha also charged out from the explosion range of Rasen Shuriken. Although the explosion of just now was very powerful, but it was still not enough to injure Yaorao, merely depleted her energy a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot let Yaorao and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast work together, otherwise I will definitely have to exhaust myself to separate them again.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought while looking at Yaorao and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast. Furthermore looking at the land around, he slowly thought, \u201cMoreover this land is already not far from completely destruction, so I cannot fight here again, I must change the battleground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Might be because she had discovered the thought of Ren Tianyou, under the control of Yaorao, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast rapidly flew towards the direction of Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not so easy!\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, then his left Rinne Sharingan flashed with eye power, followed by the space where his body was exchanged with the space between Yaorao and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, \u201cDojutsu\u2014-Baleful Transposition!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared between them, then with the eye power rapidly gushing out from his eyes, four mysterious matter flew out in four side from Ren Tianyou, flying towards Thousand Eyes Evil Beast and Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha.</p><br/><p>\u201cLimbo\u2014-Hengoku!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d \u201cHong!\u201d Along with the anguish roar of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, it and Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha were suddenly sent flying. Seeing Thousand Eyes Evil Beast was roaring in pain and the energy of Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha suddenly dimming, they seemed to have received a heavy attack.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou had no intention to let Thousand Eyes Evil Beast flying out, so he used right Rinne Sharingan to firmly stare at sent flying Yaorao, while emitting powerful eye power.</p><br/><p>\u201cDojutsu\u2014-The Other Side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, sent flying Yaorao\u2019s that huge Demonic Buddha suddenly bumped against an invisible protective screen, and its huge flying body suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>After that under the control of Yaorao, Demonic Buddha stood firmly, then sweeping all around, her eyes flashed with purple colored radiance, then Demonic Buddha raised the Void Slaying Sword in its right hand and slashed in front of her. A \u2018hong\u2019 sound resounded, and as if something was blocking it, Void Slaying Sword stopped in the mid-air, no longer slashing down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a strange space magic, I\u2019ve never thought that there is actually a space protective screen which even I am not able to cut through with my Void Slaying Sword which is also known as a sword that is capable of cutting through even space-time!\u201d Feeling that she could no longer force her Void Slaying Sword down, and seeing an obscure space protective screen around her, Yaorao within Demonic Buddha couldn\u2019t help but mutter looking at distant Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Although she was trapped inside here and couldn\u2019t move outside, but Yaorao wasn\u2019t worried, because she clearly understood that, within this space, although she couldn\u2019t attack other people, but Ren Tianyou also couldn\u2019t injure her. Moreover she also understood that this space wouldn\u2019t remain for too long, because she could clearly sense that this space protective screen was the temporary assemble of mysterious power.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just stay here, wait until we exchange the location of our battle.\u201d Looking at Yaorao who was trapped in his dojutsu for the time being, Ren Tianyou sneered, then looked towards Thousand Eyes Evil Beast who had fallen on the distant ground after being hit by his Limbo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2019s skin is really thick, and the defensive power is also really strong. Even after getting hit by my Limbo attack, it actually didn\u2019t get any injuries at all.\u201d Looking at unscathed Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Its defense was far too powerful, no wonder in those years, Yaorao was also powerless to kill it and could only seal it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s seal its movement for the time being.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, then waving his right hand, six black colored metal rod flew out, and respectively landed on the six position around Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cBarrier Jutsu\u2014- Musekiyojin! (Six Crimson Ray Formation!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, and from the six black colored rod, six huge crimson colored energy light beam flew out, then these light beams rapidly changed into light screen combining together, and formed a huge crimson colored barrier, trapping Thousand Eyes Evil Beast inside.</p><br/><p>Six Crimson Ray Formation, compared to Shisekiyojin (Four Crimson Ray Formation), which needed four kage level ninja to use, was far wider and defensive power was also far stronger. Ren Tianyou intend to first trap Thousand Eyes Evil Beast here, and after finishing the battle with Yaorao, return back to deal with it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

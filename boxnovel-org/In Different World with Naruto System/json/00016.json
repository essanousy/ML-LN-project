If he didn\u2019t want to observe the illusion techniques of this world, he would already have finished this fight in an instant.</p><br/><p>With the progression of the chant, Tian Yunguan began to fade away, and a section of the duel arena became foggy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion art\u2014Forest Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The illusion finally started to take effect after Tian Yunguan finished his chant. Tian Yunguan looked at Ren Tianyou with a trace of a sneer and thought to himself, \u201cKid, look how I finish you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time a gentle breeze blew over, along with it Tian Yunguan started to dissipate, until he thoroughly disappeared</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting, but still too easy.\u201d Seeing Tian Yunguan disappear, he muttered to himself. Then he promptly activated his right eye.</p><br/><p>Outside the arena, Luo Tianxing saw the illusion spell and cried in surprise, \u201cThe \u2018Forest Domain\u2019?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? \u2018Forest Domain?!\u2019 Isn\u2019t this a secret art of the Zhao clan of the imperial capital? How did this kid learn it?\u201d said Long You in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome time ago, I heard this fellow\u2019s father and the Zhao clan had some dealing with each other, but I never thought that the cheap Zhao clan unexpectedly handed over this secret art to the Tian clan. This is truly unexpected\u2026.\u201d Li Feng mentioned what he had heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, in the end, what is this secret skill \u2018Forest Domain\u2019? Is it impressive?\u201d seeing the startled face of her brother, Lan Xinmeng asked full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Forest Domain\u2019 is one of the top ranked secret skills. It\u2019s not a simple illusion, the user of this skill can use this skill to create countless trees to capture enemies but the most astonishing thing is that the user of this skill can enter this illusory world and attack the target physically. Although with his current level of power Tian Yunguan wouldn\u2019t be able to create many trees but I fear, with Tian You\u2019s strength\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Lan Yan said anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t brother Tianyou in danger? Not good, I have to stop this duel!\u201d Long Luo Luo was very anxious, in her heart she was blaming herself, \u201cBecause of me, big brother Tianyou is in this dangerous situation\u2026\u201d Thinking this she rushed towards the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, here at Eiffel, no one is allowed to meddle with a duel, unless a life or death situation occured or the duel is finished, otherwise the barrier around the duel arena will not be opened.\u201d Long You hastily blocked his sister and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should I do? ah~, because of me, big brother Tian You fell into such a dangerous position.\u201d Blaming herself, Long Luoluo walked back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Long You didn\u2019t know what to say to his anxious younger sister. All of them were anxious, even their identities were of no use here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer highness princess and his highness prince, don\u2019t worry! Your friend will be fine.\u201d the voice of an old man was suddenly interrupted. Long Luoluo and others looked back and saw several old men behind them. They were the old men who had been following Lan Yan and company.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond grandfather, why are you here?\u201d Seeing the thin and small old man, Long Luoluo asked with a surprised look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, fourth elder, why are you here?\u201d Luo Tianxing was surprised too and asked a tall and big old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, do you think your family could send you to this place without any precautions? As a result his majesty and the clan leader of your families send us to protect you.\u201d fourth elder said with his booming voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s right, fourth elder, why did you tell us not to worry about Tian You.\u201d At the same time, Luo Mengwu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, do you really think that your friend is only at the intermediate fighter level? He is not as simple as he looks.\u201d The fourth elder said with a mysterious smile. Then they started to look at the arena.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the ring, along with the disappearance of Tian Yunguan 4-5 meter large trees began to grow. From these trees countless branches extended towards Ren Tianyou and tightly bound him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the upper half of Tian Yunguan emerged from a tree near to Ren Tianyou . His right hand was holding the staff and his left hand was holding a dagger. Grinning hideously he said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cKid, die for me!\u201d Tian Yunguan waved his dagger in Ren Tianyou\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was looking completely calm at Tian Yunguan with his Mangekyo Sharingan. He had a mysterious smile plastered on his face, and a ripple of power was released from his right eye.</p><br/><p>Tian Yunguan sneered as he observed how is dagger was drawing nearer to Ren Tianyou.In his mind he was roaring :\u201d Die for daring to steal my woman, dumbass!\u201d</p><br/><p>But something unexpected happened as Tian Yunguan approached the 10cm mark. The dagger stopped, and couldn\u2019t advance anymore. Sensing something from above, he looked up and was stunned as his vision was blocked by the branch which was holding Ren Tianyou.He had disappeared from there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026..\u201d the mouth of Tian Yunguan was gaped open wide with surprise, he didn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cMerely this level of illusion. I just wanted to see if you had any powerful illusions , that\u2019s it. I\u2019m completely disappointed with the result.\u201d stated Ren Tianyou watched the Tian Yunguan who was bound by the illusory tree. Just now he had only used his right eye to reflect the illusion. This level of illusion was childsplay.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have disappointed me, you can die now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou watched Tian Yunguan, and unsheathed his Snake sword. Using this sword he stabbed in Tian Yunguan\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Seeing the sword getting nearer, Tian Yunguan was screaming in his heart, \u201cMove ah, I, your father move ah!\u201d At this time, the necklace around his neck flashed with a blue light and the tree that was binding him disappeared, regaining his freedom. After that he hastily retreated to dodge the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t except you had a treasure.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Tian Yunguan with indifference.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu hu\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Tian Yun Guan was breathing heavily after avoiding the attack, he was nearly at death\u2019S door. Tian Yunguan looked at the necklace and displayed a look of regret.</p><br/><p>The necklace was a gift from father, a high level treasure. It had the power to dispel an illusion, a rare treasure. He never thought it would be wasted here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, I hate troublesome fellows the most, and you are the one who started this mess.I generally tend to eradicate the trouble at its source. Since you have used an illusion, let me show you what a real illusion looks like!\u201d Saying this he sheathed his sword and activated his Mangekyo Sharingan. Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any good impression on Tian Yunguan, and he didn\u2019t care if he died. But after he had awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan, he didn\u2019t have a chance to use its power, so it was a good time to test its power.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoujutsu\u2014Tsukuyomi\u201d Ren Tianyou released the power of his left eye, and suddenly a mysterious aura radiated out from his body.</p><br/><p>Tian Yunguan was prepared for the attack of Ren Tianyou, suddenly he discovered that the eyes of Ren Tianyou were completely different, they were blood red and there were 3 spiraling curves within the eyes. Shortly afterwards, he felt dizzy, and saw 7 or 8 pairs of Sharingan circling around the sky. By the time he awoke from his stupor, he unexpectedly found himself in strange place.He was tied to the cross and no matter how he tried he couldn\u2019t free himself. At this time, Tian Yunguan suddenly saw Ren Tianyou before his eyes, and in his right hand he was holding a sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this? what do you want to do with me?\u201d Seeing the sword, Tian Yunguan was completely terrified and hastily questioned with a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to Tsukuyomi world. In this world I can control all matter, time and space. For next 72 hours, I will use this sword to stab you. Hope you are able to withstand it.\u201d After Ren Tianyou finished explaining, he stabbed his sword into Tian Yunguan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~~~~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yunguan released a blood-curdling scream, clenched his hands, as he saw blood flowing out from the injury. But as Ren Tianyou pulled out the sword, he saw that the injury was already restored.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic. This is only an illusion, everything is an illusion.\u201d Inside his mind, Tian Yunguan was reminding himself nonstop and was thinking how to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is only an illusion, but the pain is real.\u201d Ren Tianyou seemed to see through Tian Yunguan\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, how could you\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had clearly seen through him, he was startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I have already stated, inside this world, I can control all matter, time and space. And without doubt that also include your thoughts. There is still 71 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds left.\u201d Saying this Ren Tianyou again stabbed Tian Yun Guan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~~~~!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yunguan again released a blood-curdling scream. And he was even more horrified when he discovered that Ren Tian You was gradually multiplying. One after another appeared , each on was holding a glittering sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou. You\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Tian Yunguan looked all around and discovered countless Ren Tianyou\u2019s. With a cold sweat running down his back, he tried to say something.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou ignored him, and he kept on stabbing Tian Yunguan. Tian Yunguan kept on releasing a blood-curdling scream, and wanted to escape but there was no way to escape . He could only suffer endless pain, this endless torture gradually caused him to give up all hope.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>3 days in the \u2018Tsukuyomi world\u2019 is only a moment in the real world, nothing more. The people who were watching outside the arena, only saw Ren Tianyou suddenly cover his left eye, after that Tian Yunguan released a blood-curdling scream and collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a real illusion. Three days in that world is only an instant in reality\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Tian Yunguan thought and looked at Ren Tianyou. Shortly afterwards he felt vertigo and directly fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the power of Tsukuyomi? Incredible! The system has eliminated the normal side effects so my left eye only feels a little fatigue.\u201d Ren Tianyou covered his left eye and recalled the feeling of using Tsukuyomi. In that Tsukuyomi world, he clearly felt that he had everything in his grasp, like a god.</p><br/><p>Looking at the fainted Tian Yunguan, he slowly closed his Mangekyo Sharingan. And slowly started to walk towards the audience, the barrier around the arena already lifted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

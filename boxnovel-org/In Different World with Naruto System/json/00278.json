Ren Tianyou had made him fall down from the sky with great difficulty, so how could Ren Tianyou let this opportunity slip by. He began to quickly make a series of hand seals, and along with the rapid circulation of chakra within his body, he instantly finished the preparation of ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton\u2014-Jukai Kotan! (Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Emergence!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, under the shocked gaze of Amike, numerous cracks suddenly appeared on the ground around, then countless giant trees grew out from the ground, instantly changing the surrounding terrain into a forest. And Amike was completely surrounded by this forest.</p><br/><p>All of these trees emitted dense aura of life. And at this moment, the sturdy vines of these trees as if alive instantly stretched towards trapped within this tree boundary Amike.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing the sudden huge changes in the surroundings around him, as well as those vines continuously moving towards him, the pupils of Amike firmly shrunk, then he instantly flew towards the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, do you think it\u2019s this easy to escape.\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, then he changed his hand seals. After that the top of the trees suddenly extended rapidly and changed into huge vine net in the sky, stopping the path of Amike.</p><br/><p>After Amike got rid of wooden dragon with difficulty, he clearly knew that these trees were also very troublesome things. So he slashed out his right hand\u2019s Baleful Heaven Demon Blade directly sweeping towards trees, instantly cutting the vines in front of him into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, as long as you are within my tree domain, these countless vines will thoroughly swallow you sooner or later.\u201d Looking at the move of Amike, Ren Tianyou who was standing far away sneered, then continue to manipulate these countless branches and tendrils to surround Amike.</p><br/><p>Looking at those branches and tendrils all around, Amike stopped at midair. After that he slowly raised his right hand\u2019s Baleful Heaven Demon Blade, and closed his eyes. And the vines all around instantly tied up the body of Amike thoroughly.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou was inwardly proud of himself, suddenly from inside the tree domain burst forth a terrifying blade intent. And as if cutting open a horizon, huge blade slash suddenly rose from inside the tree domain, and cut this tree domain. And after cutting this tree domain into half, it advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Killing Six Secrets, Second Form\u2014-Heaven Destruction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this towering slash, Ren Tianyou felt a stabbing pain. Then he instantly made a series of hand seals. After that the ground on both side suddenly break open and two wooden palm appeared. And under the control of Ren Tianyou, these wooden palms caught this huge blade slash, completely stopping it.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, after the trees were cut into pieces one after another, the figure of Amike became visible again. Right now with him as a center, the surrounding tree domain was swept clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Mokuton\u2014-Hotei no Jutsu!\u201d Ren Tianyou made a series of hand seals, then the ground around suddenly cracked one after another. After that suddenly six or seven huge wooden arms burst out from the ground and slapped towards Amike, as if wanted to swat him to death with those wooden palms.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing those huge wooden palms all around, Amike snorted coldly. After that his right hand\u2019s Baleful Heaven Demon Blade directly made a circular sweep, and a huge circular blade slash spread out all around him with him as a center, cutting wooden palms into pieces one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, hu\u2026..\u201d Standing in Hobi no Jutsu (Wood Expulsion Jutsu), Ren Tianyou unceasingly breathe heavily. Looking at Amike in front of him, although his that powerful strength made Ren Tianyou feel a powerful pressure, nevertheless there wasn\u2019t any trace of nervousness in the eyes of Ren Tianyou, only had powerful fighting intent.</p><br/><p>And at this time, the Hobi no Jutsu (Wood Expulsion Jutsu) of Ren Tianyou slowly crack open under the repetitive attack of Amike. After that along with a loud crash, it disintegrated into wooden chips.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, today let me have a good fight. It\u2019s already been a long time since I came to this world, but only now I finally met an opponent who can let me use all of my strength to fight.\u201d Looking at Amike in front of him, Ren Tianyou looked towards the heaven and laughed heartily, while his body was burning with strong fighting intent.</p><br/><p>Ninja in itself required one to conceal oneself, then wait for a chance to kill the opponent in one hit.</p><br/><p>But for current Ren Tianyou, that was nothing but a horseshit. After painstakingly training up until now, now Ren Tianyou wanted to test his strength, and have a good all-out fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, human, although I look down upon you human clans, but I, Heaven Sealing Demon God am taking back my words of just now. You are qualified to be I, Amike\u2019s opponent.\u201d This moment, Amike was bloody from head to toe, and pointing at Ren Tianyou with Baleful Heaven which was burning with pitch-black flame, he said in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei hei.\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, then he disappeared, instantly appearing behind Amike. After that he performed a simple backhanded horizontal chop towards Amike with his right hand covered with lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I already took precaution against your this move.\u201d Seeing the sudden disappearance of Ren Tianyou, Amike immediately swung his own right hand backwards.</p><br/><p>But how could Ren Tianyou let him have his way? The Sharingan of his left eye rapidly spun, and huge amount of eye power gushed from his left eye, \u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Forever Solidify, Time Stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly Amike maintain the pose of waving his right hand\u2019s Baleful Heaven Demon Blade and stopped in midair. He was completely motionless, so much so that even his facial expression could be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014- Raigyaku Suihei! (Lightning Style\u2014- Lateral Bolt of Pain!)\u201d</p><br/><p>The right hand of Ren Tianyou changed into a huge lightning war blade, and with the momentum of breaking the void, attacked towards the head of Amike.</p><br/><p>Along with the \u2018hong\u2019 explosion sound, Amike was directly send flying downwards from the sky.</p><br/><p>And simultaneously the effect of Doujutsu\u2014Forever Solidify had also already disappeared. But due to the attack of Raigyaku Suihei (Lateral Bolt of Pain) on his head, that powerful vibration made his head instantly dizzy, and he was unable to differentiate east, west, north and south.</p><br/><p>And taking advantage of this opportunity, Ren Tianyou instantly used Hiraishin to appear beside him. After that he instantly lift up that lofty body of Amike above his head, and with his body releasing dazzling lightning, he slammed the body of Amike to the underneath ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014- Raiga Bomu!

And with his eyes changing into Sharingan, he looked towards the sky.</p><br/><p>And White Tiger and others beside Ren Tianyou instantly circled around Ren Tianyou. As Ren Tianyou was severely injured, they placed Ren Tianyou in the middle to protect. After that emitting powerful energy from their body, they also looked towards the sky.</p><br/><p>At that time, suddenly a golden radiances appeared in the sky, and shining mysterious runes appeared on this radiance, which slowly condensed into golden silhouette in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Seeing this was clearly not a substance but empty silhouette, Ren Tianyou frowned, then looking at this silhouette, he asked. Although this silhouette was not entity, but that golden colored energy being emitted from its body however was far more powerful compared to even Amike, so he couldn\u2019t help but become cautious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, don\u2019t be alarmed youngsters, I have no ill will.\u201d Seeing the alert face of Ren Tianyou and others, a gentle and kind voice came through this silhouette. This voice was filled with amiable power that made people who heard this voice to put down their guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst I will introduce myself, I am the spirit of this Tower of Babel, in other words, I am Tower of Babel and Tower of Babel is me.\u201d The words of this middle-aged man\u2019s silhouette as if bomb, exploded in the brain of everyone present.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You are this Tower of Babel.\u201d Hearing this middle-aged man\u2019s voice, White Tiger cried out in surprise, and his face was filled with disbelief expression.</p><br/><p>Alongside Great Bear and others were also similarly looking at this silhouette in surprise, as if they couldn\u2019t accept the fact before their eyes.</p><br/><p>And as for Ren Tianyou, after hearing this middle-aged man\u2019s self-introduction, his eyes instantly flashed with understanding, \u201cI had already guessed this Tower of Babel might have its own consciousness long ago, it seems I really was right. Three years ago, within Tower of Babel, weren\u2019t you the one who saved me from Amike?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, three years ago when you entered the second floor, I noticed you, similarly Amike had also noticed you. And your next performance however greatly surprised both of us. We had never expected that along with your strength of at that time, you were actually able to proficiently use space magic too.\u201d This middle-aged man nodded his head while admitting he was the one who had saved him three years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd because of your talent, Amike realized that you might become obstacle of Demon clan when they invade again, as a result he raised his hand to eliminate you, so I also raise my hand to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have a question, you as a spirit of Tower of Babel, on the basis of this Tower of Babel being able to seal numerous Demon clan\u2019s experts for 30,000 years, how can you let people of Demon clan do as he please now within Tower of Babel?\u201d Ren Tianyou asked the question which had always existed in the bottom of his heart, while looking at the spirit of Tower of Babel with confused appearance.</p><br/><p>This Tower of Babel was a divine artifact, although Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know its grade, but it was able to seal the experts of Demon clan for 30,000 years without them being able to break out, this shows its power. But Ren Tianyou however discovered that this Amike was actually able to raise his hand as he please within Tower of Babel, Ren Tianyou found this confusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, if it was before, then even though the strength of this Amike was powerful, he however would still be powerless to do as he please in this ninth floor relying on his strength.\u201d This silhouette sighed helplessly, then slowly explained, \u201cFrom 10 years ago, the power of the seal set up in the space passage joining the Demon world slowly got weaker, finally I can only use my body itself to stall for time, but on the other side of the passage, Demon Emperor of Demon clan used Universe Boundary Divine Artifact of their Demon World and led the experts of Demon clan to continuously bombard the seal of the passage, so greater part of my power were used to stabilize the seal of other side. As a result, I simply didn\u2019t have any surplus power to give consideration to Demon clan inside the Tower of Babel.\u201d [T.L: Demon World is the world of Demon clan. Previously I had translated it as Devildom, but I think Demon World is better, so from now on I will be using Demon World.]</p><br/><p>\u201cLook here.\u201d Saying this, suddenly a golden colored energy flew out in front of this middle-aged man, and a golden colored mirror appeared in midair.</p><br/><p>The image on the mirror was a vast starry sky. In the middle of this starry sky, there was a huge space black hole, and above this black hole, there was a huge seal. This seal was firmly sealing off this passage.</p><br/><p>And at the side of this seal, thirty experts of Divine Wind Continent stood there. All of them were pouring the energy within their body into this seal to constantly stabilize and strengthen the seal. And above everyone, there was a small sized golden colored tower which was emitting huge power to protect the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026?\u201d Looking at this scene on the mirror, Ren Tianyou confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the seal that was set up during that time, and these people are God Domain experts of Supreme Light Academy and 100 clans\u2019 peak experts temporarily stabilizing the seal. But the power of seal is still weakening.\u201d Tower of Babel explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was not because of all the experts of Supreme Light Academy were located in there, do you think you all could quietly enter here?\u201d Finished speaking, the spirit of Tower of Babel looked towards Whiter Tiger and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo for what matter did you appear here?\u201d Looking at Tower of Babel, Ren Tianyou confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you all something.\u201d Finished speaking, the voice of Tower of Babel become solemn looking at Ren Tianyou, \u201cYoungster, I want you to come here when you are strong enough to confront God Emperor. At that time, I will give you a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know this time, when the time comes, you will know what that is. For now here, this thing will greatly help you all to increase your strength.\u201d Saying this, a sheep skin map flew out from this golden silhouette and landed on the hand of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not for you, rather for your companions.\u201d The middle-aged man paused for a bit after saying this, after that he again continued, \u201cThis is the map of Seven Great Saints of that time\u2019s legacy. You all can go according to this map to obtain their inheritance.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

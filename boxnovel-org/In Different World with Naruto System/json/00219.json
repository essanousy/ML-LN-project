Henceforth, the position of Great Bear of Akatsuki was also filled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know you before, but as you are cousin of Vermilion Bird, I will have faith in your character.\u201d After seeing Di Qingyu had already worn his ring and robe, Ren Tianyou revealed a understanding smile on his face, \u201cI want to say only one sentence, now you have join our Akatsuki organization, you must not jeopardize the matters of organization, and if any other members came across danger, no matter what you are doing, you must immediately rush over to rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I discover anyone trying to jeopardize the matters of organization or did not try to say other members who was in mortal danger, then no matter who you are and also how big your background is, I will let you know even though heaven and earth is very big, there will not be any hiding place for you.\u201d Saying this, the three magatama inside the Sharingan of Ren Tianyou unconsciously spun continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, you can rest assured, although I Di Qingyu am not a good person, but I still have minimum principle.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Di Qingyu didn\u2019t take any offence, because some matters were much better said before than later.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard Zero, what does your words mean, are you doubting my cousin?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Vermilion Bird stared at Ren Tianyou splitting anger as she yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, how could it be, I am just stating certain truths that\u2019s all.\u201d Seeing towering flames of fury of Vermilion Bird, he again recalled that currently he was severely injured, any touch would cause him feel pain for a long time, so Ren Tianyou decided to first sound out the difficulties and retreat to avoid defeat, \u201cAs a matter of fact, you also don\u2019t need to be too tense, our organization don\u2019t ask anything, usually very free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, everyone is extremely tried because of the fight just a moment ago, so we should go back and rest for today. Moreover the resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er will begin tomorrow.\u201d Looking around to all the members, he slowly continued, \u201cAfter resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er, next we will strive to improve our strength. I think after going through this fight, everyone ought to have recognize their own shortcomings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, the head of White Tiger and others slowly sunk down, no need to speak about others, today this Bu Feng alone had played around with him and Void so easily who were strongest member of Akatsuki origination outside Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, disperse.\u201d Seeing everyone was lowering their head, Ren Tianyou waved his hand as he said to everyone. After that turning around, he looked over to Feng Yunmeng, and gave her promised Spring of Life, then said, \u201cVilla Mistress Feng, I will go back to rest first, tomorrow we will resurrect my elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you can go to rest first, your room is already ready, now I will go back to prepare for the resurrection of tomorrow.\u201d Taking Spring of Life, Feng Yunmeng said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen thank you, Villa Mistress Feng.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou turned around and walked out. Following a maid, he arrived at his room.</p><br/><p>Closing the door, Ren Tianyou sat cross-legged on the bed, slowly recovering the injuries inside his body, and simultaneously refining the life-force of Forever Green which was changing his body thread by thread. The consciousness of Ren Tianyou sunk into the system inside his body.</p><br/><p>Now the system points had already accumulated to 90,000 or so, and still had a mission which was not completed, that was resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er. After she was resurrected, his system points will once again increase by additional 80,000 system points.</p><br/><p>After that he looked at Exchange system and saw that the seal on the three tailed beast was already removed. Now he could exchange three tailed beast with 60,000 system points.</p><br/><p>Although he currently already had enough system points exchange Sanbi (Three tailed), but he didn\u2019t do so, because currently he already had 2 tailed beasts, and even if the required system points was small, he didn\u2019t want to use it, as his current ultimate target was Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Only after awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, he would exchange another tail beast. And at that time, depending on his eye power, controlling tail beasts would also be even more smooth and easy. Moreover he had already obtained Mokuton (Wood style) which he would be developing slowly. And at that time, relying on Wood style, Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, and his tailed beasts, his strength would be greatly boosted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, if only I could awaken Rinnegan right now, how wonderful it would be.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed with sentiment, but this was unrealistic, because he had not even awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, so how could he awaken Rinnegan now.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, didn\u2019t expect Uchiha Madara\u2019s Gunbai is also here ah.\u201d Just then, when Ren Tianyou had scanned the weapon store of Exchange system from the corner of his eyes, he exclaimed in surprised. You should know that this Gunbai was a pretty good weapon for him, and especially for a Sharingan user, not only could it increase the power of his Fire style, it could also be combined to use a number of specific moves. [T.L: Ganbai is the fan shaped weapon use by madara and obito]</p><br/><p>\u201cNeeds 15,000 system points, hum, not too expensive, I will exchange it after finishing the current matters in hand.\u201d Seeing the number of system points required to exchange this weapon, Ren Tianyou slowly thought.</p><br/><p>Along with the slow passage of time, the injuries of Ren Tianyou also slowly take a turn for a better under the effect of refining Forever Green. Ren Tianyou discovered that the life-force capacity of his body seems to have improved a bit because of the injury of this time. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that I need to receive severe injury every time to improve my life-force? F**k, wouldn\u2019t that turn me into masochist?\u201d Seeing the changes in his body, Ren Tianyou gave a supercilious look in a bad mood as he thought.</p><br/><p>The sky outside was already dark, and Ren Tianyou glanced at time. Now it was already past mid-night.</p><br/><p>Opening the door, Ren Tianyou looked at those two round full moon in the sky, slightly sighed, then closed the door, and jumping, he directly arrived at roof.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the eaves, Ren Tianyou kept watching those bright and clear moonlit sky, recalling his previous times on the Earth, \u201cThree years, its already three years since I arrived in this world, don\u2019t know how my father, mother and little sister are doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather had high blood pressure, I don\u2019t know whether he is still enduring the attack without losing. Although mother usually nagged me, still she nevertheless love me the most inside her heart. And after suddenly receiving the news of my death, I don\u2019t know how they managed to accept it.\u201d Thinking about his parents, the eyes of Ren Tianyou slowly become moist. \u201cFurthermore my litter sister ought to already be 19 years old now, already a big girl. Your elder brother cannot be by your side to protect you all, so you must take care of yourself as well as mother and father ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who says real men do not easily cry, only those not yet truly heart-broken says this. The space ring in the right hand of Ren Tianyou suddenly flashed with a blue colored radiance, and a bottle of alcohol appeared in the hand of Ren Tianyou. Then opening the lid of alcohol, he directly raise his head, and the alcohol immediately flowed down his throat to **. Because he was too impatient, alcohol flowed out from the corner of his mouth and soaked his clothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d The already empty bottle fell down to the ground from the hand of Ren Tianyou and shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years, at this rate, when can I have the ability to find the way back home?\u201d Ren Tianyou felt a burning sensation in his body, but he didn\u2019t care about that thinking it was the problem of his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Zero?\u201d White Tiger and others who were sitting in the pavilion saw Ren Tianyou sitting on the far away roof and confusedly asked among themselves. Next to White Tiger, Void, Vermilion Bird, Wang Yuxin, Jade Maiden furthermore newly joined Great Bear Di Qingyu were present. They were unable to fall asleep, so they had decided to eat something, and chat with each other to deepen their relation as the members of same organization.</p><br/><p>But when they also wanted to call Ren Tianyou, Wang Yuxin said he was too seriously injured today, so they should let him take more rest. But who would have thought that they would see this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know, although I know Zero longest other than Santai, but I always feel as if he is always suppressing something in his heart.\u201d Void shook his head, and expressed he was also unclear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing the current figure of Zero, why do I feel like crying?\u201d Seeing that lonely figure sitting on the roof illuminated under the bight and clear moonlight, Vermilion Bird unconsciously felt a kind of sadness feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou on the roof, the eyes of Wang Yuxin was a little bit moist, as she whispered. Then flew away from that pavilion towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSantai, she\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing Wang Yuxin flying away, Jade Maiden said towards everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet it be, let\u2019s us return too. At this time, I think it\u2019s better for Santian who had grown up with Zero from childhood to have words with him.\u201d Looking at Wang Yuxin who was flying towards Zero, White Tiger shook his head and said to everyone, then took a lead to leave pavilion. After that Void and others also slowly left. When Jade Maiden left, looking over towards Ren Tianyou, her eyes shone with an emotion which she herself didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu, how come you are still not sleeping?\u201d Without tuning his head back, and still drinking alcohol, Ren Tianyou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am unable to fall asleep.\u201d Wang Yuxin landed next to Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cIdiot, what\u2019s going on with you? You can speak your sad matters, we will help to bear your burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, you will not understand even if I talk.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed. This matter was destined to constrain his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, didn\u2019t you say, hereafter we will face any matters together?\u201d Wang Yuxin laid her head on the shoulder of Ren Tianyou, and said in gentle tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu.\u201d Turning his head and looking at Wang Yuxin\u2019s that extremely beautiful face well within his reach in his shoulder, in this instant, he felt very relaxed. Under the simulation of alcohol, he unconsciously hugged Wang Yuxin. And under the surprise gaze of Wang Yuxin, that \u2018contaminated with alcohol\u2019 lips directly sealed Wang Yuxin\u2019s that rosy beautiful lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Wang Yuxin gave out a muffled groan, and resisted instinctively, but very quickly her both hands encircled the neck of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Only after nearly one minute, this French kiss ended. Ren Tianyou looked at that rosy face of Wang Yuxin, and felt primitive impulse rising inside his body, \u201cLittle Yu, become my woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the complexion of Wang Yuxin become even rosier. Then deeply lowering her head, she whispered in mosquito like voice.</p><br/><p>But this voice directly ignited Ren Tianyou. Holding Wang Yuxin in his arms, he immediately arrived inside his room. After few minutes, along with the muffled moaning sound, there was only painting sound inside the room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

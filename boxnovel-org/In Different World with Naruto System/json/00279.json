(Liger Bomb!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the loud roar, Ren Tianyou slammed down the body of Amike which he had held up high with his hands to the ground. After that along with \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound, the ground around suddenly became full of spider shaped crack, and a huge fissure appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, after receiving this attack of Ren Tianyou, the body of Amike suddenly began to bend, and under the surprise gaze of Ren Tianyou, the body of Amike slowly changed into pitch-black colored magic mist and dissipated from the hands of Ren Tianyou,</p><br/><p>\u201cClone\u2026?\u201d Seeing Amike changing into magic mist and dissipating, Ren Tianyou became surprise, and simultaneously became alert.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, sound of wind breaking came from the midair behind Ren Tianyou, and he felt a bone piercing chill. After that he turned around and looked. He saw Amike was chopping down his Baleful Heaven Demon Blade towards his head.</p><br/><p>Seeing the demon blade was already near his body, Ren Tianyou immediately used doujutsu of his right eye without any hesitation, \u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Kamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon blade of Amike instantly cut down from the head of Ren Tianyou, instantly reaching the ground. Then along with the \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, a huge gully appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>And when his Baleful Heaven Demon Blade cut through the head of Ren Tianyou, Amike revealed a victory smile, but soon his smile disappeared, because the feeling as if he had cut through empty air came through his right hand. He didn\u2019t feel any resistance.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou was still standing in front of him without any injury. Then looking at Amike, he quickly made a series of hand seals while circulating the chakra within his body, \u201cFire Style\u2014-Majestic Nine Flame Dragon Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took a deep breathe, then he spat out a blazing flame from his mouth. Then along with the sound of dragon roar, nine huge flame dragon attacked towards Amike.</p><br/><p>Fire Style\u2014-Majestic Nine Flame Dragon Formation was the original * ranked fire style ninjutsu created by Ren Tianyou. He used fire style\u2019s form change to instantly form nine huge blazing flame dragon which would continuously attack, tiring down the enemy. It was also difficult to block, and its might was also very powerful.</p><br/><p>Seeing these nine huge flame dragon, Amike just waved his Baleful Heaven Demon Blade without any fear, sending out a huge blade slash towards these flame dragon. But on the other side, after Ren Tianyou released Fire Style\u2014-Majestic Nine Flame Dragon Formation, he immediately flew towards the sky without slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was clear, although his this move Majestic Nine Flame Dragon Formation was powerful, but it was still not enough to severely injure Amike. He had only used this move to stall him for the time being, and the real big move however was yet to come.</p><br/><p>Last time when Ren Tianyou and people of Akatsuki organization had strenuously trained in sea area for three years, Ren Tianyou had not only mastered a number of necessary ninjutsu, but had also created three original S rank ninjutsu. First ninjutsu was Ninja Art\u2014-Scorching Stars Fall and Exterminate, which he had used to destroy the entire Magic Domain, when he had attacked Magic Domain. And this time he was about to use second S rank ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cKage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Shadow Clone Jutsu!)\u201d While in the midair, Ren Tianyou made a series of hand seals, then along with \u2018peng\u2019 sound, white colored smoke appeared, from which shadow clone appeared beside him.</p><br/><p>And underneath, Amike had already destroyed two among those nine huge flame dragons. Looking at Amike currently fighting with flame dragon, Ren Tianyou whispered, \u201cI hope you can survive this move.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking this, Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone began to quickly make a series of hand seals without any hesitation. The speed of making hand seals was so fast that only blur could be seen. And along with the rapid forming of hand seals, purple lightning and cyan colored wind simultaneously rose from the body of Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone. After that along with the lighting chakra and wind chakra gushing out from his body, the sky around also changed.</p><br/><p>In the sky above, large amount of dark clouds rapidly gathered. The area of this dark clouds was very wide, which covered the range of more than 2 kilometers.</p><br/><p>In the centermost dark clouds, i.e. in the vicinity of Ren Tianyou and Amike, dark clouds turned into a kind of spiral form in the sky. And a huge lightning snakes was unceasingly wandering around this dark clouds.</p><br/><p>And simultaneously in the vicinity, don\u2019t know when but a strong gale was unceasingly blowing off the sands and rocks. These hurricanes unceasingly gathered, slowly forming tornados in succession all around in the sky. The momentum of these tornados were as if it wanted to scrape off the mountain. And there was lightning flickering in the sky above these tornados. Amike also instantly notice the change in the surroundings. Seeing those terrifying tornados and unceasingly flickering lightning snake, furthermore sensing the energy contained within them, even he was scared witless.</p><br/><p>But this moment, there was still three flame dragon in front of him that were pestering him, so with no other choice, Amike went all out and used a big move to instantly get rid of remaining three flame dragon.</p><br/><p>But this moment, the changes of the surrounding was already at final stage, so even if he wanted to stop it now, it was already too late. Furthermore this attack range was terrifying 2000 meters, so even if he wanted to flee, he was already too late.</p><br/><p>So with no other choice, Amike ruthlessly hit his own chest with his right hand, then his face instantly became pale, and simultaneously spat out a drop of red blood. This blood drop floated in front of him, and was emitting a terrifying energy.</p><br/><p>This was the refined blood which was within the Blood Core of Amike. This blood contained powerful blood qi energy of Amike, but Amike had greatly injured his vitality after spatting out a drop of this refined blood.</p><br/><p>Amike reached out his right hand, and caught this drop of refined blood, while simultaneously pouring his powerful magical power to his right hand. After that along with \u2018ka ka\u2019 disintegrating sound, a deep black colored light beam suddenly rose and wrapped around his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon God\u2019s Guard!\u201d</p><br/><p>This move called Demon God\u2019s Guard used by Amike was a move that could be learn by only the imperial lineage of Demon clan, which was one of the ultimate defense skill. The defense power of this skill was so unimaginable that even the people who was one rank greater than him would find it difficult to break it. But one required the energy of refined blood to use this move, so one might say this move had great restriction. Even with the strength of Amike, if he spent five drops of refined blood in a short amount of time, then he would definitely go down to have a tea with Death God.</p><br/><p>And just after Amike had finished his preparation, the ninjutsu of Ren Tianyou was also completed. After that Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone simultaneously yelled loudly while maintaining a hand seal in front of their chest and the chakra inside their body was rapidly depleted by 30%, \u201cNinja Art\u2014- Gale Thunderstorm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ninja Art\u2014- Gale Thunderstorm, this was the second S rank ninjutsu created by Ren Tianyou. This ninjutsu required Ren Tianyou to first create a shadow clone. And after his large amount of chakra was shared equally between them, he and his shadow clone would simultaneously use lightning and wind nature chakra. Furthermore the hand seals required for this ninjutsu was very tedious, even with the speed of making hand seals of Ren Tianyou, he required several tens of seconds to complete.</p><br/><p>This ninjutsu simultaneously summons lightning clouds containing powerful lightning, and huge tornado within the range of these countless thundercloud. And at the time of completion of this ninjutsu, those countless terrifying lightning snakes in the sky would enter into these tornados to form a terrifying lightning tornados. After that the surrounding within the range would be bombard indiscriminately. At that time, lightning chakra and wind chakra would collide with each other, forming an even more terrifying explosion storm. The sharp piercing force of lightning and terrifying cutting power of wind would destroy everything within the range of this attack. And this move Gale Thunderstorm was finishing blow of Ren Tianyou to thoroughly destroy Amike.</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ninjutsu was launched. After that the lightning and those terrifying tornados in the sky suddenly began to move.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

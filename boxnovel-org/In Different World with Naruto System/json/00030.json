After thinking for a while, he turned towards the entrance of the academy and walked towards the city. Now since he had decided to attend this Supreme Light Academy, it was essential be wealthy. Although he had a good relation with Lan Yan and others, however Ren tian You didn\u2019t want to use their money. Even if they don\u2019t mind, he himself won\u2019t agree to that proposal. So Ren Tian You had decided to sell some of the magical beasts\u2019 core which he had obtained while he was staying inside the Magical beasts\u2019 forest, for some spare gold coins. He planned to sell only few high level magical beasts\u2019 core because he had accidentally discovered some something, i.e. he could let the Naruto system inside his body, to absorb the power contained within magical beasts\u2019 core for system points. But this exchange rate was extremely low. The system didn\u2019t absorb the core of class 3 or lower magical beasts, it only absorbs the core of class 4 or higher magical beasts and exchange some system points. Even the core of class 7 magical beast which is equivalent to human great sword master, only gave 200 system points, isn\u2019t this income falling short of expenditure. Nevertheless, now he was no longer inside the Magical beasts\u2019 forest, so he don\u2019t have any other good method to earn system points. Also now he had already awakened Mangekyo Sharingan, and every time he used the doujutsu of Mangekyo Sharingan, it increases blindness value, and to offset this blindness points he had to use system points. 50 system points, only offsets 1% blindness value. As a result, although exchanging magical beasts\u2019 core for the system points was not cost effective, but currently he had no other method to earn system points, so he had no choice but to exchange system points using magical beasts\u2019 core. Although killing a person can also earn a huge amount of system points, still he can\u2019t just go around killing indiscriminately, just for the system points. Even if he tried to kill indiscriminately in this continent, then with his current strength, he won\u2019t be able to escape death form the hands of those hidden extremely powerful old humans.</p><br/><p>After asking many peoples along the way, he finally arrived at the market which was located at the southern part. This was the place where most of the markets were concentrated in whole Imperial capital. And in the middle of this market, there was a 10 meter tall building, which was auction house of imperial capital Ka Li Si. In this auction house, they often auction rather valuable items and weapons, even to the extent that sometimes they auction high grade skill book. Ren Tian You went towards this auction house named \u2018Blue Emperor\u2019s Song auction house\u2019. Ren Tian You entered the auction house, and walked towards the central hall of the ground floor. Exactly when Ren Tian You came inside the auction house, a beautiful looking maid servant came forward, \u201cHello, welcome to Blue emperor\u2019s song auction house. May I ask, if mister needs any help in something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to sell few high level magical beasts\u2019 core.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf mister wants to sell magical beasts\u2019 core, then please follow this passage all the way. And at the right side 4th room from the end, please look for great master Gao Li Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, thanks a lot!\u201d Ren Tian You thanked and after that he immediately followed the direction. After a moment he arrived at the room mentioned by that maid, after that he pushed open the door and entered inside.</p><br/><p>This was a wide room, everything that is needed in the room such as tables, chairs and other kind of furniture, were available in this room. And in the center of the room, there was an old man sitting on the chair and looking at the book attentively. Hearing the sound of the door, that old man put down his book and looked towards the direction of Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I want to sell a number of magical beasts\u2019 core.\u201d Ren Tian You stepped forward towards that old man called Gao Li Yun, and directly spoke straight to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, selling core of magical beasts? Then take out the cores of magical beasts, and let me examine it.\u201d With a little interest in his face, Gao Li Yun said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis table may be a bit small, oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, then you can just take out in the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the words of Gao Li Yun, Ren Tian You took out a storage scroll form his ninja backpack. After that he opened the scroll and spread it on the floor. Gao Li Yun didn\u2019t understand the reason behind the action of Ren Tian You, and he just kept watching.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen!\u201d Ren Tian You made few hand seals with his right hand, \u201cpeng, peng\u201d then suddenly the scroll suddenly pop off with smokes. When the smoke dispersed, they could see several piles of magical beasts\u2019 cores had appeared on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Seeing the action of Ren Tian You, surprise flashed in the eyes of Gao Li Yun. After that he looked towards Ren Tian You and said, \u201cYoungster, very good tool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your praise. Please check the total price of these magical beasts\u2019 core.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, Ok!\u201d Gao Li Yun came near this piles of magical beasts\u2019 core and started to examine carefully. After about 10 minutes, Gao Li Yun stood up and said to Ren Tian You, \u201c269 class 3 cores, 257 class 4 cores, 193 class 5 cores, 127 class 6 cores, and 37 class 7 cores. All the energy within these magical cores were properly preserved, there is not any loss, so we will pay you according to market price. 20 gold coins for class 3 cores, 100 gold coins for class 4 cores, 700 gold coins for class 5 cores, 1600 gold coins for class 6 cores, and 8000 gold coins for class 7 cores. All together 665380 gold coins. Do you have a magic card? If you have then I can directly transfer the gold coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, um, I still don\u2019t have magic card. Do you provide magic cards, if so then can I get a magic card for myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe \u2018Blue emperor\u2019s song auction house\u2019, of course give this service. Please wait a moment, I will call a person to get you a magic card.\u201d Gao Li Yun called a maid and said something in her ear. Then that servant nodded her head and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, is there anything else to sell? Or do you have more magical beasts core?\u201d Turning around, Gao Li Yun asked Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-hm, for the time being, I don\u2019t have.\u201d Ren Tian you shook his head. Now he had only a dozen or so class 7 cores, in addition to this he had only class 8 core, and saint class core. He didn\u2019t have any intention to sell these magical beasts\u2019 core.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it really is a pity.\u201d At this moment that maid came in. She hand over the purple colored card to Gao Li Yun and left the room.</p><br/><p>Gao Yi Yun produce another similar card, and he stacked them together. After that a feint wave of magic flashed. Then he handed the card to Ren Tian You and said, \u201cWell this is ownerless magic card, if you drop a blood in this card, then it will recognize you as its master. Your total gold is 665280. 100 gold coins are deducted as a fee to create this card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You drip a drop of blood on the card, after that he clearly felt that there was exact 665280 gold coins, then he said, \u201cWell there is nothing left, I will leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, looking forward to your next visit.\u201d After watching Ren Tian You leave, he waved his hand and all the cores on the ground disappeared. \u201cInteresting, only at the level of intermediate fighter, but taking out such a large number of high class magical beasts\u2019 core.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving the auction house, Ren Tian You was returning to the academy. Just at that time, a surprise voice of a female appeared behind him, \u201cYi, aren\u2019t you Ximen Tian Long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ren Tian You suddenly paused his steps. He had never thought that someone who knew the previous owner of the body would appear here. Ren Tian You turned around to look behind him, he recognized the identity of this young girl from the memory of Ximen Tian Long. \u201cTurned out to be her!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zero? White Tiger? What is this?\u201d Although the greeting method of Ren Tianyou and the others was extremely flashy, nevertheless the mother of Vermilion Bird Feng Yunmeng clearly didn\u2019t know what the Akatsuki organization was, so she asked with a surprise look in her face.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tianyou and the others had created a big ruckus in Ailer Empire\u2019s Ximen clan, even to the extent that they almost slaughtered all the peak experts of the Ximen clan, leaving not one behind, and also various big forces of this continent had already received the news, but it seems after Vermilion Bird had secretly left the villa, Feng Yunmeng had dispatched most of the scouts of the villa all over the place to search for traces regarding the whereabouts of Vermilion Bird. However, was unable to get any clues regarding her whereabouts, and was still solely focusing on finding her whereabouts. As a result, they knew nothing regarding the havoc caused to the Ximen clan by the Akatsuki organization.</p><br/><p>However this was also understandable, Feng Wu, she was from the Flame Phoenix villa, so naturally she must be extremely knowledgeable about the inner workings of the villa. So if she wanted to hide from the scouts\u2019 eyes and ears, it\u2019s simplicity itself.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Feng Yunmeng didn\u2019t know anything about his organization, Ren Tianyou blanked out for a moment, immediately after that he heaved a sigh of relief. Then thought, \u201cWell, it\u2019s much better if she doesn\u2019t know anything about my organization. If she and her peoples treat us as terrorists, then it would be a tragedy for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already caused a great havoc at Soaring Dragon Mountain villa, and with the exception of Ximen Batiann who was able to flee as luck would have it, everyone else was thoroughly killed cleanly. Last one of them was Ximen Feng, Ren Tianyou used Tsukuyomi on him for three days. It was not the three days of Tsukuyomi\u2019s world, rather three actual days. In these three days, as long as he rests his eyes properly, he could continue using Tsukuyomi. This left Ximen Feng hanging between life and death. Finally, after Ximen Feng broke down, he used fire style jutsu to directly burn him, and while alive, he was burned to dregs. After hearing his slaughtering deeds at Soaring Dragon mountain villa, his organization was already regarded as a terrorist organization who killed without batting an eyelid.</p><br/><p>After heaving a sigh of relief, Ren Tianyou made a wry smile as he tried to explain to Feng Yunmeng, \u201cWe are not things, no we are things, also no\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d The more he spoke, the more he felt it was wrong, finally he thought to himself. I don\u2019t know how to explain clearly.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and the others behind Ren Tianyou had the corner of their mouths continuously twitch, and black lines formed on their foreheads. According to Ren Tianyou\u2019s explanation, in the end were they things or not? Causing others to become even more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, interesting youngster.\u201d Hearing the third-rate explanation of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng, full of mature charm smiled sweetly, making everyone feel dazed. \u201cHowever our Flame Phoenix villa is not a place where you can come as you please. If there is nothing, then it\u2019s better for you all to leave as soon as possible.\u201d Feng Yunmeng found Ren Tianyou very amusing, plus he seemed to suit her daughter, so she didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for them, and just asked them to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, they\u2019re my good friends, how can you drive them away like this?\u201d Hearing her mother, Vermilion Bird immediately became anxious, and hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wu, you be silent.\u201d Hearing Vermilion Bird, Feng Yunmeng turned her head towards Vermilion Bird and said in a stern voice. \u201cI still haven\u2019t settled accounts for the matter of you secretly running away, so wait for me to take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVilla Mistress Feng!\u201d Ren Tianyou cupped his hands, looked at Feng Yunmeng with a begging expression, and said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, we also have a matter we want to request you, I hope Villa Mistress Feng would be willing to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat connection do I have with your matter? Why should I help you? Considering you are all friends of my darling daughter, I talked to you to this extent, and also didn\u2019t look into the matter of you all secretly entering Flame Phoenix villa. If it was before then I, your old mother would have already chopped all of you with my sword.\u201d Feng Yunmeng looked at Ren Tianyou with disdain as she spoke. As for Ren Tianyou\u2019s pleading, she directly ignored it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, those are some pretty big words, but I don\u2019t know whether you have the ability?\u201d Hearing those arrogant words of Feng Yunmeng, White Tiger immediately snorted coldly, and a powerful killing intent spread all over the big hall. Suddenly the surrounding temperature seemed to drop by a lot, and the two maids standing inside the hall felt a bone piercing chill.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t expect that this little handsome boy\u2019s killing intent to be is this heavy.\u201d Feeling that dense killing intent from White Tiger, Feng Yunmeng giggled. Then the thin golden radiance suddenly appeared from her body, and the whole killing intent of White Tiger suddenly dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Tiger, don\u2019t be rude, step down!\u201d Ren Tianyou turned his head around, and said to White Tiger in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind, just step down, I will handle this matter.\u201d Ren Tianyou continued to speak, this time they were asking for a favour, so they had no choice but to lower their heads a little. Furthermore she was Vermilion Bird\u2019s mother, so when speaking, he should watch his manner of speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Replied White Tiger, then immediately fell back.</p><br/><p>Villa Mistress Feng, I also know that we took the liberty to enter and failed to show courtesy. Just like Villa Mistress Feng said, we are neither relatives nor friends, so there is no obligation for you to help us.\u201d Looking at Feng Yunmeng who was standing in front of him with a smile on her face, Ren Tianyou slowly said. \u201cThe matter I want to request is very important to me, so if Villa Mistress Feng helps me this time, regardless of what condition you may have, I will definitely accomplish it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no matter for you to do, and I\u2019m not interested to hear your matter, nor am I interested to know it. Guards, lead them out from here.\u201d Feng Yunmeng didn\u2019t have any interest in Ren Tianyou\u2019s request, she directly opened her mouth and yelled towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Several pretty women guards came in from the door, and directly pounced on towards Ren Tianyou and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares!?\u201d Seeing several female guards charging towards them, the eyes of White Tiger and Void simultaneously flashed, and explosively roared. Then their bodies directly changed into light and flashed towards them.</p><br/><p>After that along with several \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019 sound, those several female guards suddenly shrieked, as they were kicked flying by White Tiger and Void. They heavily landed outside the door, but with the exception of superficial wounds, all of them were alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d Seeing the moves of White Tiger and Void, the complexion of Feng Yunmeng immediately sank, then she roared like a thunder. After that, golden coloured flame suddenly appeared around her body, blazing heat filled the entire hall. Feng Yunmeng waved her right hand, suddenly a half moon like gold coloured energy Qi chopped towards Ren Tianyou and the others.</p><br/><p>At that time, a lightning silhouette suddenly flashed in front of her attack. When everyone looked carefully, they noticed that this figure was Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>The whole body of Ren Tianyou was covered with powerful lightning chakra, and he stretched forward his right hand, which directly changed into a lightning claw and grabbed this terrifyingly hot flame energy slash.</p><br/><p>The lightning chakra on the right hand of Ren Tianyou and the flame slash continuously clashed against each other. At this time, Ren Tianyou exerted a bit of strength into his right hand, and pinched the flame slash directly breaking it into pieces. These pieces changed into fire elements and disappeared into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you do have some strength. But making trouble in Flame Phoenix villa with this small amount of strength is just bringing about your own destruction.\u201d Seeing the powerful lightning element on the body of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng sneered. Just when she was about to make another move, Vermilion Bird immediately blocked her front.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t raise your hand, okay, they are my friends.\u201d Seeing her mother was about to make another move, Feng Wu pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph friends, our Flame Phoenix villa\u2019s people would never be friends with these stinking men. Now you quickly get out of my way, after I finish settling with these fellows, I will settle accounts with you for the matter of secretly running away from the villa.\u201d Hearing Vermilion Bird, Feng Yunmeng suddenly became angry as she berated her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t, unless you kill me first, I will not move.\u201d Hearing Feng Yunmeng, Vermilion Bird resolutely said. \u201cFrom childhood, because you said we people of Flame Phoenix villa were not permitted to leave this mountain, I never got out of this mountain. I grew in within this mountain from childhood, so I knew nothing about the world outside this mountain world. I didn\u2019t have any real friends within this mountain, those disciples and maids treated me as Miss, and the elders and you also treat me as a daughter. For 18 years, did you ever try to understand your daughter\u2019s heart as a mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom childhood, you would punish me severely, and frequently curse me in your rage, so I went ahead and left this villa. This time if Zero didn\u2019t have a pressing matter where he needed to request your help, then I absolutely would not have returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing Vermilion Bird, Feng Yunmeng\u2019s body quivered, trembling right hand\u2019s index finger pointed at Vermilion Bird, then she suddenly raised and waved her right hand towards that beautiful face of Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cPa!\u201d This slap didn\u2019t land on the face of Vermilion Bird, as her arm was firmly held by a lightning covered hand. Looking at the owner of the hand, she saw Ren Tianyou expressionlessly standing at the side of Vermilion Bird, and his right hand was tightly holding her right arm, making it impossible to move forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cVilla Mistress Feng, there is no need to get worked up over such a small matter.\u201d Ren Tianyou indifferently spoke to Feng Yunmeng, as he also slowly loosened his grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an internal matter of our Flame Phoenix villa, it is not a matter for you outsiders to meddle into!\u201d As a matter of fact, the instant she had begun to hit, inside her heart Feng Yunmeng had already regretted it, and so she felt fortunate when it was blocked by Ren Tianyou. But it was not easy to make Feng Yunmeng show gratefulness towards men.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Villa Mistress Feng, I want to do a proper business deal. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to reject what I have requested, as you will not be helping me in vain.\u201d Ren Tianyou took out a simple book and one crystal which was emitting a black coloured magic fog from his space ring, and continued to speak, \u201cI am willing to give you this Mid-heaven ranked battle skill\u2014\u2014-Violent cloud sudden change, plus this Low God ranked, demon clan\u2019s divinity crystal as a payment. And I will furthermore promise to do any three tasks you, Villa Mistress Feng ask, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate my principles, I will exert my fullest efforts to get them done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mid-heaven grade battle skill was the reward he got after completing the mission \u2018get purple gauze magnificent sky flower\u2019 of mercenary guild. As for this Low God, demon clan\u2019s divinity crystal, he naturally obtained it after killing that unlucky demon clan member in the Tower of Babel.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, your condition is actually very fascinating.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng\u2019s complexion immediately changed slightly for a more favourable expression, then the golden flame on her body also slowly dissipated. \u201cThen tell me what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ren Tianyou slowly closed his eyes, then suddenly opened and staring at Feng Yunmeng, he said, \u201cI want Villa Mistress to resurrect my dead elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? Say it again.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the complexion of Feng Yunmeng suddenly changed, and a powerful aura from her body firmly locked onto Ren Tianyou, \u201cFrom where did you hear the information that our Flame Phoenix villa is capable of resurrecting a dead person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Simultaneously Feng Yunmeng secretly thought inside her heart, \u201cWhere did this guy get this information? Don\u2019t tell me that Little Wu\u2026.? Impossible, except me only very, very few elders of the Flame Phoenix villa know of this. So it is impossible for even the members of our villa to know this, let alone outsiders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guessed.\u201d Ren Tianyou completely ignored the aura of Feng Yunmeng, and continued on, \u201cI heard the Phoenix god blood lineage of your Flame Phoenix villa have rebirth fire bath ability. I also don\u2019t know whether this ability could be used on other people or not, but I was also forced to give medicine to a dead horse, so I came here to request of you. [T.N: to give medicine to a dead horse (Idiom): to keep trying everything in a desperate situation]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut from the reaction of Villa Master Feng just a moment ago, it seems you Flame Phoenix villa can really resurrect my elder sister, so Villa Mistress Feng, please you must help me, I absolutely will never forget this favour.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng slowly retracted her aura, then she looked at that Heaven grade battle skill and that divinity crystal in Ren Tianyou\u2019s hands, and again, thought of her daughter, then sighed inside her heart, \u201cAi, let it pass, since it\u2019s like this, I should help him. Even Little Wu is asking me to help him, what\u2019s more we will not suffer losses excessively, one divinity crystal plus that Mid-heaven grade battle skill, we definitely will not suffer too big of a loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Heaven grade battle skill is very rare, even Flame Mountain villa, this kind of big forces possessed only a few, this proves the worth of Heaven grade battle skills. As for the divinity crystal, it could be used to increase the likelihood to break through the barrier of god domain and enter the boundary of god domain, so it was similarly priceless.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I agree to your request.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng slowly said. But before Ren Tianyou became happy, she continued, \u201cBut to revive the dead, you must first get two things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpring of Life and Revenant stone!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

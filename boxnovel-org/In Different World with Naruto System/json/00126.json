But this killing intent was not directed towards him, and was also not directed towards any other people, rather automatically being emitted. Ren Tianyou looked towards the location from where this killing intent was coming form with surprise.

With this type of unmatched taunting skill, I don\u2019t know whether it will be good or bad for him to join my group.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any time to sigh, because the brawl had already started, so he restrain himself from thinking useless things and had a look. After hearing the unmatched taunting of this youngster, all of them erupted with extreme rage, they immediately released battle qi, and holding huge swords in their hands, they dashed towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u201d, \u201cding\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 7 sound of metal colliding rang out.

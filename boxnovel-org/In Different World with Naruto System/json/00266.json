Although Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know this Great Holy Light Stars Formation, but seeing Bu Feng\u2019s those extremely cautious appearance, he knew that these transparent rays were something that must not be touched.</p><br/><p>And although he was neither as skilled as Bu Feng in martial arts movement nor his speed was unrivalled under the heaven, but he however possessed Sharingan. After Bu Feng went down, Ren Tianyou directly used kamui of right eye and directly jumped down secretly, now appearing in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d Looking at Bu Feng in front of him, Ren Tianyou calmly said, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect after letting you escape three years ago, I would unexpectedly encounter you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then turning his head and looking all around, Ren Tianyou continued, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve spoken this much, I want to say I really admire you for actually daring to come here where the stronghold of Light Temple is located. Moreover you were able to avoid the eyes of all guards and arrive here. It seems in three years when we haven\u2019t seen each other, your speed has become even faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are no worse than me, weren\u2019t you also able to arrive here without being noticed by anyone? Furthermore even I myself didn\u2019t notice I was being followed.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng solemnly said, \u201cDon\u2019t know what brings you the leader of Akatsuki organization here? Are you still planning to get back on me for the matter of me trying to assassinate the members of Akatsuki organization three years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, I have already forgotten about that matter.\u201d Ren TIanyou shook his head while speaking. \u201cBut although I have already forgotten about that matter, but we two are at least not friends. And not my friend can only be my enemy. Although I don\u2019t know what thing is inside that box, but it is necessary to not let enemy obtain the things they wanted to obtain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible to have your way.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng snorted coldly. Shortly afterward, he immediately reached out his hand towards that wooden box underneath to seize and take away, but just at that moment, wind breaking sound came from above his head, which was unexpected to Bu Feng. He immediately gave up the plan to take that box, instead he hit the ground with his hand, immediately making a forward flip and jumping forward in the sky.</p><br/><p>And just after Bu Feng had left from that place, Ren Tianyou\u2019s right leg directly kicked at the ground where he was standing just a moment ago. Then seeing Bu Feng was in the sky in front of him, Ren Tianyou exert strength in his legs and stamped on the ground chasing after him.</p><br/><p>But although Ren Tianyou was fast, Bu Feng was even faster. In the midair the body of Bu Feng suddenly glimmered with cyan colored light, then in a flash, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>And seeing Bu Feng had disappeared, Ren Tianyou frowned and immediately stopped his steps. Then along with the spinning of his Sharingan, his powerful dynamic vision capture all the movements of Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, suddenly a wind breaking sound come from behind him, but Ren Tianyou just smiled, then slightly moved his head to the right. Just after that a palm covered in cyan colored light holding a strange dagger suddenly brush past the face of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>And seizing at movement, Ren Tianyou immediately turned around his head, and the pattern of his left eye spun rapidly, then invisible eye power rapidly gush out from his eye, \u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Forever Solidify!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the time and space around quickly froze under an invisible power. Bu Feng maintain the pose of stabbing the dagger in front with his hand without any motion in the same place, and without wasting this rare opportunity, Ren Tianyou quickly punched heavily on the abdomen of Bu Feng without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>And when his right hand landed on the abdomen of Bu Feng, Ren Tianyou had already removed Doujutsu\u2014-Forever Solidify, causing the time and space around to flow normally again. But as for Bu Feng, he was directly sent flying. While still in midair, Bu Feng stabilized his body and slowly landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Clutching his abdomen where he was feeling indistinct pain, Bu Feng failed to notice that mysterious mark on his abdomen which slowly concealed itself. Right now he was looking at Ren Tianyou with surprise, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>In his memory, he only saw Ren Tianyou had merely turned around his head, then his abdomen was already hit. The stopped time of two second didn\u2019t appear in his memory, so in his thought, he had lost to Ren Tianyou in terms of speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour speed is indeed very fast, so fast that the eyes of average person cannot keep up with your speed, but every movement of yours are completely caught by my eyes even though my speed is not as fast as yours.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said while pointing his Sharingan. Now the purpose of this time was already achieved, so speaking a number of matters was also not any big problem. Moreover from the beginning, he didn\u2019t intend to rob this thing from him, he had only intend to have great fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou\u2019s those two scarlet eyes, Bu Feng slightly understand as he thought in his heart, \u201cThose pairs of eyes ought to be blood lineage of this fellow. According to the narration of this fellow as well as him being able to clearly see my movements just now, his eyes should have the ability to slow down the movement of human body. But even if your eyes are able to keep up the pace with my speed, does your body able to react in time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Bu Feng gently closed his eyes, then when he snapped open it again, his entire body was glimmering with starlight, \u201cStars Blood lineage, initiate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Bu Feng, his body emitted powerful aura, but with the very good control of Bu Feng, it was spread within this building only, lest his aura would have attracted the people outside.</p><br/><p>A star mark appeared on his forehead, and his body emitted a large amount of dim starlight, then looking at Ren Tainyou, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t know if you can keep up with my speed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStarry sky step\u2014-Scattered Star!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Bu Feng, he instantly disappeared, and countless starlight appeared in the sky which charged towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing these starlight, Ren Tianyou firmly frowned, then he immediately pulled out Uchiha Round Fan with his right hand. And at this moment, his Sharingan caught the appearance of afterimage, then he directly swung his round fan, but hit only empty air.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, countless afterimages suddenly appeared all around him which suddenly attacked him rapidly, and he basically didn\u2019t have any time to react, \u201cNot good, kamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing countless starlight afterimages all around him, Ren Tianyou directly used kamui of right eye. After that all those countless starlight merely passed through his body.</p><br/><p>When starlight disappeared, the body of Bu Feng was half-crouching in front with exquisite wooden box already in his hand. Ren Tianyou was greatly surprise to find Bu Feng actually had enough time to take that wooden box, while still attacking him. This speed was really fast, so fast that even if he was able to see his figure, his body was not able to react in time.</p><br/><p>But before Ren Tianyou and Bu Feng could open their mouth, suddenly a glimmering holy light rose from inside the groove where the wooden box was kept, and a loud sharp sound also reverberated through the horizon. Simultaneously outside this building, huge Holy Light Magic Formation quickly rose from the ground, rapidly reaching the top of the building.</p><br/><p>Hearing the sound of alarm, the guards outside immediately became alert, then instantly surrounded this building. Simultaneously countless guards within imperial palace who had heard the alarm sound, hurriedly ran towards this building.</p><br/><p>Within the imperial palace, hearing the alarm sound, the complexion of three old man wearing red clothing of bishop greatly changed, then changing into white light, all of them disappeared. And in the main hall of Light Temple outside the imperial palace, more than ten holy light simultaneously flew towards imperial palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect those damned wretches of Light Temple were so sinister, actually setting up a mechanism here.\u201d Hearing the sound of alarm, Bu Feng muttered to himself, but he however didn\u2019t have any fear on his face. Then looking at Ren Tianyou, he said, \u201cI am not accompanying you to play any longer, you look out for yourself, I am leaving first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, his body instantly changed into starlight then flying in the sky, he rapidly passed through Great Holy Light Stars Formation. After that he broke through the fan shaped window, and flew out.</p><br/><p>Seeing Bu Feng had already disappeared, Ren Tianyou who was still inside the building slightly smiled, \u201cFinally I can see a good play. I really want to see how you will run out from this stronghold of Light Temple. Hope you don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Finished speaking, along with the spiral shaped space ripple, he also disappeared from there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After a closer look, it was actually Li Xinyun. Right now the white colored light barrier before her body was a bit dim, even the radiances of the 3 illusion energy ball had also become a bit dimmer. She had a trace of blood stain on the corner of her mouth, and contrary to what one might expect there was no big injuries on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected your speed to be this fast. From the very beginning I had taken a precautions against your speed, my illusion light wings were exactly for this purpose, but I had still underestimated your demonic speed.\u201d Li Xinyun slowly said.</p><br/><p>Hearing the words of Li Xinyun, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t say anything, merely quietly stared at Li Xinyun who was floating in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it is almost impossible for me to win this match, nevertheless I will struggle with all my strength till the end.\u201d Finished speaking, Li Xinyun clapped her hand together, suddenly the 3 energy balls floating around her twinkled with a strong white colored illusion energy. Along with the move of Li Xinyun, the illusion energy slowly spread all over and covered the air around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion skill\u2014boundless confusion domain!\u201d Along with the shout of Li Xinyun, immediately the illusion power around them moved, along with the thought of Li Xinyun, and at the field of vision of Ren Tianyou, suddenly a dramatic change occurred.</p><br/><p>The arena had vanished, and currently he was standing at the endless maze. And all around him, there were only damp cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite capable eh?\u201d Seeing the changes around him, Ren Tianyou smiled. Just at that time Ren Tianyou suddenly sensed that a strange sound was coming through the cliff around him. He turned his head only to see, that countless stones had suddenly appeared from the cliff, and was slowly advancing towards him. After that under his foot, he suddenly sensed that the earth\u2019s surface underneath his foot had become soft, and saw that the earth\u2019s surface had suddenly changed into purple and black colored quagmire. Then his body was ceaselessly sinking into this quagmire.</p><br/><p>Quietly looking at the changes around him, Ren Tianyou slowly formed a hand seal with his both hand, \u201cAlthough this illusion is quite lifelike, and illusion ability also not bad but it\u2019s too bad as your opponent was me. Release!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the explosive shout from Ren Tianyou, the surrounding around quickly disappeared, and after his field of vision restored, he found himself still standing at the original location of the arena. And all the stones, cliff, maze and quagmire had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou had easily destroyed her illusion in a flash, Li Xinyun was shocked within her heart and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better to not waste any more time, beautiful lady, honestly speaking, your illusions are very powerful, but illusions don\u2019t work on me. I think you might as well concede early, I really don\u2019t want to hit a flower.\u201d Staring at Li Xinyun floating in the air, Ren Tianyou suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never admit a defeat.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Li Xinyun firmly shook her head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this case, I have no other choice. I have to win this match, so as far as possible I will try not use too much force.\u201d Seeing Li Xinyu was unlikely to give up, although he had already guessed this result, but he still couldn\u2019t help but shook his head. Then his hinds quickly formed a hand seals. \u201cRaiton\u2014Raigen Raikochu!\u201d (Lightning Illusion\u2014Flash Pillar)</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Along with the completion of forming the seals, suddenly an intense dazzling rays of light sprang out from the body of Ren Tianyou, and that radiances caused Li Xinyun and all the audiences watching the battle unable to open their eyes.</p><br/><p>Just when everyone were rubbing their tearful eyes which was stung with an intense light, they heard few faint words, \u201cRasengan.\u201d Then it revert back to quietness.</p><br/><p>When everyone\u2019s vision were restored, everyone were greatly surprised. As they saw on the arena, Ren Tianyou was still standing at the original location, but he was carrying already fainted Li Xinyun in his arms.</p><br/><p>Everyone were looking at the arena with a strange expression on his eyes, and especially seeing Sun Chuqian and several others\u2019 expression in their eyes, even though he was quite thick-skinned, he couldn\u2019t help but blushed a little. Hastily turning his head towards the judge who was equally staring blankly, he yelled, \u201cHey, didn\u2019t you see the match is over already? Still not announcing the result of the match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..oh oh.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the judge finally react. He quickly removed the barrier, came up in the arena, and then gave Ren Tianyou his identity plate. After that he turned his head towards the audiences and announced, \u201cI declare Ren Tianyou as a winner of this match.\u201d</p><br/><p>After judge announced the result, immediately Ren Tianyou holding Li Xinyun in his embrace disappeared from the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, congratulation on winning the match, but you are also too awesome, actually hitting and knocking out the famous beauty our academy and holding her in your embrace. You ox, just take a look around at the expression in the eyes of the male students.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou returning while carrying one of the greatest beauty of their academy, Wang Haiqing immediately opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh.\u201d Hearing Wang Haiqing, Ren Tianyou immediately turned around to look. Seeing the sight behind him, he couldn\u2019t help but became terrified within his heart, even though he was quite powerful. The eyes of all the male students around were burning with anger and were staring at him, some were even grinding their teeth, and some were staring at lower part of his body\u2019s back. Seeing this Ren Tianyou suddenly felt a chill, and his chrysanthemum also tighten.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, I believe tomorrow\u2019s headline of the academy will be you. At that time you will definitely become very famous in this academy.\u201d Sun Chuqian covered her mouth and charmingly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I see your injuries are already healed, Chuqian, actually you have the strength to laugh at me.\u201d Hearing the teasing voice of Sun Chuqian, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. After the light system healing magic of schoolmate Li Shui, my injuries are already healed. Now only few days of rest is enough for a full recovery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Ren Tianyou was about to say something, suddenly he sensed the movement from Li Xinyun in his embrace. Ren Tianyou immediately turned his head to look, and saw that Li Xinyun slowly opened her beautiful eyes. Then she looked around with confusion, trying to understand where she was. At the final moment of her memory, she saw the body of Ren Tianyou suddenly released an intense light, so she had no choice but to close her two eyes, then she sensed her powerful energy barrier was suddenly broken in an instant, after that she felt a pain in her nape. After that she didn\u2019t know anything at all.</p><br/><p>Opening her eyes, Li Xinyun looked all around her, and suddenly discovered something unusual with her body. After careful examination, suddenly she found that she was lying on the embrace of Ren Tianyou. And all those peoples around were looking at her with a peculiar expression on their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Li Xinyun immediately screamed, and struggled free from the embrace of Ren Tianyou. In a flash the color of her face became red through and through, don\u2019t know whether that was from being angry or shy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou rogue, drop dead.\u201d Li Xinyun yelled in her charming voice, then waved her hand and slapped the face of Ren Tianyou. \u2018Pa\u2019 clear and melodious sound of slap in the face rang out, the finger print of 5 fingers appeared on the face of Ren Tianyou. After slapping Ren Tianyou, she immediately ran outside the square, leaving behind the stunned Ren Tianyou.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

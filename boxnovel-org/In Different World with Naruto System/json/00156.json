Say it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Lord, Ximen Tianlong who was expelled from Ximen clan 3 years ago, is leading a mysterious organization called Akatsuki to attack Soaring dragon mountain villa which is located outside the city. And after I came out from the villa, I saw that they used a huge barrier to completely surround the villa. My Lord, I have returned to notify this news. I hope My Lord would arrange experts to go to reinforce them as soon as possible.\u201d This middle-aged man was the person who had returned from the villa to notify the Ximen clan under the order of Ximen Batian. And after getting this order, he had anxiously rushed all the way to the city. Now the person before him was the previous Patriarch of Ximen clan, i.e. father of Ximen Batian, Ximen Kuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, you can leave now.\u201d Ximen Kuang waved his hand and signaled that middle-aged man to leave. After getting the command from Ximen Kuang, this middle-aged person slowly bowed and left. After this middle-aged man left, Ximen Kuang started to ponder for a moment, the walked towards the rear of the hall. After reaching the rear wall of the hall, he stretched his hand, caught the small magic lamp\u2019s lampstand, and twisted it. Then the \u2018ka ka\u2019 sound of gear moving rang out in this hall, and the floor in the hall cracked open revealing a tunnel entrance, and there was a huge staircase leading underground in this tunnel. Ximen Kuang walked down this staircase, and after his body completely entered this tunnel, the slab stone slowly combined harmoniously with crack on the floor and closed this tunnel entrance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Outside Soaring dragon mountain villa, the lights unceasingly flashed in the sky, and many experts who were emitting powerful aura appeared there. All of them were drawn by this huge barrier which had completely surrounded the whole Soaring dragon mountain villa.</p><br/><p>Inside the villa, Ren Tianyou and his group were looking at the groups of people of Ximen clan who were standing at the hall. Beside them, there were more than 10 others experts who had stayed behind to help. And along the road behind them, numerous corpse laid on the ground, and the blood was still flowing out from these corpses, dying the floor completely red. Those corpses were the dead bodies of the guards of Ximen clan who had tried to obstruct Ren Tianyou form taking is revenge under the command of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>Staring at Ximen Batian furthermore the groups of peoples of Ximen clan in front of him with his eyes which was flashing with fierce and malicious intent, Ren Rianyou showed a ruthless smile. After his soul had fused with the soul of Ximen Tianlong, Ren Tianyou himself had also possessed the hatred of Ximen Tianlong towards Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>Hated them because they had bullied and humiliated him in his childhood, hated them because they caused his mother to starve to death, hated them because they had never seen him as a human, hated them\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. This kinds of many hatred had already seeped into his bone marrow, and now seeing the target of his hatred in front of his own eyes, the eyes of Ren Tianyou unconsciously changed into Mangekyo Sharingan, and this blood colored pupils which was full of evil intent firmly stared at them. And when he saw the faces of these peoples, his killing intent gradually increased, but when he saw a single person among the crowd of Ximen clan, his gaze not only paused, but a complicated emotion flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>This person was the only one in whole Ximen clan who showed consideration to Ximen Tianlong, Ximen Yue\u2019er. It could be said that if Ximen Yue\u2019er had not protected Ximen Tianlong, then it was almost impossible for Ximen Tianlong to be able to survive. Although Wang Yuxin had helped him very much, nevertheless when all is said and done just like the distant water couldn\u2019t quench his thirst, she was from Wang clan, so it was impossible for her frequently visit him.</p><br/><p>As a result, after seeing Ximen Yue\u2019er, the state of Ren Tianyou\u2019s mind was very complex. Because no matter what type of felling he had for Ximen Yue\u2019er, from the time he had invaded and destroyed this wedding ceremony, he was already the mortal enemy of Ximen clan. And she as a core junior of Ximen clan, also should took her arms against Ren Tianyou. But at that time, Ren Tianyou would definitely try not to injure her as much as possible, because regardless of anything, he had already determined inside his mind to not hurt this gentle girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, return my Yuxin, you damn concubine\u2019s seed.\u201d Ximen Feng hideously started at Ren Tianyou and howled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, my dear elder brother, aren\u2019t you a little bit too na\u00efve?\u201d Looking at Ximen Feng who had gone mad, Ren Tianyou sneered with disdain. Then said to White Tiger and others, \u201cAll of you don\u2019t make any move, I will personally kill all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Zero, these peoples are powerful experts. And among them, there are 5 god ranked experts, so can you deal with all of them by yourself?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger anxiously roared. In this hall, including Ximen Batian, there were 5 god ranked experts, and each of them possessed Saint Dragon blood lineage, so their strength were extremely terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Zero, we should fight together.\u201d Vermilion Bird also appealed to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I alone is more than enough. You all just defend the surrounding of this courtyard, and in case anyone dares to flee, kill them on the spot.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou directly stepped forwards without giving White Tiger and others a chance to refute. Step by step he walked towards the peoples of Ximen clan who were standing at the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spread out, each person defend a wall.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had already started to move, White Tiger tuned around and said to Void and Vermilion Bird. Then he directly fell back and, sat cross-legged next to west wall while holding his rapier, and attentively watch the battle that was about to unfold. Void and Vermilion Bird also fell back and arrived next to the respective walls, and attentively looked towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou who was unhurriedly walking towards them, Ximen Batian said to the crowd of peoples of Ximen clan, \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in this battle, we will settle them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ximen Batian and 4 clan elder flashed and appeared opposite to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill.\u201d Ximen Batian roared loudly, then a powerful gold colored Saint dragon battle qi appeared and surrounded his body. After that the huge sword in his right hand flashed with fierce radiances. As a patriarch of Ximen clan, his battle qi had already reached intermediate God rank.</p><br/><p>And among the 4 middle aged person by his side, 2 of them were early stage of God rank, one was middle stage of god rank, and final one was later stage of god rank, all of them were powerful expert of God rank. The aura of these 5 experts locked on to Ren Tianyou. After hearing the order of Ximen Batian, all of them rushed towards Ren Tianyou to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Seeing 5 people flying towards him, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then he quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cFuton\u2014-Shinkugyoku! (Wind Style\u2014-Vacuum Bullets!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took a deep breath, then he suddenly spat out numerous small sharp air column from his mouth towards incoming five.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Clever, very clever, but too na\u00efve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then under the control of Ren Tianyou, Susanoo brandish Futsu no Mitama Sword. After that glimmering huge lightning light immediately divide into four huge sword blades, which advanced towards the sea surface underneath.</p><br/><p>After these four huge sword blade made contact with sea surface, they rapidly divide and disperse the sea surface, and sunk towards the bottom of the sea, leaving behind a huge cross shaped gully on its way, which didn\u2019t close up for a long time as the seawaters around were blocked by its powerful strength.</p><br/><p>But, although the sea was directly split open, and Ren Tianyou could clearly see the circumstance at the bottom of the sea, nevertheless he didn\u2019t discover even a trace of Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, hiding really deep in the water means I can\u2019t find you for the time being, but this Dragon Island will suffer the disaster. Without you, I want to see who will be able to block my attack.\u201d Although Ren Tianyou was not able to find him, but he had a way to force him out. If he changed his target to Dragon Island, then Dragon Emperor would not be able to remain hiding.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after Ren Tianyou had just spoken, more than ten huge waterspout suddenly appeared in the sea surface all around which advanced towards Susanoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Seeing these waterspouts, Ren Tianyou snorted, then Susanoo brandish huge Futsu no Mitama Sword, sending out a huge circular sword slash, which completely destroyed huge waterspouts around him.</p><br/><p>And just at this time, suddenly Dragon Emperor\u2019s muffled voice came from the bottom of the sea, but Ren Tianyou was unable to understand this incantation. And along with this incantation, that falling seawater suddenly stopped in midair, then slowly separate and dispersed, changing into four huge water screen in midair. And just at this time, from the sea underneath, suddenly four huge azure colored energy wave fly out and entered into this water screen. After this energy entered into water screen, suddenly a gleaming light circulated above these water screen, creating an indistinctly visible azure colored runes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred sea domain\u3002 Azure circulate\u3002Gleaming light domain change\u3002 Heavenly Ocean Current Seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Dragon Emperor, the water screen around suddenly condensed into huge barrier, trapping Ren Tianyou\u2019s huge Susanoo inside it. And above each of the water screen, a single huge word \u2018seal\u2019 appeared.</p><br/><p>And after the barrier was successfully erected, suddenly huge ripple appeared in the far-off sea surface. Then along with \u2018peng\u2019 sound, Dragon Emperor\u2019s that huge dragon body flew out from inside seawater.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally willing come out? Did you spent mental and physical effort only to create this thing? It seems to be something, but\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Saying this, with his thought, Susanoo brandished huge Futsu no Mitama Sword directly towards the barrier in front of him, \u201cDon\u2019t know whether this barrier can withstand my Futsu no Mitama or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Dragon Emperor merely sneered looking at Ren Tianyou\u2019s movement without trying to stop. After Futsu no Mitama Sword directly hit the barrier in front, the matter that surprised Ren Tianyou occurred.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou merely felt as if his Futsu no Mitama Sword was cutting a piece of soft thing. Just like sponge, when Futsu no Mitama cut it, that huge water screen immediately deformed rapidly. And the softness of water screen nevertheless withstood Futsu no Mitama\u2019s hard cutting edge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026..?\u201d Seeing this scene, Ren Tianyou was surprised as he thought, \u201cThis big lizard is quite intelligent. Actually thinking of using softness to conquer strength and stopping the cutting edge of my Futsu no Mitama.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Futsu no Mitama was withdrawn, this water screen rapidly revert back with dim radiance. After that sizing up this barrier with his Sharingan, he thought, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, all the energy of this barrier is shared all around. If attacked one side, then other three side\u2019s strength will assemble together to withstand. Moreover those four azure energy wave from underneath ought to be this barrier\u2019s energy source.\u201d</p><br/><p>And when Ren Tianyou was carefully observing this barrier\u2019s structure, Dragon Emperor was also making his move. This moment, Dragon Emperor was using his those hard-earned valuable Power of Law. He spent entire 10 drops of Power of Law at once. After going through this battle, now Dragon Emperor only had twenty or so drops left, this already made him very distressed endlessly, but he still use 10 of them, this shows his deep hatred towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly Law\u2014-Holy Solidity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the yell of Dragon Emperor, suddenly countless thick and strong golden colored light beam appeared all around the sky. All of these golden light stuck into this water screen horizontally and vertically, forming a huge prison with Ren Tianyou trapped inside it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, although this move of yours is very powerful, and I also admit that if you went all out, then I am powerless to stop you, but this sea give me a chance, chance to trap you.\u201d Looking at trapped Ren Tianyou, Dragon Emperor relaxed, and slowly spoke, \u201cI believe the consumption of this move of yours is definitely very large. So after your energy is completely exhausted, what means will you use to contend against me? With the water of four seas as the energy source, this Heavenly Ocean Current Seal of mine is basically unlikely to dry up any time soon. And as for this holy prison, I sacrificed a total of ten drops of Power of Law to create it. So if you want to persist in, then my holy prison can persist for three days and two nights without any problem, but can you persist that long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover the most important point is that you also can\u2019t use that strange space magic to escape from there. Because inside this prison created with Holy Solidity, all the elements except holy element are eliminated, your space magic will lose efficacy inside there, as a result you can just wait to die.\u201d After saying this much, Dragon Emperor as if victory was already within his grasp, had a complacent expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean you are definitely going to win?\u201d When Dragon Emperor finished speaking, Ren Tianyou\u2019s that indifferent voice resounded. Then indifferently looking at Dragon Emperor, as if he didn\u2019t sense a slightest bit of plight, he continued, \u201cI can only say you have spoken incorrectly just now. First: I never intend to use space magic to escape. Second: Do you really think you can stop me with this kind of means?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday I will let you know the real strength of Full Body Susanoo.\u201d Finished speaking, under the command of Ren Tianyou, Susanoo raised Futsu no Mitama in his right hand which was covered with purple ash colored lightning, and rays of lights began to gradually appear in its left hand too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But the complexion of Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t change, just exerting force in his right leg, his body directly changed into a blur and disappeared from that location.</p><br/><p>Along with the \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, a terrifying explosion wind and waves spread in all direction. When the smoke and dusts dissipated, one could see huge crack on the ground of this square which spread all around just like a spider web. And Baluoda holding two huge battle-ax was standing at the side of this crack, and as for those five High God realm experts, they were directly rushing towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Teshi Sendan! (Digital Shrapnel!)\u201d Looking at those five experts rushing towards him, Ren Tianyou extended his two hands, then along with \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026continuous sound, ten tiny sharp finger bones shot towards them.</p><br/><p>These five people had no choice but to stop and set up a firm barrier in front of their body to block those sharp finger bones of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, well, well! Didn\u2019t expect I Baluoda had underestimated you. Today I will use your blood to wash off the soul of these excellent soldiers you have killed. Tiger Roar Sky Tyrant Axe!\u201d Baluoda roared, then swinging his right hand, huge black tiger axe slash shot out from the huge battle-ax of Baluoda\u2019s right hand towards Ren Tianyou along with tiger roar sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing the huge axe slash flying towards him at high speed, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly, then waving his right arm, countless tough and tensile bones stuck out from his arm which changed into a huge bone shield in front of him. After that along with \u2018dang\u2019 loud metal colliding sound, under the assault of that huge black tiger axe slash, Ren Tianyou slide several meters backward, but fortunately the bone shield was not broken through, firmly blocking this attack of Baluoda.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I have really looked down upon the power of Shikotsumyaku before, never though these bones were tough and tensile enough to block an attack of True God realm expert.\u201d Looking at the huge bone shield on his right arm, Ren Tianyou thought inwardly.</p><br/><p>And after Ren Tianyou had blocked the attack, Baluoda and those five High God realm experts had already surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, now you can\u2019t run away. The Forbidden Sky Magic Formation within this Bloody Cloud City is already activated, so from now on all the experts who are yet to step into God Lord realm are powerless to fly in the sky within this city. This time you are screwed.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou in the middle of their encirclement, Baluoda sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCannot fly\u2026\u2026\u201d After hearing Baluoda, Ren Tianyou immediately become happy, then looking at Baluoda and other around him, he said, \u201cSince we cannot fly, then all of you prepare to accept death penalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou half squatted down, and placed the palm of both hands on the ground of the square, then circulating the chakra within his body, he yelled, \u201cPulsate, Sawarabi no Mai! (Bracken Dance!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, suddenly \u2018ka ka\u2019 sound of cracking transmitted outward from inside the ground, then countless sharp bones suddenly broke out from the ground. Moreover the number of these sharp bones were unexpectedly still spreading towards all direction rapidly.</p><br/><p>Sawarabi no Mai (Bracken Dance) was the final dance among the five \u2018dance\u2019 of Kimimaro\u2019s Shikotsumyaku. At that time Kimimaro required the aid of the power of Orochimaru\u2019s cursed mark because of his insufficient strength, and under the second state of this cursed mark, he was able to use this move, but with the current level of Ren Tianyou\u2019s strength, he could easily use this move.</p><br/><p>Although the might of this move was powerful, but Ren Tianyou had never intend to use this move, because this move was basically not effective against the experts of Saint rank and above. Because although this move could cause countless sharp bones to stick out from the ground around him, but Saint rank and above experts could easily fly in the sky to dodge this, so how could this move injure them?</p><br/><p>But what Ren Tianyou had never expected was, this Baluoda had unexpectedly activated the Forbidden Sky Magic Formation to prevent him from escaping through the air. One might well say this was harming themselves.</p><br/><p>When Sawarabi no Mai (Bracken Dance) stopped, all those ordinary demon soldiers around him had already died under this move. And among those five High God realm experts, two of them had died and remaining three were also stabbed but luckily escaped with their life intact. And as for Baluoda, at the critical moment, he had used absolute strength to break out from those sharp bones forest, escaping the danger.</p><br/><p>With the tragedy around him, Ren Tianyou no longer stayed there, his body directly changed into a blur and rushed towards that space transfer gate on the high platform. And after entering inside that space transfer gate, his body disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, that bastard, you three follow me to chase after him!\u201d Seeing the disappearance of Ren Tianyou inside the transfer gate, Baluoda angrily roared, then calling those three High God realm experts who had survived, he prepared to enter inside the space transfer gate and chase after Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, suddenly a purple colored radiance appeared in front of everyone. Along with the dissipation of this radiance, the right leg of Yaorao stepped on the sharp bone of Ren Tianyou, blocking the path of Baluoda and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of Yaorao, Baluoda suddenly exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me!\u201d Looking at the sorry figure of Baluoda and others, Yaorao covered her mouth and slightly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what matter you have to block my way, I want to hunt down that villain of just now to take revenge.\u201d Baluoda respectfully said. As a matter of fact, he truly was unclear about the identity of Yaorao in front of him, but he know that he must not provoke her. If he made her unhappy, then he will definitely die without a place for burial. This was something leaders of all the big forces within Bloody Cloud City knew after Yaorao came into this Bloody Cloud City for no apparent reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you all to stop pursuing him.\u201d Yaorao slowly said her purpose in coming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are, relying on your\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing the words of Yaorao, one of the three High God realm experts who had survive by fluke stepped forward and said towards Yaorao in disdain. But before he could finish speaking, suddenly purple colored radiance appeared around his body, making him unable to move even a bit.</p><br/><p>Then before the alarmed and panicky gaze of everyone, the body of this High God realm expert as if melting changed into pieces of meat slice and fell down from his body. Within 5 minutes, originally living expert had already changed into a skeleton.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy words are orders, from today onwards, you all are not allowed to pursue or attack Uchiha Tianyou. The fate of all the violators will be same as him.\u201d Looking at the frightened look in the eyes of everyone on the scene, Yaorao slowly said in a stern voice. Finished speaking, her body changed into a purple colored radiance and disappeared inside the space transfer gate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

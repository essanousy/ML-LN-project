This person looked at the sign of Lan Diyin auction house, then without stopping he directly walked over to the gate of auction house.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, please show your entrance ticket.\u201d At the gate, he was stopped by staff who was responsible to check the entrance tickets. Then the staff held out his hand towards mysterious masked man for ticket.</p><br/><p>This mysterious masked man didn\u2019t utter a sound or a word, just took out a card and hand it over with his gloved right hand. Even though the staff was quite curious, but fortunately he had been working in auction house for a long period of time, and he had seen all kinds of person wearing strange dresses, as a result he was not too surprised. After taking the entrance ticket of this person, he swiped that ticket on the groove of the gate, and then the magic stone of the groove flashed with a red light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your entrance ticket, welcome to Lan Diyin auction house. Please come in.\u201d Seeing that there was not any problem with the ticket, the staff returned the ticket, then stretched his right hand and invited him to enter.</p><br/><p>This mysterious masked person took back his entrance ticket, and without looking back, he disappeared inside the gate.</p><br/><p>This mysterious masked person was without doubt Ren Tianyou, he was wearing the dress of Akatsuki group of Naruto world, and had also worn the mask of Tobi which Tobi had put on after he had got Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou knew that the crucial point to activate his mission system was the \u2018Power of god crystal\u2019 of this auction, he had already made his preparation at an earlier time. And to guard against the unexpected, he had forced himself to not use any of his ninjutsu and doujutsu in the competition of the academy. And he had also refused the invitation from Lan Yan for this time auction, and used this dress which was only known to himself to conceal his identity to come here. And also in case his identity was leaked, he didn\u2019t want to involve them, so he had act on this alone. He was alone, and even if his identity was exposed, he could just run away, who was capable enough to stop him. And this Divine Wind continent was very big, and how could there not be any place to shelter him.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, for the matter of this robbing, Ren Tianyou still had conflicting views inside his heart. After all these peoples and he himself didn\u2019t had any enmity or hatred, so he was anxious to rob that thing from them. Nevertheless he was powerless in this matter, after all he didn\u2019t have enough gold coin in his body to buy this thing fairly. He had 600,000 gold coins which looked pretty much, but if seriously calculate, he estimated that he couldn\u2019t even buy the scrap of \u2018Power of god crystal\u2019. And also he must complete this mission, because if he fail this mission, the penalty was too serious. And Ren Tianyou could not bear this penalty, and he didn\u2019t dare to let the mission system close forever, as without this he would lack different ways to earn system points.</p><br/><p>Walking for almost 3 minutes through a long corridor, he finally saw the exit in front of him. Arriving at the exit, a huge auction room appeared in front of him. Carefully sizing up this huge auction room, he discovered that this auction house actually covered more than 1000 meter. Before him he saw a great numbers of seats, and straight ahead there was a huge auction platform with a huge red colored cloth behind it, in the auction room. And around the auction room, there were many private rooms too. And in the midst of auction room, many peoples were already sitting on the seat, and chatting with their peers.</p><br/><p>Just then, an attending female came next to Ren Tianyou, then respectfully said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cHello mister, May I ask what your seat number is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBox no. 33.\u201d Ren Tianyou replied using a hoarse voice, then handed his entrance ticket to her.</p><br/><p>That female attendant respectfully took the entrance ticket, look at it, and discovered it was indeed box no. 33, then she returned back the entrance ticket. After that she said, \u201cMister, please follow me, I\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou followed that female attendant all the way towards the right side of auction room, then climb the stairs, and arrived at the floor containing the private room. Then that female attendant stopped in front of the door with a number plate 33, after that she took out a magic card and swipe it on the groove of that door. Then along with a \u2018ding\u2019 sound, that door suddenly opened automatically.</p><br/><p>Entering into the box, a private room of about 50 square meter appeared in front of his eyes, and a huge magic lamp was dangling from the roof. This magic lamp was releasing a soft white light illuminating the entire box.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou sat on the huge magical beasts hide chair, and his buttocks immediately felt soft sensation, this may be comparable with the sofa on the Earth. And on the nearby table, there were several plates of delicious fruits, and at left hand side, there was a device with quoted price.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask if you need anything, Mister?\u201d That young girl respectfully asked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, you may withdraw.\u201d Ren Tianyou waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. If you need anything, you can press that red button on the wall, then we will come over to serve you.\u201d After finishing speaking, that beautiful maid leave the box, then closed the door.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked at the device with quoted price, just looking it for a short time, he grasped the usage of this device with quoted price. Blue colored button was to increase the price by 1000 Gold coins, green was to increase the price by 10,000, and red was to increase the price by 100,000. Next to these button, there were button with 1, 2, 3, 4\u2026\u2026\u2026 These few digits represents to increase the price to the digits times the current amount.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the chair while holding the plate with fruits and eating it, Ren Tianyou was boringly waiting for the auction to start. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that the family of Lan Yan was actually this wealthy, if nothing else, only the amount of people attending this auction is enormous. Fortunately I asked him to left one box open, or else I would also be like those people who are squeezing at the outside seats.\u201d Looking at those crowd of squeezed sweating peoples, Ren Tianyou rejoiced regarding his decision.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou boringly looked outside the box around the auction house, then suddenly he saw several familiar figure in the number 07 box.</p><br/><p>\u201cMember of Ximen clan.\u201d Looking at those several person wearing a cloth embodied with huge dragon design, hidden behind the mask, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but to expose a cruel smile. \u201cHe he, Very good, didn\u2019t expect you also actually came here, this way without much extra effort dispose you all altogether. I will treat it as a little bit of interest for the original host of this body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it would be best if you get the \u2018Power of crystal\u2019 too, this way I won\u2019t have much sense of criminal guilt. If you all were be my opponent, it\u2019s unlikely for me to be soft-hearted\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And originally almost dried-up chakra of Ren Tianyou instantly replenished.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow there is no other ways left to replenish my chakra, so I should be end this fight as soon as possible.\u201d Sensing that his almost exhausted chakra was successfully replenished, Ren Tianoyu thought inside his heart.</p><br/><p>This chakra replenish method was used by Naruto in the Naruto world when he was fighting against Pein. Ren Tianyou had also created a single shadow clone prior to this battle, and let him wait and gather the chakra at a safe secret location, then Ren Tianyou used Gyaku Kuchiyose no Jutsu (Reverse Summoning Jutsu) to summon it and release this shadow clone, and chakra gathered by that shadow clone was naturally transferred to him replenishing his exhausted chakra.</p><br/><p>As Ren Tianyou had not yet reach the level of Naruto, so he was unable to gather strong power of Sage mode, and also he could only leave single shadow clone to gather Chakra. So now he had no other way to replenish his chakra, as a result he must end this fight now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu..!\u201d Ren Tianyou secretly breathe in, then quickly dashed towards Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo. And simultaneously he quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cKaton\u2014 Ryuka no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014Dragon Flame Jutsu!)\u201d Ren Tianyou right hand was near his mouth, then he spit out a huge dragon shaped flame from his mouth directly towards Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu.</p><br/><p>Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu simultaneously jumped out from the stone pillar and successfully dodge the attack, and the Dragon Flame Jutsu of Ren Tianyou instantly hit those stone pillars successfully destroying it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater magic arts\u2014\u2014-Surging waves!\u201d Ximen Xinbo flew in the sky, and instantly complete the preparation of strong water system magic spell, immediately after that countless water system elements gathered quickly, and a huge water waves appeared from the ground and flooded towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou immediately dodged this attack by jumping towards the sky, but at this time suddenly a gold colored light beam appeared in front of Ren Tianyou. Then that light beam disappeared and Ximen Shu appeared in that place, and waved his huge dragon sword which was covered with gold colored radiances towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a hike.\u201d Ximen Shu roared, as he slashed his huge sword towards Ren Tianyou using his both hands. From the earlier time he had waited for this opportunity, so this one attack naturally contain his full power.</p><br/><p>Hidden underneath the mask, Ren Tianyou was quite calm even after seeing this formidable surprise attack of Ximen Shu advancing towards him. And a powerful eye power suddenly gushed out from both of his Mangekyo Sharingan, and outside the body of Ren Tianyou, suddenly appeared a purplish red colored energy layer completely surrounding his body, and this energy quickly formed a skeleton shape. And the attack of Ximen Shu hit this skeleton, and immediately gave out a metal colliding sound, then Ximen Shu felt a powerful vibrating rebound on his hands, and then he was sent flying backwards due to rebound this rebound force. [T.L: YEAH!!!! Finally SUSANOOOOOOO]</p><br/><p>Falling back on the ground, Ximen Shu retreated several steps backwards to stabilize himself from this vibrating rebound force. After stabilizing himself with great difficulty, he raised his head, and looking in front of him, a fear appeared in his face, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the ground, Ren Tianyou was completely surrounded by skeleton from head to toe, and his whole body was releasing a powerful evil aura. Shortly afterwards the purplish red colored energy surrounding Ren Tianyou suddenly rose sharply, and continuously gathered a huge amount of energy, then along with the \u2018kacha kacha\u2019 sound, a half body huge skeleton which was several meter high appeared around Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Afterwards at this skeleton, suddenly countless dense energy thread appeared, and these energy thread surrounded the entire skeleton. After that this skeleton was covered with huge red colored flame armor which was releasing fire. There was a sharp huge horn at the head of this giant, and a huge helmet covered its head. And two light suddenly flashed at the location of eyes. In the right hand of this giant, it held a huge bottle gourd, and in left hand, it held a huge smooth mirror shield. Along with the awakening of this giant, it raised its head towards the sky, and released a loud roar towards the heaven.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumm!\u201d</p><br/><p>A huge energy fluctuation spread towards all direction in a high speed with this giant as a center. And the grounds around it as if crushed by the roller scattered into a small pieces.</p><br/><p>This was the ultimate doujutsu of both eyes of Ren Tianyou eyes\u2014\u2014\u2013Susanoo! The appearance of Susanoo was like this because, Ren Tianyou had chosen the Mangekyo Sharingan of Uchaha Itachi, and this had great affected on the appearance of the Susanoo of Ren Tainyou.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou felt huge amount of power around him, although this power far surpass Ren Tianyou\u2019s own power, nevertheless he was capable of completely controlling all these powers. He felt that he could perfectly wield every bits of the power of this Susanoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the power of Susanoo?\u201d Feeling that the power was continuously pouring out from his eyes, Ren Tianyou lifted up his right hand and talked to himself. \u201cThis power really is fascinating, but\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Looking at the continuously decreasing value of blindness, this clearly reminded him the side effect of using Susanoo. \u201cI should resolve this fight as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou raised his right hand, and he saw that the right hand of his Susanoo also followed the movement of his right hand and lifted its right hand. Shortly afterwards a huge flame light sword blade appeared form inside the bottle gourd in its right hand. This was the first magic weapon of Uchiha Itachi\u2019s Susanoo, Totsuka no Tsurugi. (Totsuka Blade)</p><br/><p>Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade), also known as Sakegari no Tachi (Sakegari Longsword), was actually not physical, metallic form magic weapon, it was ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade capable of sucking the target it pierces inside the bottle gourd that Susanoo carries and seals it for eternity in a genjutsu world.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou slowly walked towards the direction of Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo. Looking at that incomparably huge energy giant, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo felt incomparable huge amount of pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one, what the hell is that?\u201d Ximen Xinbo said towards Ximen Shu with an agonized face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know, I have never seen such thing before.\u201d Ximen Shu shook his head and he also had a bitter expression on his face. \u201cNumber two, you must be careful, you should have also seen the defense power of this guy just a moment ago, I was actually sent flying backwards with just a rebound. And according to the build of this guy\u2019s body, his attack power is also absolutely not weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are powerless to fight him head on, we should wait for Diaixinao and Adelaide, and after that it would be easy to handle him.\u201d Ximen Xinbo said helplessly, now they could only stall for some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, first let\u2019s hold the steps of this guy.\u201d Ximen Shu answered, then he directly rushed towards Ren Tianyou at full speed.</p><br/><p>Looking at incoming Ximen Shu, disdain flashed in the eyes of Ren Tainyou, then he waved his raised right hands and following his movement, Susanoo also waved its right hand which was holding the Totsuka no Tsurugi (Totsuka Blade). Shortly afterwards a huge fiery red colored sword blade advance towards Ximen Shu while slashing the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing the attack of huge sword blade, the body of Ximen Shu flashed, and successfully dodged the attack, and then he quickly gathered gold colored battle qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWar dragon\u2014\u2014\u2013Ascend to heaven chop!\u201d</p><br/><p>A huge sword blade of light along with a huge golden windstorm advanced towards Ren Tianyou. But he just raised the left arm of Susanoo, then the shield equipped at left hand of Susanoo flashed with light, after that the attack of Ximen Shu hit this shield and disappeared without any effect.</p><br/><p>This was the second magic weapon of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, Yata no Kagami (Yata Mirror). This magic weapon could defend any attack, which include soul attack, physical attack, and every other kind of attacks including ninjutsu attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute Zero!\u201d At this time, the voice of Ximen Xinbo came from behind, then incomparable cold wind blew towards Susanoo, shortly afterwards those innumerable ice elements quickly condensed, and a layers of ice quickly appeared on the body of Susanoo, then the Susanoo was thoroughly frozen solid, and was turned into a huge ice sculpture.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it successful?\u201d Looking at the frozen solid Susanoo, simultaneously a same thought flashed in the mind of Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu, but the next scene thoroughly broke their hope.</p><br/><p>They saw the ice layer of frozen solid Susanoo suddenly started to disintegrate with \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound. Then due to the huge energy fluctuation from Susanoo\u2019s body, the layer of ice thoroughly disappeared instantly from its body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

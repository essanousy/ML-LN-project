And along with the dissipation of that purple colored radiance, the figure of Yaorao appeared in that place.</p><br/><p>Looking at the disappearing back view of Ren Tianyou, Yaorao revealed a mysterious smile. Shortly afterward, she also flew towards the direction where Ren Tianyou had disappeared.</p><br/><p>In a cave of a small mountain, Ren Tianyou sat cross-legged inside that cave, slowly recovering the chakra within his body.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Ren Tianyou slowly opened his eyes, but he didn\u2019t stand up rather fell into a deep thought, unceasingly recalling the scene of Labake\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>At that time, after he said that he would not kill Labake, his Teshi Sendan (Digital Shrapnel)\u2019s finger bone which had fallen beside the body of Labake suddenly flew, and before everyone including Ren Tianyou was able to react, it had directly stabbed through the space between the eyes of Labake, instantly taking his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely obvious that someone is trying to frame me.\u201d Recalling the strange scene of that time, Ren Tianyou thought inwardly with certainty, \u201cThe main problem is, it has been only a short period of time since I entered Demon World, so there is basically no one here that have enmity towards me, furthermore my current identity is something I made up, so it is also impossible for someone who is called Uchiha Tianyou of Bone Demon clan to exist beforehand in Demon World. Moreover even if there is such a person, the possibility of the enemy of such person staying in Bloody Cloud City is far too small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou definitely didn\u2019t believe in these possibility, as one might well say that the probability of this was happening was lower than purchasing the winning lottery ticket of 5 million.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd within Bloody Cloud City, I had come into contact with solely Yaorao of that pub, but I had done nothing injustice to her, and we don\u2019t have any enmity, so it is very unlikely for her to frame me. Moreover even if she had hidden her strength, but it is not possible for her to be able to frame me by deceiving my eyes.\u201d Think this, Ren Tianyou recalled that mysterious woman filled with charm inside the pub, but he didn\u2019t believe that she had framed him. But what Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know was, this time his deduction nevertheless was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover at that time I didn\u2019t notice anything unusual, although I had not opened Sharingan, still my eyesight was still there, so to be able to deceive my eyes and instantly control my finger bone to attack, this person is definitely a powerful expert.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but sighed. He had never expected that just when he was intending to make a move, he attracted the attention of hidden expert without any rhyme or a reason.</p><br/><p>In any case, now there was only two possibility, first was the hidden enemy of Labake borrowed his hand to kill him, shifting the blame onto him. Looking at the behavior of Labake, this possibility was very likely.</p><br/><p>Second was just like Labake, because of Yaorao. But this person was clever, so with the help of the death of Labake, he was trying to eliminate him.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, counter soldiers with arms, water with an earth weir, since I cannot stay here in Demon World for a long period of time, when I finish my plan, I will immediately leave this place, then prepare the plan for the invasion of Demon clan.\u201d Ren Tianyou patted off the dusts and stood up, then sighing, he left that place.</p><br/><p>Now he had officially crossed one domain among eight domain and enter into Baleful Blood Realm among three Realms. And this Baleful Blood Realm\u2019s leader was one of the three Great Demon God, Blood Prison Demon God\u2014-Bulada, was extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>The strength of this Bulada was at least comparable or more than the strength of Heaven Sealing Demon God\u2014Amike whom Ren Tianyou had encountered in the ninth floor of Tower of Babel.</p><br/><p>Primarily, because Amike was sealed within the ninth floor of Tower of Babel for a long period of nearly 30,000 years, his strength was greatly whittled away due to the divine power of Tower of Babel, so when Ren Tianyou encountered Amike, his strength was not at his peak state.</p><br/><p>But although the strength of this Bulada was strong, but Ren Tianyou had no relation to that, because his goal was Demon Metropolis\u2014-Demon Emperor\u2019s City. Only after entering the Demon Emperor\u2019s City, he would begin to take action.</p><br/><p>But now there was nearly one month of time left before the opening of Demon Metropolis, and before then Demon Metropolis would absolutely not open. So Ren Tianyou decided to stay here for one month of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore then I should not go to the town in order to avoid side issues that might arise. I will go there only at the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou flew towards the distant sky. After flying for nearly three hours, Ren Tianyou suddenly discovered a huge abyss in the distant, and this abyss was emitting a chilling black colored aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Seeing that abyss far away, the eyes of Ren Tianyou revealed a solemn expression, because that black colored aura being emitted by that abyss gave him a chilling feeling.</p><br/><p>If the people of Demon clan saw this abyss, then they would absolutely be so frightened that they would urinate in their pants, then they would immediately run away madly without turning back, because this was the one of the forbidden ground for entire Demon clan\u2014-Endless Abyss.</p><br/><p>In this Endless Abyss resides a terrifying existence. Even Demon Emperor of Demon clan had no way to capture this existence. Once this fellow came out from Endless Abyss, and the consequence of that was, the neighborhood\u2019s surroundings of 1000 li changed into ruins, finally Demon Emperor lead three Great Demon God of Demon clan and thirteen Demon Generals, then all of them acting together, they finally forced it to retreat back to Endless Abyss. After that they used the Universe Boundary Divine Artifact of Demon clan and combined the power of everyone to set up a powerful seal around this Endless Abyss, making it impossible for this fellow to leave the radius of 3 li around the Endless Abyss.</p><br/><p>Although they sealed this fellow, but they however were powerless to really injure that fellow, furthermore in the battle against this fellow last time, Demon Emperor had greatly damaged his vitality, one might say the price was heavy.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou was completely unaware of this matter, so he curiously flew towards this abyss. When he arrived within the 3 li range of Endless Abyss, suddenly powerful purple colored seal blocked his path, making him powerless to move forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026? Seal?\u201d Seeing the barrier in front of him, Ren Tianyou was surprised. Shortly afterwards along with the appearance of Sharingan, and launching the kamui of right eye, he immediately pass through this barrier entering inside the seal.</p><br/><p>And just after Ren Tianyou had entered into the barrier, a terrifying roar resounded from inside the abyss, and huge sound waves transmitted outwards from inside. Ren Tianyou was unable to bear hearing this sound, so he covered his two ears.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

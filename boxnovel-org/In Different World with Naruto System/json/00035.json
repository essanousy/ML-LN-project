Even now, my body is still hurting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to take advantage of me? Do you think I\u2019m that cheap? I think it was still too light of a punishment.\u201d Luo Meng Wu said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you still used me as your shield/excuse, how can you forget about this!\u201d Ren Tian You immediately argued back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is it? Why can\u2019t I remember? When did that happen ah?\u201d Luo Meng Wu said with uncertain look in her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..you are something.\u201d Ren Tian You said while grinding his teeth. \u2018Honestly our forefathers didn\u2019t deceived me, \u2018women are very difficult to deal with\u2019, and this phrase is also applied here ah, f**k!\u2019 Ren Tian You cursed inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tian You, why did Lan Yin suddenly leave at that moment? I clearly know that he is a type of person who never gives up so easily.\u201d Luo Meng Wu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I just merely created an illusion and told him something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is secret, I cannot say.\u201d Ren Tian shook his head.</p><br/><p>After that they walked silently and reached the dormitory, but seeing the condition of dormitory, Ren Tian You immediately ceased his steps and refused to move forward.</p><br/><p>Because in front of him, Ren Tian You saw several female student were talking, washing clothes and so on. If Ren Tian You swaggered inside the dormitory now, he was uncertain whether he will be alive or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, Tian You? Let\u2019s go.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tian You was not moving an inch, Luo Meng Wu felt surprised and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, you go first. I will follow you soon.\u201d Ren Tian You resolutely shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026so it was like that. Be at ease, these sisters are very gentle and soft. They will definitely receive you warmly.\u201d After looking at the direction where Ren Tian You was watching, Luo Meng Wu understood the thought of Ren Tian You. So she teased him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026no need, I will think about the way to go up myself.\u201d Ren Tian You resolutely shook his head in refusal.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you insist, you are on your own. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Seeing the resolute expression, Luo Meng Wu no longer teased him. And she walked towards the dormitory.</p><br/><p>Seeing Luo Meng Wu disappeared inside the dormitory, Ren Tian once again looked at those female students in front of dormitory. \u2018Grandfather\u2019s, this is also my dormitory, so why am I afraid?\u2019 Although he mumbled like this, but he didn\u2019t have enough guts to brazenly walk inside the dormitory filled with girls only.</p><br/><p>\u201c*sigh*, since I can\u2019t walk through main entrance, then I, your father will enter through window them.\u201d Ren Tian You grinned his teeth and quickly walked behind the dormitory. After some time, he arrived at the walls behind the dormitory, then he used his chakra to cover his feet and started to walk on the walls. Just when he was at the side of second floor room, he suddenly heard the noise from that room.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Ren Tian You cried out in alarm and quickly started to form the series of hand seals, \u201cDoton\u2014Iwagakure no Jutsu! (Earth Style\u2014Hidden in Stones Jutsu!)\u201d After he completed forming hand seals, suddenly the chakra started to fluctuated around him and his figure disappeared from the wall.</p><br/><p>After that he saw that the window of that room was opened from inside, and someone threw a basin of water from that window, after that the window was closed again.</p><br/><p>At that time, space started to twist and Ren Tian You figure suddenly appeared on the earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, that was a close call.\u201d Ren Tian You wiped the sweats on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Doton\u2014Iwagakure no Jutsu! (Earth Style\u2014Hidden in Stones Jutsu!) allowed him to camouflage himself with the earth around him.</p><br/><p>After that he walked towards his room windows. After arriving near his room windows, from his ninja backpack he took out a kunai, and then pry open his window and entered inside his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, finally came in. his sister really is not easy.\u201d Ren Tian You sat on the bed and wiped his cold sweat from his forehead. A moment ago, it was really dangerous, if not for the concealing ninjutsu, I would have been discovered. The he would have become a big jock. At that time, he suddenly thought about a problem, how was he going to come and go from his room every day, should he use window every day? F**k, what a great thing ah!</p><br/><p>Although he was depressed enough to cough blood, still there wasn\u2019t any good solution to this problem, so he could only use window for the time being.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You shut the windows of the bathroom, and started to have a pleasant bubble bath. After bathing he wiped his wet body dry and lied on the bed.</p><br/><p>Right now Ren Tian You was not feeling any drowsiness. From his bed he was lying, he looked towards the sky outside the window. After that looking at the 2 moons for a long time, he started to thought about many things.</p><br/><p>\u2018Its already been more than 2 years since I arrived to this Divine Wind continent, I don\u2019t know how my parents are doing. In addition after they got the news of my death, I don\u2019t know whether they could again live normally or not. But mom and dad, your son is not dead, but still alive in this another world. You can rest assured, as soon as I am strong enough, I will search for the way back and will definitely return back.\u2019</p><br/><p>Thinking about his current strength, ren Tian You couldn\u2019t help but become vexed and upset with himself. Although he is already at the level of elite ninja, still regarding to understanding the nature of chakra was the greatest difficulty for him. Till now he had grasped thunder chakra nature change, but as for wimd attribute. He only got a clue nothing more. After he grasped the nature change of Wind attribute, he wanted to fuse two attributes to use kekkei genkai (blood line limit) ninjutsu. There was a huge improvement in the amount of chakra he possessed. But he can exchange a tail beast from the system and borrow its chakra. Nevertheless, seeing the long string of zeros in system point\u2019s requirement, Ren Tian You felt sharp pain in his ass.</p><br/><p>In addition there is Sharingan, which was the most important. He wanted to awaken Mangekyo of Obito. And also wanted to awaken Mangekyo of Sasuke so that he could fuse the mangekyos and upgrade the Mangekyo Sharibgan to Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. But just to awaken next 2 pairs of Mangekyo, he needed 20,000 system points, no need to mention about the requirement of system points to awaken Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. But, even when Ren Tian You was staying at Magical beasts\u2019 forest for more than 2 years, he didn\u2019t earn altogether 20,000 system points, but currently he wasn\u2019t at Magical beasts\u2019 forest, and didn\u2019t have any chance to earn system points, so only god knows when he will have enough system points to awaken Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Currently Ren Tian You wanted to activate the mission system, so that he would have extra method to earn system points. But he had no idea how to activate it. As a result, there wasn\u2019t any mission listed there.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, I\u2019m so sick of it, but I don\u2019t want to sleep.\u201d Ren Tian You got more and more irritated while thinking about these matter. So he covered his head and tried to fall asleep so that he don\u2019t need to think about these matters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

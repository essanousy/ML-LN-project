Landing on the ground of the ravine, Ren Tianyou looked towards the member of demon clan who was holding a huge spear in his hand while floating in the sky, then his eyes automatically changed into Mangekyo Sharingan, as he became serious. Although Ren Tianyou vowed solemnly, nevertheless he was not 100% sure that he was able to kill this fellow. When all is said and done, this fellow was an expert of God domain level, so a moment of single carelessness would definitely cost Ren Tianyou his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, little human boy, you are truly stupid, actually coming here to court your death.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, that demon clan laughed heartily and said, \u201cIt\u2019s already been several thousand years since I last tasted the blood of the humans. Little boy, I\u2019ll let you leave behind your name, since you will be the first person I\u2019ll be eating after I was trapped inside this seal several thousand years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Zero, am the leader of Akatsuki organization.\u201dRen Tianyou slowly said, then looking face to face with demon clan he added, \u201cNow your name and status.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you asked, there is no harm in letting you know. My name is Aibute\u2014\u2013Xibolai, am small team leader of devil army group under His Excellency Demon god of Devildom, and am a Low-god.\u201d This demon clan i.e. Aibute boldly introduced himself, then his special blue colored eyes stared at Ren Tianyou and added, \u201cLittle boy, reminisce stops here, now it\u2019s time for you to say goodbye to this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Aibute suddenly waved his spear with his right hand. After that a huge pitch-black colored spear attack gushed out from the spear, which advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, deserved to be called demon clan, still truly despicable, actually initiating an attack all of a sudden.\u201d Seeing the sudden attack of Aibute, Ren Tianyou sneered, his right foot heavily stepped on the ground, then he advanced towards incoming attack. He had no intention to dodge or block the incoming attack, he just directly advanced towards the incoming attack with the intention of meeting it head on.</p><br/><p>Seeing this move of Ren Tianyou, Aibute exposed a mocking smile on his face, because he clearly understood the true power of his 100 demon liao attack style. Although this spear attack looked like ordinary and mediocre, but its power was absolutely not as it seems. But when Aibute was ridiculing, the scene he saw in front of him, stupefied him.</p><br/><p>He saw his attack directly passing through the body of Ren Tianyou as if the body of Ren Tianyou was transparent. And Ren Tianyou was still advancing towards him without losing any speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing the strange scene in front of him, he was shocked. But as a Low God ranked expert, he very quickly adjusted his mentality. His eyes revealed a serious look, and was not that relax like just a moment ago, \u201cAbility to change into emptiness? Really a hard to deal ability, however I do not believe that you are able to continuously use this ability for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Aibute directly rushed towards Ren Tianyou, tightly clenched the spear in is hand, and stabbed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Even after seeing that the spear was advancing towards him, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have a slightest bit of change in his expression. He just pulled out his sword of kusanagi, and pointed it towards Aibute, as if he was ready to use a move to perish together.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ren Tianyou was pointing his sword towards him, he just sneered and said, \u201cHumph, I, your father\u2019s spear is longer than your lousy sword. Little boy, you are still too na\u00efve.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Aibute was shocked to see that his spear again directly penetrated and pass through the head of Ren Tianyou without any resistance just like a moment ago, and the sword of kusanagi in the hand of Ren Tianyou had already arrived in front of him. Seeing this, Aibute was so scared that the color of his face immediately changed, but it was already too late to dodge this attack, and before his terrified gaze, the sword of kusanagi directly stabbed his body. But strangely he didn\u2019t feel any pain whatsoever, so carefully looking, he saw that his spear was still passing through the body of Ren Tianyou, and his sword was just passing through his body without any resistance.</p><br/><p>After the spear passed through the body of Ren Tianyou, Ren Tianyou waved his sword of kusanagi with his right hand, and tried to cut the waist of Aibute.</p><br/><p>Seeing this movement, Aibute waved the spear in his right hand and along with the \u2018dang\u2019 metal colliding sound, the sword attack of Ren Tianyou was successfully blocked by his spear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing his attack was blocked, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then made a series of one-handed seals with his right hand, suddenly along with the ear piercing sound of birds chirping, the right hand of Ren Tianyou was filled with dazzling lightning light. And this lightning light spread and completely wrapped his sword of kusanagi, then this lighting light also spread to the spear of Aibute.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of lightning, Aibute instantly separated his spear from the sword of Ren Tianyou, then he quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about running.\u201d Seeing the quick retreat of Aibute, Ren Tianyou roared. Then the lightning in his right hand instantly elongated, and advanced towards Aibute in a high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, you dead man, don\u2019t look down upon I, your father.\u201d Seeing that he was forced to retreat by a tiny lightning attack of Ren Tianyou, Aibute instantly felt huge humiliation, he had never thought that an insignificant human was actually looking down upon him. He pulled up his heavy spear with his right hand as if it didn\u2019t have any weight, and then directly stabbed at the pointed end of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Chidori Eiso (Chidori Laser Spear), directly blocking it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe control over the spear of this fellow is too powerful.\u201d Seeing the method used by Aibute to block his Chidori Eiso (Chidori Laser Spear), Ren Tianyou was shocked inside his heart. After that so as to not waste any more chakra, he dispersed his Chidori Eiso (Chidori Laser Spear).</p><br/><p>Aibute had used the tip of his spear to block Ren Tianyou\u2019s Chidori Eiso (Chidori Laser Spear), and this method is not that simple as it looks, one must have perfect control over his spear and moreover must have good judgment to have a chance to accomplish this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeserved to be called Low-god ranked expert. This strength really is not ordinary.\u201d Looking at Aibute standing opposite to him, Ren Tianyou expression turned solemn and muttered to himself. After these brief confrontation, Ren Tianyou roughly understood his strength. At the very least, it was impossible for him to use the same spear move of just a moment ago to block his Chidori Eiso (Chidori Laser Spear).</p><br/><p>On the other side, Aibute also slowly recalled the brief confrontations of just a moment ago, \u201cIt seems this fellow possess an ability to pass through anything without a doubt. All attack including energy attacks would directly pass through his body without causing any effect on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Thinking this, the expression of Aibute changed, \u201cAccording to what happened just a moment ago, it seems at the time when the attacks are passing through his body, he is also powerless to attack. So when he attacks, he definitely have to materialize, so I only need to aim for the movement when he is attacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, all of my big moves also lost its effect, he is able to easily avoid all of my big moves using this move. So I have to use big moves very carefully, otherwise it is just wasting my magic power.\u201d Although he figure out the key aspect of the ability of Ren Tianyou, but knowing is one matter, ability to accomplish is another matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I think this is not the only ability he ought to have.\u201d Aibute again though about how Ren Tianyou was able to create earthen wall outside the barrier just a moment ago, then carefully looked at Ren Tianyou and thought, \u201cIts better to test him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, there is only 2 days left, I must finish off this fellow as soon as possible. And when entering this place, dean had stated that after 8 days the 1st floor would automatically transfer us out, but now I am in 2nd floor, so this rule doesn\u2019t apply to me. Nevertheless I shouldn\u2019t stay here for a long time, so as to avoid being found.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought inside his heart. He feared that if he stayed in 2nd floor for a long time, Long Feilu would discover the flaw after he got out from here. Although there were always many people entering the 1st floor for the test daily, nevertheless he would be inevitably found out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Just at that time, Ren Tianyou heard a loud sound of movement, so he looked, and saw a huge spear which was filled with pitch-black colored flame was flying towards him. And Aibute was following this spear, while continuously maintaining the distance of 10 centimeters.</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless.\u201d Seeing the flying spear, Ren Tianyou muttered, then directly rushed towards the incoming spear. When that long spear pierce through his head, the spear just passed through him without any resistance, and without stopping his pace, Ren Tianyou stretched his right hand towards Aibute.</p><br/><p>When the spear completely passed through his body, he directly materialized his body, and caught the shoulder of Aibute with his right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI win.\u201d When he caught the shoulder of Aibute, the eyes of Ren Tianyou flashed with excitement, after that he immediately poured out huge amount of eye power from his right eye. Then a huge spiral shaped space ripple appeared in front of him, which surrounded Aibute and started to suck him in. But just at that time, Ren Tianyou discovered a mysterious smile on the face of Aibute, then he heard a movement sound behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, diversion.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t need to turn around his head to know what was advancing towards him from behind, and his eyes flashed with surprise. He knew that this fellow in front of him was only a diversion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

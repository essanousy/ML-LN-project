Now Ren Tianyou had deeper understanding about the cultivating system of this world. Although he had obtained all the inheritance of Naruto world, still the cultivation system of this world was not that simple, as this cultivation system was also passed down from ancient times. Since this world was based upon the rule of \u2018only strong are respected\u2019, so he should first carefully understand the cultivation system of this world, which would be extremely important in the future.</p><br/><p>About an hour later, a dull sound of bells rang. Hearing the sound of these magic bells, Yun Leixiao stopped his explanation, and said to the students, \u201cToday\u2019s lesson ends here. Everyone can go and have a meal. And then, its free time in the afternoon. In that free time, anyone can enter this cultivation room to cultivate. Well, dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou and other students walked out from the door of cultivation room in succession and scattered in all direction.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou also walked out from the cultivation room and looked up at the blue sky, at that time \u2018gu gu\u2019 sounds came out from his stomach. Touching his stomach he mumbled, \u201cAi, before anything else, I need to fill up my stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou walked towards the direction of dining hall, after walking about 10 minutes he arrived at dining hall. He directly went to the 2nd floor. Now he was also rich, he was not going to care about the cost of the meal.</p><br/><p>He ordered a large quantity of food enough to cover the whole large table, then he sat on the empty seat and waited for his food. Lan Yan and others had entered the Babel tower\u2019s trial by fire today, and yesterday they had already informed him that this trial by fire would take at least 3 days for them to return. Now he didn\u2019t know anyone else in this academy, so he had no choice but to remain here on his own for the time being.</p><br/><p>After about 10 minutes, all the dishes he had ordered started to come up in succession. Seeing these appetizing cooked dishes on his table, he picked up the spoon and started to move.</p><br/><p>After a period of time, all the cooked dishes on the table entered the stomach of Ren Tianyou. Then he let out a completely satisfied burp, while touching his already bulging stomach. At this time, he felt many peculiar gazes, so he raised his head and looked around his surroundings. He saw all the people around him who were in the midst of eating were looking at him with astonished look. Seeing those peoples, he was puzzled for a moment, then suddenly his face became very red. Looking at the table before him, he could only see the big mess of scattered leftovers of his food and empty plates. \u2018It seems they saw my poor table manners. F**k, I threw away my face again.\u2019 Ren Tianyou hurriedly settled his account and ran away from the dining hall. Under the peculiar gaze of these peoples, he didn\u2019t have enough thick skin to continue sitting there.</p><br/><p>After leaving the dining hall, he didn\u2019t know what to do next, as there was not any class in afternoon. \u201cForget about it, before doing anything, let\u2019s go to dormitory to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou walked towards the direction of dormitory. While walking he saw tree leaves under his foot, think for a moment, then he picked up the leaf and placed it between his palms, \u201cSince there is nothing else to do, might as well continue to try nature change of wind attribute chakra.\u201d</p><br/><p>He concentrate the chakra in his hand, and tired hard to make his wind attributed chakra even more thin and sharp. Then tried to cut the leaf. But the leaf was scattered into pieces in an instant. Once again he failed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou threw away that leaf and continue to pick up another leaf. While walking towards his dormitory, simultaneously he was experimenting the nature change of his wind attribute chakra.</p><br/><p>When he was still trying hard to cut the leaf in his hand, suddenly he sensed cold murderous intent around him and his body immediately shuddered. And without wasting any time, he raised his head in alert. But when he saw the scene around him, his mouth gaped opened with surprise.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously he was already at the 2nd floor of the dormitory. Because he was extremely concentrated on his task, not to mention that he forgot he had to be extremely careful and enter his room from the window, but he boldly swagger inside the dormitory full of girls. Now all the girls in the dormitory had discovered him. Every one of them had a murderous look, and had their eyes fixed on him. The expression in their eyes which were looking at him, looked as if they were guarding themselves against a wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, this really is a laughable matter.\u201d Suddenly his expression collapsed. He had never expected that, temporarily training his wind attribute chakra\u2019s nature change would cause him to be surrounded by these female students. This won\u2019t be cheap, ai, quickly think about how to run away from here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, who are you, don\u2019t you know this is girls\u2019 dormitory? You actually dared to come here with evil intention.\u201d At this time, among the crowd, a long hair girl who was wearing a tight-fitting jumpsuit, coldly stared at Ren Tianyou and asked in stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, that, this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know what to say. Seeing the murderous looks on the face of all the female students surrounding him, he immediately swallowed his saliva and howled in his mind, \u201cWow, so terrifying. The saying \u2018anger of woman is more terrifying than ferocious beast\u2019 is really true. If they really get violent, then\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d The whole body of Ren Tianyou immediately shivered and didn\u2019t dared to think about the consequences.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat this, speak, in the end what are you here for, if you don\u2019t give us a clear reason, then don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible for you to safely leave here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ha ha, beautiful ladies, no need to get excited. Just like you all, I also live in this dormitory.\u201d Ren Tianyou hastily explained. If he didn\u2019t clear the misunderstanding, perhaps they will cut him into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you live in this dormitory?\u201d That long-haired female student was not convinced with the explanation of Ren Tianyou and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Ren Tianyou without losing tie nodded his head and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking, don\u2019t you know this dormitory is for us girls? You big man, actually saying you also live here, if you want to lie, you should at least look for a believable lie.\u201d Another beautiful female student with low stature said with face full of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d The group of girls nodded their head with approval.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m speaking truth, I live in room no. 202 on the second floor. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can come with me to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then you come with me.\u201d Ren Tian you followed the group of girls and arrived in front of room no. 202 entrance. Then a tall beautiful girl said towards Ren Tianyou, \u201cNow take out you room card and open the door for us to see. In case if you can\u2019t open the door, you know the result, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, you step aside, I\u2019ll open the door.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered and stepped forward. Then he took out his room card from his ninja backpack and inserted it in the groove of the door. Then along with the fluctuation of magic, the door of the room immediately opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the opened door, all the female students surrounding him were completely surprised. They looked at each other, no one would have thought that, Ren Tianyou was actually speaking truth. He actually live here.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yunyun, what\u2019s going on here? How can a male move in this dormitory?\u201d A girl was confused and asked that tall beautiful girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know! We\u2019ve already lived here for a long time. Previously when this dormitory was just built, some boys had moved in but now they all had already moved out. It is still called boys dormitory but in reality only female students live in this dormitory. How can teachers arrange a male student to this dormitory again?\u201d That tall beautiful female student called elder sister Yunyun expressed her feeling with uncertainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, I am also not too clear. Because I am newly-arrived student, just came in today, and just when I find this dormitory, I was already surrounded by you.\u201d Ren Tianyou was forced to lie. He couldn\u2019t reveal about yesterday matter of entering his room from window, otherwise the outcome won\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>\u201cSchoolmate, we\u2019re sorry. It seems like we have misunderstood you, sorry.\u201d Hearing that Ren Tianyou was newly arrived student, they though \u2018no wonder he looked unfamiliar, and no one have seen him before. It seems like the teacher had made the mistake.\u2019 So thinking this matter didn\u2019t have any connection with Ren Tianyou, this beautiful female student called Yunyun apologized to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, that\u2019s all right. My name is Ren Tianyou, please take care of me.\u201d Ren Tianyou extended his right hand towards this beautiful female student with a smile, but inside his heart he release the long sigh of relief, \u201cNot bad, finally I bluff my way out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Zhao Yunyun, I live in room no. 205. I am truly sorry for just now.\u201d Zhao Yunyun also extended her right hand and shook it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, I already said its ok.\u201d Ren Tianyou replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

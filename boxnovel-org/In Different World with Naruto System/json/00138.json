And they also revealed anxious expression on their faces, as they didn\u2019t know why the reaction of Ren Tianyou was like this after hearing the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Ren Tianyou waved his hand, indicating everything was fine, then taking a deep breath, he looked towards Lan Yan and asked, \u201cLan Yan, tell me everything about the matter of this Ximen Feng and Wang Yuxin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, Ok.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t understand why Ren Tianyou had such a big reaction after hearing this news and why he was asking more about it, nevertheless since Ren Tianyou asked, he started to tell them all the things he knew about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is like this, as far as I know Ailer Empire\u2019s Ximen clan and Wang clan are always in friendly terms. And they always wanted to form an alliance by marriage from earlier times, thereby solidifying the friendship between their clans.\u201d Lan Yan cleared his throat, and began to explain systematically. And Ren Tianyou just quietly sat on his seat without any expression on his face, and just silently listen to the explanation of Lan Yan. But both hands on the table that were tightly clasped showed that he was not that calm inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cSo after the decision, Ximen and Wang clan scheduled the wedding ceremony after 10 days at the Soaring dragon mountain villa of Ximen clan which is located at the imperial capital of Ailer Empire. At that time, basically all the powerful and big forces of Divine Wind continent will send someone to join this wedding ceremony. Even our Lan clan will attend this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Quietly listening the narration of Lan Yan, everyone who were sitting there were able to clearly sense a powerful aura of Ren Tianyou which was gradually rising. Just when his aura was about to break out from his body, a hand pressed his shoulder, and feeling this hand in his shoulder, the mind of Ren Tianyou gradually sobered.</p><br/><p>\u201cA close call, I almost wanted to\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed a breath of relief inside his heart. Just now he was infatuated to the point that he almost triggered the evil nature of Uchiha clan. After that he looked towards the owner of this hand\u2014\u2014-Li Jianrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a moment ago you said that we are already friends, and friends don\u2019t say these kinds of words.\u201d Li Jianrong shrugged his shoulder, and said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cAnd I think you have something to say to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Tianyou, tell us frankly, is Ximen Feng your enemy? Just now when you hear the matter of Ximen Feng\u2019s marriage, your complexion directly become abnormal.\u201d Li Feng also asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Tianyou, if you need any help from us, you can just ask us without any hesitation. Although Ximen clan is powerful, nevertheless all of us not necessarily fear them.\u201d Luo Tianxing also opened his mouth. No need to talk about Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo who had the identity of being from ancient 100 clan, even Luo clan of Luo Tianxing, and the imperial clan of Long You were comparable to Ximen clan in strength. And the Lan clan of Lan Yan was a business clan, so they have armed military whose power was perhaps almost comparable to Ximen clan, but if you talk about financial capacity, they are far more above Ximen clan. Li clan of Li Feng was an old illusion clan, whose strength was also nowhere that weak.</p><br/><p>Looking at the guys around him, Ren Tianyou felt warmth inside his heart. After that he slowly took a deep breath, and decided to tell them his matter, not for anything else, but because they were his friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually had a name before, called Ximen Tianlong. But I was driven out from the Ximen clan, and then I was chased to kill by the peoples of Ximen clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201d\u201d Hearing this information, everyone was completely stunned. They had considered countless possibilities, nevertheless they had never thought that Ren Tianyou may be someone from Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, how did this happen?\u201d Luo Tianxing was confused, he didn\u2019t understand the situation at the moment. So he asked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I will tell you all how did this happened from the beginning to end, this is also the biggest secret in my heart.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at the faces of Lan Yan and others and slowly started to explain from the beginning. \u201cMy original name is Ximen Tianlong, my father is clan head of Ximen clan, Ximen Batian, and my mother was actually a servant-girl of the clan\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next Ren Tianyou told them all the experience of Ximen Tianlong in the Ximen clan from beginning to end. Finished listening the recount of Ren Tianyou, Luo Tianxing and others instantly became extremely angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose scums.\u201d Luo Tianxing who had extremely bad temper hit the top of the table and directly cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people really are\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Long You shook his head, not knowing what to say, then he turned his head towards Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cTianyou, I don\u2019t care what you used to be, but I just know that you are my good friend Ren Tianyou. If you need my help just say directly, although even with my Royal status, I cannot provide too big help, nevertheless I will definitely accomplish the things that I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long You was correct, although Royal clan held unfathomable strength, nevertheless he was only a single prince among the numerous princes of the empire, so thinking that he could do anything was not realistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Tianyou, if you need any help from us, just let us know.\u201d Lan Yan and Lan Xinmeng simultaneously said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu wu, big brother Tianyou, why did those bastards bully you like that? They are bad people, wu wu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d After hearing the experiences of Ren Tianyou, Long Luoluo, this little beauty cried and leaned on the embrace of Ren Tianyou, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not look at me, just tell me what should we do next, ai, who told me to accept your White tiger ring?\u201d Li Jianrong looked at the White Tiger ring that was given to him by Ren Tianyou, and said. And Yan Xinluo, although this fellow said nothing, nevertheless one could easily see the strong murderous look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuoluo, don\u2019t cry, look your big brother Tianyou is all right now.\u201d Ren Tianyou patted Long Luoluo who was in his embrace and comforted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, if those bastards bully big brother Tianyou again, then I will absolutely help you to beat them up.\u201d Long Luoluo said with the tears on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, okay.

Humph, they don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d Ren Tianyou had already decided that he will arrive at Ximen clan after 10 days.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured, I no longer care about these things, after all these things already passed, and now I am living happily. And after escaping from that mortal danger, I also awaken my power of blood lineage. Now I am no longer a waste of before, so you don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at them and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is like that, then its okay. But Tianyou, if you ever need our help, do not hesitate, just ask us, we will definitely help you.\u201d Li Feng said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>After finishing dinner, they went separate ways, Ren Tianyou, Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo went towards collage, and Lan Yan and others all return to their respective house.</p><br/><p>\u201c10 days later, you are going to take part in the wedding ceremony of Ximen clan.\u201d Walking on the street, Li Jianrong suddenly said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cI can clearly sense that strong anger in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I can also sense that your heart is not calm.\u201d Yan Xinluo also said to Ren Tianyou. As a member of Death god clan, he was extremely sensitive in sensing fluctuation of soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I will speak the truth.\u201d Hearing Li Jianrong and Yanxinluo, Ren Tianyou immediately knew that he could not hide things from them.

After that Ren Tian You remembered about that Babel tower, which was mentioned by Li Yun, so he asked Li Feng and others about this tower.</p><br/><p>\u201cBabel Tower, we also don\u2019t know many things about this tower!\u201d Shaking his head, Lan Yan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only know that, even before this Supreme light academy was established, this Babel tower already existed inside the ground of this academy. As far as where it located is, what it is, how it looks like and so on, none of us know about it. And it is also forbidden to spread rumor about this babel tower.\u201d Long You explained slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all are only first grade. Currently we just need to inform teacher that we completed trial by fire assignment at Magical Beasts\u2019 Forest, and after that we can obtain the permission to enter this mysterious Babel tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you ask about this to your clan elders? I think the background of all of you is not that simple?\u201d Ren Tian You asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong You is the 3rd prince of the imperial family, Long Luo Luo is 7th princess, as for Luo Tian Xing and his sister, their father is Grand Marshal. He is in charge of 1/3 army of the empire, their father is known as \u2018crazy blood war god\u2019, and he is saint rank warrior. The clan of Li Feng is also not weak. They are aristocratic clan of illusionists, whole clan members are expert in cultivating illusions. And as for my clan, heh heh, we do business.\u201d Lan Yan slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh Heh, the family of Lan Yan is very rich. Do you know the Blue emperor auction house in the imperial city? That is theirs auction house!\u201d Li Feng added.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, that auction house belong to your clan!\u201d Suddenly Ren Tian You rolled his eyes and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what happened?\u201d Seeing the odd reaction of Ren Tian You, Lan Yan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday I went to that auction house, and sold all the magical beasts\u2019 core that I had collected in these 2 years, and got more than 600,000 gold coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Lan Yan and others were a bit surprised, what is this, their good friend was shortage in money and he sold his everything had in his friend\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, no need to speak about this anymore. Didn\u2019t you all asked your clan\u2019s elder about this babel tower?\u201d Ren Tian You was mostly curious about this Babel tower.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe asked about it, but they said that after we enter, we will know about it ourselves, and didn\u2019t disclosed a single word bout babel tower.\u201d Li Fen said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, big brother Tian You. My father always loves me very much, but even he didn\u2019t tell me a single word about Babel Tower. I\u2019m very angry!\u201d Long Luo Luo added.</p><br/><p>Listening the explanation of Lan Yan and others, Ren Tian You started to thought, \u2018why didn\u2019t anyone gave any information on this Babel tower, even a king himself is keeping it a secret from his own sons and daughter. In addition to this, today he encountered that mysterious youth. That special aura surrounding around his body resemble the specific race which Ximen Tian Long had accidently read in ancient book. Still, truly interesting, seems like the decision to come to this academy was indeed correct.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Patting Ren Tian You who was deeply thinking, Li Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, its nothing! Just thinking about Babel tower.\u201d Ren Tian You replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t think any more about it. Oh, It\u2019s already this late. Let\u2019s go to eat something first.\u201d Long You pulled Ren Tian You and started to head towards dining hall.</p><br/><p>After they reached the dining hall, Long You and others didn\u2019t sat there but headed towards the second floor, which was reserved for nobility to eat. This shows that discrimination between poor and rich is present everywhere.</p><br/><p>After ordering meals, Ren Tian You again asked about the academy. Naturally Lan Yan and others answered every question about the academy. From this Ren Tian You got general understanding of the academy.</p><br/><p>The classes in the academy were divided into 5 courts\u2014\u2014 general magic court, warrior skill court, magic court, and alchemy court. Everyone who attend this academy, no matter the level of strength, and innate talent can only attend grade 1 of any court at the start. Only after you pass the trial by fire assignment given by the academy, you get the chance to enter Babel Tower. And only after completing the assignment of Babel Tower that is given by the academy, you can ascend to next class. You can take these assignment anytime, as long as you think your strength is strong enough, even if that is your 1st day, you can attempt this assignment. But if you fail to complete the assignment, you are barred to attempt this assignment for next six months. Also if you didn\u2019t ascend to the next class within 2 years of joining the academy, then you are expelled from the academy and is forever banned to enroll this academy again. No matter what your identity is.</p><br/><p>And every grade had a special class, this was the class where Ren Tian You was assigned. This was the class where only genius and experts of the same grade can attend. Of course, entering this class didn\u2019t give any chance to sit back and relax, as every other student of the same grade can challenge the student of special class of same grade. If the challenger wins, then the loser special class student will lose his place in special class to the challenger. Also the challenges can\u2019t be refused, and refusing the challenge meant giving up the challenge. Of course there is the limit on how many challenges, you should accept daily. At least 3 challenges should be accepted, after that you could reject any other challenges for remaining day.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d After listening to Lan Yan and others, Ren Tian You muttered to himself. Just at that time, meal also arrived. They stopped their discussion and started to eat.</p><br/><p>After they had eaten and drunk to their heart content, they left dining hall and started to stroll around the academy. \u201cLittle Wu, you came back from your trial by fire assignment.\u201d Just then, they heard a surprised voice of male from behind them.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You and others looked behind them, and saw a young man with a blue hair who resembled Lan Yan and Lan Xin Meng. And was running towards Luo Meng Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Yin, how many times should I tell you, don\u2019t call me so intimately!\u201d Seeing that male, Luo Meng Wu suddenly had a headache, and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Yin? Same surname as Lan Yan and Xin Meng, furthermore that blue hair, don\u2019t tell me this kid is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Hearing the name of the kid, coupled with the blue hair, Ren Tian You immediately speculated the identity of this young man. After that Lan Yan conformed his guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey younger brother, I and your younger sister both are standing here, but even after so long you didn\u2019t see us? Is Meng Wu only the person in your eye?\u201d Lan Yan said gloomily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, elder brother and little sister, you are also here.\u201d It seemed like Lan Yin had just discovered them, so he hastily greeted them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Lan Yan didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. Lan Xin Meng was also speechless seeing the reaction of her 2nd older brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, never thought that the younger brother of Lan Yan was this interesting.\u201d Ren Tian You laughed in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wu, did you eat? If not then please come with me to have a dinner.\u201d Lan Yin didn\u2019t even turned towards the direction of his brother and sister but was only staring at the direction of Luo Meng Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, sorry, this young lady had already eaten just a moment ago. Furthermore, I don\u2019t want to eat meal with you.\u201d Luo Meng Wu was already having a great headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, Little Wu, this is already 383th time you turned me down when I invited you. Why do you turn me down every time?\u201d Lan Yin said with a sad face. Hearing Lan Yin, Ren Tian You shook his head. The willpower of this fellow is indeed high, even after getting rejected so many times, he still hadn\u2019t given up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026.that is because I already have another person I love, yes, he is Ren Tian You.\u201d Luo Meng Wu suddenly pointed towards Ren Tian You and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, what, me again!\u201d Hearing this, Ren Tian You felt like crying. \u2018Ever since I came to this world, every time someone want fake boyfriend, they look for me. And what\u2019s more, I have to take the hit of jealousy.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that time, Ren Tian You suddenly sensed a powerful murderous intent. Looking at the source, he saw that the eyes of Lan Yin was shining with dangerous glint and was firmly staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu dong!\u201d Ren Tian You heavily swallowed his saliva, and he couldn\u2019t help but retreat few steps.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

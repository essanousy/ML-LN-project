The height of this giant when it was still sitting cross-legged was already more than 50 meters. The entire body emitted a sharp aura, giving people a kind of powerful feeling.</p><br/><p>Behind it, there was a huge purple halo, where light waves were wandering about. Although radiance was soft, but the aura alone could make people feel their qi and blood boiling, and have their heart filled with dense killing intent.</p><br/><p>That giant slowly descended along light beam, and landed behind Yaorao. After that Yaorao put her hands\u2019 palms together and emitting purple light from her body, she slowly entered into the chest of that giant and disappeared.</p><br/><p>And after Yaorao entered into the body of this giant, two radiances flashed in this giant\u2019s eyes, and this giant slowly stood up. As this giant stood up, a terrifying energy shockwave spread all around.</p><br/><p>Seeing this over 70 meters giant in front of him, solemnness flashed in the eyes of Ren Tianyou, and thought in his heart, \u201cIt seems Yaorao also truly wants to go all out now, I must be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, that giant begun to get into action. It brandished its that huge right arm, and huge purple colored halo slowly condensed in the center of its right palm. Then it slapped towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, \u201cMyriad Demon Homing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly a loud demonic voice resounded between heaven and earth. Countless demonic images appeared in the sky behind this giant one after another, then that slapping palm rapidly became larger, and as if a huge mountain peak, covering the whole sky, it slapped towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s Shusanoo. Before this huge palm, the huge Susanoo of Ren Tianyou was just like a child, and it seemingly wanted to destroy Ren Tainyou\u2019s Susanoo with merely a slap.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, don\u2019t underestimate me, Ren Tianyou.\u201d Looking at that huge palm, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly, and his Rinnegan began to release powerful eye power, then Susanoo began to rapidly extend its both arms to block above its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Loud ear-deafening sound of explosion rang out. The space seemed to be shattered by this sound of explosion. When the hands of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo had blocked Yaorao\u2019s this Demonic Buddha\u2019s palm, the ground underneath Susanoo was instantly broken by the impact force. And under this force, the legs of Susanoo seemed bent and almost kneeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock for me!\u201d Ren Tianyou who was standing inside Susanoo roared loudly, and simultaneously the hands of Susanoo exerted power, finally blocking that huge palm for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201cKyuubi, Bijudama!\u201d After Ren Tianyou blocked this Demonic Buddha\u2019s attack, he immediately yelled towards Kyuubi.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Kyuubi immediately answered, then immediately bent over. After that rising its head towards the sky, gathered massive amount of chakra in its mouth, slowly condensing a huge chakra energy ball, precisely was a bijudama.</p><br/><p>But the bijudama of Kyuubi was much larger compared to other tailed beasts\u2019 bijudama, and even the space around it seemed to be crushed by the energy leaking out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBijudama!\u201d Kyuubi immediately shot its bijudama directly towards Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha without the slightest hesitation. And the already tattered ground was pulverized once again by the power of the bijudama all the way to Demonic Buddha.</p><br/><p>After the bijudama of Kyuubi was shot, Ren Tianyou directly dispersed Susanoo, and before the right palm of Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha landed on him, he instantly used kamui to leave that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d bijudama directly hit the body of Demonic Buddha, and \u2018hong\u2019 loud sound of explosion resounded, then this huge explosion gave rise to shockwaves that spread all around.</p><br/><p>Above the head of Kyuubi, along with spiral shaped space ripple, Ren Tianyou appeared on its head. After that he carefully looked for any movement inside the explosion.</p><br/><p>When the explosion winds and waves stooped, Ren Tianyou was able to clearly see all the circumstance inside.</p><br/><p>In front of the body of Demonic Buddha, there was an energy shield formed from the purple colored radiance emitted by its right hand, and this shield had completely blocked the bijudama of Kyuubi, but that radiance of its body had also become dimmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems it will not be easy to fight this fellow with only my power, I must get the help from tailed-beasts.\u201d Seeing this Demonic Buddha was unexpectedly unscathed under the bijudama of Kyuubi, Ren Tianyou who was standing on the head of Kyuubi thought.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou said to other eight tailed-beasts, \u201cYou all go and deal with that Thousand Eyes Evil Beasts, as for this fellow, I and Kyuubi will deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other tailed-beasts simultaneously answered, then rushed towards that huge Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>And as for Ren Tianyou, he directly bit his right hand\u2019s finger, then made a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose no Jutsu Gedo Mazo!\u201d (Summoning Jutsu Gedo Statue!)</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front directly broke open, and a huge statue emerged.</p><br/><p>This statue\u2019s body was as huge as that giant. It had nine huge eyeballs in its head, and its body\u2019s color was just like the color of dead tree with ten protruding pillars rising on its back. Moreover both of its hands were shackled by huge handcuff, this was precisely empty vessel of the Jubi.</p><br/><p>Now Ren Tianyou had no choice but to get help from Gedo Statue too. And under the control of his Rinnegan, Gedo Statue was no weaker than any tailed beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Gedo Statu spread open its hands, directly shattering the handcuff, while roaring. And a powerful shockwaves spread all around, blowing away countless broken rocks.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou on the head of Kyuubi released a large amount of eye power, then the Susanoo Armor wrapped around the body of Kyuubi. And at the same time, from two side of the body of Kyuubi, two huge energy arms emerged, and both of these hands held Futsu no Mitama Sword separately, precisely was Beast of Calamity. Moreover with Kyuubi, it was strongest Beast of Calamity.</p><br/><p>Now with Ren Tianyou using his unique skill combined with Gedo Statue was about to fight to the death against Yaorao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

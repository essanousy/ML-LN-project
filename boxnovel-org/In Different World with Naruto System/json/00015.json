Ren Tian You had stayed at Magical Beasts forest for more than 2 years, and had only eaten roasted meat of magical beasts like a savage, So now for him anything other than roasted meat was a high level delicacy. And Lan Yan and others were the descended of large clans, from childhood on, they had lived in luxury but this time they suddenly had to go to the Magical Beasts forest for a month long training exercise.These pampered youths had to endure hardships they hadn\u2019t had to before . So when they suddenly saw the table full of delicacies , even Lan Xin Meng and the other beautiful girls were unable to mask their desire. Ren Tian You and company rushed to devour all the food served on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cBurp!\u201d Luo Tian Xing leaned back at his chair and released a satisfied burp.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally I got the chance to eat my fill. At the Magical Beast forest,I, your father had to hold back for 1 month!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?You cannot eat anymore!? Just a moment ago, you were vigorously stuffing your face. Take a look at the bones left on your plate, by yourself you have devoured a whole barbecued pig.\u201dLan Yan said with a gaze full of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBah! You should take a look at Tian You. He is the real master.\u201d After listening to Lan Yan, Luo Tian Xing said while pointing towards Ren Tian You. Lan Yan and company suddenly turned towards Ren Tian You, suddenly everyone\u2019s mouth gaped open..</p><br/><p>They only saw that Ren Tian You was still furiously eating. In front of him were at least 7 or 8 empty plates as well as many scattered bones.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You suddenly felt all of them were looking at him so he raised his head and discovered that all the others had their mouth gaping wide open and were looking at him with listless eyes. So he asked full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, why are you all looking at me like that, and why are you not eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, brother Tian You, are you full?\u201d Long Luo Luo asked stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, about half full.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the answer of Ren Tian You, several thumping sounds could be heard. And he merely saw that Lan Yan and the others had fallen from their chair. Lan Xin Meng and the other 2 beautiful ladies were also sitting unstable on their chairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, finally I know what a real foodie is.\u201d Still sitting on the floor, Li Feng exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah until now I believed I was someone who could eat a lot, but in front of Tian You, I am inferior.\u201d Luo Tian Xing said with an admiring light in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Listening to the others, the face of Ren Tian You was growing darker by the second, and he was shouting in his heart, \u201cF**k, I, your father am losing my face again and again since I came to this world, damn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ren Tian You was whining, suddenly the surprised voice of a male came from the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Luo, that\u2019s great. I didn\u2019t expect to see you here, it seems we are truly destined.\u201d A youth who was wearing splendid clothes and was followed by 4 guards came towards them with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort. Tian Yun Guan, who is destined with you? We are not familiar with each other, and first take a look in the mirror. Don\u2019t try to act familiar with me!\u201d Seeing this youth, the face of Long Luo Luo suddenly became quite unsightly, and spoke with a disgusted expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Luo, why are you speaking like this, I am very heartbroken.Am I not treating you wholeheartedly?But why do you still not understand my feelings?\u201d This youth ,known as Tian Yun Guan, said with a sad expression.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You who was standing at the side suddenly frowned. Just now he saw a hidden glimmer of anger flash in the eyes of Tian Yun Guan. There was no possible way to be mistaken as even his normal eyes were already powerful enough to see through others after awakening the Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow is definitely bad news. Deep in his heart he is scheming.\u201d Ren Tian You thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort, you are disgusting. You think I don\u2019t know about your matters? You have already said that same sentence to at least 50 other women, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Luo Luo replied disgusted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, sister Luo Luo, you are misunderstanding me. How can all those women compare to you?\u201d Hearing Luo Luo, murderous intent flashed in his eyes but he suppressed it, instead said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort. I am going to vomit. And don\u2019t address me like you are close to me. I\u2019ll not speak with you!\u201d While speaking Luo Luo suddenly caught the sight of Ren Tian You. The corner of her mouth raised a little and she ran towards him and took his arm in her bosom, after that she said towards Tian Yun Guan, \u201cAnd I already have a boyfriend, so from now on don\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian You, help me driving out this fellow.\u201d Long Luo Luo lowered her head and whispered in a quiet voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d Ren Tian You assured Long Luo Luo. He didn\u2019t have a shred of good impression towards this Tian Yun Guan. This fellow was a deep schemer and had great patience. Since he had already become friends with Lan Yan and the others, he would not allow this fellow to hurt them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe~~..sister Luo Luo,You don\u2019t need to deceive me. His strength is only at the intermediate fighter level, he is just a garbage! How can this garbage be your boyfriend?\u201d Seeing Ren Tian You was only at the level of an intermediate fighter, Tian Yun Guan said with a condescending look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.!?\u201d Hearing Tian Yun Guan insulting Ren Tian You, Long Luo Luo became angry.Behind Lan Yan and company also frowned and stood up.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ren Tian You suddenly patted the hand of Long Luo Luo, and stepped towards Tian Yun Guan and said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, just a moment ago you said garbage, who spoke garbage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI spoke garbage.\u201d Tian Yun Guan said without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right, indeed you spoke garbage.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders with a look of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are courting death!\u201d Just now Tian Yun Guan discovered his mistake, and suddenly his face blackened.He approached Ren Tian You with murderous intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort. Tian clan\u2019s kid, don\u2019t force me.\u201d Seeing that Tian Yun Guan wanted to attack, Luo Tian Xing swiftly appeared in front of Tian You and forced Tian Yun Guan to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you are quite bold to raise your hand here, do you believe it when I, say I can bury you forever in this town?\u201dLi Feng said with a face full of contempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026..you all.\u201d Tian Yun Guan couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing, Luo Tian Xing and others were standing up to protect an intermediate fighter trash.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I told you before still counts. I will not object, if you chase after my sister without using your despicable means and win her heart.But now my sister already has a person she likes, you better give up before going too far!\u201d Long You interrupted Tian Yun Guan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort. Very good. Bloke, if you are a man then do you dare have a duel with me? Let\u2019s see who is more suitable for Luo Luo.\u201d Tian Yun Guan unwillingly looked at Ren Tian You and roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian You, do not accept. He is already a Great Illusion Scholar.\u201d Long Luo Luo said anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, don\u2019t accept it, Tian You. He has a class 4 blood lineage suitable for illusionist.\u201d Luo Meng Wu also nervously persuaded Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry and rest assured. I don\u2019t look down on this guy.\u201d Ren Tian You carelessly said. In his heart he was thinking, \u201cPlaying with illusion in front of me, will be your downfall.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Long Luo Luo was still anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down. Have a little faith in me.\u201d He comforted the beautiful little lady Long Luo Luo. Actually Ren tian You wanted to know more about the illusionist, and magicians of this different world.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, are you really sure about this\u2026\u2026\u201d Luo Tian Xing also was also not convinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, rest assured, honestly speaking I am not underestimating him. Do you really believe I am only intermediate fighter\u2026?\u201d Ren Tian you said with mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in short, just be a bit more careful.\u201d Luo tian Xing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort, dumb idiot. See how I will play with you.\u201d he said with ferocious expression ,seeing that Ren Tian You had agreed to the duel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah ,sure.\u201d Ren Tian You was not in the mood to play with this clown.</p><br/><p>Luo Tian Xing and other paid the bills and left the Heavenly Fragrance restaurant. They directly went to the duel field which was located at center of the town. Inside Eiffel town it was not allowed to engage in combat, so if anyone wanted to settle their score they had to go to the duel field. If a battle took place inside the town then, no matter the identity of the person, you would be punished.</p><br/><p>They arrived at dueling place, Ren Tian You and Tian Yun Guan jumped onto the arena. And the staffs also arrived there, and raised a barrier so that no one could interfere with the duel. But life and death duels were not allowed in this arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, dumb idiot, you snatched my Long Luo Luo, so I\u2019ll not let you die easily. I\u2019ll let you despair before you die!\u201d Seeing that the barrier of the arena was raised, Tian Yun Guan arrogantly roared towards Ren tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinished? If you have finished talking then let\u2019s begin. I want to return back to eat.\u201d Ren tian You used his finger to dig out his ear and spoke towards Tian Yun Guan with ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnort, since you urgently want to die, then I\u2019ll fulfill your wish.\u201d After finished speaking, Tian Yun Guan took out a staff, and suddenly released his illusion power.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion of blood lineage!\u201d After Tian Yum Guan shouted, his body suddenly became a little illusionary, and it became harder to know whether it is real or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting! I hope you will not disappoint me.\u201d Seeing Tian Yun Guan, Ren Tian said to himself. And then he suddenly closed his eyes and when he had opened it again, his eyes had changed into blood red in color and it contained 3 spiraling curves. \u201cMangekyo Sharingan open!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d A look of surprise appeared when Tian Yun Guan saw Ren Tian You\u2019s eyes. Just now he had merely seen those eyes but he felt like his consciousness almost sunk. He was so scared that he immediately turned away, and no longer dared to look at those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse all the moves you have. I just so happen to want to look at your illusions. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Ren tian You causally said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, do you see the eyes of Tian You?\u201d At the audience, Luo Meng Wu asked Luo Tian Xing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this should be his power of blood lineage. I didn\u2019t expected, his blood lineage power was located in his eyes. Still it\u2019s quite strange.\u201d Luo Tian Xing looked surprised, but he was not in discomfort. Because Ren Tian You had controlled his power so that it would not affect the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, how dare you underestimate me? I\u2019ll cut your body into 1000 pieces.\u201d Tian Yun Guan was filled to the brim with anger and suddenly began to use his illusion to attack Ren tian You.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

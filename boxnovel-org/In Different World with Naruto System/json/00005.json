And also he was getting more and more familiar in using hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>After a month, in the morning, next to the stream, he was forming the hand seals quickly, fast enough that his hands were already becoming a bit blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cRam\u2014Serpent\u2014Tiger, bunshin no jutsu [Clone Jutsu].\u201d A second later, \u2018peng\u2019, he was surrounded by white colored smoke. Then there appeared another figure who looked the same as him. But if one looked at it carefully, the figure seemed a bit unreal, as if it could disappear at any time.</p><br/><p>After a month of cultivation, finally his chakra was upgraded to the next level. Also, he became even more familiar with hand seals, and now he could form three basic hand seals within a second. His strength was also upgraded; he also had planned to begin learning several low level ninjutsu from the Ninjutsu tab. The first reason was that previously on Earth, he was a hardcore fan of Naruto and always hoped someday he could also learn and use ninjutsu. Now of course, that opportunity had arrived. Second, his strength of Intermediate Fighter was not good enough in times of danger inside the Magical Beast Forest. Although his current location was at the outer perimeter of the forest, nobody could guarantee that a high level magical beast wouldn\u2019t become bored in the inner region and decided to take a walk in the outside perimeter of the forest. If that happened and he encountered that magical beast then\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>So he had decided to learn some of the lifesaving jutsu first, and after completely learning them, he planned to proceed to the next cultivation plan. And to start learning ninjutsu, of course, he should start from the three most basic jutsu.</p><br/><p>In the Naruto world, the three most basic jutsu are commonly referred to bunshin no jutsu [Clone Technique] (making a clone of oneself, to puzzle the enemy), Henge no Jutsu [Transformation Jutsu] (turn oneself into someone or something else, like Sun Wukong and the 72 Transformations) and Narikawari no Jutsu [Body Substitution Jutsu] (when receiving an attack, swap one\u2019s position with nearby objects).</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, before on Earth some people also added Shunshin no Jutsu [Body Flicker Technique] in the category of most basic jutsu, but Shunshin no Jutsu is high-level ninjutsu, only higher level ninja could learn this jutsu. With this Shunshin no Jutsu, some high-level ninja had become famous such as Shunshin no Shisui [Shisui of the Body Flicker]. But the 3 most basic ninjutsu can be learnt at a ninja academy by any student.</p><br/><p>He had just used bunshin no jutsu [Clone Jutsu] which was one of the most basic ninjutsu. Actually many Naruto fans considered the role of bunshin no jutsu not big. This jutsu was not only used to confuse the enemy but also could be used to talk with another person as well as explore dangerous regions.</p><br/><p>He looked at his clone for a while and tried to touch it with his hand but his had passed right through it without any resistance. As he expected there was no resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease!\u201d</p><br/><p>He formed a hand seal, deciding to get rid of the clone. After this, he used Henge no Jutsu [Transformation Jutsu]. Again, he was surrounded by white colored smoke and from within a middle aged man who was wearing western clothes from Earth appeared. If even a single individual from Earth saw this man, then they would absolutely cry out in alarm and utter, \u201cWow, Brother Andy.\u201d And then they would immediately pull out a pen and paper and run towards him for a signature.</p><br/><p>Correct, he had transformed into a widely known individual on Earth, Heavenly King Andy Lau.[T.L: Hong Kong Cantopop singer and actor] He went to the stream and looked at his reflection and said, \u201cGee, correct, now I, your father (laozi), also can transform like Sun Wukong of the 72 Transformations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Observing the reflection of Andy Lau in the stream, he could not help but click his tongue and nod his head. Only after this did he release his transformation and change back to his previous appearance. After this he started to use Narikawari no Jutsu [Substitution Jutsu].</p><br/><p>Although Narikawari no Jutsu was also one of the three most basic jutsu, but compared to other two, Naruto used it quite frequently as he used it in his day to day life too.</p><br/><p>He quickly formed the required hand seals for Narikawari no Jutsu, then he saw a different sight; he suddenly felt himself appear near the tree some distance away from his original location.</p><br/><p>He slowly walked towards his original location, he was quite happy and completely satisfied with this jutsu\u2019s effect. It was quite worthwhile to learn and was easy to use daily. Also this jutsu was very useful to flee from powerful magical beasts and could greatly increase the chances of his survival.</p><br/><p>Even after testing all the three most basic ninjutsu, there he had not consumed all his chakra. So, he opened the Ninjutsu tab in the system and started to learn some of the basic ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>He opened the ninjutsu system and found the jutsu he wanted to learn first. After he found what he had searched for, he started to practice to get familiar with the hand seals required for this jutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSerpent\u2014ram\u2014monkey\u2014boar\u2014horse\u2014tiger, Katon\u2014Endan !\u201d [Fire Style: Flame Bullet]. (This </p><br/><p>He finished forming the hand seals, slightly bent backward, brought his fingers near his mouth and slowly blew out a small fireball. (Flame Bullet and grand fireball jutsu is different, Flame Bullet is weaker version of grand fireball jutsu)</p><br/><p>The fireball\u2014uh, how do you say it\u2014it was just a small ball of flame. He looked at his small fireball and immediately the corner of his mouth twitched and a black line appeared; his jutsu was just like the jutsu used by kid Sasuke when he was learning for the first time.</p><br/><p>He felt powerless, now he was forced to make great effort to practice so that he could perfect this jutsu.</p><br/><p>Thus, he started to put great effort in practicing this jutsu. In the beginning, he always spat out a small flame. With practice, he slowly started to grasp the chakra output, which cause his jutsu to slowly take shape.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014Endan !\u201d He quickly formed the required hand seals, and he spat out a huge fireball, and \u2018hong\u2019 it knocked down a huge tree which instantly burned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew, finally I could use this ninjutsu. I, your father\u2019s throat almost spat out smoke, *cough* *cough* this won\u2019t do, water.\u201d Along with the completion of this ninjutsu, he was relieved a little, but what followed after was a sudden surge of pain from his dry throat. He immediately ran to the stream, bent over and drank big mouthfuls of water, one after another. Practicing this jutsu from the morning till now almost caused him to spit smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s all for practicing this jutsu, what\u2019s more I have more or less already learnt this jutsu. But before doing anything, first I need to fill something in my stomach. My stomach is already starting to protest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He ran toward his temporary kennel\u2014*cough* *cough* not kennel but rather his shelter. In fact, it was just a hole in the tree. He had already kept the meat of a Lightning Cat here. So he just started a flame and started to roast the meat.</p><br/><p>Since his last taste of delicious Lightning Cat meat, he had started liking this magical beast. So he started to insanely hunt these Lightning Cats around his surroundings. All the Lightning Cats who appeared in his sights were caught by him as their speed was a joke in front of his Sharingan. Of course, all those Lightning Cats entered his stomach and also helped him to gain system points.</p><br/><p>Now he had altogether 680 system points; the upgrade of his Sharingan was still far. The main reason for this low amount of system points was that low class magical beasts give only small amounts of system points. And, he had no way to hunt high level magical beasts, so he could only accumulate system points slowly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

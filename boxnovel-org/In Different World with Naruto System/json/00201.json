Roll out for me.\u201d Hearing this voice, everyone inside the hall instantly retorted. And all of 4 elders instantly stood up and arrived at the side of Elf Queen, protecting Elf Queen in the middle of them. After that they emitted powerful aura from their body which quickly spread all around. The atmosphere inside the hall suddenly become stifling, and just like eagle, their sharp eyes ceaselessly scanned all around. And on the body of Kaliyi, dark black colored dense fog suddenly appeared. Under the thought of Kaliyi, this dense fog quickly spread around. This was dark system sensing magic, could sense all living things\u2019 life trait and information, and return back to her brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMerely in less than two hours, Your Majesty the Queen already not recognize me?\u201d Along with the voice, the space in front of Elf Queen and others suddenly distorted into a spiral shaped space ripple by mysterious power, and a young man wearing black robe with red clouds imprinted on them appeared in the hall from inside this space ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d Seeing the person appeared in front of her, the complexion of Elf Queen instantly ashen. And just like violent storms, her aura pressured him, as if wanting to crush him into powder. And the aura of 4 elders were also firmly locked on to him, were ready to attack at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Your Majesty the Queen and everyone, don\u2019t get excited like this. This time I came here without any ill intention.\u201d Waving his hand, and as if he was not feeling any pressure from the aura of these people, he casually said.</p><br/><p>But just at this time, from the ground under him, suddenly innumerable huge vines grew out, and tightly wind around his body, making it impossible for him to move. The body of female elf elder behind Elf Queen was glimmering with light green magic radiance, and both of her hand was also gathered together. It seems she was the one who suddenly used nature magic just now to restrain him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Zero, this time you are unable to get away even if given wings.\u201d Seeing he was trapped, the complexion of Elf Queen slowly took a turn for the better, and she withdrew her the powerful aura, then coldly snorted towards the trapped person wearing black robe with red clouds imprinted on it.</p><br/><p>Correct, this person naturally was Ren Tianyou. After he return back Xing Lu to her room, he directly came here, because there was something he must do.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, is that so?\u201d Feeling he was tightly tied up by vines, he just laughed without refuting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect after you steal our Elf clan\u2019s Spring of Life, you actually didn\u2019t escape immediately, instead swaggeringly appeared before us. I must say that you are quite bold but stupid.\u201d Looking at the trapped and cannot move Ren Tianyou, with sneering expression on her face, Elf Queen mockingly said to Ren Tianyou. She really had not thought that Ren Tianyou would actually return back. With regarding to his that space magic, she had already took precautions against it, so when Ren Tianyou appeared, she use her body to block that female elder behind her, moreover gave her signal to secretly use magic spell to trap Ren Tianyou, in order to prevent him from feeing by using space magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, quickly hand over Spring of Life you stole, this way we will leave your corpse intact, otherwise we\u2019ll tear your body into thousands of pieces.\u201d Looking at trapped Ren Tianyou, one of the male elf elder by the side of Elf Queen coldly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA, HAHAHA\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing this male elf elder, Ren Tianyou suddenly laughed, laughed without any restrain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s laughter, the complexion of this male elf elder sunk, then staring at Ren Tianyou, he coldly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am laughing at you stupid.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, and said slowly. Then ignoring this male elf elder whose complexion became unsightly, he continued to speak, \u201cAccording to you, even if I hand over this Spring of Life, I will die, and even if I don\u2019t, I will die, since it is like that, why do I give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, after killing you, we will search your body.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Elf Queen coldly snorted, her eyes full of killing intent stared at Ren Tianyou. In her mind, she couldn\u2019t wait to kill Ren Tianyou, not only because Ren Tianyou had stolen Spring of Life, furthermore because her body was thoroughly seen by this guy in front of her. And seeing his those demonic eyes, she consciously or unconsciously looked away, and she couldn\u2019t wait to dig out those eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I am so stupid that I will bring Spring of Life with me when I come here?\u201d Ren Tianyou curled his lips, and disdainfully continued to speak, \u201cI have already placed those Spring of Life in an extremely safe place, this is inside my stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Elf Queen and others became daze, and simultaneously had a kind of bad premonition inside their heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn simple words, those more than 40 bottles of Spring of Life, I drank all of them. Ng, its taste was pretty good, so this time I came here to ask whether you have more or not, I want to borrow a little bit to taste.\u201d Ren Tianyou licked his tongue and had a very greedy appearance.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, Elf Queen and others immediately began to curse inside their heart, \u201cYour sister, drank more than 40 bottles of Spring of Life, and only saying the taste was pretty good, don\u2019t you know those were the collection of several decades. And you bastard drank all of them in one breathe, don\u2019t you know ordinarily we Elf clan hate to part or use, just store it just like life treasure, and use it only at crucial moment, but you bastard drank more than 40 bottles at once. This is several ten times more extravagant compared to even us Elf clan. This Spring of Life is treasure of us Elf Clan, not your ordinary item, you thief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou drank then drank, why did you deliberately return back before us to show off, saying coming back to ask little more. Taste pretty good, then taste it, elder brother, you truly take this palace as your back garden ah, must you bully us elves like this ah.\u201d This split second, Elf Queen and 4 elders had an impulse to cry inside their heart.</p><br/><p>Seeing the expression on the face of Elf Queen, Ren Tianyou proudly laughed inside his heart. In fact, he was intentionally giving them heartache, who told them to use nature magic to trap him. Although he could leave any time, still he however couldn\u2019t bear but to make them feel heartache inside their heart, merely it seems the effect was pretty good.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor\u2026..me\u2026..make\u2026..this bas\u2026tard\u2026..a\u2026.minced meat.\u201d The face color of Elf Queen become green, gritting her teeth, she said one sentence. This shows how much Ren Tianyou\u2019s those words of just a moment ago infuriated her. Not only her, the complexion of all the elves inside the hall became pitch-black, and they were staring at the direction of Ren Tianyou as if they were about to spew fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty the Queen.\u201d That female elder who had used nature magic to trap Ren Tianyou answered, then looking towards Ren Tianyou, a cruel smile appeared on her face. After that clasping both of her hand together, she violently stirred the nature energy on her body. With her movement, those vines immediately began to tighten slowly, as if wanting to strangle Ren Tianyou into minced meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, ah, too tight, oh, loosen a bit, don\u2019t use force like this ah.\u201d Feeling the vines around his body was gradually tightening, Ren Tianyou emitted strange yelling sound. This sound however seemed awkward to hear, seemingly like the voice of loose in moral woman. Hearing this caused all the woman present on the scene to be flushed.</p><br/><p>This vines became more and more tight, and the voice of Ren Tianyou become louder and louder. Suddenly, Ren Tianyou along with his voice suddenly disappeared. Disappeared so suddenly that Elf Queen and other who were originally having a good time merely stood there blankly for a moment. Immediately afterwards, they rushed forward, but there wasn\u2019t any trace of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m here.\u201d Just at that time, that wicked voice rang in their ears. Ren Tianyou was standing on the right hand side\u2019s wall, and was in the process of waving his hand towards them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

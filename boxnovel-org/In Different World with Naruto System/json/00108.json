Besides one should use any means whether it is fair or foul to successfully win the fight. You really are childish to think otherwise.\u201d Listening to that young girl in purple dress, Ren Tianyou sneered at her with full of disdain, then stared at her huge breast, and opened his mouth, \u201cHum, woman with big boobs but no brain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, what did you say?\u201d Hearing the last sentence of Ren Tianyou \u2018woman with big boobs but no brain\u2019, in addition seeing that he was staring at her **, this immediately caused her to thoroughly explode. Then roared at Ren Tianyou which was just like the roar of the lioness from the east side of the river, which caused the ears of Ren Tianyou ringing. [T.L: the roar of the lioness from the east side of the river=====roar of dominating wife in a temper]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you getting excited like this? How about speaking about the proper business, now I am qualified to join you team, right?\u201d Touching his ringing ears, Ren Tianyou said towards this angry young girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I belittled your strength, you are indeed qualified to join my team, but you have already injured my people, do you really think that I will still allow you to join? Moreover, I still have yet to settle the account of the matter just now.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, this young girl in purple dress furiously stared at Ren Tianyou and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, you know that the people under you were the first one to attack, and I was just passively defending. You can also ask anyone here, they could easily testify my point.\u201d Hearing this young girl, Ren Tianyou shrugged his shoulder helplessly, and then said to her while pointing the crowds of onlooker.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d This young girl instantly started to pant for breath due to extreme anger, and along with her heavy panting, her 36E breast also started to move up and down continuously, and in addition Ren Tianyou just watched it intently. And right now inside her heart, that young girl was thinking, why this strange thing was happening today, she who was born in a major family from childhood had received excellent education, and generally she would very rarely lose her temper, and also she had never before lost her temper like today. After thinking this, this girl instantly push all the blame on Ren Tianyou. \u201cIt must be because this guy is too hateful, as a result my heart was throw into disorder, then get angry. Well, didn\u2019t you want to get on our ship, this girl will let you. And after you board on the ship, look forwards to how I will get even with you.\u201d Thinking this plan inside her mind, this young girl revealed a pleased with herself smile. Afterwards she looked at Ren Tianyou with her beautiful eyes which harbored evil designs. At that time without any reason, Ren Tianyou suddenly felt a chill running down in his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, since it is like that, I will let you allow you to join our team. You can travel on the ship of our Jealous Heaven mercenary group. This is half of your commission, and after completing the mission you will immediately get the remaining half. Now leave behind your name and your mercenary group name if any, we need to register it.\u201d After thinking her next moves, this young girl immediately changed her tone of speech and accepted the request of Ren Tainyou to ride on their ship. Then hand over the package to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Hearing that this young girl had suddenly accepted his request, Ren Tianyou felt something was wrong, but since his goal was already achieved, he didn\u2019t care about it anymore. He just took the package, opened it, and saw altogether 200 Amethyst coins. An Amethyst coin was equal to 100 Gold coins, so it was total of 20,000 Gold coins. Really deserve to be one of the 4 SS-ranked mercenary groups, this Jealous Heaven really is generous.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Zero. I am the leader of Akatsuki mercenary group.\u201d Accepting the package, Ren Tianyou replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero? Quite an odd name. My name is Ling Weiwei.\u201d After hearing the name of Ren Tianyou, Ling Weiwei also introduced herself. After that she looked at Ren Tianyou asked, \u201cJust a moment ago, were you using illusions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Weiwei had thought that the fighting circumstance of Ren Tianyou just a moment ago were illusions, because only illusions appears strange like that. Furthermore she had inspected the very first guard called Aliu who was disposed off by Ren Tainyou, and discovered that he really was trapped in a very powerful illusion, and had remained unconscious.</p><br/><p>Hearing that Ling Weiwei had mistook his Kamui as illusion. He lightly smile and replied, \u201cSort of.\u201d Ren Tianyou would certainly not correct her, this way it would save him trouble to explain her, and also his power will not be leaked. Although Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t care whether his ability got leaked, but it\u2019s better for him if other knew less about him. As a matter of face, after he owned Obito\u2019s eyes, Ren Tianyou could already bring out to play many kind of tactics. And now if Ren Tianyou really wanted to flee, then only a handful of people could stop him. When it comes to fleeing, the eyes of Obito were absolutely top-notch. As a nice youngster who had lived in 21st century, Ren Tainyou without doubt clearly understand that the most important things in the battle was to save one\u2019s life. Who knows what kind of abnormal super experts exists in this world, so exchanging Obito\u2019s eyes was a great choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected.\u201d Ling Weiwei mistakenly believed that Ren Tianyou had given a tacit consent. Then she pointed towards Aliu who was lying on the ground motionlessly due to the illusion of Ren Tianyou, and spoke, \u201cCan you first undo the illusion?\u201d Ling Weiwei pointed towards constantly drooling Aliu. And the other 4 guards slowly stood up from the ground while rubbing at the place where Ren Tianyou had hit them. Worst among them was the guy who got punched on the nose by Ren Tianyou, as his nose was still bleeding without end.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou head over to the side of that guard called Aliu, then touched his forehead with left hand and made a hand seal with only right hand, \u201cKai!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou undid the illusion, that guard slowly opened his eyes. Seeing that he was already awaken, Ren Tianyou left him alone, and went to the side of Ling Weiwei and said, \u201cWell, I undid his illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Aliu had really woken up, the face of Ling Weiwei became slightly better, and thanked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you are welcome. In fact I rather like your angry appearance, that way you looked even more beautiful.\u201d Ren Tainyou suddenly bend over and softly said in the ear of Ling Weiwei. Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou stepped up and walked towards the innumerable crowds of onlookers. And these crowds immediately got out of the way of Ren Tianyou, making a path for him. The strong, wherever they go, the peoples would hold them in awe and veneration.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Hearing what Ren Tianyou had said, furthermore feeling that residual heat of Ren Tianyou\u2019s voice on her ear, she ferociously stamped on the ground. Then walk over to Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cRemember, gather at the pier of Sea Heaven town, tomorrow at 9 in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it! I will arrive there in time.\u201d Ren Tianyou replied and left.</p><br/><p>Since the issue of getting a ship was solved, now his only problem was the mission of that island. So he went to the inn for an early rest, and prepare for the boat journey tomorrow and the next battles to come.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

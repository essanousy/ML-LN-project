Here the unexpected dangers were also greatly reduced, as a result they were more relaxed. And also just yesterday they had a big battle, so Luo Tian Xing and others reverted back to the nature of young master and miss of big clan, and didn\u2019t get up early in the morning. Currently it didn\u2019t matter to Ren Tian You, because he didn\u2019t care where he had to stay. And currently he had only 2 goals, first was to find the way back home and other was to get revenge against Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a very long time, it was obvious to Ren Tian You that, his current power was insufficient to achieve his goal of finding the way back home to Earth. After thinking very hard for a long period of time, he had estimated that, first of all he had to evolve his Sharingan to Rinnegan level. This would help him to summon the body of 10 tailed beast, after that he could exchange 1-9 tailed beasts with system points, then revive the 10 tailed beasts. After reviving 10 tail beasts, become its host (jinchuuriki). He thought that perhaps, with the help of 10 tailed beast\u2019s incomparable strength added with the power of the supreme eye Rinnegan, may be capable to break through the dimension and return back to his original world.</p><br/><p>But currently he was extremely far away from accomplishing that. First of all his eyes were only at the level of Mangekyo Sharingan, and that was also awoken just recently so he was still not yet completely familiar with its basic power. No need to talk about mastering most supreme level eyes \u2018Rinnegan\u2019. And after that, there was the resurrection of 10 tailed beast, and for its resurrection, all the 1-9 tailed beasts was necessary. And even for the exchange of single 1 tailed beast \u2018Shikaku\u2019, it required at least 30,000 system points to exchange, no need to mention about the requirement of system points to exchange the tailed beast having almost infinite chakra, Kyubbi.</p><br/><p>And before trying this, he should gasp some space-time related ninjutsu. Even in the original world of Naruto, there were only a hand full of ninja who could use space-time related ninjutsu. And the most famous was 4th hokage, who was also known as Yellow Flash! But his ninjutsu which made him famous \u2018Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu)\u2019 was not created by him! It was actually created by 2nd Hokage who was also the younger brother of 1st Hokage. 4th hokage merely improved this jutsu, and developed \u2018Hiraishin \u2014 Ni no Dan (Flying Thunder God Technique \u2013 Level Two)\u2019.</p><br/><p>In the Naruto world, the most admired ninja of Ren Tian You was not the ninja who was known as God of Shinobi \u20181st hokage\u2019 or the first person to evolve his Sharingan to Rinnegan \u2018Madara\u2019! But the 2nd hokage \u2018Senju Tobirama\u2019! Because Ren Tian You thinks that the talent of 2nd hokage was far above 1st hokage or any others. The 1st hokage had merely inherited 6 path\u2019s incomparable ** and chakra, which made him possible to use wood element ninjutsu, that\u2019s all. But 2nd hokage merely depending on his common water element ninjutsu became 2nd hokage. Even more he also developed a space ninjutsu \u2018Flying Thunder God Jutsu\u2019 and also forbidden jutsu \u2018Kuchiyose\u2014Edo Tensei (Summoning Jutsu\u2014Reanimation). [TL: ** was written in raw]</p><br/><p>Either of those ninjutsu were matchless. Relaying on \u2018Flying Thunder God jutsu\u2019, 4th hokage had got the nickname \u2018Yellow Flash of hidden leaf\u2019 and became one of the most powerful ninja in his time period. Relaying on \u2018Summoning Jutsu\u2014Reanimation\u2019 forbidden jutsu, Kabuto alone could actually hold on his own when fighting against the army of Allied force and after summoning Madara with that jutsu, he also succeed to force the allied force army to corner! So Ren Tian You thought that even though 2nd hokage was matchless genious, he was merely overshadowed by the matchless reputation of his brother 1st hokage, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>The main goal of Ren Tian You was to find a way back to Earth, and for this first he must learn and master space related ninjutsu. But even after researching and studying \u2018Flying Thunder God jutsu\u2019 for a long period of time, he still lacked the slightest knowledge of it. Because for learning this jutsu he should be first be capable to sense dimensional fluctuation. If he couldn\u2019t do that then forget about practicing and mastering, he couldn\u2019t even take the 1st step to start studying this jutsu. It\u2019s not that the strength of Ren Tian You was not enough to learn this jutsu, rather he was completely powerless to sense slightest fluctuation in dimension. So with no other choice, he thought about the shortcut, which was Sharingan.</p><br/><p>The powers of Sharingan is very mysterious and unparalleled. And after awakening Mangekyo Sharingan, the user can get even more unique or unusual ability. This includes the space-time related ability too!</p><br/><p>There were only 2 people with the Sharingan which possessed time-space related ability, they were Uchiha Madara and Uchiha Obito. Ren Tian You knew only one space-time related ability of Madara, which was temporal shift, this jutsu was shown once in Naruto world. And the space related ability of Uchiha Obito was even more prominent! The ability of this fellow could not only shift space but the user could send himself inside the different dimension to dodge the attacks, and he could also send other person inside his dimension where that person would be in his mercy. And his both eyes had the same ability and that ability was known as kamui. Kakashi who had left eye of Obito couldn\u2019t use the full version kamui, but even the uncompleted version was far more powerful.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was completely sure that for the time being he couldn\u2019t learn Flying Thunder God jutsu, so he wanted to awaken Mangekyo Sharingan of Uchiha Obito. Because he possessed Naruto system, he was not limited by any rule of original Naruto world. As long as he had enough system points he could awaken Mangekyo Sharingan of every person. So he came up with this shortcut which was to awaken Mangekyo Sharingan of Obito!</p><br/><p>Since he already realized that for the time being he couldn\u2019t learn Flying Thunder God jutsu, he thought \u2018Since I can\u2019t even sense space fluctuation, for now I won\u2019t dwell on it. After I personally let my body feel another space related jutsu, it would be easy to sense space fluctuation. Then I can easily learn this Flying Thunder God jutsu!\u201d As a result, Ren Tian You had gave up his plan to awaken Mangekyo of Sasuke, and decided to awaken Mangekyo of Uchiha Obito next.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tian You had already decided what to do next, he still had quite a numbers of matters that was troubling him. First was, his wind and lightning attributes\u2019 chakra nature change hadn\u2019t make any progress whatsoever, because of this he couldn\u2019t learn Futon\u2014Rasenshuriken (Wind Style\u2014Rasen Shuriken) ninjutsu. Second was quantity of system points! After exchanging Mangekyo Sharingan, he didn\u2019t have many system points left, so he must hurry and start earning system points. Third was the mission system of Naruto system! He had already own this Naruto system for more than 2 years but he hadn\u2019t completed even a single mission, because there was not even a single mission mentioned. So it was harder to collect system points. If this mission system had any missions then he would have another method to earn system points and he no longer need to kill magical beasts all day long like he is some kind of butcher.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, currently he still did not have full confidence, that he could successfully take revenge against Ximen clan. As one of the major clan among 4 clan of country of Emperor Ai Le, surely the strength of Ximen clan was not weak. Although he had power which was far more incomparable to previous Ximen Tian Long, still he didn\u2019t let this power to get into his head. Before taking revenge, Ren Tian You at least wanted to awaken Mangekyo Sharingan of Obito and completely master wind and thunder chakra nature change. Only after that he would start to take revenge against Ximen clan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

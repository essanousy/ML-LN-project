The floor where Sun Chuqian was originally standing at, suddenly cracked opened, then a magma erupted out from inside that crack.</p><br/><p>When Sun Chuqian felt an unusual change underneath her foot, she immediately dodged sideways. When she felt that she had dodged the attack, the shaking of the floor became even more intense. She saw many cracks on the floor, and a burning hot magma erupted out from each and every crack. Sun Chuqian hastily sidestepped, but the eruption of magma was excessively crowded together, and was impossible to completely dodge it. Since she was unable to dodge, she had no other choice but to use her own battle qi to break out from this situation and avoid the attack.</p><br/><p>Just when Sun Chuqian made a great effort to dodge jet of magma, suddenly a huge magma ball floated out in the air from the each and every cracks and appeared before her eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing that huge magma energy ball floating in the air, and was emitting a high temperature, the pupils of Sun Chuqian firmly shrunk, and yelled inside her heart, \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d, \u201cHong\u201d, \u201cHong\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.a series of loud explosion sound rang out, which was accompanied by the jet of magmas.

In the middle of this explosion, even Ren Tianyou himself didn\u2019t know what the condition of Sun Chuqian was.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Ren Tianyou quickly started to make a series of hand seals, then a powerful lightning appeared above his right hand which was accompanied by the ear-piercing sound of birds cry. Then in front of all those peoples in the audiences who were crying out in alarm, he rushed toward the arena in an extremely high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Zi.\u201d In a flash Ren Tianyou appeared at the edge of the arena, then without the slightest hesitation he stabbed at the barrier of the arena with chidori of his right hand. In a flash, a huge electric current sprang out from his right hand, and immediately after that a large amount of ripples appeared on the barrier.</p><br/><p>Although the energy of the barrier flickered in a high speed after it was hit, and the color of the barrier became dim nevertheless the Chidori of Ren Tianyou was not able to cut open the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Immediately Ren Tianyou was sent back flying by the rebound of the barrier. But he balanced himself in the air and firmly landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, are you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all right Tianyou, why are you attacking the barrier?\u201d After Wang Haiqing, other peoples also came near him and asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, I must quickly break this barrier, or else Chuqian won\u2019t be hold for a long period of time in this kind of huge series of explosion.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head and expressed his thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow student, if you attack the barrier again without rhyme or reason, I will cancel your qualification of this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, shut your mouth.\u201d Hearing the judge, already worried Ren Tianyou, suddenly got angry, and pair of Mangekyo Sharingan suddenly stared at that judge.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hearing the scold from Ren Tianyou, the judge immediately became angry, but just as he was about to open his mouth, he saw those eyes 2 demonic blood red colored eyes. Shortly after seeing those eyes, he suddenly sensed that more than 10 metal rods were inserted in his body and he could not even move a single section of his body. This was indeed Magen\u2014Kasegui no Jutsu (Demonic Illusions\u2014Shackle Stakes) of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>After he resolve the hindrance, a strong electric current sprang out from the body of Ren Tianyou, and it gradually attached around his body forming a lightning armor, then all his hairs stood erect. After that he bent all his four fingers of his right hand with the exception of his index finger and dashed towards the barrier again. \u201cJigokuzuki\u2014Ippon Nukite!\u201d (Hell Stab\u2014One-Finger Hand!)</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d immediately Ren Tianyou changed into an extremely sharp lightning spear and charged straightly towards the barrier of the arena.

It\u2019s already been a very long time since I encountered such an interesting youngster. I want like to see, how he handles this matter.\u201d Long Feilu shook his head and with a great interest in his eyes, he stared at Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In front of the surprised expression in the eyes of the peoples in the audience, in a flash Ren Tianyou destroyed the barrier of the arena, then quickly continued on towards the direction of the center of the explosion. \u201cHong long long\u201d Violent explosion sounds were still unceasingly ringing, nevertheless these explosion were powerless to destroy the lightning armor which he had activated beforehand.

Why are you here?\u201d Sensing her body was held by someone, the faint consciousness of Sun Chuqian became a bit clear. After carefully looking, she found out that the person was Ren Tianyou.

I don\u2019t know what your name is, but truly thank you.\u201d Hearing that man, Ren Tianyou thanked that man for the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, I am Yi Shui. As for thanks, it is not necessary as this is the thing I have to do as a priest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks brother Yi Shui, please wait a moment, I want to finish some matters first.\u201d Seeing that Wang Yanli had already withdrawn his wings of heaven and was standing at ruined arena after the explosion on the arena had stopped, a cold light flashed in the eyes of Ren Tianyou. Then leaving behind the afterimage, he rapidly dashed towards Wang Yanli.</p><br/><p>But even faster than Ren Tianyou, someone else had already arrived in front of Wang Yanli and just before Ren Tianyou knocked down Wang Yanli, that person blocked the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hearing this, the movement of Ren Tianyou slowly stopped.</p><br/><p>Hearing that gradually increasing dragon roars, Ren Tianyou made a wry smile, \u201cAi, I have never expected that most of the battles I have fought since I arrived in this different world is basically group brawls. First I fought over thousands bones of the dead ferocious beasts at God Weeping region. This time while attacking Ximen clan, first was group of god ranked experts, then 2 god domain experts joined, and finally after that the dragon clan are also joining. Ai, such a miserable life.\u201d</p><br/><p>But apart from making a wry smile, there was not a single trace of fear on his face. Because when he had killed that dragon Adelaide, he had already considered that he would become the mortal enemy of dragon clan as a consequence. And now since the dragon clan was helping his mortal enemy Ximen clan, they had also already became his enemies. And as a cultivator, if he couldn\u2019t move forward because of mere fear, then why on earth did he cultivate to gain strength? To become truly strong, one most not fear the sufferings, and should dare to challenge his own heart. No matter who, as long as he blocks ones way, one only had to destroy and thoroughly eliminate it.</p><br/><p>Just like Uchiha Madara of Naruto world, he himself faced whole ninja world, easily knocked down all 5 kages as if adult was teasing the child, and even while facing against the resurrected past hokages, there was not a single bit of fear in his face. He alone showed disdain for the whole ninja world. And exactly this type of strong heart was precisely something Ren Tianyou wanted to learn.</p><br/><p>As the black hole gradually enlarged, huge dragons emitting powerful aura flew out from inside that huge black hole. Flame dragon, Ice dragon, earth dragon, Holy dragon\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026over 20 dragons flew out from that black hole. From the aura they were emitting, all of them were god ranked dragons.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ren Tianyou sensed that 5 unusually powerful aura was coming out from inside that black hole, which firmly locked on to him. After that along with this 5 powerful aura, 5 lofty middle-aged person wearing golden battle armor came out from inside the black hole, and remained floating at the sky. After these 5 middle-aged person came out, that huge space black hole also slowly began to close up and finally disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026..\u201d Feeling the powerful aura all around him, the pupils of Ren Tianyou firmly shrunk, only now he finally sensed the feeling of danger. The aura of each of these 5 middle-aged person were comparable to Ximen Zhou, as all of them were experts of High God realm. And now including Ximen Zhou, there were 6 experts of High God realm, Ximen Wuyan who was Mid God realm expert, and furthermore those more than 20 god ranked dragons. Seeing this impressive lineups, the complexion of Ren Tianyou finally changed, \u201cOh, this situation is anything but reassuring. If they jointly attack with this kind of formation, sooner or later I\u2019ll fall. Never expected that this dragon clan would actually use this kind of amazing lineups to entertain me. They really thought high of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ximen Batian, that old bastard is still not dead, so I cannot retreat. If I withdraw now,Ximen Batian will absolutely hide inside Ximen clan, and it will not be easy kill him.\u201d Thinking this, an ominous glint flashed in his eyes, and continued, \u201cSince it is like this, then I will stir up even more big turmoil, and let the name Akatsuki reverberate through this whole continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, didn\u2019t expect that Wuyan furthermore you, old barbarian also came out.\u201d One of the 5 middle-aged man with fiery red colored long hair said with a surprise, after seeing Ximen Zhou and Ximen Wuyan floating in the sky a distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, we Ximen clan is almost about to get wipd out leaving behind none. So without coming out, do you want us to helplessly look at the destruction of our Ximen clan?\u201d Ximen Zhou said in a bad mood. Recalling that he was forced to helplessly look at the slaughter of the member of his Ximen clan, he looked at Ren Tianyou with eyes full of killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Adilasi, don\u2019t excite him anymore, aren\u2019t we here to seek the killer of Adelaide? Quickly kill that fellow, take his soul to the cave of dragon god flame and burn his soul by dragon flame for sever thousand years.\u201d At the side of this red haired middle-aged man i.e. Adilasi, another middle-aged man whose body was surrounded with earth yellow colored aura opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie jie, Andongni, the soul of this fellow is mine. I want to use his soul to make undead warrior. Daring to kill members of our dragon clan, it seems power and might of our dragon clan are completely forgotten by the humans, since we didn\u2019t move around for these last few years.\u201d A middle-aged man with grey colored long hair said with his unpleasant to hear voice while smiling strangely.</p><br/><p>After his brief remark, remaining 2 middle-aged person also joined in the quarrel. And the other dragons just flew around without any surprise on their face, because even in Dragon Island, these 5 were always like this.</p><br/><p>All 5 of them were person occupying leading position of Dragon clan in Dragon Island. And all of them had reached the realm of High God in strength. And after reaching High God realm, Dragon clan were able to use their power to change their dragon body into that of human body. These 5 individuals were, Flame dragon Adilasi, Earth dragon Andongni, Death dragon Buliqite, Ice dragon KeluoYi, and Holy dragon Xilaisite. Originally when they had heard that the killer of Adelaide had appeared, they had immediately assembled Dragon clansmen. And at first they had no intention to send all 5 of them, but seeing the destruction Ren Tianyou caused at God weeping region, they increased their guard against Ren Tianyou. And this time Buluke had return back with the information that Ren Tianyou had surprise attack on Ximen clan, so dragon clan decided to dispatch all 5 of them, so as to be prepared for all contingencies.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, according to that Buluke, Adelieya and Bulaici, these two dumb idiot stayed behind to help Ximen clan, so where did those two go?\u201d At this time, Holy dragon Xilaisite stopped quarreling, look all around, and said confusedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you about it.\u201d At that time, the voice of Ren Tianyou entered the ears of those 5 middle-aged person whose true form was that of dragon. \u201cThose 2 lizards have long since died by my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard! Say that again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After hearing Ren Tianyou, all 5 of them instantly stared Ren Tianyou with furious looks, complexion became unsightly, and cursed Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just stating the fact.\u201d Ren Tianyou indifferently shrugged his shoulder, and the next sentence of Ren Tianyou thoroughly angered these 5 dragons almost causing them to explode. \u201cThe one called Adelaide or something, my sword cutoff its head and it died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut those 2 lizards were even more miserable.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at the unsightly expression of those 5 dragons, and with a smile on his face, he added, \u201cThose 2 didn\u2019t even leave behind their corpse, as they were directly changed into powder by my attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, Bastard, I, your father will butcher you.\u201d Hearing the words of Ren Tianyou, the Fire dragon Adilasi who had extremely violent temper roared in anger. Then his body directly changed into blazing flame light beam and shot towards Ren Tianyou. In a blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Ren Tianyou, and swung his right hand towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s head. \u201cGo to hell, you bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, solidify forever\u2014-Time stop!\u201d Seeing Adilasi in front of him, Ren Tianyou sneered with disdain. Although his speed was extremely fast, but under the Mangekyo Sharingan of Ren Tianyou, it was nothing. Along with the huge amount of eye power gushing out from his left eye, suddenly an aura of profound mystery spread in all direction, and the fist originally about to hit his head, abruptly stopped, and the figure of flame dragon also became standstill in the sky maintaining his previous action.</p><br/><p>\u201cKonoha Daisenpu! (Severe Leaf Hurricane!)\u201d Immediately after Adilasi stopped in the air, Ren Tianyou directly kicked his head. And along with a \u2018peng\u2019 sound, Adilasi was immediately kicked flying. And while in the mid-air, the effect of Time stop Ren Tianyou had used on the body of Adilasi ended, and he also instantly woke up, flew several meters back and finally stabilized his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdilasi, are you alright?\u201d Seeing that Adilasi was kicked flying back, other 4 superior dragons came over and asked Adilasi with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright!\u201d Adialsi shook his head, then wiped the blood flowing out from the corner of his mouth with his right hand, and rubbed his aching face, while looking at Ren Tianyou with a strange complexion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdilasi, what happened just a moment ago?\u201d Jus at this time, ice dragon Keluoyi asked confusedly. At that time when they heard the words of Ren Tianyou, all of them were angry, so they merely heard Adilasi roaring in anger, then saw him already kicked flying back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know what had happened at that time. Just when my fist was about to hit this guy, I don\u2019t know what happened, but my body was already hit flying back.\u201d Adilasi shook his head, as he had also no idea what had happened at that time.</p><br/><p>This was the doujutsu of Ren Tianyou\u2019s left eye\u2014- solidify forever\u2019s ability to control time. As a matter of fact, during the time when he was affected by this doujutsu of Ren Tianyou, Adilasi\u2019s consciousness was completely shut off, that means he was not able to know what had happened within that time, or had the memory of that time interval. This was the powerful ability of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, since you have arranged such a magnificent lineup to welcome me, I also should take this seriously.\u201d When all 5 dragons were puzzled, the voice of Ren Tianyou entered their ears. After speaking he bit the thumb finger of both his hands, and blood flowed out from his thumb fingers, after that Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, then both hand pressed down in the sky. Suddenly two mysterious runes seals spread all around sky in the sky from his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose no Jutsu! (Summoning Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along wth the voice of Ren Tianyou, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, two sound rang out and two large white colored smoke suddenly appeared in the sky. After that two voices came from inside these smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, you finally summon ore-sama, I hope I can have a satisfying fight this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are summoning me, that means the enemies have already appeared, is that right Tianyou?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

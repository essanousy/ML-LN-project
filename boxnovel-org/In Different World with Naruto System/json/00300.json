After that slowly turning around, he looked behind.</p><br/><p>After turning around, Ren Tianyou saw that robust man called Labake who had retreated after Yaorao had scolded him inside the pub was chasing after him from inside the pub.</p><br/><p>Right now this robust man called Labake\u2019s face appeared to be pitch-black, and his two big bull eyes were firmly staring at Ren Tianyou with ominous glint.</p><br/><p>From the time this Labake had seen Yaorao for the first time, her beauty that was unrivalled within the entire city had deeply attracted him.</p><br/><p>And with an identity of being brother-in-law of the city lord of Bloody Cloud City, this Labake was always arrogant, domineering and act wickedly within this city. And at the time he had seen Yaorao for the first time, he wanted to take her to his home by force.</p><br/><p>But his brother-in-law i.e. the city lord of Bloody Cloud City stopped him. He told him that whatever happens he must never provoke this Yaorao. If he (Labake) offend her, then he (city lord) would break all the relation he (city lord) had with him (Labake).</p><br/><p>Although he Labake would act wickedly relying on his identity as a brother-in-law of city lord, but he was just a bungling oaf. He also clearly knew that everything of his were given to him by his brother-in-law, so after hearing the words of his brother-in-law, he hastily agreed to his brother-in-law.</p><br/><p>And the matter that had happened next made Labake even more terrified of Yaorao. Once the eldest son of Bloody Cloud City\u2019s foremost clan carelessly offended this Yaorao, and on the same night, this entire clan was massacred leaving none behind.</p><br/><p>The next day, only the corpses were found inside the residence of this clan, but no one had heard or sense any battle activity within this clan in the previous night.</p><br/><p>One should know that there was two True God realm experts within this clan.</p><br/><p>Although the big forces within Bloody Cloud City knew who had done this deed, but all of them selected to suppress this matter.</p><br/><p>Still although this Labake couldn\u2019t obtain Yaorao, but inside his heart, he however had already regarded her as his woman, and didn\u2019t let anyone to touch her.</p><br/><p>But today seeing Yaorao and Ren Tianyou were merrily talking with each other, he intentionally came to disrupt things, but outside of his expectation, he was reprimanded by Yaorao, so he hated Ren Tianyou on the spot. But he didn\u2019t dare to raise his hand inside the pub, but outside, he however didn\u2019t have any worries.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d Looking at Labake\u2019s that black as if carbon ash face, Ren Tianyou expressionlessly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, dumb idiot, relying on your white face, you dared to seduce big sister Yaorao, today if I don\u2019t kill you, then you will not know the power of I, Labake.\u201d Crackling the finger bones of his hands, Labake slowly walked towards Ren Tianyou from a flight of steps of the pub entrance.</p><br/><p>And the activity of this side attracted the attention of the pedestrians walking around them. All of them surrounded Ren Tianyou and Labake and began to watch the drama.</p><br/><p>All of these people knew Labake, and they also naturally knew his behavior too, so all of them sighed one after another thinking someone was out of his luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell, dumb idiot. Tiger Roar Wave!\u201d Labake gathered huge amount of black colored magical power within his body, then brandished his fist, sending out huge black colored magic tiger towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing the move used by Labake, the onlookers around again sighed one after another thinking Ren Tianyou was screwed.</p><br/><p>Because although the character of Labake was not decent, but he was Peak Deity ranked expert. And as for Ren Tianyou, no matter how they looked at it, he was merely Intermediate Fighter in strength, so how could he be the opponent of Labake?</p><br/><p>This huge black colored magic tiger quickly reached Ren Tianyou, and with the roaring sound, it directly swallowed Ren Tianyou, then along with the loud explosion sound, it exploded, and huge shockwaves spread in all direction.</p><br/><p>The onlookers tumbled backwards due to the wind and waves of this explosion, and simultaneously thought that this boy ought to be already torn into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, this damned bastard, this time you died without a place for burial.\u201d Seeing his black tiger had swallowed Ren Tianyou and exploded, Labake open his mouth and laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d At that moment, an indifferent voice came out from inside the explosion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Hearing this voice coming out from the cloud of dusts raised by explosion, the surroundings onlookers of Demon clan simultaneously thought inwardly.</p><br/><p>When the cloud of dusts raised by explosion dissipated, everyone could clearly see Ren Tianyou. And seeing Ren Tianyou, the pupils of all of the onlookers couldn\u2019t help but shrunk firmly, and a word simultaneously appeared within their heart, \u201cMonster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now the clothing on the upper part of his body had already fallen off, and was hanging down from his waist. And countless white bones were unexpectedly sticking out from his body, forming a bone shield in front of him. This looked very terrifying.</p><br/><p>This was Ren Tianyou using the ability of Shikotsumyaku to manipulate the bones within his body for defense. Now that he had entered Demon World and was disguising himself as demon of Bone Demon clan, he wanted to play this part up to the par.</p><br/><p>And although the strength of this Labake was very weak compared to himself, but his human body was not strong like that of Demon clan. If he use Raiton Chakura Modo (Cloak of Lightning), then this attack would have tickled him at best, but he however couldn\u2019t reveal his ninjutsu casually.</p><br/><p>Moreover since he had chosen to use the identity of Bone Demon clan as a disguise, using the ability of Shikotsumyaku was the best choice. This was also something Ren Tianyou had already thought in advance before entering the city of Demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly this level of power and you want to have a beauty for yourself, isn\u2019t this overrating yourself?\u201d Looking at surprised Labake, Ren Tianyou sneered in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s those mocking words, the complexion of Labake immediately become red in shame, then rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, overestimating your capabilities!\u201d Seeing Labake rushing towards him, Ren Tianyou sneered in disdain, then stretched his hands. After that the fingertips of his ten finger unceasingly wriggled, shortly afterwards ten tiny sharp bones shot towards Labake.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeshi Sendan! (Digital Shrapnel!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing sharp bones, the complexion of Labake changed, then waving his right hand, he created a black colored energy barrier in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026muffled sound unceasingly rang out. These tiny bones collided against the barrier and fell down. The color of this barrier also unceasingly became dim, and finally broke apart. After that remaining two bones directly shot into the shoulder of Labake.</p><br/><p>Labake gave out a blood-curdling scream, then covering his shoulder with his right hand, he fell down to the ground. And a dark red colored blood flowed out from his covered shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the level of your skill? Trash!\u201d Looking at Labake who was knocked down with only one move, Ren Tianyou sneered.</p><br/><p>Although the reason why Ren Tianyou was able to defeat Labake in a single move was because there was a huge gap in strength between himself and Labake, but the ability of this Shikotsumyaku being too terrifying was also another reason.</p><br/><p>The ability of Shikotsumyaku if used for attack, then it was strongest attacking spear, and if used for defense, then it was strongest shield.</p><br/><p>In the first place, even when Garra had buried Kimimaro 50 meters deep underground, and applied the big pressure, he was still unable to kill him, this shows the strength of Shikotsumyaku.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me, I beg you.\u201d Seeing those eyes of Ren Tianyou flashing with ominous glint, Labake said with trembling legs and fear written all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling you will only dirty my hand, so I don\u2019t feel like killing you.\u201d Seeing that fearful look of Labake, Ren Tianyou said in disdain.</p><br/><p>Inside the pub, Yaorao stood beside the window. Seeing the situation outside, her lips which were full of charm slightly bend upward. After that raising her right hand in front of her, she muttered, \u201cInteresting youngster, in this several ten thousand years, you are the first person I was not able to see through. Let me use this trash to test out your potential. Hope you will not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, with the wave of her right hand\u2019s finger, then a purple colored energy passed through window and directly shot outside. After that it entered the tiny bone beside Labake.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for not killing\u2026\u2026eh!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou would not kill him, Labake immediately got excited, and thanked to Ren Tianyou. But before he could finish thanking, the tiny bone with purple light directly shot straight into the space between his eyes.</p><br/><p>The words of Labake immediately stopped, and blood began to flow out from the hole in the space between his eyes. After that his consciousness slowly dissipated. And his last thought was why did Ren Tianyou go back on his words and kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d The instant that bone had flown, Ren Tianyou immediately realized that this was bad, but he was too late to react.</p><br/><p>Now seeing Labake had died, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have time to carefully search who secretly framed him. Now he could only use his fastest speed to run away from here.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou ran away leaving behind the corpse of Labake and those dumbfounded onlookers.</p><br/><p>Inside the pub, seeing Ren Tianyou had quickly ran away, Yaorao slightly smiled and her beautiful body changed into purple colored mist and disappeared from that place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

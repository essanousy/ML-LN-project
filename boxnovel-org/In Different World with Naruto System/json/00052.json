Originally there was not any design on the surface of the plate but now he saw that there was a star pattern above the gold colored plate. This was the proof of victory, and was necessary to participate in next match. The unconscious Li Yi was carried him down from the arena by his classmates.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou also stepped down from the arena. He estimate that there won\u2019t be any match for him in the morning, or at least until afternoon. So he decided to watch the match of other participant. At that time, Ren Tianyou discovered Yan Xinluo on the arena, he saw that Yan Xinluo had just stepped on the arena. As always his face was completely devoid of emotion and was firmly staring at his opponent.</p><br/><p>The opponent of Yan Xinluo was also from warrior court, and had the strength of about great swordsman level. Along with the announcement from the judge to start of the match, the opponent of Yan Xinluo immediately dashed towards Yan Xinluo with a huge sword in his hand. When the distance between them was just about 2 or 3 meter, suddenly an earth colored radiance of the battle qi appeared around the body of the opponent. Then he waved his huge sword with his both hands and heavily hit the ground in front to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A huge sound of explosion rang, then the surface of the earth started to split open and the attack advance towards Yan Xinluo at a high speed. This attack caused a deep crack to appear on the surface stone arena.</p><br/><p>Yan Xinluo was calmly looking at the approaching attack. Just when this attack was going to hit him, a grey colored undead battle qi suddenly appeared around the body of Yan Xinluo. A short sword was also already in his right hand. Then he poured his undead battle qi into his short sword. After that, he quickly threw his short sword towards the incoming attack. Then his right foot heavily stepped on the ground, and then he dashed in a high speed following his own short knife.</p><br/><p>Merely after 2 seconds, the short sword of Yan Xinluo and \u2018earth explosion\u2019 made a contact with each other. In that instance, the grey colored battle qi pour out from that short knife, and covered the earth explosion\u2019s yellow colored sword slash. And the yellow colored sword slash was completely corroded. Even after that the speed of the short knife didn\u2019t decrease, and still advanced towards the opponent of Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>That guy saw that his attack was destroyed in a flash, and because of that single attack, he directly fell into a perilous situation. Seeing the speed of that short sword, that fellow was completely surprised. And without wasting any time he waved his huge sword to block that short sword. But is he really able to block it?</p><br/><p>\u201cDing!\u201d A metal colliding sound rang. Afterwards that fellow felt as if both of his hands were hit by the huge force of 10000 ton. Then suddenly he felt that his blood started to flow in reverse, and blood started to gush out from his mouth. Both of his hands were completely numb, and the huge sword he was holding dropped from his hand. After that he had no other choice but to helplessly look at the short sword in front of him which was advancing towards his face. So he gave up all his hope and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>But even after a long time, he didn\u2019t felt any pain, so he couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes to confirm. Just when he opened his eyes, he saw that the tip of that short sword was just before his eyes. It was less than 3 centi-meter away from his nose. Seeing this he couldn\u2019t help but suddenly felt a deep fear causing him to retreat few steps back and fell down on the ground.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the judge announced Yan Xinluo as the winner of the match. Hearing the announcement of his victory, Yan Xinluo withdrew his sword and returned it inside its sheath. Then he stretched his hand and catch the number plate which was tossed by the judge. After that he stepped down from the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never thought that, this undead battle qi actually had this powerful corroding effect. Its power is comparable to dark system battle qi\u2019s corroding effect. This undead battle qi is quite abnormal ah.\u201d Seeing the corroding effect of undead battle qi, Ren Tianyou unconsciously muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Among the crowd, watching the match of Yan Xinluo, a young man wearing the fairy red colored magic robe showed the smiling expression. Then without looking back he left that area.</p><br/><p>Far away at one corner, seeing the match of Yan Xinluo, a man wearing a close combat dress, suddenly creased his brows and mumbled, \u201cI have never thought that a member of Sishen clan had also come out into this world. It seems this Divine wind continent is going to be lively again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou continued to watch several matches. Sun Chuqian and Wang Haiqing also won their respective match. Even Li Yun who was only at peak great swordsman level had smoothly won his first match. After watching the match for a while, he found nothing worth watching. So he walked towards the area where the competition of 2nd year was being held. After walking about 10 minutes, he arrived at a big square. After looking for a while, he finally discovered Lan Yan and others. They were seriously watching towards the arena. And when he also looked towards the arena, there was an old acquaintance on the arena. That old acquaintance was love rival of Ren Tianyou, Lan Yin.</p><br/><p>Although this boy is a bit different from Lan Yan and others, nevertheless his strength is not that weak. In terms of strength, he is already at mid-sword master level. And the speed of this kid was so fast that only his after images were seen on the arena. He was wind system warrior and had inherited the blood lineage \u2018gentle gale dance\u2019 of his clan, as a result the power of his wind system battle qi was completely maximized. Along with relentless attack of Lan Yin, finally his opponent was knocked outside the arena.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian walked up and tapped the shoulder of Long You, \u201cWho ah, don\u2019t you see I, your father\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026eh, Tianyou. How are you?\u201d While he was watching the match, Long You felt that someone was tapping his shoulder. Immediately he turned his head and was ready to curse the person who had disturbed him while he was watching the match. However when he turned around his head, he saw Ren Tianyou was that person. So he immediately swallowed back all the curses.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now I seemed to hear, someone claiming himself to be my father ah.\u201d Seeing the opened mouth of Long You, Ren Tianyou said smiling. But seeing the smile of Ren Tianyou, Long You suddenly felt a chill inside his heart and started to tremble all over the body. Then without wasting any time smiling apologetically he said, \u201cHeh heh, Tianyou, you must have heard wrongly, I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, how come you are here? Don\u2019t you have your match?\u201d Hearing the voice of Ren Tianyou, Lan Yan and other also turned around. Then Lan Yan suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, my match is already finished. So I came here to watch the match of Tianxing and Li Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Tianyou, you already finish you match, isn\u2019t it a bit too fast! The match of my brother and Li Feng was very early, so their matches are already over.\u201d Luo Meng Wu was little bit surprised, she didn\u2019t thought that he had actually finished his match this quickly. If they knew that Ren Tianyou had completed the match within 10 seconds, they would have been even more surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder, you all are watching the match of Lan Yin. Oh, that\u2019s right, since the match of Tianxing and Li Feng is already over, where are both of them now?\u201d Ren Tianyou already heard that both of them had won their match, but he didn\u2019t see the figure of them. So he asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of them were called by our teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the match of Lan Yin was finished and he came towards Lan Yan and others. When he saw Ren Tianyou, the body of Lan Yin was clearly stiffed. Although Lan Yin no longer hates Ren Tianyou for the matter of Luo Mengwu, nevertheless he didn\u2019t have any good opinion towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect you are also here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, of course, I am everywhere.\u201d Seeing Lan Yin, suddenly Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t bear but to make fun of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Hearing the obvious teasing voice of Ren Tianyou, Lan Yin suddenly snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, both of you stop it. Let\u2019s go to dining hall and have a meal. Perhaps both Tianxing and Li Feng would look for us there.\u201d Seeing the scene in front of him, Long You hastily called everyone to go for a meal at dining hall. After that all of them walked towards the dining hall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

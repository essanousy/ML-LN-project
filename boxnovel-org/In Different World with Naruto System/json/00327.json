And in the sky, along with the dissipation of purple colored radiances, Yaorao\u2019s that attractive beautiful figure appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, damned Demon Empress, you actually dared to appear in front of me, I will devoured you alive. It is because of you, I am sealed here for such a long time.\u201d After seeing the figure of Yaorao and sensing that familiar aura, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast instantly exploded with violent rage, and its body released boundless stifling aura, which rapidly spread in all direction, causing the surrounding space to emit a creaking sound as if it would scatter at any time.</p><br/><p>Sensing that stifling aura, Ren Tianyou emitted a purple ash colored lightning spark blocking this oppressive aura. But as for Yaorao above, she completely ignored this powerful aura of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cThousand Eyes Evil Beast, inside this seal, you have no chance to win against me.\u201d Looking at angry Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, Yaorao coldly snorted in disdain. Shortly afterwards, a purple colored energy ball flew out from her body. This energy ball emitted an unusually evil purple aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing that purple energy ball, the pupils of Ren Tianyou shrunk firmly, as he instantly knew this was bad. Last time when he was fighting against Yaorao, he however had clearly seen that Yaorao had precisely used the energy of this purple energy ball to completely seal the space.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want same thing to happen here, so he immediately used Hiraishin no Jutsu to leave the seal.</p><br/><p>And within the seal, seeing that purple energy ball in front of Yaorao, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast instantly exclaimed, \u201cThis is Universe Boundary Divine Artifact\u2014-Purple Ling Dark Break.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this purple energy ball appeared, Yaorao stretched her right hand\u2019s index and middle finger side by side, then softly chanted the incantation.</p><br/><p>After nearly five second, huge purple colored energy chains appeared from the surrounding seals, densely covering the entire space within the seal. And under the control of Yaorao, they directly tied up the body of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, making it unable to move in midair. Even with its exceedingly high strength, under this energy chains, it was unable to struggle free.</p><br/><p>After doing all this, Yaorao looked at this tied up in midair Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, and waved her right hand, then that purple colored crystal ball suddenly changed into a light and flew into the seal, and emitting a large amount of purple energy, it began supplying energy to the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stay here, after I deal with that human, I\u2019ll come back to sort you out.\u201d Looking at this trapped Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, Yaorao slowly said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, don\u2019t run, damned Demon Empress, quickly release I, your father.\u201d Sensing its body was firmly bound, and it was unable to move even a bit, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast loudly roared.</p><br/><p>But Yaorao completely ignored the howl of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast. Then with her body slowly changing into a purple colored mist, she disappeared from there. And what Yaorao didn\u2019t notice was, after she left, the ground within the seal slowly loosen.</p><br/><p>And above the wasteland not far away, the figure of Yaorao appeared in front of Ren Tianyou. \u201cNever thought that after fleeing last time, you\u2019d still dare to return here. It seems I cannot show you mercy this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, who show mercy towards whom is still not certain.\u201d Looking at Yaorao who had appeared in front of him, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly without running away, rather quickly began to make a series of hand seals. He wanted to test out how high his current combat strength was.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Style\u2014-Grand Nine Flame Dragons Formation!\u201d Ren Tianyou shouted loudly taking the lead to make a move. He spat out blazing flame from his mouth which took the form of nine huge fire dragon and advanced towards Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoring cheap trick.\u201d Looking at those nine huge fire dragons flying towards her, a disdain flashed in the eyes of Yaorao. She just waved her right hand, and majestic purple colored energy changed into a huge purple colored energy barrier in front of her, firmly blocking this fire style ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>After that both hands brandishing purple colored energy thread, Yaorao formed a purple colored six edged star in front of her, then she pointed at this purple colored six edged star with her right hand\u2019s index finger. After that this purple colored six edged star suddenly changed into a huge six-pointed star and advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Six Edged Purple Baleful Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that huge purple colored six edged star rushing towards him, Ren Tianyou shouted loudly and simultaneously began to quickly make a series of hand seals. Then shadow clone appeared beside him, and this shadow clone released large amount of wind attributed chakra in his right hand, \u201cDo you think same trick will work against me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, ear-piercing sharp sound resounded throughout the entire horizon. A super huge wind attributed energy shuriken appeared in the right hand of Ren Tianyou. Along with this the appearance of this shuriken in his right hand, the shadow clone also changed into white smoke and disappeared due to the exhaustion of chakra.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Futon\u2014Choodama Rasenshuriken! (Wind Style\u2014-Massive Rasen Shuriken!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou shouted loudly, and directly threw this huge rasen shuriken. The extremely powerful cutting power of rasen shuriken directly sliced that huge purple colored six edged star into two halves, and these two halves changed into purple colored energy and dissipated in the air.</p><br/><p>And as for rasen shuriken, without losing any of its strength, it rapidly advanced towards Yaorao, as if it wanted to slice her into two halves.</p><br/><p>Looking at this huge rasen shuriken, Yaorao slightly frowned. Even she felt danger sensing the energy being emitted from this rasen shuriken. And now it was already too late for her to dodge, because she was too close to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>With no other choice, Yaorao rapidly brandished her hands, and the purple colored energy formed a seal formula in front of her chest, while simultaneously chanting the incantation. And along with the rapid surge of energy, twelve purple colored rhombus shield formed in front of her.</p><br/><p>And purple colored energy runes were depicted above these purple colored shields, and those runes were emitting powerful purple colored energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Defense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yaorao softly spat out two words, and those purple energy shields suddenly rose above the head of Yaorao, then emitted purple colored light screen, guarding all around Yaorao.</p><br/><p>And just then, the rasen shuriken directly collided against this light screen, and suddenly loud ear-piercing sound reverberated in the sky.</p><br/><p>And Yaorao poured her powerful purple colored energy from within her body to maintain this Purple Defense.</p><br/><p>And just at that time, Ren Tianyou who was standing at a distant point softly spat out one word, \u201cExplode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, rasen shuriken suddenly exploded with a bang, and large explosion engulfed the surroundings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I think it is very likely that Zero had ran into strong enemy here, and gone through a battle. And I think both of them suffered loss in the end.\u201d Seeing the scene around her, Vermilion Bird immediately understood that this was the place every one were looking for, and she determined that this place was definitely the place where Zero had met with mishap.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Just at that time, Southern Dipper suddenly called out to everyone, then leaving behind after image, he disappeared and then instantly appeared in the midair a little above the center of the crater. And seeing Southern Dipper had suddenly descended, White Tiger and others also immediately followed after himhim.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see what that is?\u201d Pointing at underneath pool of blood as well as half piece of arm beside that pool of blood, Southern Dipper asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not the clothing of Zero.\u201d carefully looking at that tattered black battle armor on that arm, White Tiger said. \u201cThat ought to be the arm of the person whom Zero was fighting at that time. Depending on the situation he might have already died without a place for burial.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where is Zero? According to the aura of Fire of Life, Zero is still not dead, but is severely injured.\u201d Great Bear lifted his head and looking all around, he said what everyone was thinking right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, please be fine ah.\u201d Looking at the bleak and dislocated scene, Little Yu put together the palms and prayed. Since it was not clear whether Ren Tianyou was dead or alive, her beautiful eyes couldn\u2019t help but shed tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu, you don\u2019t need to be sad, Little You, he is definitely fine.\u201d Seeing broken-hearted Little Yu, although she herself was also extremely worried, but Muyue however strengthen her mind and consoled Little Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet Jade Maiden use her ability to take a look at what had happened here before.\u201d Seeing sad Little Yu, Southern Dipper sighed, then said while looking towards Jade Maiden.</p><br/><p>Jade Maiden nodded her head, and just when she was about to use her ability to look at what had happened here before, White Tiger suddenly shouted towards empty void.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d White Tiger instantly reacted by pulling out long sword from his back, and prepared to slash out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d At that time, a voice everyone was familiar with suddenly resounded, and White Tiger immediately stopped his action.</p><br/><p>After that everyone excitedly turned towards the origin of this voice, and saw Ren Tianyou standing in midair with pale complexion. And with tiny wounds all over his body, he looked incomparably miserable.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, very good, I finally find you, wuwu\u2026\u2026..\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou, Little Yu instantly threw herself into the bosom of Ren Tianyou, and yelled while weeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u2026\u201d When Little Yu hit his bosom, Ren Tianyou instantly felt incomparable pain from his injuries, and involuntarily hissed in pain with his face twitching few times, but he still endured it. After that looking at Little Yu in his bosom, he consoled, \u201cLittle Yu, I am fine, don\u2019t feel sad. Now everyone is looking at you because when you cry, you resemble a floret cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, what\u2019s going on here? We discover your Fire of Life was very dim, so we knew that you have met with accident. After that while searching for you, we finally find this place.\u201d Seeing wounds all over the body and pale face of Ren Tianyou, Great Bear solemnly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was very difficult for you all to arrive here searching for me.\u201d Seeing everyone had arrived at ninth floor of Tower of Babel, Ren Tianyou nodded his head. Actually he didn\u2019t think that the strength of everyone was actually this strong, unexpectedly was able to find this place where he had his battle.</p><br/><p>But the external wounds on his body of this time were not the wounds he had suffered during the fight against Amike, rather were the wounds he had suffered from using Hiraishin no Jutsu.</p><br/><p>Against the expectation of Ren Tianyou, when he had used Hiraishin no Jutsu to teleport, he unexpectedly sensed a strong barrier. Fortunately his Hiraishin no Jutsu in itself was incomparably mysterious space-time ninjutsu, so using his powerful strength, he forcibly spilt open that blocking barrier.</p><br/><p>But because of internal injuries, the space storm that sprang out at the instant when barrier was broken however gave him additional wounds, as a result Ren Tianyou appeared before them in this incomparably miserable state.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that place I was in at that time is not within Divine Wind Continent. After all of my injuries are healed, I should go there again and take a look at what world that is.\u201d Thinking about that huge space barrier, Ren Tianyou slowly thought within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Zero, what happened here, don\u2019t tell me that all the state here is caused by you.\u201d Looking at those place where the land had disappeared, White Tiger asked to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, originally I only wanted to explore Tower of Babel, but who would have thought that there was unexpectedly a powerful Demon clan hidden here. And that Demon clan was none other than one of the three Great Demon God of that time, Sealing Heaven Demon God\u2014-Amike.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Great Demon God?\u201d Hearing the words of Ren Tianyou, everyone present in the scene cried out in alarm. They knew that the experts of Demon clan of those years were sealed within Tower of Babel, but none of them had ever thought that there actually was such a big BOSS hidden here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the strength of this Demon clan was very strong, and we fought here. I went all-out in this battle and was in slightly advantage position, but at the final moment, this Demon clan selected the move of both sides suffering the loss. Although he finally died, but I also nearly lost my life. And although I luckily return back alive, but I am also severely injured.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head and briefly explained his previous battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, you really didn\u2019t disappointed me. You finally returned here alive.\u201d At this moment, a simple and vigorous voice suddenly resounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hearing this sudden voice, everyone instantly become alert and looked towards the origin of this voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He, however, only liked a single anime series, Naruto, for no reason at all.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was a second year university student in H City. But don\u2019t even mention losing his virginity, he didn\u2019t even had a girlfriend.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not like he was ugly, he only had a little fault with his character\u2014\u2014cooping up in his residence. Correct, cooping up in his residence. This fellow loved to shut himself in his rented room and watch the history or creation of Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto on his computer. Naruto updated every Thursday, an event he wouldn\u2019t miss even once.</p><br/><p>Once, the classmates of Ren Tian You wondered why he always nesting in his house and didn\u2019t go out. They even thought that he was \u2018building a golden house to keep his mistress\u2019 [TL: doing something secretly], as he always looked impatient to go back to his house after class. Once, they secretly followed him to his house, and the next thing they saw made a black line appear on their faces. They saw him returning to the house, directly turning on the computer and going \u2018tudou.com\u2019 [TL: Chinese video sharing site] to watch Naruto. This made the classmates who were following him greatly depressed.</p><br/><p>Today the new Naruto episode 563 [ED: seems to be Shippuden episode 343] was updated. The teaser said that in this episode Naruto\u2019s opponent\u2019s [ED: Tobi\u2019s] mask would be destroyed and his real face will be revealed. So it could not be missed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was anxiously looking at the 60 second advertisement countdown on the upper \u00adright corner of video player. The 1 second that was remaining finally passed. When he was ready to watch with complete passion, he heard a \u2018tudou\u2019 sound and he saw the large words, \u201cError code 2011.\u201d</p><br/><p>At once his anger exploded in a flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, F**king trash tudou.\u201d</p><br/><p>His right hand suddenly grabbed the cup on the table and threw it at the computer, however he had forgotten that there was still tea inside the cup. The tea directly splashed on the plug of the computer; instantly a series of sparks were generated which spread along the top of the table to his right hand.</p><br/><p>In that instant, before the electric sparks reached his body, his last thought was, \u201cF**k, I will never throw anything again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Divine Wind Continent, the country of Emperor Ai le. In its eastern area there was a magical beast forest which was filled with terrifying magical beasts. This place was paradise for many adventurers because they could hunt high level magical beasts and suddenly become rich overnight, no longer needing to worry about eating and drinking in their lifetime. But there were also countless adventurers who had forever slept in the forest because of their low actual strength.</p><br/><p>In the magical beast forest\u2019s surroundings there was a small stream, at whose side lay a youth who was wearing luxurious clothes. This youth looked to be 15 years in age but he didn\u2019t have a trace of childishness in his face and those two dashing eyebrows increased his handsomeness even more. At this time the right hand of this youth slowly moved few times, he slowly opened his eyes and with a puzzled expression he looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere am I? Don\u2019t tell me I didn\u2019t die?\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly stood up, looked around at his surrounding environment and only towering tree appeared in his vision. He was completely puzzled looking at the huge towering trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hold his head and unceasingly rolled on the ground as one scene after another flashed through his mind. After a few minutes, he stopped whining and forced a bitter smile on his pale face.</p><br/><p>Divine Wind Continent, the country of Emperor Ai le\u2026\u2026\u2026.Ximen Tian Long, scion of the Ximen household, hehe, I had never thought one day I would unexpectedly be reborn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Correct, Ren Tian You was no longer on Earth, but was rather reborn in the world called Divine Wind Continent and the name of his current body was Ximen Tian Long who was of the \u2018Ximen\u2019 clan. This clan was one of the four major clans in this country of Emperor Ai le. Don\u2019t see the peculiar domineering name of this guy, because this guy is hundred percent a loser. [TL: \u2018Tian Long\u2019 means Dragon of Heaven] The thing is, his mother was just a female servant of Ximen family, and 5 years after giving birth to him, she died of an illness. And his father, the master of the Ximen house, Ximen Ba Tian, had not entered his mother\u2019s courtyard once, not even when she died.</p><br/><p>And this guy was also a loser at cultivating. He didn\u2019t have any cultivation talent, no magic talent, and only had a pitiful battle qi talent which was also limited so he could only practice up to Intermediate Fighter and no further.</p><br/><p>But this guy seemed to be exceptionally popular with females. He didn\u2019t know why, but the daughter of Wang Jia clan which was also one of the 4 major clans, of all the people, she had fallen for this guy. But the eldest son of Ximen clan, Ximen Feng, Ximen Tian Long\u2019s elder brother also liked her which gave birth to wild jealousy in his heart. Finally, he sent some people to proclaim that Ximen Tian Long was not the biological son of Ximen Ba Tian. And, he didn\u2019t know how, but Ximen Tian Long\u2019s father had believed those words and Ximen Tian Long was driven away and banished from the imperial capital. Still, Ximen Feng didn\u2019t let him go and dispatched assassins to hunt him; finally this guy was killed by those assassins at this magical beast forest.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was studying this information in his brain, after which he forced out a smile in his heart. He had never thought that this guy whom he possessed was so miserable. Unexpectedly, not only was he a loser in cultivating, in addition, he had such a formidable enemy. How do you expect me to survive from now on\u2026ah?</p><br/><p>Ai, suddenly he thought about his parents on Earth and his younger sister, not knowing when they will realize about his death and how they would react, he felt sad in his heart.</p><br/><p>Just then he felt extremely thirsty and having seen the stream in front of him, he struggled to get up, supported his weak body and started to walk towards it. He was about to die because of thirst so he was ready to drink the water.</p><br/><p>At that time when he saw the reflection of himself in the water, his mouth became \u2018O\u2019 shaped. He didn\u2019t notice whether this guy was too ugly or extremely handsome. Rather, he clearly saw the reflection of his eyes on the water. They were a pair of scarlet eyes, inside of which was an inverted magatama.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026..the Sharingan!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After that Ximan Batian released the gold colored saint dragon battle Qi from his body, changing it into a massive Dragon God Shield. A multitude of pinging sounds were the only results of Ren Tianyou\u2019s attack as the bullets bounced off the shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Six, you stay here and be careful of any sneak attacks by the three people next to the walls. Old Four, Five and Seven, let\u2019s take advantage of this opportunity and force him out from this courtyard, it is very likely that the youngsters will be injured if we continue to fight here,\u201d ordered Ximen Batian after successfully blocking the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d The four elders replied in unison. Then Old Six with the strength of intermediate god rank, fell back and stood before the younger Ximen clan members for their protection. The remaining three immediately releasing their Saint Dragon Battle Qi, and three golden beams of light snaked out from their blades as they cried, \u201cWar Dragon Style, Sky Dragon\u2019s Attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the voices of the three elders, came the massive roars of three dragons, reverberating throughout the whole courtyard. After that three golden energy dragons filled with terrifying Saint Dragon Battle Qi shot toward Ren Tianyou leaving a blaze of golden energy in their wake, under their commands.</p><br/><p>With a great boom of sound, the three energy dragons swallowed Ren Tianyou under the shocked gazes of all present. After the visible explosion, a terrible shockwave of energy spread in all directions. The force of the attack was so strong that even after it swallowed Ren Tianyou, it passing through him, and leaving a ravine on the floor of the courtyard behind him, it slammed into the entrance, which after having been weakened by Ren Tianyou\u2019s last fire attack, this once exquisite entrance, already heavily damaged, collapsed altogether.</p><br/><p>Still standing next to one of the walls, Vermilion Bird saw the destructive attacks towards Ren Tianyou, without thought she began to release a golden flame. She yelled out \u201cZero!\u201d anxiety in her voice as she prepared to enter the fight.</p><br/><p>At that moment, White Tiger, who was sitting in a relaxed cross-legged position said, \u201cNo need to worry, Vermilion Bird, this kind of weak level attack is not enough to give Zero a slight injury, so just sit back, calm down and watch.\u201d Meanwhile Void, his face unchanging, but for the flicker of his eyes as he watched the battle.</p><br/><p>Hearing the words of White Tiger, Vermilion Bird recalled that it had been Ren Tianyou who had rescued her from that extremely dangerous contest with the demon, this thought calmed her down immediately. After that slowly withdrawing her phoenix flames, and began watching the battlefield, ready to halt any junior member of the Ximen clan from fleeing.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The entrance door was completely destroyed by the three elders\u2019 joint attack, nothing remained but a billowing cloud of smoke. Suddenly Ren Tianyou burst free from the cloud, Sword of Kusanagi in hand, a crackle of lightning accompanying him as he landed lightly on the ground behind.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou laughed with disdain, \u201chah, I didn\u2019t even need to use my kamui to dodge that weak attack. Did you really believe that you forced me out of the courtyard? I just don\u2019t want elder sister Yu`er to get injured due to this battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the courtyard, Ximen Batian tapered the energy needed to maintain the golden Dragon God Shield, allowing the energy of the shield to slowly shift into particles which dissipated into the air. Watching the fading shield, he spoke to the elders, \u201cHe is already forced to retreat, lets move!\u201d his body changing into a gold colored radiance which rushed directly towards Ren Tianyou, the three elders followed suit.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ximen Batian and the elders rushing towards him, Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes flashed with a pallid light, the powerful lightning around his body slowly dissipating. Sheathing Sword of Kusanagi, he began rapidly making hand signs, completing the needed hand signs as Ximen Batian and the elders rushed out from the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014Gokakyu no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014Grand Fireball Technique!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Ren Tianyou placed his right hand near his mouth, spitting out a massive fireball that shot towards Xamen Batian and the others, a wave of brilliant heat travelling behind it.</p><br/><p>Seeing the massive fireball streaking towards them, the eyes of Ximen Batian flashed with a wan light, swinging his vast sword which was covered with his powerful Battle Qi into the oncoming fireball from Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>The slash of Ximen Batian was filled with Saint Dragon Battle Qi, blocked the fireball, the two colliding together. Creating a deep crackling sound. Even with the defense of his Saint Dragon Battle Qi, the heat of the flame astonished Ximen Batian, as his face was actually burning from the heat.</p><br/><p>All of the members of the Uchiha clan were experts in the use of fire, and although the body of Ren Tianyou belonged to Ximen Tianlong the one who his clan called a good for nothing, when the Naruto system had invaded Ren Tianyou\u2019s soul placing him in this new body, it had changed his bloodline to that of the Uchiha. This was also why Ren Tianyou had been able to activate and use the Sharingan without much trouble.</p><br/><p>As Ximen Batian blocked the attack of Ren Tianyou, the three elders who had been closely following rose into the sky, changing into three golden lights which began flying towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing the three elders that were flying towards him, Ren Tianyou immediately stopped the Gokakyu no Jutsu (Grand Fireball Technique), placing both of his hands inside of his ninja tool backpack and drawing out 3 kunai into each hand, he threw them towards the incoming elders, then he started to make a series of hand signs immediately after the kunai were in the air.</p><br/><p>Seeing the kunai that were flying towards them, the three elders smirked. \u201cDoes he really think these puny weapons are any obstruction to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the 3 god ranked experts finished this snide remark, Ren Tianyou had already finished making a series of hand signs.</p><br/><p>Now, while both of his hands maintained the Tiger sign, he opened his mouth, speaking gently \u201cNinpo\u2014Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Ninja Art\u2014Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu).</p><br/><p>Moments after Ren Tianyou uttered these words, the 6 kunai multiplied, continuing their flight towards the now shocked elders who, while not understanding how the advancing kunai had suddenly multiplied, still knew that even these several tens of kunai were not capable of penetrating the defense of their god ranked battle Qi.</p><br/><p>Calmly, the elders swung their great swords which glimmered from the light surrounding their bodies, hearing only the sound of multiple metallic collisions as they easily blocked the kunai.</p><br/><p>As the kunai were reflected away, the elders noticed that attached to the very end of these weapons were transparent steel wires, the other end of these short steel wires containing paper with an unknown rune.</p><br/><p>In front of them, Ren Tianyou, having completed the hand seals for the Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu, smirked at them with scorn, placing the palms of both hands together spitting a single word, \u201cEXPLODE!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a series of deafening explosions ringing out, the papers with the rune upon them suddenly ignited under the shocked gaze of the elders, the explosions engulfing them. Ren Tianyou slowly released his hands, looking to the sky, where the explosions continued to reverberate, a smile appearing on his face, \u201cWhat brilliant fireworks!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

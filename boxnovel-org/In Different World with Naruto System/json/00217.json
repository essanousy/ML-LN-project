Then along with a series of \u2018swish\u2019, \u2018swish\u2019, \u2018swish\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026sound, dazzling starlight as if fireballs, formed a huge meteor shower. A meteor shower miraculously appeared in the daytime sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Zero, you are powerful as expected, you are the first person to force me to turn into this, but if you wish to overtake me, then we will talk after you are able to break through my Pursue Star.\u201d Along with this loud and clear voice in the sky, the meteor shower dissipated.</p><br/><p>And the Hirudora (Afternoon Tiger) of Ren Tianyou hit empty air, and landed on one small mountain beneath, then gave out a loud explosion sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful!\u201d Seeing Bu Feng had disappeared without a trace, Ren Tianyou immediately cursed with unsightly complexion. Then after undoing Hachimon Tonkou, that tyrannical chakra around his body also slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu Hu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Ren Tianyou unceasingly breathe heavily, cold sweats continuously appeared in his forehead and flowed down his constantly twitching face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeginning of the backlash of Hachimon Tonkou?\u201d Feeling pain coming through his body, the face of Ren Tianyou continuously twitched, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect even after my big efforts, this guy still ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, is indeed worthy of my choice. In terms of speed, I really am inferior to you.\u201d The scene of just a moment ago when Bu Feng use pursue star to leave again appeared in the brain of Ren Tianyou. Then shaking his head, he helplessly sighed. With regarding to this kind of speed, even Ren Tianyou was too inferior to bear comparison. \u201cBut wait until I master Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu), after that you will no longer be able to escape my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the speed of Bu Feng was too fast, or how abnormal his pursue star was, as long as Ren Tianyou could leave a mark of Hiraishin (Flying Thunder God), Bu Feng would never be able to escape his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er, I will immediately begin to study Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu)!\u201d The eyes of Ren Tianyou shined as he instantly determined his next path. \u201cAnd among all the members of my Akatsuki organization, with the exception of White Tiger and Void, the strength of all others are basically unbearable, ai, fundamentally, they are too weak. Forget it, can only take one step at a time. First I must look for the things that are helpful to increase their strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, a spiral shaped space ripple emerged from the right eye of Ren Tianyou, and after that space ripple surrounded him, he disappeared from that location.</p><br/><p>In Flame Phoenix Villa, Jade Maiden and others were boringly waiting for the return of Zero. And the mother of Vermilion Bird Feng Yumeng had taken away the elder cousin of Vermilon Bird Di Qingyu to talk inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingyu, how are things? Was everything fine outside these few years?\u201d Looking at many time more mature compared to before man in front of her, Feng Yunmeng asked with some emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, rest assured aunt, I was very happy there few years.\u201d Hearing the concern of Feng Yunmeng, Di Qingyu felt warmth inside his heart. Then slowly said, \u201cAnd I manage to successfully break through Sun\u2019s domain, and my Golden yang blood lineage has already activated thoroughly, evolving to peak-saint rank blood lineage. Now I can completely use the true fire of sun. And I have already entered the rank of high level God rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s great, I think your parents can rest in peace now.\u201d Hearing Di Qingyu, Feng Yunmeng\u2019s that beautiful face revealed a hint of excitement plus grieved expression. She was happy for the progress of the strength of Di Qingyu, and was also grieved for the death of his parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cSooner or later, I will definitely enter Bewildering Shadow Valley, and thoroughly kill all those people to avenge my parents.\u201d When he mention Bewildering Shadow Valley, the face of Di Qingyu showed a strong hatred, and powerful golden flame also appeared around his body, burning the seat under him to ashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingyu, you mustn\u2019t act rashly, with your current strength, don\u2019t mention getting revenge, I fear when you step into Bewildering Shadow Valley, that boundless dense fog will pull you into endless illusion. With the exception of the people of their clan, other people are basically powerless to survive inside that dense fog of Bewildering Shadow Valley.\u201d Seeing the complexion of Di Qingyu, Feng Yunmeng instantly stood up and arrived to his side, then placed her right hand on his shoulder. After that along with powerful fiery red battle qi, the golden flame of Di Qingyu was suppressed back inside his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt, I am fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d The complexion of Di Qingyu revert back to normal, then seeing the concern in the face of Feng Yunmeng, he slowly said, \u201cBefore I become very strong, I will not easily enter Bewildering Shadow Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s good.\u201d Hearing Di Qingyu, Feng Yunmeng nodded her head, then encouraged him, \u201cActually after 5 years, they will definitely come out, then you don\u2019t need to take chances to enter Bewildering Shadow Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hearing Feng Yunmeng, Di Qingyu asked with surprise. He knew that as one of the ancient 100 clans, they had suffered heavy losses during the invasion of demon clan, and were forced to hide inside Bewildering Shadow Valley to recuperate their losses. Now it\u2019s already more than ten thousand years without any news about them, so why would they suddenly came out into the world now?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, it\u2019s not only them, after five years, all of the ancient 100 clans will come out into the world.\u201d Feng Yunmeng turned around his head, then looked towards the far away sky, and slightly sighed, \u201cThe reason for them coming out into the world is because after five years, Demon clan\u2019s invasion will soon arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Demon clan\u2019s invasion? How is this possible, weren\u2019t they already beaten back to their devildom? And weren\u2019t their transfer passage thoroughly sealed at that time?\u201d Hearing Feng Yunmeng, Di Qingyu asked in surprise. His face was filled with disbelief look.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually about this matter, basically all ancient 100 clans and we mankind\u2019s every big forces have already receive this information. Because this information had come through the most mysterious Tianji clan of ancient 100 clans, and this information was the divination from True God realm elder of Tianji clan using his whole cultivation and life, basically all the big forces of entire continent are making their preparation, they are making preparation for after five years, about to arrive Demon clan.\u201d Hearing Di Qingyu, the face of Feng Yunmeng revealed a complex expression, \u201cSeveral tens of thousands years ago, when demon clan had invaded, that time can be called greatest disaster of Divine Wind continent. Countless peak experts fell, fields littered with corpses, blood flowed like a river, and everyday a large amount of people died. And the area where people could live also reduce to one third. Never thought, now after five years, demon clan will again start the matter of several tens of thousands years ago, ai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere all the things you said true? Villa Mistress Feng!\u201d Just then, a muffled male voice suddenly resounded the entire hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho, roll out for me.\u201d Hearing the sudden voice, the complexion of Feng Yunmeng instantly shrunk, then powerful aura sprang out from her dainty body spreading in all direction. Immediately the whole hall was filled with oppressive aura. And when Di Qingyu heard this voice, burning qi with blazing golden flame suddenly came out from his body and with a flash of a flame, one gold colored spear appeared in his hand. After that he cautiously scanned all around.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, it\u2019s me.\u201d Just then, the space in front of Feng Yunmeng suddenly distort into a spiral shaped space ripple, and Ren Tianyou with miserable appearance appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s you boy, when did you come back, and also eavesdropping our conversation?\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou, the aura around the body of Feng Yunmeng slowly return inside her body and she said in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that, when moving through space, the coordinate deviate a little, error, fault.\u201d Hearing Feng Yunmeng, Ren Tianyou somewhat apologetically said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you should rejoice that the deviation caused to arrive here, if you had arrived inside the bathhouse of our Flame Phoenix Villa, heihei, then you are just waiting for our Flame Phoenix Villa\u2019s chase to kill.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng stared at Ren Tianyou with a strange gaze and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that, it won\u2019t be, it won\u2019t be.\u201d Hearing Feng Yunmeng, sweats began to pour out from his forehead, and hastily waving his hand he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you look miserable, I hear from Little Wu that you chased after Bu Feng, how was it, you failed.\u201d Looking at the miserable figure of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng came over and patted his shoulder and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSi\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d With the hand of Feng Yunmeng landing on his shoulder, Ren Tianyou suddenly felt all of his muscles trembling, and the muscles of face suddenly twitched ferociously, then falling back, he answered, \u201cVilla Mistress Feng, please be lenient. Because of a forbidden move I used just a moment ago, my whole body is still in pain, so I cannot bear your this gentle and soft palm ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it seems this time you ate big loss.\u201d Seeing the reaction of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng covered her mouth and lightly chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, yes, the speed of this guy called Bu Feng really was incomparable fast. Even after using forbidden move, I was barely able to catch up to him, but in the end he still got away.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought about the speed of Bu Feng, then he helplessly heaved a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is already very good. The speed of this guy Bu Feng is unrivalled under the heaven, and I have never heard someone able to catch up to him.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng said. As Mistress of Flame Phoenix Villa, how could she not know Bu Feng?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, Villa Mistress Feng, the matter you said about Demon clan again invading Divine Wind continent after 5 years, was that really true?\u201d Just then, Ren Tianyou suddenly recalled what Feng Yunmeng had stated just a moment ago, so he asked to confirm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely true.\u201d Feng Yunmeng nodded her head in confirmation, then added, \u201cThe prophecy of Tianji clan is never wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Feng Yunmeng, Ren Tianyou again recalled the matter that had happened to him inside Tower of Babel. At that time, that finger had poked and sent his Susanoo along with him flying. Up until now, he still didn\u2019t have the nerve to confront the owner of that finger. The circumstance of that time had greatly shocked Ren Tianyou, one should know that the defense power of his Susanoo however was ranked first in the Naruto world, although at that time, it was still not in complete form, but also was very powerful. But just like that, a single poke of a finger send it flying, and the blindness points of his eyes fell so sharply, almost instantly making him blind, this shows the strength of the owner of that finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems my hunch of that time was not wrong ah.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed and slowly said. The owner of that finger of that time was definitely sealed expert of demon clan, and inside the Tower of Babel, this Demon clan was actually able to temporarily attack him through the seal, this shows that at that time, the seals were already weakened to some extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat hunch?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201d Ren Tianyou explained everything that had happened to him inside Tower of Babel from rescuing Vermilion Bird by chance, then killing Demon clan, and finally that finger poked and sent him flying matter, but he naturally hid his doujutsu as well as Susanoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever thought that the Tower of Babel was not able to thoroughly seal them, it seems Demon clan are really invading again ah.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the expression of Feng Yunmeng become complex, as she said. Then she looked at Di Qingyu, and her eyes shined, \u201cBoy, do you remembered your 3 promise to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Naturally I do remember.\u201d Hearing the sudden question of Feng Yunmeng, Ren Tianyou answered. The first condition was to get her 2 bottles of Spring of Life, this he had already accomplished. He only needs to give her Spring of Life.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, in that case, my second condition is to let him join your organization.\u201d Feng Yunmeng pointed to Di Qingyu with her right hand and slowly said.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

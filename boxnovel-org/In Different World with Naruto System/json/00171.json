And a huge amount of eye power gushed out from those two blood red Mangekyo Sharingan, instantly after that, a purple colored lightning appeared on the surface of his body, which formed into giant skeleton demon god. And at the right hand of this demon god, an ultra-long thin sword appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell, you bastard.\u201d Ren Tianyou yelled loudly, and with his thought, suddenly a lightning slash was send out from the Futsu no Mitama sword. This directly cut off the Earth mountain god from the middle of its legs.</p><br/><p>This huge sword blade directly cleaved the huge body of Earth god giant from the middle. And this two half fell down at either sides of Ren Tianyou, which gave out a thunderous sound.</p><br/><p>Stepping on the ground, Ren Tianyou directly jumped out from the crater, and landed on the ground outside the crater. After that the Susanoo slowly dissipated revealing the sorry figure of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Originally flashy cloak of Akatsuki organization which Ren Tianyou was wearing had now already changed into beggar clothing. Many holes on the clothing revealed the sturdy body of Ren Tianyou which he had unceasingly hammered into shape by training taijutsu for more than 3 years. And his right arm nevertheless was hanging down, as if there was not any bone in that arm. It seems this arm was broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough, bastard, didn\u2019t expect a slight carelessness unexpectedly injured me this heavily.\u201d Ren Tianyou coughed twice, and blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth. After wiping the blood with his left hand he looked to his already broken right arm, \u201cStill it really is troublesome now, as my right arm actually got broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, in that split second when that Earth mountain god\u2019s attack almost arrived, although he was able to timely use his arms to defend his body, and also the lightning chakra inside his body automatically covered his body with a layer of lightning armor, but due to time constraints, and the fist of this Earth mountain god was too heavy, his right arm was broken.</p><br/><p>After all the Earth mountain god was created by Ximen Wuyan using his earth system magic on a small mountain of about 30 meters high, so its strength was indeed powerful than the imagination of peoples. And in the split second he was hit, Ren Tiayou\u2019s right arm had instantly broken, after that he had barely managed to activate Susanoo to protect his left hand. Then he was directly send flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not for Susanoo, that time, I would be in real danger.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed. Again looking at his right arm, he continued, \u201cWhat bad luck, only one hand is left. This way it is troublesome for me to make hand seals.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the troublesome thing was behind him, the two halves of Earth mountain god which was cleaved by Ren Tianyou suddenly stood up, and a huge amount of earth yellow colored magic power gathered in these two halves. These powerful magical power continuously gathered on these halves, and under the support of this magical power, they started to grow their missing halves. After that new two Earth mountain god appeared in that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d Seeing the appearance of Earth mountain gods, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but cursed. There was no mistake, he had injured himself to attack it, but not only he failed to destroy the target, instead there was an addition, wasn\u2019t this plain cheating.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ximen Wuya who was floating in the air landed above one of the Earth mountain god. After looking at the sorry figure of Ren Tianyou, he sneered, \u201cHumph, did you think that it was that easy to destroy my Earth mountain god? I have poured my earth system divine magic incantation inside their body, so even if you destroy it until only head remained, it can quickly absorb boundless earth elements from the surroundings and recover its body. Youngster, this time you are dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou wanted to refute but he suddenly heard the sound of movement from above him. Looking above him, his eyes firmly shrunk. After seeing Ren Tianyou had killed their several companions, those dragons in the sky were thoroughly angry. Some of them spat out their powerful dragon breath attack towards Ren Tianyou, and some of them were quickly gathering a powerful magic while chanting their magic incantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Ren Tianyou thought, then immediately powerful lightning chakra covered his whole body, changing into a layer of lightning armor. After that changing into lightning blur, he immediately disappeared from this location.</p><br/><p>The attacks of those dragons landed on the ground, immediately causing a loud sound of explosion, and a huge crater appeared on the ground. Although the attack of these dragons were very powerful, and the attack density was also extremely concentrated, but under the stimulation of lightning chakra, not only the defense of his body increased, even his speed was as fast as lightning.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, among all the martial arts under the heaven, only speed cannot be defeated! More powerful attacks and powerful moves, if they didn\u2019t hit the enemy, then everything is meaningless. And when it comes who is the fastest person in Naruto world, the answer is definitely Raikage of Kumogakure (Hidden cloud). 4th hokage was known as fastest because of his space ninjutsu\u2014- Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu). If they purely compete in speed then, Raikage would easily win hands down. Unless a person opens the 8 inner gates, no one is able to match raikage in terms of pure speed.</p><br/><p>Below on the ground, those dragons could only see lightning blur. No matter how they attack, and how much attack range they had, they were basically powerless to land a single attack on Ren Tianyou. Although the right arm of Ren Tianyou was broken, he still had taijutsu. He had diligently trained in taijutsu for more than 3 years, thinking that in case he was not able to use ninjutsu, taijutsu may come in handy. Now it seems, training taijutsu was really not waste of his time.</p><br/><p>While dodging the barrage of attacks, he was continuously thinking inside his heart. \u201cProlonging this battle is very unfavorable for us. And if it goes on like this, then sooner or later I will be exhausted to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShukaku and Matatabi are being tied down by Ximen Zhou and those 5 superior dragons for the time being. But this is also a good thing, as I can deal with these dragon first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut before that, I must dispose this troublesome person.\u201d While dodging he looked towards cautious Ximen Wuyan who was hiding between two Earth mountain god, \u201cThis guy really is hidden danger from the beginning, so I should kill this guy first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this guy is hiding in the middle of those two Earth mountain god, and currently I can\u2019t make hand seals, so powerful ninjutsu is out of the question, and as for taijutsu\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Thinking taijutsu, Ren Tianyou looked at that giant body of Earth mountain god, and again looked at his small body, then shook his head, and gave up this idea. Using taijutsu to deal with these 2 giants of more than 30 meters high who felt no pain, and didn\u2019t die, Ren Tianyou believed that his brain was still not that broken to try that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough these giants are troublesome, and couldn\u2019t be killed, but it is after all a magic spell. And as long as caster died, the magic spell will naturally break itself.\u201d While continuously dodging the attacks of Dragons, Ren Tianyou unceasingly thought about countermeasures. \u201cLike this I only have to think about the way to deal this guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking for a bit, Ren Tianyou thought of a way to deal with the situation. He didn\u2019t looked at those 2 giants, instead looked over to the dragons with a cruel smile on his face. After he had formulated the plan, boundless chakra rapidly surged from his body, and lightning flickered even more violently on the surface of his body. Ren Tianyou slowly floated in the sky and stopped in the mid-air, from the distance he looked just like a thunder god. Suddenly the thumb and little finger of left had of Ren Tianyou curled, leaving behind only 3 fingers, and a powerful lightning gathered in the fingertips of his left hand.</p><br/><p>And at the distance, seeing the whole body of Ren Tianyou was covered with lightning, furthermore that method of curling his fingers, Matatabi who was in the process of confronting several superior dragons, who used to be sealed within the human of Kumogakure (Hidden cloud) naturally knew this special move of Raikage, \u201cIs this\u2026\u2026? Raikage\u2019s ninjutsu\u2013 Sanbon Nukite (Three Fingered Assault). Didn\u2019t expect Tianyou, this boy still had these.\u201d</p><br/><p>And those continuously attacking dragons, seeing the figure of Ren Tianyou, they immediately roared in excitement. They believed that Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any strength left, so they immediately fired powerful blazing dragon breath attack towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Jigokuzuki\u2014- Sanbon Nukite! (Thrust of Hell\u2014-Three Fingered Assault!)\u201d Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, stretched his left arm straight, and as if his body changed into a lightning spear, he shot towards those dragons.</p><br/><p>But next scene caused the glasses of everyone to drop to the ground, and especially Matatabi, this huge demon cat even exclaimed in surprise, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the momentum of Ren Tianyou was quite big, but after making contact with those dragons\u2019 breath, he merely broke thorough 3 dragon breath, after that his body was directly hit and was sent flying. This was just like loud thunder but small raindrops. Those dragons who had carefully prepared to guard against his attack, after seeing his big momentum were also clearly depressed.</p><br/><p>But no one knew whether this was coincidence or not, but Ren Tianyou was send flying towards the direction of Ximen Wuyan and 2 Earth mountain gods. Seeing Ren Tianyou was hit and was sent flying towards him, how could Ximen Wuyan let this chance slip by. Recalling how Ren Tianyou had killed the peoples of Ximen clan, he looked at Ren Tianyou with his eyes filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>After that he commanded one Earth mountain god to advance towards the direction of sent flying Ren Tianyou. After getting command from Ximen Wuyan, this giant Earth mountain god extended its two huge arms, opened its palms, and received Ren Tianyou. It seems it was ready to flatten Ren Tianyou into a patty.</p><br/><p>As the distance gradually reduced, and when the two palms of Earth mountain god were already about to meet Ren Tianyou, at that time, Ren Tianyou suddenly opened his tightly closed eyes, his eyes flashed with bright light, then controlling his body, he stamped on the space cross-section in the sky which was invisible to naked eyes, and directly changing into a blur he disappeared from that place. And that Earth mountain god just clapped in the empty air.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou had disappeared, Ximen Wuyan immediately knew that this was bad. After that he instantly knew that something will happen, so he commanded other Earth mountain god at his side to be on the alert. And he himself also unceasingly scanned around with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>At this time, about 20 meters at the right side, Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared. After that he extend his lightning covered left hand, and quickly dashed towards Ximen Wuyan. This was real Jigokuzuki\u2014- Sanbon Nukite (Thrust of Hell\u2014-Three Fingered Assault). From the beginning the target of Ren Tianyou was not those dragons, but targeting dragons was only him pretending to get close to Ximen Wuyan, as his real target was always Ximen Wuyan.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou was quickly rushing towards him, Ximen Wuyan quickly rushed behind the Earth mountain god of his side, intending to use Earth mountain god as a shield to stop Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ximen Wuyan was hiding behind Earth mountain god, Ren Tianyou sneered with disdain. \u201cDid you really believe that this giant will be able to stop me? If there is two of them, then there is a slight possibility, but only one, humph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou changing into an all-conquering spear, directly penetrated through the giant body of Earth mountain god, making a huge hole on its body.</p><br/><p>\u201cStab!\u201d Along with the stabbing sound, under the gaze of everyone, the left hand of Ren Tianyou directly stabbed though the body of Ximen Wuyan, directly crushing his heart. And the powerful lightning system chakra in that left hand spread throughout the body of Ximen Wuyan, completely paralyzing him.</p><br/><p>Feeling that his body was penetrated through, furthermore that sensing lightning energy was wantonly moving around his body continuously, with a \u201cpuff\u201d, he spat out blood from his mouth, looked down at the hand which had penetrated therough his heart, and he stammeringly said, \u201cFrom the beginning\u2026\u2026..your target\u2026\u2026..was\u2026\u2026.actually\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, who asked you to make these giants which are too difficult to deal with, so I had no other choice but to kill you.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly continued, \u201cAnd also, I am the very vengeful person. You broke my arm, so how could I let you go for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou pulled out his left hand from the body of Ximen Wuyan, his body suddenly fell down powerlessly to the ground and laid there motionlessly. After his heart was crushed, even if he had successfully stepped into the realm of god domain, he was not able to avoid death. And in the left hand of Ren Tianyou, currently there was a crystal which was emitting a soft yellow colored radiance.</p><br/><p>Support me through patreon to get early access and other bonus.

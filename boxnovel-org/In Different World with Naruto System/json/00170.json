After that it opened its mouth and let out a loud roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>This roar was full of excitement. It was happy for its rebirth, and excited for upcoming battle. As a tailed beasts, which one of them feared a big battle?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the special flame of demon cat? Actually able to directly attack the soul, it really is formidable.\u201d Standing on the head of Shukaku, under his Mangekyo Sharingan, Ren Tianyou clearly saw that, when that blue colored flame spread to the body of that dragon, a special power actually seeped inside its body, reaching its soul, and after finally burning it to death, even soul of that dragon itself was also devoured by Matatabi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Tianyou, the flame of Matatabi is second only to that of stinking fox, Kyuubi. So naturally, it\u2019s powerful.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou muttering to himself, Shukaku explained to him. There was extremely clear difference in ability among all 9 tailed beasts, so although Matatabi\u2019s flame was powerful, nevertheless its overall strength was lower, compared to Kyuubi (9-tailed) demon fox with unlimited chakra. Ren Tianyou also dreamed that one day he would awaken Rinnegan, and release all 9 tailed beasts. At that time, if he saw someone not pleasing to his eye, he would just blow the whistle, and all 9 tailed beast would immediately tear them apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day is not that far away.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked towards the sky, discarded this thought, then began to make hand seals, \u201cKage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Shadow clone Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018peng\u2019 sound and a white smoke, the clone of Ren Tianyou appeared on the head of Shukaku. After a clone appeared, both Ren Tianyou and his clone began to quickly make a series of hand seals. Under the chakra support of both Shukaku and Matatabi, Ren Tianyou temporarily didn\u2019t have to worry about the issues of chakra.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuiton\u2014-Suiryuudan! (Water Style\u2014-Water Dragon!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014-Goryuka no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014- Great Dragon Flame Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After they finished making hand seals, both of them loudly yelled. After that along with the surge of chakra inside the body of Ren Tianyou, suddenly two loud dragon roar came from behind both Ren Tianyou and his clone, then simultaneously huge water dragon and blazing flame dragon appeared behind them. And under the control of Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone, both dragons intertwined with each other while advancing forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire clouds frenzy!\u201d Seeing the attack of two energy dragons, the huge dragon eyes of Flame dragon Adilasi flashed with pallid light, then spat out huge flame towards the incoming two energy dragons attack of Ren Tianyou from its dragon mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing this Ren Tianyou snorted coldly with disdain. After that under the control of himself and his shadow clone, two huge energy dragons suddenly began to quickly move according to his idea, directly dodging the attack of Adilasi, then circled and advanced towards the crowd of more than 20 God ranked dragons who were flying behind.</p><br/><p>From the beginning the target of Ren Tianyou was not these powerful experts, because he was extremely clear that wanting to injure these 5 superior dragon with these 2 ninjutsu was just a pipe dream. And the might of these 2 *-ranked ninjutsu, although was somewhat insufficient to thoroughly deal with those God ranked dragons, but merely reaching them was enough for the plan of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Under the command of Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone, these huge energy dragons directly arrived at the crowd of behind dragons, after that directly locking on to targets, these two dragons roared and immediately shot in the middle of this crowd.</p><br/><p>Along with a \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, two huge energy dragons, one fire one water, two with opposite energy collided, instantly causing a huge reaction. A terrifying energy storm diffused in all direction, which swept away the crowd of dragons in all direction. Even Ximen Zhou, Ximen Wuyan and those 5 superior dragon a bit far away were also affected by this huge energy storm, but along with a sudden appearance of energy radiances above their body, their body firmly stood at the same location just like a mountain, basically negating all the effects.</p><br/><p>But this energy storm swept all of those God ranked dragons, all of them were blown off in all direction. No one among the God ranked dragons were able to firmly stabilize their body.</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, objective achieved. Shukaku, Matatabi, I\u2019ll start to move, help me stop these fellows.\u201d Seeing these two *-ranked ninjutsu had achieved the expected objective, Ren Tianyou said to Shukaku and Matatabi.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, Tianyou. Leave these guys to us for the time being.\u201d Shukaku directly replied, Matatabi at its side also nodded its huge big cat head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone directly jumped off from the head of Shukaku and landed on the space cross-section which couldn\u2019t be seen by naked eyes, then quickly rushed towards those God ranked dragons.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that you will have your way.\u201d Seeing the direction Ren Tianyou was rushing towards, Death dragon Buliqite immediately understood his intention. Currently all of those God ranked dragons were exerting huge effort to stabilize themselves in this huge energy storm, and if this fellow rushed towards them at this time, then the result would be terrible. So it immediately flapped its wings and got ready to stop Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, a large amount of sand suddenly rose towards the sky, blocking the way of this Death dragon Buliqite, which forced it to stop its movement. Shukaku raised its huge head and issued a satisfied laugh, \u201cYou little lizards, your opponent is me.\u201d The eyes of Matatabi also shined, and firmly stared at their movement, but what Shukaku and Matatabi failed to notice was, far behind, the Earth mountain god was slowly disappearing into the ground under the command of Ximen Wuyan.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone were already about to reach those crowd of dragons. At that time, both of them made a series of same hand seals, then along with the ear-piercing birds cry sound, a dazzling lightning simultaneously appeared on the right hand of Ren Tianyou and on the left hand of his shadow clone.</p><br/><p>After Chidori appeared in their hands, both of them simultaneously stretched their hand which was covered with lightning. After that a narrow and thin lightning light appeared between their hands, then both of them simultaneously advance towards crowd of dragons with this lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014- Raiden! (Lightning Style\u2014- Lightning Cable!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly Ren Tianyou locked on to first target, a Holy dragon. Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone directly rushed towards this dragon, then this thin and narrow lightning light directly streak across its body. The hard dragon scales on its body was just like a paper in front of this lightning light.</p><br/><p>3 seconds after Ren Tianyou and his shadow clone left, a thin and narrow cut became visible on its neck. This cut became bigger and bigger, finally separating the head from the body. After that the huge dragon head and that huge dragon body directly fell towards the ground from the sky, which was accompanied by sprinkle of gold colored dragon blood from the neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, you bastard, I will tear you to shreds.\u201d Seeing the miserable end of that Holy Dragon, Holy Dragon Xilaisite roared loudly. The fertility of dragon clan was very low compared to other race of this continent, so each of the dragon were incomparably precious for the dragon clan, but now within 10 minutes from the time they had arrived, 2 dragons had died a tragic death in front of their very own eyes, and in addition Ren Tianyou had already killed 3 dragons, altogether 5 dragons had already lost their lives from the hand of Ren Tianyou, so how could they not get furious.</p><br/><p>But despite this, they were firmly hindered by the sands of Shukaku, and in addition Matatabi was jumping with that powerful bouncing ability and attacking at them with its cat claw or its huge fire ball. Basically they didn\u2019t have any time to prepare their big moves. And Shukaku and Matatabi were also temporarily unable to injure or kill Adilasi and others, because similarly both of them also didn\u2019t have any time to prepare for their big moves. So currently they were in the state of stalemate, with no one able to harm other.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ren Tianyou had already killed 3 dragons in one breath, and when he had locked on to another target and was preparing to make his move, both him and his shadow clone suddenly sensed huge gravitational force around them, and it became harder for them to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026? Gravity skill?\u201d Feeling this difference, Ren Tianyou was shocked inside his heart. At this time, a loud movement sound suddenly came through, and a huge rock spear suddenly appeared from below and directly skewered Ren Tianyou from the buttocks. After that along with a \u2018peng\u2019 sound, this Ren Tianyou changed into white smoke and disappeared from the sky.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tianyou was very glad for his good fortune, that this attack hit his shadow clone, nevertheless the way of dying of this shadow clone was really too\u2026\u2026. Directly getting skewered by a huge stone spear from the buttocks, when the memory of this shadow clone was send back to the brain of Ren Tianyou, he immediately felt that this chrysanthemum tighten.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grandmother, didn\u2019t expect this different world has also this Sennen Goroshi (One Thousand Years of Death).\u201d Ren Tianyou shivered all over, the sensation of this shadow clone\u2019s death was transmitted to his brain just now left behind a shadow in his mind. Just when Ren Tianyou prepared to look around for the bastard who had use such vicious method to kill him, he suddenly heard a movement sound in front of him.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou immediately looked in the front, saw a huge rock fist was advancing towards him. Because currently the eyes of Ren Tianyou was that of Uchiha Itachi, he was not able to use Kamui of Uchiha Obito, or his own Other Side.</p><br/><p>As a condition reflex, Ren Tianyou raised his both arms in front of him, a layer of lightning chakra appeared around his body, and large amount of eye power gushed out from his eyes. Afterwards this huge fist hit him. Ren Tianyou suddenly felt as if he was he was slammed by a giant truck with the speed of 80 m/s, and he was directly sent flying downwards.</p><br/><p>Along with a \u2018hong\u2019 sound, Ren Tianyou was knocked down to the ground, and along with a huge crater, numerous huge cracks spread in all direction. The ground with several 10 meters of radius was completely destroyed by the impact of this force, this shows the power of this fist.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cTianyou!\u201d\u201d Seeing this circumstance in the distant, Shukaku and Matatabi roared loudly with great alarm, but Ren Tianyou had already fallen on the ground, and due to the huge dusts cloud resulted by the explosion, no one could clearly see the circumstance inside it.</p><br/><p>They looked up in the sky, and saw a huge rock giant whose body was emitting a powerful magical power standing at the sky. And at the head of this rock giant, the figure of Ximen Wuyan appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, it turns out that this guy had sneaked attacked Tianyou.\u201d Seeing the main culprit, the eyes of Shukaku flashed with ominous glint, and let out a loud roar.</p><br/><p>After the dusts cloud dissipated, in the midst of deep crater, Ren Tianyou who was injured all over was motionlessly lying down with both of his eyes shut. And that Earth mountain god in the sky above directly descended from the sky, extended its bulky right leg, and trampled towards Ren Tianyou. If this leg truly trampled, coupled with that terrifying impact, then Ren Tianyou would truly lose his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Seeing this, worried look appeared on the eyes of Shukaku who was far away, then loudly roaring, boundless sands flew towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s location. And Matatabi trampled on the ground and also jumped towards the direction of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you will success!\u201d But those 5 dragons and Ximen Zhou roared. The Earth dragon Andogni quickly chanted an incantation, then along with a huge vibration on the ground, 7 or 8 huge earthen wall broke through the ground, directly blocking the boundless sands of Shukaku from moving forward.</p><br/><p>And Ximen Zhou and remaining 4 dragons directly appeared in front of Matatabi, directly blocking her. Ximen Zhou swung his fist, and 4 dragons swung their tails, then along with \u2018hong\u2019 sound, Matatabi was sent flying downwards to the ground. After that along with a loud impact sound the whole ground swayed, and a huge crater appeared.</p><br/><p>On the other side, that huge rock leg of that giant Earth mountain god almost stepped on the body of Ren Tianyou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Support me through patreon to get early access and other bonus.

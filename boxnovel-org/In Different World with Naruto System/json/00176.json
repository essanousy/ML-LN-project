Everyone had worried expression in their face. And at another floating platform not far away from them, Ximen Feng was lying motionlessly with lifeless eyes. After using genjutsu to dominate him, Ren Tianyou had sent him in this kamui dimension along with Vermilion Bird. Although it was impossible for the illusion of Ren Tianyou to continuously last this long, but don\u2019t forget there was a great illusionist inside kamui dimension. With her present, it was very unlikely for Ximen Feng to wake up anytime soon.</p><br/><p>And Wang Yuxin who was originally poisoned, under the efficacy of Purple gauze sky magnificent flower, the poison inside her body had already been detoxified. And under the care of Jade Maiden, she regained her consciousness.</p><br/><p>After waking up, Wang Yuxin was suspicious looking at the environment around her, and especially seeing unconscious Ximen Feng, furthermore seeing several peoples wearing same kind of cloths sitting at her side. Only after Jade Maiden and others resolved her doubts, was she able to know that this space was Ren Tianyou\u2019s own space, and they were all member of Ren Tianyou\u2019s organization. And they had accompanied Ren Tianyou to Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>But when she heard that Ren Tianyou was still fighting on the outside, she immediately began to get worried. Only after the persuasion of Jade Maiden and Vermilion Bird, they were able to settle her down with great difficulty, but she still was worried while waiting for the arrival of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>White Tiger and all others were also similarly worried, especially White Tiger and Void. Both of them clearly remembered that before they entered kamui dimension, 3 extremely powerful experts had arrived at that place. But they didn\u2019t show this worry on their face, because if even their mind was in chaos, then what would happen to Wang Yuxin after knowing that? But if both of them knew that after they had left the battlefield, a crowd of powerful experts of dragon clan also appeared at the battlefield, then they would also definitely not be able to stay calm like this.</p><br/><p>And the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er was preserve using a special power of Vermilion Bird\u2019s Phoenix God blood lineage, so as to not let her corpse to begin rotting with time. Seeing the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er, Wang Yuxin was greatly taken aback, then tears began to slowly flow out from her eyes. Because due to the relationship with Ximen Tianlong, she and Ximen Yue\u2019er had a relation just like that of sisters, and now suddenly seeing her corpse, she naturally felt incomparable grief.</p><br/><p>At the time when everyone were anxiously waiting, suddenly the space above the platform not far away from them began to distort, after that Ren Tianyou who was covered all over with injuries appeared before the eyes of everyone.</p><br/><p>Seeing the appearance of Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and others immediately stood up, and happily jumped towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s side. Seeing the scares on Ren Tianyou, Vermilion Bird asked worriedly, \u201cZero, are you alright? Why are there so many injuries on your body? Are you seriously injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Zero, why this sorry figure, was there serious hindrance?\u201d White Tiger and others also asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, I am fine, these are all superficial wounds.\u201d Ren Tianyou waved his hands, indicating that everything was fine. With the exception of getting his right arm broken, he didn\u2019t receive any other severe injury, and under the effect of Shikotsumyaku (Dead Bone Pulse), his arm was also already healed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou\u2019s gaze landed on Wang Yuxin who was standing at the back, then he slowly walked towards her. Arriving at her side, Ren Tianyou held her jade hand, and asked in extremely soft tone with concern, \u201cLittle Yu, how are you? Are you alright? Did the poison in your body detoxified?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now, with the help of elder sister Jade Maiden, the poisons inside my body are already eliminated completely.\u201d Wang Yuxin stretched her right hand, helped Ren Tianyou to wipe his cheek. Looking at the scars in the body of Ren Tianyou, her eyes revealed anguished expression, and she continued, \u201cIdiot, are you alright? Why are there so many injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured Little Yu, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know me, from childhood I\u2019ve taken beating and am already accustomed to it. So this type of superficial wounds are merely small appetizer nothing more.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered with a smile. Then he raised his arms, intentionally acting strangely by bulging his muscles, signaling everything was alright.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi!\u201d Seeing the strange appearance of Ren Tianyou, Wang Yuxin suddenly laughed, and her jade finger of right hand poked Ren Tianyou\u2019s forehead, after that she said with a smile, \u201cIdiot, you really changed, you\u2019ve become more mature, no longer that foolish idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, after going through so many things, I nevertheless grew up!\u201d Ren Tianyou said with a smile. And just when he hugged Wang Yuxin in his bosom, suddenly the sound of coughing came from behind.</p><br/><p>White Tiger with a strange expression in his face, and placing his right hand in front of his mouth, he coughed several times, and said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cHey Zero, if you want to flirt and have some private words, then go somewhere private all right? I am little bit jealous seeing you so open and aboveboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at his side Vermilion Bird and Jade maiden also had smiling expression on their face, and were looking at Ren Tianyou with expression like a smile yet not a smile, as for Void as always he was expressionless, but looking carefully one could discover that the corner of his mouth was unceasingly twitching. Although Ren Tianyou was thick-skinned, but he couldn\u2019t help but his complexion became red. As for Wang Yuxin, no need to talk about her, she immediately exclaimed, and completely buried herself on Ren Tianyou\u2019s bosom and hid her face.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou coughed few times, pretend as if nothing had happened, and patted Wang Yuxin who was in his embrace, hinting her to rise. And after the urge of Ren Tianyou, Wang Yuxin slowly come out from the embrace of Ren Tianyou with bright red complexion.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ren Tiayou thought about Ximen Yue\u2019er, and asked Vermilion Bird, \u201cVermilion Bird, where is the corpse of elder sister Yue\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u201d Vermilion Bird stepped aside and revealed Ximen Yue\u2019er who was lying behind her. Currently the motionlessly lying on the ground corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er was covered with a thin golden colored flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er!\u201d Seeing the corpse of Ximen Yue\u2019er, Ren Tianyou directly flashed and arrived at the side, and knelt down beside the body. Then his trembling right hand slowly touched her face as his tears slowly flowed out from his eyes, and dropped on her asleep face, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, elder sister Yue\u2019er, all this happened because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, don\u2019t be sad.\u201d Seeing grieved Ren Tianyou, White Tiger said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, elder sister Yue\u2019er she\u2026\u2026..\u201d Wang Yuxin came over to Ren Tianyou, and said with her face filled with sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Yu, I will absolutely look for the method to resurrect her.\u201d Ren Tianyou said with strong determination. He recalled Rinnegan\u2019s Gedo \u2014 Rinne Tensei no Jutsu (Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth). But he was unsure when he would be able to awaken this supreme eyes, and he was also unsure whether this jutsu would work in this different world or not.</p><br/><p>At this time, he suddenly thought Phoenix\u2019s rebirth fire bathing, so he immediately turned around and said towards Vermilion Bird, \u201cVermilion Bird, can your Flame Phoenix villa\u2019s Phoenix god blood lineage\u2019s rebirth fire bathing resurrect elder sister Yue\u2019er?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Vermilion Bird shook her head as she express that she didn\u2019t know about it, and continued, \u201cNormally our rebirth fire bathing is said to work only on us who inherit Phoenix god blood lineage. But I heard that several thousands of years ago, a person begged our Phoenix villa to help him resurrect one person. As for the final result, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, as long as there is hope even if only slightest, I\u2019ll not give up that opportunity.\u201d Ren Tainyou said firmly, then looked at Vermilion Bird, \u201cVermilion Bird, I want to trouble you to help me get to your Phoenix villa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut all along our Phoenix villa doesn\u2019t allow any strangers to enter and especially men.\u201d Vermilion Bird shook her head, as she replied to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll let you take me there, and I believe I can successfully enter with your help.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, although I\u2019ll help you, but even I can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to enter Phoenix villa.\u201d Seeing the determined face of Ren Tianyou, Feng Wu nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d Ren Tianyou gratefully thanked, then looking at Jade Maiden, he said, \u201cJade Maiden, originally I promised you to kill that Ling Yanqi after this revenge, but now because of this condition of elder sister Yue\u2019er, I\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, as long as you remember this in your heart. I believe that you wouldn\u2019t deceive me.\u201d Jade Maiden slightly smiled and didn\u2019t rebuked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! Since it is like this, we set off to Phoenix villa.\u201d Ren Tianyou gratefully thanked Jade Maiden too. After that he looked over to lying motionless Ximen Yue\u2019er, then raise his head and said.</p><br/><p>Support me through patreon to get early access and other bonus.

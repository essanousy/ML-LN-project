(Summoning Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, in the ground in front of him, with a sudden \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026.sound, four white some appeared.</p><br/><p>Along with the appearance of these smoke, four loud beast roar suddenly resounded from inside those smokes, and the huge sound waves spread in all direction. After these smoke dissipated, four huge figure could be seen at that place.</p><br/><p>A huge yellow colored raccoon dog, demon cat with its entire body burning with blue flame, a huge turtle with huge tortoise shell, and finally an ape whose entire body was emitting burning hot flame appeared at that place, precisely were Ichibi Shukaku, Nibi Matatabi, Sanbi Isobu, and finally Yonbi Son Goku\u2026\u2026\u2026four tailed beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat magical beasts are these?\u201d Seeing the suddenly appeared four tailed beasts, Amike standing on the head of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast suspiciously asked. Even after searching in his memory of several tens of ten thousand years, he however was certain that he had never seen these type of magical beasts.</p><br/><p>No kidding, if he had seen nine tailed-beasts of Naruto world, then that in itself would be fishy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also never seen these four magical beasts.\u201d Seeing these four magical beasts that had suddenly appeared in front of it, Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast searched all of his memory, but he didn\u2019t find any information on these four beasts. \u201cBut these four magical beasts are hard to deal with, we have to be a bit more careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but regardless of what trick this fellow use in front of us, with the joint effort of us, he is bound to get doomed.\u201d Amike confidently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s test the strength of these four fellows first.\u201d Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast finished speaking, then opened its mouth, spatting out countless huge pitch-black colored flame ball towards four magical beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cShukaku!\u201dSeeing countless fireballs in front and that blazing temperature that was evaporating the air around them, Ren Tianyou immediately called out Shukaku.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Shukaku answered, then circulating huge amount of chakra within its body. After that the ground in front suddenly cracked open, and countless sands sprang out from inside forming a huge sand shield, which blocked those countless fire balls.</p><br/><p>\u201cSand\u2026\u2026.?\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of sand, both Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast simultaneously exclaimed inwardly. And at this moment, suddenly countless sand waves flooded towards them with irresistible force.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Are you looking down upon me?\u201d Seeing the sand waves that appeared all of a sudden, Amike didn\u2019t speak, but Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast roared. After that it opened up its huge mouth and spat out huge blazing flame, which changed into a blazing flame wall in front of it. All the sands that came into contact with this flame wall immediately changed into a black colored substance and fell down.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, watching Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, Ren Tianyou was unceasingly planning in his heart, \u201cCurrently I have four tailed-beasts. Comparing tailed-beasts with these two in front, other than Shukaku, all other have more than enough offensive power, but their defense power is insufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Amike of Demon clan as a one of the Demon God of Demon clan, one might well say his fighting experience is very abounded, so after fighting for a little bit, he will definitely notice the weakness of tailed beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo now there is only one way left.\u201d Thinking this, the pattern of Ren Tianyou\u2019s both Sharingan spun rapidly, \u201cI can only use this one move, if this one move also didn\u2019t work, then I will run away as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton\u2014-Moku Bunshin no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Clone Jutsu!)\u201d After making the hand seals, three exactly same clone appeared beside Ren Tianyou, then Ren Tianyou and his clones immediately dispersed and landed on the head of each tailed-beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cShukaku, Matatabi, Isobu, Son, let\u2019s fight together.\u201d Ren Tianyou jumped and landed on the head of Son, while other three clones jumped and landed on the head of respective remaining tailed-beasts. After that the Sharingan of Ren Tianyou and his clones spun rapidly, and a huge amount of powerful eye power unceasingly flowed out from their eyes, \u201cIso\u2014Susanoo! (Majestic Attire\u2014Susanoo!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, a huge purple ash colored lightning energy simultaneously appeared around the body of Ren Tianyou and his clones, and it slowly surrounded the huge body of tailed beasts too, forming a huge susanoo armor to protect the huge body of tailed-beasts.</p><br/><p>And the head of tail-beasts were also protected by huge helmet, leaving behind an open for mouth and pair of eyes. As for Ren Tianyou and his clones, they appeared inside the crystal which was on the top of the helmet.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not complete, gather for me!\u201d Ren Tianyou and his clones simultaneously roared, and their Sharingan spun even more violently. After that at the two side of tailed-beasts body, two huge arms appeared simultaneously. And each of those arms were holding long and thin huge sword which was glimmering with purple ash colored lightning sparks, were Futsu no Mitama Sword.</p><br/><p>This move was a move which Uchiha Madara had used when he was fighting a final death match against Senju Hasirama. He used Susanoo as a protective armor for Kyuubi, then used Kyuubi\u2019s huge attack power to attack Senju Hasirama. This was very good method to increase the defense power of weak defense of tailed-beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Susanoo? The power of Uchiha clan is really mystical ah.\u201d Feeling that huge armor on their body, tailed-beasts unceasingly sighed within their heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I have used Susanoo to protect your body, so you don\u2019t need to worry about defending, you only need to attack together with me.\u201d Ren Tianyou who was standing on the head of tailed-beasts said. But after saying this, he made a wry smile, then added, \u201cBut I also can\u2019t support you four simultaneously for long time with only my chakra, so lend me a bit of your chakra.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Four tailed-beasts answered simultaneously, then a thin tube appeared on their head which got inserted into the body of Ren Tianyou and his clones. After that huge amount of chakra of tailed-beasts came pouring into the body of Ren Tianyou. Now Ren Tianyou feel the chakra within his body were being unceasingly depleted due to simultaneously supporting Iso (Majestic Attire) for four tailed beasts, and again getting replenished immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow let us give this fellow a big gift first.\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, then the four tailed beasts simultaneously opened their mouth. After that a huge amount of chakra appeared before their mount, forming a huge chakra energy ball. This was bijudama.</p><br/><p>And this was still not over, Ren Tianyou and his clones simultaneously controlled Futsu no Mitama Sword and inserted into it, then a huge amount of chakra entered into the tailed beast, gathering even more energy within these bijudama.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After that Ren Tianyou quickly ran on the sea surface towards that 9-headed hydra as if he was running on the earth surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch an extreme control in magical power, actually able to control his magical power to stand and run on the surface of the water.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou who was running on the surface of the water, Ling Weiwei suddenly exclaimed, and thought that tis was possible due to Ren Tianyou having extremely high level of control in his magical power.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou firmly stared at 9-headed hydra with his Mangekyo Sharingan. As a matter of face, originally Ren Tianyou actually didn\u2019t want to join this battle, but he didn\u2019t know the exact location of this God Weeping region, and without clearly knowing the exact space coordinate, he could not directly teleport to that place using Kamui. So he had to give up his plan to reach God Weeping region with his Kamui.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou had finally found a mercenary group which was heading towards God Weeping region, and after joining them, he had gotten a guide without paying any charge, so how could Ren Tianyou let this magical beast get in his way. As a result he had joined this fight.</p><br/><p>When Wang Qingfeng who was flying in the sky saw that Ren Tianyou was running on the surface of the sea, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, and immediately afterwards his attention was drawn by the big fireball fired by that 9-headed hydra.</p><br/><p>Wang Qingfeng immediately dodged this fireball attack, then quickly poured his magical power to his magic wand on his right hand, then a huge wind blade appeared in the sky and quickly advanced towards that 9-headed hydra.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, although you are also God-ranked expert, nevertheless you are much worse compared to I, your father.\u201d Seeing the wind blade attack, this 9-headed hydra eyes were filled with disdain. Then opened the mouths of two of its head, after that countless wind blade and lightning pillar appeared in the sky and advanced towards the huge wind blade attack of Wang Qingfeng. In addition seeing Ren Tianyou who was running on the surface of sea towards itself, another one of its head opened its mouth, then a wave of flame advanced towards Ren Tianyou. Seeing the incoming attack, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals with his both hands, \u201cSuiton\u2014Suiryudan no Jutsu! (Water Style\u2014Water Dragon Jutsu!)\u201d After Ren Tianyou successfully casted the jutsu, the sea surface at his side start to quickly stir, then along with the loud dragon roar, a huge water dragon made up of water advance towards the attack of that 9-headed hydra.</p><br/><p>Currently in this vast sea, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t need to consume huge amount of chakra to use water style jutsu. So contrary to what one might expect, this boundless sea provide a huge assistance to Ren Tianyou. His Suiryudan no Jutsu easily destroyed the flame magic of 9-headed hydra, then continued to advance towards its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, dark magic\u2014-mystic light stab!\u201d Looking at this incoming Suiryudan, the dark system head of 9-headed hydra, opened its mouth, then the dark system magic elements quickly started to condense in the air, and this condensed dark elements changed into a long dark spear in front of this 9-headed hydra, then under its command, that long dark spear flew towards Suiryudan.</p><br/><p>Mystic light stab smoothly flew in the sky with dark radiances, straight towards the head of Suiryudan, and directly pierce through the head and then body of the Suiryudan, after that without reducing any speed, it directly advanced towards Ren Tianyou. After Suiryudan was completely pierced through, suddenly up in the air, followed by the bursting of the Suiryudan, innumerable drops of water trickled down.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the mystic light stab was quickly flying towards him, the Ren Tianyou\u2019s Mangekyo Sharingan of right eye started to rotate. After that the body of Ren Tianyou was completely pierced through by the mystic light stab and that mystic light stab entered the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou was completely pierced through, Ling Weiwei who was still at the deck of Soaring Dragon ship, helplessly cried out in alarm. She could not believe what she had seen with her own eyes, just a moment ago still healthy and active Ren Tianyou had suddenly like this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>At this time, alongside cry of Ling Weiwei, a voice came from the surface of sea, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that you a mere beast was actually this strong.\u201d Ren Tianyou who was completely pierced through spoke as if nothing had happened. And carefully looking there was also not any wound in his body, and he was still alive and kicking.</p><br/><p>Hearing this voice, Ling Weiwei didn\u2019t dared to believe her own ear, so she raised her head, looked towards the sea, and saw that Ren Tianyou had not only collapsed as she had thought, but seeing the current scene, she couldn\u2019t help but remembered the strange circumstance in the battle between Ren Tianyou and her guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? You were undoubtedly pierced through by my mystic light stab.\u201d Seeing alive and still kicking Ren Tianyou, 9-headed hydra couldn\u2019t believe what it was seeing and exclaimed. Its 18 eyes of 9 heads had clearly seen that its mystic light stab had undoubtedly pierced through the body of Ren Tianyou. But now no need to talk about being injured, there was not even a single scratch on his cloth, let alone his body. So it couldn\u2019t believe what its eyes was seeing now.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou completely ignored this 9-headed hydra, rather lifted up his head and looked towards the floating Wang Qingfeng and said, \u201cOld man, do you have any magic spell that can instantly finish off this beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s question, Wang Qingfeng was clearly surprised, after that he opened his mouth, \u201cMy forbidden magic spell ought to kill it instantly, but there is a problem, it takes long time to chant the incantation of this forbidden magic, and in that time period, I should not be interrupted. And it is very likely that this 9-headed hydra will not give me time to chant this incantation of this forbidden magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the power of forbidden magic spells were extremely strong, but it requires a very long time to chant the incantation of these forbidden magic spells. Just like last time, in the battle between him and Ximen clan, even after Ximen Xinbo had got the aid of God-ranked frost dragon, he had required one whole minute to complete the chanting of incantation of forbidden magic spell. If God-ranked magician experts got sufficient time to prepare, they could release a forbidden magic spells, that could even destroy a town in an instant. But everyone knew that might of the forbidden magic spells, so no one would ever give their foe enough time to prepare the forbidden magic spells.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have a magic spell that can finish off this beast instantly, I will tie it down, and help you to gain enough time for chanting the incantation of forbidden magic spell.\u201d Hearing Wang Qingfeng, Ren Tianyou was relieved. Fortunately Wang Qingfeng had forbidden magic spell which was capable enough to finish off this 9-headed hydra, if Wang Qingfeng didn\u2019t have any means, then without the use of the doujutsu of his Mangekyo Sharingan, he could only use that new big jutsu which he had only learned recently but not yet mastered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly you?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Wang Qingfeng was surprised. He didn\u2019t know whether he should believe in Ren Tianyou or not, after all if he started chanting forbidden magic spell, and was interrupted in the middle, then the power of backlash was enough to cause him a serious injury. And also if he didn\u2019t fight, then it was possible that everyone in Soaring Dragon ship may not survive.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t procrastinate, I\u2019m going first.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t give any time to Wang Qingfeng to think, and quickly made a hand seals with both hands, \u201cSuiton\u2014Suiro no Jutsu! (Water Style\u2014Water Prison Jutsu!)\u201d Then from the water of sea around the 9-headed hydra, suddenly a huge water screen quickly rose and surrounded the 9-headed hydra. [T.L: \u201c\u2014\u2014\u201d Don\u2019t know which water style jutsu this is, its literal meaning is water style\u2014\u2014irrigated land(), overflow of water () , empty or hollow or void ()] [I have been trying to search any jutsu that matched the meaning of words for hours in naruto wiki, but couldn\u2019t find it.][And I think the description much less match Water Prison Jutsu] [If there is any good suggestion, please comment.]</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ren Tianyou had already taken the action, and finally thinking the strange ways he had dodged the mystic light stab, Wang Qingfeng subconsciously believed in Ren Tianyou. Then he quickly retreated back, released a huge amount of powerful wind system magical power and started to quickly chant the incantation for forbidden magic.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

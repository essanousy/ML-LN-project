Fortunately he didn\u2019t rush to take revenge against Ximen clan, otherwise even if he use Susanoo, it was not certain whether he could have leave from there safely. It was so because Ximen clan was capable enough to firmly hold the position of one of the 4 major clan of Aileke Empire and also had the inheritance of mid-saint rank blood lineage called Dragon roar blood lineage. The pheasant living at the lowest rung of Ximen clan, Ximen Tianlong is not capable enough to understand the full strength of Ximen clan. Since he had occupied this body, Ren Tianyou considered that he had the duty to help Ximen Tianlong to get revenge, but he was not that impatient to take the revenge. But once he start, he would attack like a thunderbolt and directly flatten Ximen clan. From the memory of Ximen Tianlong, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any good impression on these member of Ximen clan. If Ren Tianyou was still on the Earth, he maybe not be able to kill any other person, but since he had reborn in this world where only strength is respected and human life was cheaper than the life of the dog, he had no other choice but to contaminate both his hand with the blood of other living beings and also not hesitate to do so. In fact, after obtaining the Naruto system, it was already destined that his hands would be stained. To become a qualified ninja, whose hands are not stained with the bloods of human?</p><br/><p>According to \u2018Chronological history of continent\u2019 book, several ages ago, before 100 ancient clan went to seclusion and when those 100 clans were flourishing, although mankind strength was not that weak, nevertheless they weren\u2019t able to dominate Divine wind continent like now. Because at that time, Divine wind continent was facing the great calamity. The sky above the continent suddenly ripped open along with the deep long rift. Endless passage of abyss was opened, countless demons poured out from this passage. In order to defend their homeland, all the 100 clans and others gave up their prejudice against each other and united to resist against these demons.</p><br/><p>These demons call themselves heavenly demon. Among them there were 12 demon generals, 3 great demon god and furthermore a senior demon of monstrous magical power. But humans gave all they had in their power and only killed 8 demon generals and remaining 4 escaped back to the endless abyss. Among 3 great demon gods, 1 died, 1 sealed and last 1 escaped back to endless abyss. And as for senior demon of monstrous magical power, 100 ancient clan gave their all to knock him back to that endless abyss, and furthermore sealed the opening of that endless abyss. Henceforth 100 ancient clans go and live in seclusion to rest and build up their strength. After that mankind relied on their superior fertility rate, and gradually restored and furthermore dominate Divine wind continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting, never thought that this world is not limited to Divine wind continent. When I got strong enough and at that time if I have free time, then I think I should visit other continents to have a look. Maybe I can find the way back home there.\u201d Looking at the book, he said to himself. Although it is recorded that those demons were very terrifying, nevertheless it has nothing to do with him. Currently the top priority was to increase his strength even more until he return back to Earth. Other issues don\u2019t have any concern with him.</p><br/><p>He put down \u2018Chronological history of continent\u2019 book, then he opened the \u20185 major danger spot\u2019 book. While he read this book, time slowly passed. Ren Tianyou discovered that the information on this book was quite interesting.</p><br/><p>5 major danger spots are Magical beasts forest, Bewildering shadow ravine, Ghosts plains, Weeping god region and Ice cold veins.</p><br/><p>Although Magical beasts forest was paradise for adventurer, still many experts were buried there. Once a group of high level experts, massacred a large number of high level magical beasts for their cores, but after doing so, those experts never returned back from this magical beasts forest. Among those experts there was 1 god ranked expert. No one knows what happened inside magical beasts forest. In the end, some says these experts arose the wrath of all the high level magical beasts, then they were attacked and killed by those magical beasts. Other says, inside Magical beasts forest there is a slumbering magical beast king with fearsome strength, and those group of experts provoke the anger of this magical beast king, and all of them were killed within Magical beasts forest.</p><br/><p>Bewildering shadow ravine is a ravine which is completely filled with bewildering fog. A white colored thick fog is spread all over this ravine, this fog makes those people who enters this ravine, to become unable to differentiate the direction. And the most terrifying thing about this fog was the power of illusion contained within these thick fogs. Once anyone enters this ravine, they would be caught into an endless illusions. Even if you have high strength, and ordinary illusion don\u2019t work on you, nevertheless you won\u2019t be able to withstand these endless illusions. As a result once anyone enters this ravine, basically no one would come out.</p><br/><p>Ghost plains is a death zone. Throughout the year the sky of this place is enveloped by the pale grey colored fog and no one knows why. Inside this plain there are many terrifying undeads roaming around. At present no one dares to enter inside this place. Because till this date no one is capable enough to return back alive after entering this place. Once someone enters, immediately all the contacts with that person would be lost, every kind of magic communication equipment are useless. No one know the reason and also no one dares to probe this place for reason too. Because if someone enters, it will only add one more ghost, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>Weeping god region is a place where even if Gods enter, then they would cry. This is the small island far beyond the sea. Inside this island, there are mankind, magical beasts, spirits, giants\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..skeletons. No one knows what happened inside this island. But the must strange thing was, once a group of experts entered this island, then suddenly an endless aura of grieved gush out from their heart without any reason, and everyone could only shed their tears continuously. From this incident the name Weeping god region was given to this place. And if a person with not enough strength enter this region, then it was possible that he would be buried in this place forever.</p><br/><p>Ice cold veins is the mountain range which is covered by the endless snows throughout the years. The year-round temperature of this place is more than 40 degree below 0. Even if the person with a high level strength enter this place, the inexhaustible cold air envelopes their body causing them to lose at least 2%-3% of their strength. And inside this place, there are many ice system magical beasts roaming around. Legends says that, there is a giant frost dragon at the top of this Ice cold veins. Alsol there are many ice system treasures inside this place, such as iciness fog fruit, once a person eats this fruit, he obtain the ability to control the cold ice. Cold ice crystal, this is the gem of ice system, which all the ice system cultivators crave to protect even in their dream. And if this gem is worn on the body, it had the effect of purifying the mind.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou read about the information about the magical beasts forest, his forehead was completely covered with cold sweat. He ceaselessly rejoiced within his heart, originally he had massacred quite a number of magical beasts in the magical beasts forest to obtain system points so that he could exchange Mangekyo Sharingan and other things. And even now he had thought to return to Magical beasts forest to again massacred even more number of magical beasts so that he could earn system points, but he hadn\u2019t done so, which was lucky for him, otherwise it would be impossible for him to stand here.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou wiped the cold sweats above his forehead and continued to read the explanation about Bewildering shadow ravine. He learnt that this place was filled with the fog containing illusion, even if expert illusionist enter this place, they would eventually sunk in the illusion of this place. But he had Mangekyo Sharingan which could easily see through every illusions, so the illusion within that place would not affect him. But the thick fog would be the problem, as his Sharingan didn\u2019t have the ability to look over 360 degree like Byakugan. So he may lose the sense of direction if he enter this place.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou read about Ghost plains, but he didn\u2019t find this place interesting. According to the information on the book, this was the death zone, no matter who entered, they die. By no means is he stupid enough to enter that place.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was actually interested in Weeping god region. He discovered the crucial point \u2018no matter who enter, they all cry\u2019 very amusing. But according to his guess, this should be illusion but in the end he had never entered this place so he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><br/><p>As for Ice cold veins, he wanted to go there when he had time. With regards to the treasures of this place, he was quite envious.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

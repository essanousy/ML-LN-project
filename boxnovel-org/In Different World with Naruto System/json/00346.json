Under the fear, anger, unwilling\u2026..and so on expression of all demon soldiers, it directly landed covering the entire battlefield, and even Eiffle Capital was also within the area covered by this meteorite.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d ear-deafening explosion sound resounded, that meteorite finally landed, and the underneath ground suddenly shook violently, and as if the doomsday had arrived, ground cracked one after another, and under the terrifying shockwaves that spread all around due to this meteorite colliding against the ground, countless demon soldiers were killed without leaving even dead bones under this attack which could be rated as catastrophic attack. This explosion gave rise to smoke and dusts which instantly spread all over the entire battlefield.</p><br/><p>When the explosion sound disappeared and shaking stopped, now the battlefield was in complete ruins as if a prehistoric beast had rampaged on it. And as for that huge meteorite, it had exploded, changing into countless huge rocks and was raining down in the battlefield.</p><br/><p>And as for that powerful nearly 30 million demon army, they had completely disappeared. Merely a number of demon soldiers had luckily survived under this terrifying attack, as for remaining, they had already changed into ice-cold corpses, and some even had their corpses thoroughly crushed by the meteorite leaving behind not even their dead bones.</p><br/><p>And the original flourishing ancient city\u2014-Eiffle Capital had also changed into a waste city under the impact of the meteorite. City wall and all the buildings inside the city had already collapsed, changing into broken down debris. This scene as if the scene after a disaster was the result of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Tengai Shinsei (Heavenly Obstacle Quaking Star) move.</p><br/><p>And at this time, a boulder suddenly flipped over, then the soil burst out. After that Agule and Yisha jumped out from inside. When the meteorite was just about to land, Yisha had used her special ability to hide herself and Agule under the ground, moreover she changed the density of soil around, making them incomparably solid. In this way, they were luckily able to keep their small life, surviving this terrifying attack.</p><br/><p>After they stood firmly, and slightly calming down their rolling over and over blood and qi within their body, they looked around the battlefield. The scene they saw however immediately overwhelmed them.</p><br/><p>There was the sound of wailing mournfully everywhere in the battlefield. Countless demon soldiers had already died under this meteorite, and they could estimate that merely less than 30,000 demon soldiers had survived, moreover among these survived demon soldiers, basically all of them were injured. Seeing this scene before their eyes, the eyes of Agule and Yisha instantly turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, damn human, come out, I, Agule will definitely kill you.\u201d When he had set off, Agule was high-spirited, he believed that humanity was basically powerless to stop his elite army, but to his surprise, a single human destroyed his entire legion. So how could he keep himself from getting angry?</p><br/><p>Agule looked up to the heaven and roared, and with that tyrannical aura on his body suddenly rising sharply, he punched the huge rock beside him. Immediately \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound resounded, and cracks appeared on this huge rock. Shortly afterwards, with a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, it shattered into countless fragment and fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>And just then, suddenly an ear-deafening dragon roar resounded in distant sky, attracting the gaze of Agule and Yisha. They saw a black colored dragon shaped light made up of demonic power was directly streaking across the horizon and was flying towards them in a high speed.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018xiu\u2019 sound, Anlake descended down from the sky and landed in front of Agule and Yisha.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe pay respect to Your Excellency Anlake.\u201d Seeing the arrival of Anlake, Agule and Yisha immediately bowed and greeted respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here? How did it became this way?\u201d Seeing the circumstance around, as well as countless dead or injured demon soldiers, Anlake asked Agule and Yisha with ugly expression.</p><br/><p>Agule and Yisha looked at each other, then narrated the matter of encountering Ren Tianyou, his surprise attack as well as how Ren Tianoyu finally summoned a meteorite to exterminate the entire legion in full detail.</p><br/><p>After hearing the narration of Agule and Yisha, Anlake became incomparably solemn. Merely a single person destroyed an entire legion? Especially that earth-shattering meteorite he had summoned just now, even when he was several hundred kilometers away at that time, he was able to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems the worry of Her Majesty is really accurate.\u201d Anlake solemnly thought inwardly. Before he had set out to here, Yaorao had told him that she feared that this legion will encounter the attack of strongest human, so she was making him to go to support this army.</p><br/><p>Because for the truly strong expert, crowd tactics was merely a joke, as no quality and only quantity simply couldn\u2019t threaten these strong experts. Just like 30,000 years ago, Demon Empress had raised her hand and she directly changed 3 million army of humanity and 100 clans into the pool of blood.</p><br/><p>At this time, on the broken-down high platform not far away from them, the space suddenly distorted, then Ren Tianyou walked out from inside.</p><br/><p>Then looking at the scene he had created, Ren Tianyou showed a cruel smile, and said, \u201cThe might of this move is pretty good, this scene is truly fascinating ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn human, you finally came out, I will definitely kill you.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou had appeared, Agule roared, while glaring at Ren tianyou with his eyes that seemed to want to shoot out flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the one who caused this?\u201d Seeing the appearance of Ren Tianyou, Anlake asked while coldly staring at Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so, are you going to avenge these trash?\u201d Hearing Anlake, Ren Tianyou\u2019s Rinnegan firmly stared at him, and feeling the energy within this body of Anlake, he unhurriedly thought inwardly, \u201cIs he a Demon God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen drop dead, Demon Dragon Wave!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ablake coldly snorted, then a large amount of black colored energy wave flew out from his body, and changing into a huge black dragon, it shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Looking at the black colored demonic dragon, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then raising his right hand, along with the eye power circulating in his Rinnegan, under the surprise gaze of everyone, the energy of this demonic dragon was unexpectedly absorbed by Ren Tianyou, causing it to slowly shrink, and finally disappear.</p><br/><p>This was one of the ability of Rinnegan that could absorb any energy based attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing the move of Ren Tianyou, the complexion of Anlake suddenly blanked, and yelled in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, with only three of you, you all are not qualified to fight with me, let my pawns accompany you to play.\u201d Looking at Anlake and other two, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then he began to quickly make a series of hand seals. And along with the circulation of chakra within his body, he placed his right hand on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose\u2014-Edo Tensei! (Summoning Jutsu\u2014-Reanimation!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, from the ground in front of Anlake and others, suddenly three coffins bore out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And before anyone could react, it instantly changed into several afterimages and disappeared from before the eyes of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing this, all the pedestrians couldn\u2019t help but were dumbfounded. They rubbed their eyes and they subconsciously thought, \u201cIs that the speed mankind can achieve?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why did we stopped moving?\u201d At this time, one charming female voice came from inside one silver white carriage, then one delicate jade hand reach out from inside the carriage, and opened the door curtain of that carriage, then a woman wearing black dress whose face was covered with a piece of black gauze walked out from inside that carriage. After that she asked what was going on towards knights wearing pitch-black knight warrior suit of armor who were riding gale horse by the side of the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to holy maiden, just now someone suddenly ran past this place in extremely high speed, even I was barely able to see only afterimages.\u201d Among them, one knight holding a black spear who was at the most front position of this knight group fling the reins of gale horse and came at the side of carriage, then replied offering a respectful bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing the answer of this knight, this woman in black dress was somewhat surprised and exclaimed aloud.</p><br/><p>But before she finished speaking, the pedestrians in front suddenly cried out in alarm again. A purple colored lightning shadow with powerful lightning light was quickly advancing forward in the middle of the crowd by dodging all of them.</p><br/><p>She only felt a blur before her eyes, and that shadow of a human figure had already passed the knight groups in front her and finally stepped on the roof of her carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d At this time, suddenly a surprised voice came from this purple lightning shadow, then when this figure jumped off from the roof of this carriage and was still in the midair, this shadow turned around his head, and this woman clearly saw a pair of blood-red eyes. Inside those eyes, each one had three strange black colored magatama which was quickly spinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose eyes, don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s him?\u201d Seeing those pair of red eyes, this woman in black clothing fell into deep thought. She would never forget that night, a man with those same eyes had seriously injured her, and she was forced to use space scroll which was very difficult to get to run away.</p><br/><p>But when this girl was lost in thought, that lightning shadow in the midair had already disappeared. Before anyone could react to stop him, he had also already disappeared similarly before their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did I feel d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and as if I have seen her somewhere before when I saw that woman in black dress?\u201d Running in the road, Ren Tianyou slowly thought. Just now when he saw that woman wearing black dress at that carriage, he had a kind of familiar feeling, \u201cBut also not ah, although its already more than three years since I arrived in this world, but the number of people I am familiar with is not that many, so how could I forget any of them? Don\u2019t tell me she is someone Ximen Tianlong this guy knew? Forget about it, regardless of anything, catching this slippery guy in front is first priority.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about Bu Feng in the front, Ren Tainyou felt pain in ass again. Just think he however had to go through many arduous training to achieve his current speed, but the speed of this guy in front was actually a little bit faster compared to him. If he didn\u2019t have the support of nintaijutsu of raikage which use lightning chakra to simulate his physical body, improving his speed, then Bu Feng would have already lost him. Even now he could only barely keep up the pace with Bu Feng nothing more, so wanting to catch him was very difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need to open Hachimon Tonkou (The 8 Inner Gate)? Won\u2019t do, the backlash of Hachimon Tonkou (The 8 Inner Gate) is too big. What if even after opening 7th gate, I am still powerless to overtake him, then after the beginning of side effect, I will completely lose him.\u201d Looking straight at that very quickly running ahead figure, Ren Tianyou firmly gritted his teeth as he hatefully thought inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about it, can only take a step at a time. Now the most important thing is to not lose him.\u201d Looking at that natural and unrestrained elegant figure in the front as well as his that speed, Ren Tianyou strengthen his plan to subdue him to join his Akatsuki organization.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, didn\u2019t expect you are actually able to keep up with me like this ah, very good, but can you still increase your speed.\u201d Seeing that lighting figure was still able to keep up the pace with him, Bu Feng burst into loud laughter and said. Simultaneously, a kind of \u2018wanting to compete\u2019 thought appeared inside his heart.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he Bu Feng, relying on his speed had effortlessly entered the place with magnificent army with thousands of men and horses as if getting into his back garden as he please, and killed the people of Light Palace, but he however still hadn\u2019t felt any pressure. Finally in front of several Red robbed cardinals who were God domain experts, he killed a group of golden knight, then swaggered off. If he want to run, it might as well say no one was able to block and stop him. In terms of speed, if Bu Feng was second, then no one is capable of being first.</p><br/><p>But now the person behind him however was actually able to barely keep pace with his speed. This instantly gave rise to his idea of having competition with Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>He Bu Feng had no shortage in money, also didn\u2019t like fame and fortune, the sole reason he had taken the job of assassin was to improve his speed, and to become even faster. So he always took high difficulty assassin mission. The greater the difficulty, the more he liked, because for him, only real expert would give him pressure, and only after feeling pressure, his speed would become even faster. And this time he had selected the mission to assassinate all Akatsuki members for this same reason, but now, he found better target, i.e. Ren Tianyou behind him. As for failure of mission, he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, whether you are even faster or not, you can\u2019t run away from me today.\u201d Hearing Bu Feng, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly, but inside his heart, he also wanted to test the maximum limit of his own speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, hope you are able to.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng slightly smiled. Then that strange dagger in his right hand streak across making a beautiful arc, and directly flew back to that sheath in his waist.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, he quickly made a hand gesture with both of his hand, then in that light cyan battle qi radiance above his body, slowly pale hazy starlight appeared, surrounding his whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cStars blood lineage, appear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Bu Feng, suddenly a star mark appeared in his forehead, and his cyan colored wind system douqi around his body was directly replaced by that hazy starlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing that pale hazy starlight, Ren Tianyou who was chasing behind frowned, \u201cCould it be that all along, this guy had not opened his blood lineage? Must it be so abnormal ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, are you ready, now be sure to not lose me.\u201d Sensing that pale starlight around his body, Bu Feng laughed, then as if his body changed into a dazzling starlight, he suddenly rushed forward very quickly and a long stars radiance followed behind him. \u201cStars step\u2014- Star transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Bu Feng instantly exploding with speed, Ren Tianyou directly felt like throwing up a mouthful of blood, \u201cF**k, must his speed be so fast ah, big brother, are you really only God rank?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou\u2019s heart felt as if thousands of grass-mud horse run past his head, then his mood immediately become very bitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister, today, I, your father will also so all out.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou threw a black colored small pill in his mouth, then the lightning chakra radiances around his body suddenly rose violently and sharply. The lightning god armor on his body become even more life-like, and looking from distant, he looked just like lightning god that had descended to the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Ren Tianyou looked up to the heave and let out a loud roar, and the sound waves spread in all direction. Then after he exert strength in his right leg, the ground around suddenly cracked open a huge fissure. A huge crater appeared under his leg. After that Ren Tianyou changed into a dazzling lightning shadow precisely following the direction where Bu Feng had disappeared.</p><br/><p>After further using lightning chakra to actively change his physical body, his speed suddenly rose sharply, but the burden in his physical body also become very big.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those countless black colored energy balls which he had shot out from his fists landed on the underneath ground before his eyes, giving rise to the series of loud explosion sound. And Ren Tianyou was thoroughly engulfed within this explosion.</p><br/><p>Even so Amike however didn\u2019t stop his movements, he continuously swung his fists for one minutes. The ground around the explosion was already torn to pieces, and due to the large amount of dusts and smoke rising from the ground, the circumstance of the ground underneath was not clearly visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, did that finish him?\u201d Looking at the continuous explosion underneath, Amike stopped his movement. After that breathing out, he firmly stared at the ground underneath for any movement.</p><br/><p>After about three minutes, the smoke and dust underneath gradually dissipated, revealing the circumstance inside. But seeing the circumstance underneath, the pupils of Amike firmly shrunk, as he exclaimed in surprise, \u201cThis is\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Underneath on the ground there was a shield like huge wooden structure. And a huge devil face was carved above this wooden structure. And this shield was emitting a fresh aura of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Seeing this huge wooden shield, Amike was confused. And at that time, \u2018ka ka\u2019 sound came from underneath shield and this devil face came apart from the middle, revealing a huge groove inside. And a figure of a person was standing inside it, and that person was naturally Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>This moment Ren Tianyou was standing there without any injury, and his Sharingan were firmly staring at Amike. And just at this moment, his right eye suddenly got bloodshot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Amaterasu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, suddenly a pitch-black colored flame appeared on the shoulder of Amike, and began to burn rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Amike felt pain in his shoulder, and what made him frightened the most was, when he used his magical power to extinguish this flame, as if his magical power had become a fuel, this strange black flame burned even more violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Amike snorted coldly, then the divinity crystal within his body flashed with black light, releasing a terrifying repulsive force from within his body, which directly shook off Amaterasu from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s that easy, Enton\u2014-Kagutsuchi! (Inferno Style\u2014-Flame Control!)\u201d Ren Tianyou coldly shouted, directly using Kagutsuchi. After that the flame of Ametarasu which were shaken off from the body of Amike suddenly gathered rapidly, then changing into pitch-black colored fire dragon, it advanced towards Amike.</p><br/><p>After experiencing the power of Amaterasu, how could Amike let this flame attach to him again so easily? And without even looking at his already burnt black right arm, he already know that the degree of burn was so serious that right now his right arm was almost useless.</p><br/><p>Looking at this black colored fire dragon, Amike directly punched in front with his left hand which contained huge power. Suddenly the space in front of him gave out a \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound, and a huge black hole appeared there, which swallowed this fire dragon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

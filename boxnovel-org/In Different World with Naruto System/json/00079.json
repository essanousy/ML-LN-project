A cold sweat were unceasingly flowing out from his forehead. Successively using 2 form of transmigration 6 change was still the great burden for Yan Xinluo. He was filling pain all over the body, in addition most of his battle qi was exhausted. And Yan Xinluo was showing a wry smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Without losing any time the judge stepped up inside the arena, then after inspecting Wang Yanli, he released a sigh of relief as he discovered that he had merely lost his consciousness due to the intense shock wave. Fortunately it was nothing serious, or else\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>The judge stood up, then announced Yan Xinluo as the winner of the match. Then the audiences gave a warm applause. And especially Ren Tianyou and his classmates clapped until their hands were red. Because after the match was won by Yan Xinluo, it was certain that their class would win the first and also take the second place too, and to this must be added the points accumulated by Sun Chuqian and Wang Haiqing, so it was already decided that their class would be the overall winner of this cultivation room ranking competition.</p><br/><p>After Yan Xinluo stepped down from the arena, Wang Jiafei said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, today I will treat you all to a meal outside the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I think you should treat us meal tomorrow instead.\u201d Ren Tianyou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Wang Jiafei was clearly stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we are in extremely bad condition, so we should hurry back to recover our strength, and prepare our self for the tomorrow\u2019s final match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe top 2 position is already yours, and it is already clear that the overall 1st position is also ours. So is it really necessary for you two to fight till the bitter end?\u201d Wang Jiafei asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, highly necessary, because this is a fight as a cultivator. And also even if I agree, you think Yan Xinluo would also agree to end it peacefully?\u201d Ren Tianyou lightly laughed and explained.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, Wang Jiafei turned her head, and as expected she saw the eyes of Yan Xinluo was shining with strong fighting intention. Immediately Wang Jiafei covered her face with her hand and couldn\u2019t help but heaved a sigh, \u201cFine. So it\u2019s like that, I just hope both of you do not go too far in the match tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Ren Tianyou and Yan Xinluo both replied. After that both of them returned their respective dormitory, and started to recover their strength.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>At 9 o\u2019clock in the next morning, the square of Supreme light academy was completely filed with the crowds of peoples, and their voices. Almost all the 1st grade students of Supreme Light Academy were gathered here, because this was the finals of cultivation room ranking completion of 1st grade. And no one wanted to miss this match, one could even say that this was the match between strongest students of 1st grade.</p><br/><p>In general, many peoples had gathered here from early morning, to get the suitable seat to watch this rare brilliant match. Not only that but, many power of imperial capital Kalisi had also heard the rumor about this match and rushed over to watch this match. They intended to throw out an olive branch after the match was over to draw them in their own power.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents of Supreme Light Academy, and everyone, good morning!\u201d At this time, blue light flashed in the sky above the arena, and the dean Long Feilu suddenly appeared in the air above the arena. \u201cAfter several days of intense selection matches, in the end we have already arrived at the final match of this completion. I believe you all are also looking forward to this match just like me. So now I will declare the official start of the final match of this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Long Feilu, all the peoples of the audiences gave a warm applause. Long Feilu waved his hand and immediately the applause slowly reduced, \u201cNow I ask the participants of today\u2019s match to come up in the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Ren Tianyou and Yan Xinluo simultaneously appeared on the arena, they stood opposite to each other and were staring at each other. And the eyes of both of them were burning with strong fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it seems like both of them already can\u2019t wait for the start of the match. Fine, I will also not waste any more time. I myself will be taking charge of this match, now I announce the start of this match.\u201d Right after Long Feilu flashed outside the arena, an earth colored barrier surrounded the whole arena. Vice-dean Zhao Guanghui had also appeared outside the arena, actually he was the one who had erected the barrier.</p><br/><p>After the barrier was erected, Ren Tianyou and Yan Xinluo both released blue colored and grey colored rays of lights from their respective body. Karma transmigration also automatically came out from the sheath, flew to the right hand of Yan Xinluo and issued an excited sound. \u201cDo you know? Actually I have been waiting for this match for a long period of time.\u201d Touching the ice-cold blade of karma transmigration, Yan Xinluo said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, me too.\u201d Holding his Sword of Kusanagi, strong lightning light rose form his body, and changed into a lightning armor. Ren Tianyou was also excited for this match. [T.L: from now on it will be Sword of Kusanagi not Snake sword!]</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Both Ren Tianyou and Yan Xinluo said in unison. Saying this, both of them simultaneously rushed towards each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDang!\u201d A sound of metal colliding rang out, at the center of the arena, the sword of Kusanagi of Ren Tianyou and Karma transmigration of Yan Xinluo had confronted each other. Both of them were unceasingly trying to overpower each other, but both of them were firmly blocking each other. Under the power of both of them, the arena was issuing the \u201cka ka\u201d scattering sound.</p><br/><p>At this time, the undead battle qi around the body of Yan Xinluo started to violently stir, and an undead battle qi halo suddenly appeared before his eyes, \u201cUndead shock wave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A violent sound of explosion rang out, and Yan Xinluo as the center, a circular deep dent appeared on the arena. But the silhouette of Ren Tianyou had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>Yan Xinluo suddenly heard a sound coming from above his head, immediately raised his head and saw Ren Tianyou who was covered violent lightning, and he was raising his right leg high up in the air, and as if a huge lightning chop, his leg advanced straight towards Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Girochin Doroppu!\u201d (Lightning Style\u2014Guillotine Drop!)</p><br/><p>With a \u201cswish\u201d sound, Yan Xinluo rapidly retreated. When Yan Xinluo had just retreated less than 1 meter from his original location, the attack of Ren Tianyou fell at that original location. \u201cHong!\u201d A loud sound of explosion rang out, and a huge strong shock wave spread in all direction, and this shock wave also advanced towards the retreating Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead shield!\u201d The undead battle qi around the body of Yan Xinluo quickly stirred, condensed, and took the shape of a huge shield in front of him. This shield successfully blocked this huge shock waves. At this time, a blue colored lightning suddenly rushed towards Yan Xinluo from the middle of the dusts in a high speed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had opened up his right arm, and was directly chasing the retreating Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014 Rariatto!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014Lariat!)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

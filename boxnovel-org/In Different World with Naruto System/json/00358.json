And noticing this spying upon power, Yaorao also immediately ceased her action, and spread her divine sense looking for that spying upon consciousness.</p><br/><p>Just then, a voice suddenly resounded on the mind of Ren Tianyou: \u201cSire Zero, I am Ling Xiaotian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClan Head of Tianji clan? Why are you seeking me?\u201d Hearing the voice in his brain, Ren Tianyou replied back in his brain feeling surprised. He wondered why he was seeking him in a time like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this, I would like to trouble Sire to draw this battle to the sea area, because the land there is already unable to withstand your battle. Right now Eiffle Capital\u2019s land is already in a complete mess, and if it is hit again, then the land around will definitely sink.\u201d The requesting voice of Ling Xiaotian resounded in the mind of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Xiaotian, Ren Tianyou seriously looked the surroundings of all around. The land around was already in ruin, there were huge craters and cracks all around the ground. And water had already begun to spring out from deep underground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u2026!\u201d Ren Tianyou exhaled a long breathe, then said towards Ling Xiaotian in his brain, \u201cWell, I got it, I will try to draw the battlefield to the sea area as much as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Sire Zero.\u201d Hearing the reply of Ren Tianyou, Ling Xiaotian gratefully thanked to Ren Tianyou. But he also knew that this matter was not good to do, after all, current Ren Tianyou and Yaorao were evenly matched, so it was not so easy to change the location of battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, quickly leave, I will try to draw the battlefield to seaside as much as possible. The Demon Empress seems to have already noticed your existence, if she follow the tracks of your divine sense to launch an attack towards Radiance Capital, then that would be bad.\u201d Seeing Yaorao seemed to have already discovered Ling Xiaotian, Ren Tianyou hastily said to Ling Xiaotian in his brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I hope Sire will be careful, and hope you will win a victory on raising the flag in this place.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ling Xiaotian said a sentence and disappeared from the battlefield.</p><br/><p>And as for distant Yaorao, after noticing that spying upon consciousness had disappeared, she again paid complete attention to that Full Body Susanoo of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly cannot look down upon the energy of that thing, it seems I have to come up with real strength to deal with him.\u201d Looking at that huge body of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, Yaorao couldn\u2019t help but thought solemnly.</p><br/><p>But at this time, Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo suddenly sprout two huge energy wings behind it. Then flapping its wings, this Full Body Susanoo which was over 50 meters in height flew away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to run? It\u2019s not that easy.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou wanted to fly away, Yaorao couldn\u2019t help but snorted coldly, then changing into a purple light, she chased after Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Merely after running less than 100 li distance, Yaorao had already caught up to him.</p><br/><p>After that Yaorao waved her hand, and Purple Ling Dark Break flew out from her body and shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing Purple Ling Dark Break flying towards him, the right hand of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo brandished Futsu no Mitama sword, sending out a huge purple colored lighting slash towards Purple Ling Dark Break, knocking it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to run? Today unless you hand over Tower of Babel to me, don\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s possible to leave this place.\u201d Yaorao caught the knocked back Purple Ling Dark Break, then coldly shouted towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Yaorao waved her hand again, then purple colored radiance flew towards the sky, and two space black holes appeared in the sky. Shortly afterwards, two loud roar came through these two black holes, and two figures flew out from inside that black hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Seeing these two figures that had flown out from the space black hole, the pupils of Ren Tianyou suddenly shrunk, and flashed with shocked expression.</p><br/><p>One was a nine headed huge snake which was over 40 meter in length, it flew out of black hole and landed beside Yaorao, and its nine pairs of eyes coldly stared at Ren Tianyou, precisely was Yaorao\u2019s demon pet\u2014-Abyss Hydra.</p><br/><p>This Abyss Hydra had already stepped into the realm of God Emperor in strength, although was not as strong as Yaorao, but was far stronger than Demon Gods.</p><br/><p>And the other one made Ren Tianyou even more surprised, because it turned out that the other one was precisely that Thousand Eyes Evil Beast that was trapped in Demon World.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this fellow appear here? According to reason, it and Yaorao are definitely mortal enemies, so it shouldn\u2019t have helped her.\u201d The appearance of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast surprised Ren Tianyou the most, he didn\u2019t understand why Thousand Eyes Evil Beast was helping Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, Your Majesty Demon Empress, is this human the enemy of this time?\u201d Abyss Hydra flew down from the sky, and came underneath Yaorao, letting her stand at the centermost snake head, and asked. As for Thousand Eyes Evil beast, it landed beside Abyss Hydra and floated there without any movement and sound.</p><br/><p>What Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t notice was, after Thousand Eyes Evil Beast appeared, a strange mirror suddenly appeared on the waist of Yaorao, and stuck with her belt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we absolutely can\u2019t let this fellow run away, Tower of Babel is with him.\u201d Yaorao nodded her head and said to Abyss Hydra.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Abyss Hydra answered, then it raised one of its snake head, and purple colored lightning sparks gathered above its that snake head.</p><br/><p>Along with the call of Abyss Hydra, suddenly large amount of black clouds which was densely covered with lighting sparks appeared in the sky. Huge lightning snakes were unceasingly wandering in this cloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunderbolt Roar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Abyss Hydra, countless huge thunderbolts struck towards the Susanoo of Ren Tianyou from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d, \u201chong\u2019, \u201chong\u201d\u2026\u2026a series of explosion sound unceasingly resounded, and the Susanoo of Ren Tianyou was engulfed by countless thunderbolts, and under these thunderbolts, the ground around ruptured with a loud bang.</p><br/><p>When thunderbolts ceased, and dark clouds dissipated, Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo was standing there without a scratch. And right now lightning sparks were glimmering around Futsu no Mitama swords, and the surroundings\u2019 lightning elements were being rapidly absorbed by Futsu no Mitama sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He is absorbing lightning.\u201d Seeing its lightning was being absorbed, Abyss Hydra exclaimed in surprise. It had never expected this result.</p><br/><p>No kidding, Fursu no Mitama sword was the sword of Takemikazuchi, possessing the ability to control myriads of thunder and lightning, so how could ordinary lightning attack flaunt its superiority in front of this sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I have already recovered Rinnegan\u2019s power, I don\u2019t need to waste eye power using Susanoo.\u201d Feeling the recovery of his Rinnegan, Ren Tianyou slowly thought.</p><br/><p>This was not because Susanoo was weak, rather because Ren Tianyou wanted to use other moves first to deal with these three in front of him, after all, the mobility of Susanoo was somewhat weak, so facing the besiege of three people, it would be hard to dodge.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, The Susanoo around Ren Tianyou slowly melted, revealing Ren Tianyou\u2019s body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

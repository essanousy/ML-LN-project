Ren Tian You believed that if he believe in his own strength and cultivate, then there will come a day when his strength will soar to the heavens.</p><br/><p>Although he possessed an ultra-powerful good item\u2014-Naruto system, nevertheless this system merely made his starting point to be a bit better compared to other person, nothing more. So the most important thing to become strong was to relay on himself and his own effort, nothing else.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tian You fell into a deep sleep, and early in the next morning, he woke up. Today he wanted to report and attend the class in the academy.</p><br/><p>Although he already possessed all the inheritance of Naruto world, nevertheless the cultivation system of this world also had the heritage of over millions of years, so it definitely had its own merits. Ren Tian You intends to borrow this worlds\u2019 cultivation system, and adding it together with his Naruto system, he wanted to create 1 or 2 unique ninjutsu which only belong to him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore this Supreme light academy still had that mysterious Babel tower, Ren Tian You was extremely curious about this tower. This was the mysterious tower that existed even before the establishment of Supreme light academy, and the information about it was tightly sealed, so no information about it could be found. Ren Tian You was looking for an opportunity to enter this tower.</p><br/><p>After getting out of the bed, he performed all his morning duties, and freshen up. Then he stealthily walked out from his room. \u2018Grandfather\u2019s, this is my own dormitory but I am forced to behave like some thief.\u2019 Ren Tian You was never this depressed before. \u2018That damn Li Yun, don\u2019t let me meet you again, otherwise I will let you taste the pain of having your chrysanthemum explode.\u2019 Recalling the time when Li Yun assigned the dormitory for him, he couldn\u2019t help but grind his teeth and wanted to slaughter him.</p><br/><p>After leaving the dormitory, he directly walked towards the class of warrior skill court. Yesterday evening, Lan Yan had already told him the location of warrior skill court. Today he wanted to directly report and attend this class.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You walked for about 20 minutes, and arrived before a 5 storied tall building. His special class was located at 5th floor. Ren Tian You entered the building and at the fifth floor he found his class. Then he opened the door and entered the class, then he saw a spacious classroom where about 30 students were sitting and a single beautiful lady was standing at the platform. This lady had red colored hair, her figure was also slender. When Ren Tian You opened the door and entered the class, the eyes of all the students including this female focused on Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, student, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d The red haired beautiful lady was staring at Ren Tian You with her fresh eyes, and with her sexy light voice, she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am newly-arrived student, and it seemed I was assigned to this class.\u201dRen Tian You crooked his head and slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then take out your notice for me to examine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you meant this?\u201d Ren Tian You took out a piece of paper from his ninja backpack. That piece of paper was given to Ren Tian You by Li Yun yesterday.</p><br/><p>That young girl came before Ren Tian You, at that time the nostrils of Ren Tian You were filled with the hot aroma, which almost made Ren Tian You intoxicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you actually defeated\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Looking at the result of test in that piece of paper, that young girl was surprised. Her lips parted involuntarily and with an amazement in her eyes, she read everything that was written on that piece of paper.</p><br/><p>Very quickly she realized her misbehavior, and immediately controlled her surprise feeling on the surface. Then facing Ren Tian You she said, \u201cI\u2019m Wang Jia Fei, hereafter one of your guiding teacher, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You followed Wang Jia Fei and arrived above the platform. Looking towards all the students, she said, \u201cEveryone, today we have a new student in our class again, so let him introduce himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Ren Tian You, am an orphan, and currently 17 years old.\u201d Facing all the students, Ren Tian You introduced himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, student Ren Tian You, you can sit on the right corner at the back.\u201d Pointing at the open seat at the back, Wang Jia Fei said to Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ren Tian walked towards the pointed seat.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You sat down and looked in front of him, then he discovered that the mysterious boy whom he had met yesterday was also sitting in front of him. Watching this fellow, Ren Tian You showed a mysterious smile in his lips. After that he no longer paid attention to that youth and looked at the platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents, just a moment ago, we were speaking about the things we should know as a warrior. We are able to use battle qi because of battle qi seed inside our body, this seed absorbs the energy within the atmosphere and turn it into battle qi. According to different deposition of individuals, they absorbs different types of energy from the atmosphere.\u201d Standing at the platform, Wang Jia Fei slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the innate talents of everyone is different, this affects the size of the battle qi seed. With the exception of innate talent, battle qi cultivation manual is also extremely important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs we all know, battle qi cultivation manual, magic secret law, and illusion secret book are all divided into Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow\u2014-4 large rank. Each rank is further divided into 3 sub rank (low, mid and high). And the quality of battle qi cultivation manual is influenced by the energy absorbing speed from the atmosphere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, the most commonly found low-yellow ranked battle qi cultivation manual, it only contains the most basic method. So, mid-yellow rank battle qi cultivation manual is at least 3 times better that low-yellow ranked method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe quality of the cultivation manual also affects the absorption quality of battle qi. Most of the common manuals teaches to directly absorb the energy which is filled with impurities, so they had to spend their time to refine that impurities. But some of the better quality cultivation manuals can decrease the amount of impurities while absorbing battle qi, this helps cultivators to save their time needed to refine the impurities. And they will have more time to cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll battle qi is divided into fire, water, wind, lightning, earth, light and dark, these 7 big battle qi system. But there are also variation battle qi, such as ice system battle qi. Nevertheless, no matter what system battle qi, they each have their own characteristics. Like flame system had scorching and explosion, water system had constant and continuous, wind system had elegance, lightning system had paralysis, earth system had thick and heavy, light system had heal, and finally dark system had corrode and so on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese system of battle qi don\u2019t have any rank, as long as we deeply comprehend our respective element, we can become an expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I am fire system warrior, I pursue the profound understanding of fire system\u2019s wild character. After advancing to Saint Class, do I really need to train our battle qi? Without doubt, I know that this is too early to ask. I asked this question because if we don\u2019t need to train our battle qi after Saint Class, then currently we should focus more in learning element power rather than training battle qi. This may help us in ascending higher rank in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, only comprehending the element power and not cultivating or training battle qi is not possible. It is so because, even if you comprehend deep level insight on elemental power, you won\u2019t have required strength to put it into action. And without comprehension of element power one cannot be powerful expert. So both of them is necessary for becoming expert warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I am going to explain about my understanding on element power, this will be very helpful for you all to increase your strength in the future. So listen carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carefully listening to the explanations of battle qi, elemental power etc. from Wang Jia Fei, the first lesson of Ren Tian You in the different world began.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

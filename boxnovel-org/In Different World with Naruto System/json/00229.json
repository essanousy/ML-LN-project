And in front of this valley stands a huge stele, which was carved with few large character. Magic Doman, Death to Trespasser!</p><br/><p>Inside this valley, many Magic Towers stood in great numbers at all place. These towers were glimmering with huge magic halo. And among those many Magic Towers inside this entire valley, there was only four exceptionally towering huge Magic Towers. The magic fluctuation of these four Magic Towers compared to ordinary Magic Towers were far more powerful. These four Magic Towers were glimmering with four large magic radiances, making a huge barrier surrounding the entire Magic Domain.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, a disaccord white colored radiance regarded that huge barrier as if nothing, and directly passed through its obstruction, infiltrating the Magic Domain.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, in the centermost tallest Magic Tower, a middle-aged man wearing fiery red magic robe was sitting on a huge throne with his eyes shut. But just when this white colored radiance passed through the barrier, the eyes of this middle-aged man suddenly snapped opened, and with a huge flame around his body, he disappeared from that audience hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares to intrude Magic Domain, roll out for me.\u201d In the sky of Magic Domain, along with a flash of flame, a loud voice resounded through the Magic Domain. After that with this condensation of this huge flame, that middle-aged man slowly appeared at that place. Then he began to firmly stare at that place from where white colored radiance had infiltrated.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, from the side\u2019s four huge Magic Towers, fly out a yellow, a purple, a green and a blue lights respectively. Very quickly those light flew behind this middle-aged man, and dissipated, revealing four magicians holding magic staff including Jade Maiden\u2019s personal enemy Ling Yanqi among them.</p><br/><p>These four peoples were the four big leader of Magic Domain. Earth system leader residing in Earth God Magic Tower, Ling Yanqi. Lightning system leader residing in Violent Thunderclap Magic Tower, Lei Ba. Wind system leader residing in Pure Wind Magic Tower, Feng Yunxiang. Water system leader residing in Sea Source Magic Tower, Shui Linglong.</p><br/><p>\u201cDomain Master, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Ling Yanqi stepped forward towards this middle-aged man and asked respectfully.</p><br/><p>Domain Master, this middle-aged man was this generation\u2019s Domain Master of Magic Domain, Flame High God\u2014\u2014Fen Tian!</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone have broken through the barrier and sneak into Magic Domain just a moment ago.\u201d Fen Tian indifferently said. After that a fiery red magic staff with three best quality huge fire magic core embedded on it suddenly appeared in his hand. Then a pale magic radiance flew out from that magic staff which spread in all direction. He was clearly using probing type magic.</p><br/><p>But what made Feng Tian disappointed was, even with his this magic, he made no discovery.</p><br/><p>But at that time, in the sky in front of these 5 people, suddenly a white colored radiance flashed. This white colored radiance slowly reorganized, forming an illusionary figure of Jade Maiden in the midair. But right now her body nevertheless was illusionary without substance. It clearly was only a phantom.</p><br/><p>And inside the Fragrance restaurant of Dark capital which was 30 li away, Ren Tianyou and his group clearly saw the circumstance of Magic Domain from the Dazzling Light Mirror created by jade Maiden.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, let the show begin.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly thought while drinking wine.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Seeing this figure, Fen Tian frowned, but before he could open his mouth, Ling Yanqi behind him cried out in alarm with shock flashing in his eyes. Simultaneously he was continuously thinking in his heart, as he was very clear that Jade Maiden had come here to talk with him. He had killed her whole family, so if she could she would have already skinned and pull out his tendons. Last time, because of Ren Tianyou, he had wasted large amount of energy, and used his own blood to use secret skill to escape. After that he had to lie on the bed for one year, slowly recovering over time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know this woman?\u201d Hearing Ling Yanqi, Fen Tian frowned and turned around to look at him, then asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting back to Domain Master, this woman is member of Akatsuki organization.\u201d Ling Yanqi respectfully bowed slightly and answered. He however was very clear about the means of this person before his eyes, so he didn\u2019t dare to have slightest amount of disrespect.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, didn\u2019t expect the strength of Domain Master is this high, I had just entered and you have already discovered me.\u201d Seeing five big experts of Magic Domain in front of her, Jade Maiden lightly laughed after covering her mouth and said without a shred of pressure of being surrounded. This was not because the strength of Jade Maiden was too high, rather her current body was basically formed by using her power of blood lineage. There was no substance, so even if this was destroyed there wasn\u2019t any loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk less nonsense, don\u2019t know what matter your Akatsuki organization have with our Magic Domain, in my impression, we don\u2019t seem to have any intersection between us, so there ought to be no enmity.\u201d Fen Tian frowned, but didn\u2019t take any action. With his eyesight, he naturally knew that this was merely a phantom nothing more, so there was no use even if he destroyed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDomain Master you however spoke incorrectly.\u201d Looking at Ling Yanqi behind Fen Tian, Jade Maiden said without any fluctuation in her mood. She was looking towards Ling Yanqi as if she was looking at a dead person, and that would indeed become fact very soon, because when Akatsuki organization arrive here, Ling Yanqi absolutely won\u2019t be able to flee again relying on his any means.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Don\u2019t know where I spoke wrong?\u201d Fen Tian indifferently said still frowning without any fluctuation in his mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Akatsuki organization have very big hatred against you magic Domain, so how can it be said that we don\u2019t have any enmity?\u201d Jade Maiden said while looking at Fen Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, this instead is a surprise for me, where is the hatred between us?\u201d Fen Tian gave out a loud laugh, then staring at Jade Maiden with domineering eyes, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ask about this matter to your Earth system leader of Magic Domain\u2014\u2013Ling Yanqi.\u201d Looking at perspiring profusely Ling Yanqi, Jade Maiden indifferently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Fen Tian turned around his head and indifferently asked looking towards Ling Yanqi. But hearing that discontented tone, Ling Yanqi was afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cDomain Master, this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Ling Yanqi didn\u2019t know what to say, he couldn\u2019t afford to say the matter of him slaughtering her whole family to seize treasure in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, after a while, I will settle with you.\u201d Fen Tian snorted coldly, then ignoring him, he rather looked over to Jade Maiden and said, \u201cDon\u2019t know how you want to settle this enmity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery simple, we have two options.\u201d Jade Maiden showed two fingers, then looking over to Fen Tian and his group of five with a smile, she slowly bend her one finger, \u201cFirst, destroy Ling Yanqi\u2019s cultivation, and hand him over to us. Moreover apologize publicly, then this matter is settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, who do you think you are, actually wanting us Magic Domain to apologize. Do you believe I, your father will annihilate your Akatsuki or whatever organization.\u201d Hearing those arrogant words of Jade Maiden, the complexion of Fen Tian slowly sunk. But the Lightning system leader Lei Ba behind him cursed staring at Jade Maiden.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Akatsuki organization talking very big, don\u2019t know if you have strength to back your words?\u201d Wind system leader Feng Yunxiang calmly said while looking at jade Maiden with ill gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak your second option.\u201d Fen Tian didn\u2019t lose his temper, he calmly stared at Jade Maiden and said flatly. But those four leader who were familiar with him knew that he was already thoroughly angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d With calm complexion, Jade Maiden slowly bend her other finger, then looking at Fen Tian, opened her mouth, \u201cSecond, after 5 days, we Akatsuki organization will come here in your Magic Domain, and personally\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Before Jade maiden could finish speaking, huge flame surrounded her, and her figure was thoroughly consumed, and disappeared after changing into bits of lights.</p><br/><p>The complexion of Fen Tian standing in front of four leaders blackened just like bottom of a pot, and he slowly opened his right hand. After he saw the figure of Jade Maiden had disappeared, he looked towards four people and said, \u201cCome to audience hall.\u201d Finished speaking, he changed into flame and disappeared from that place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

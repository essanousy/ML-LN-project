Both of his eyes were tightly closed, and the chakra with his body was slowly absorbing endless natural energy from outside.</p><br/><p>The reason why he had selected to train in this ocean area was, because this ocean area was quiet and no one would easily disturb him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the natural energy in this endless sea was comparatively denser than in the continent, so Ren Tianyou had selected this endless ocean area as his training location.</p><br/><p>But, although Ren Tianyou already knows the training method of this Sage Mode, but it was obviously not easy to train.</p><br/><p>Right now his forehead was covered with beads of sweats, and brows were tightly creased, as if he had encountered something troublesome.</p><br/><p>In fact he had indeed encounter a trouble. While absorbing the natural energies, it was impossible to continuously maintain balance from the beginning to the end simultaneously. So Ren Tianyou also didn\u2019t dare to absorb too much natural energy, else he would be consumed by natural energy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes snapped opened. Right now, his eyes were flashing with deep helplessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, almost three weeks have passed, but I still couldn\u2019t do even the most basic absorption of natural energy and maintain the balance of Senjutsu chakra.\u201d Ren Tianyou helplessly sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to think of a way to do it, otherwise I\u2019ll be just wasting my time in vain.\u201d Ren Tianyou helplessly thought while still sitting on the boulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI alone am basically powerless to quickly accomplish the absorption of natural energy, as well as maintain the stability of Senjutsu chakra within my body, but in this world only elder sister Yue\u2019er cultivates chakra, moreover now she is not beside me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, my stupid head, truly walking into a dead end!\u201d Ren Tianyou hit his own head, and cursed.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Ren Tianyou stood up, and making a series of hand seals, \u201cWood Style\u2014-Wood Clone Jutsu! (Mokuton\u2014-Moku Bunshin no Jutsu!)\u201d Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, two identical to himself clones appeared beside him.</p><br/><p>After that, Ren Tianyou sat down cross-legged again, then began to slowly absorb natural energy, and those two wooden clone beside him simultaneously sat on either side of Ren Tianyou and placed their hands on his shoulder, then simultaneously closed their eyes.</p><br/><p>Within the body of Ren Tianyou, after a long period of continuous cultivation, large amount of chakra was circulating rapidly. And at this time, a large amount of energy entered inside his body from outside, mixing into that chakra.</p><br/><p>This large amount of energy entering into his body from outside was precisely the natural energy he had absorbed from outside, but Ren Tianyou nevertheless was powerless to clearly grasp the balance of this natural energy he had absorbed.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, two large amount of chakra entered into his body from outside once again, helping him to maintain the balance between the chakra and natural energy within his body.</p><br/><p>The method Ren Tianyou thought of was, letting his clones to temporarily help him to maintain the portion of natural energy accurately to one-third of entire Senjutsu chakra, then he himself consciously use the ability of Sharingan to accurately remember this sensation. And afterwards when he enter into Sage Mode by absorbing the natural energy, he would no longer need to rely on the help of his clones again.</p><br/><p>With the time passing minute after minute, one hour slowly passed. At that moment, Ren Tianyou who was sitting cross-legged on the boulder suddenly opened his eyes. Beside the eyelids of his eyes, two pink colored mark appeared, and simultaneously a black colored rune appeared on his forehead too, which continuously spread to his ears.</p><br/><p>After that he stood up, and those two clones beside him also disappeared slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis feeling is really different, and my sensing ability has unexpectedly become so large in an instant.\u201d After standing up, he slowly felt changes after entering Sage Mode.</p><br/><p>After entering Sage Mode, the natural energy around him completely stood in his side. Now even if he closed his eyes, the situation within the radius of 10 li completely appear within his mind.</p><br/><p>Furthermore Ren Tianyou could also borrow the power of natural energy around him, so the natural energy around him had already become his good friend for his use.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow with the aid of Sage Mode, my strength and speed received significant boost. This really is pretty good!\u201d Sensing carefully, Ren Tianyou clearly felt that his strength had really obtained great boost.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Ren Tianyou dispelled the Sage Mode state, and his body returned to normal state.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I have already memorized that state perfectly, so it\u2019s time to rest for a while, then continue to absorb the natural energy and try again!\u201d After dispelling the Sage Mode, Ren Tianyou sat on the boulder and began to slowly reflect.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>One months later, in one huge isolated island of the endless ocean, a loud shouting sound reverberated, \u201cSage Art\u2014Wood Style\u2014-Artifacts of the Buddha! (Senpo Mokuton\u2014-Chojo Kebutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>In a distant valley, there was a more than 100 meters tall giant Buddha with thousands hands, and on the top of this giant Buddha, there was a huge wooden golem with wooden dragon coiling around it, and only on the head of this wooden golem, Ren Tianyou with Uchiha Round Fan on his back was standing with both hands maintaining a hand seals.</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, this Thousand Hands Giant Buddha suddenly began to violently brandish its thousand giant hands. And continuous loud sound of explosion reverberated throughout this valley.</p><br/><p>When the loud sounds of explosion stopped, and the smoke dissipated, one could see that the surroundings of 4-5 li in radius was already razed to ground.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou who was floating in the midair faintly smiled, then looking at the state he had created, he nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>After one month of continuous training, he had already grasped Sage Mode completely. And he had also already grasped a number of Sage arts perfectly.</p><br/><p>But just at this time, Ren Tianyou suddenly noticed a powerful energy fluctuation in the distant sea surface. Carefully sensing, it seems someone was in the process fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Is there someone else in this endless sea? Let\u2019s go and see.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought in surprise. In this endless sea, there were countless terrifying ocean magical beasts, so average people would not come here. Last time when he had come here, he had taken a boat with other people. Ren Tianyou was very curious to know who had come over here. If it was not for training, then why would anyone come here to suffer a living hell?</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, along with a spiral shaped space ripple, he disappeared from that place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

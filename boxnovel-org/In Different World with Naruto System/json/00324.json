She, Ling Weiwei\u2019s nature was lively and active, and she loved to go on an adventure. Just like last time, she daringly recruit mercenaries by herself to go on an adventure to endless ocean, this kind of dangerous place. At that time, if it was not for Ren Tianyou and that secretly hiding Deity ranked magician, then Ling Weiwei and all those people of that boat would have already buried deep within the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you still haven\u2019t notice why you are always running into powerful magical beasts every time you go out to sea? This is not a coincidence, rather it\u2019s because of your physique.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of my physique? Isn\u2019t this only because I am too unlucky?\u201d Ling Weiwei excitedly held the hands of Ren Tianyou and asked agitatedly. As a matter of fact, she had already noticed this point long ago, not only in endless oceans, even if she went to magical beasts\u2019 forest, she would always suffer the pursuit of high level magical beast without any rhyme and reason. And she had always believed that this happened because her luck was too bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the possibility of having bad luck in succession so many times like this in succession?\u201d Ren Tianyou rolled his eyes and said in a bad mood, \u201cAfter examining your body just now, I notice that you were emitting a kind of special energy fluctuation from within your body which could be perceived only by magical beasts. And this energy fluctuation possess a very strong attraction towards magical beasts. One may well say that you are basically a delicious cake for magical beasts, and all of them are dying to eat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then what should I do?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ling Weiwei exclaimed aloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t to a place where magical beasts gathers, you\u2019d be fine, and you should also focus on cultivation hereafter, as your aptitude is pretty good. Furthermore, in less than a year and half, the situation of continent will change greatly, and at that time, there will be many bloodshed, so you should at least learn to defend yourself.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed. Although now he had already refined the power of Forever Green completely, the power of his wood style had already surpassed Senju Hasirama, and chakra capacity was also comparable to tailed beasts, but in this state where he still hadn\u2019t awakened Rinnegan, he still had no confidence to deal with Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I must adapt to my current strength as soon as possible, then master Edo Tensei, and then go to complete those two things as soon as possible.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly thought within his heart. And with regarding to those three thousands Universe Boundary Divine Artifact that mysterious virtual shadow had stated, he had has own plan. Perhaps he had to carry out the similar plan just like Uchiha Madara, but his plan might be confronting the entire universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d Ling Weiwei nodded her head and said in a low voice. Now that she knew that the reason for everything was her physique, she understood that she indeed shouldn\u2019t run around all over the place, otherwise her little life would really end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell. I have something to do, so I am leaving first, take care of yourself, I will come back to see you if I have time.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked all around, now that Ling Weiwei had safely arrived to the shore, it was time to leave, as he still had many things left to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to leave?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ling Weiwei a little gloomily said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNg, well, I really have something that needs to be done. You can rest assured, after I finish all those matters, I will come to look for you.\u201d Ren Tianyou said, then directly used kamui to leave this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou had left, Ling Weiwei whispered, while tears flowed out from the corner of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In one nameless mountain of Dark Empire, there was the stronghold of a bandits group. This bandit group relied on the geographical advantage of this mountain to frequently attack travelling merchants and stop at nothing in doing evil.</p><br/><p>But today, in front of the entrance of this mountain stronghold, along with the appearance of spiral shaped space ripple, a youngster with huge round fan on his back, wearing bamboo hat and black rob with red clouds imprinted on it appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Seeing the suddenly appearance of a person, the bandits in the lookout towers in front of the door of this mountain stronghold who were responsible for guarding instantly became alert and made the preparation for a battle.</p><br/><p>This person was naturally Ren Tianyou. He used a week of time to adapt to his increased power and exploding chakra after the power of Forever Green was completely refined. Then began the preparation for Edo Tensei.</p><br/><p>All those people who had watched Naruto knows that, a sacrifice of a living person was absolute necessity to use Edo Tensei, so Ren Tianyou placed his sight on this bandits group. In any case, the hands of these bandits group were stained with the blood of countless innocent person, so he would not feel unsettled and have guilty conscience if he used them as the living sacrifice for Edo Tensei.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Katon\u2014-Goryuka no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014-Dragon Flame Jutsu!)\u201d Ren Tianyou ignored these people, and quickly made a series of hand seals, then he spat out huge fire from his mouth, which changed into a fire dragon and attacked towards the gate of mountain stronghold.</p><br/><p>Along with the loud sound of explosion, the gate of mountain stronghold was directly blasted open, and simultaneously those bandits guarding the gate were also blasted asunder.</p><br/><p>Along with this loud sound, all the bandits inside this mountain stronghold immediately held their weapons and rapidly ran towards the gate.</p><br/><p>And just then, the figure of Ren Tianyou slowly walked in from the blasted open gate. And seeing those bandits rapidly coming outside from all around, Ren Tianyou laughed grimly, and quickly made a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cMokuton Hijutsu\u2014-Jukai Kotan! (Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Emergence!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with his voice, the ground around suddenly began to crack open one after another, and giant trees grew out from the ground, instantly changing the entire mountain stronghold into a woods. After that countless thick vines instantly darted towards the bandits around and tightly bound them. Then the energy within their body was instantly absorbed by these vines. Now they were hung in the midair without any ability to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaju Mokuton Bunshin no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Multi Wood Clone Jutsu!)\u201d After all the bandits were tied up, Ren Tianyou made a series of hand seals, and numerous exactly the same wooden clones appeared. These clones walked to the front of those bounded bandits, then placed their hand on their shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cKamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the clones simultaneously used right eye\u2019s kamui. Then along with the appearance of spiral shaped space ripple, all of those bandits were sucked to his kamui space.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat settles it.\u201d Seeing all the bandits were already captured alive, Ren Tianyou lightly smiled. After that he removed his wooden clones, and used large scale fire style to change the entire mountain strongholds into sea of flames before leaving.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

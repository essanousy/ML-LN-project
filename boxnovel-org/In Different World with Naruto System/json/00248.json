(Summoning Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, on the ground in front of him, with \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026three sounds, huge white colored smoke appeared, spreading in all direction. After that three powerful imposing aura spread all around, which blew off those dragons flying in the sky tumbling backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out, my tailed beast fellows, Ichibi Shukaku, Nibi Matatabi and Yonbi Son Goku.\u201d Looking at the white smoke in front of him, Ren Tianyou stood up, then looking towards Dragon Emperor and others whose complexion had a greatly changed, he slowly said with a grinned.</p><br/><p>After three cloud of white smokes disappeared, three huge strange magical beasts who were several tens of meters in height appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Among them, one was raccoon dog whose body was covered with earth yellow sand. There was huge tail unceasingly swaying behind it. It was Ichibi Shukaku.</p><br/><p>Another one was demon cat whose entire body was covered with blue colored flame vigilantly looking all around it. There was two tails which was also covered with blue flame unceasingly swaying behind it. It was Nibi Matatabi.</p><br/><p>And final one was a gorilla with two huge horns in its head whose body was covered with fiery red as if burning flame furs. There was four tails unceasingly striking the ground behind it. It was Yonbi Son Goku.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou exchanged Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, he understood that it would take a very long time for him to be able to exchange Rinnegan, so after considering for a while, he decided to first exchange few Tailed beasts.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou spent 60,000 system points to exchange Sanbi and 120,000 system points to exchange Yonbi. As for other Tailed beasts, he didn\u2019t plan to exchange for the time being. If he exchanged too many tailed beast then he would not be able to control them perfectly, so he had only four tailed beasts for the time being. Moreover these four Tailed beasts were Ren Tianyou\u2019s gift for Dragon clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, are these herd of lizards your opponent?\u201d Looking all around, Yonbi Son Goku opened its mouth while breathing out two long flame from its nose, then asked in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Shukaku, Matatabi, Sun Goku, you three help me stall those three guys. As for Isobi, you take care of remaining one. And allow me to take care of this strongest one and those flying lizards.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said while looking all around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201d\u201d Three tailed beasts answered in unison.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, third, fourth, you three take care of those three huge fellows. Be a bit more careful, those three magical beasts are not weaker than you all. In addition don\u2019t let them destroy the island in any circumstance.\u201d Looking at those three magical beasts in front of him, Dragon Emperor also arranged his three sons to take care of them. He did so because other than him, only these four princes could match these three magical beasts. As for others dragons, they would only be food for these tailed beasts if they were sent to fight against them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar\u201d, \u201cRoar\u201d, \u201cRoar\u201d After roaring, these three princes changed into their true form. After changing to huge dragon, then rushed towards three tailed beasts. Only after turning back to their true form, they would be able to deal and contend with these tailed beasts with huge body.</p><br/><p>Seeing three huge dragon incoming, three tailed beast welcomed them respectively. After choosing their respective opponent, they immediately began fighting.</p><br/><p>Second prince Brenda against Ichibi Shukaku, third prince Brook against Nibi Matatabi, and fourth prince against Yonbi Son Goku.</p><br/><p>With their huge dragon form and powerful holy magic, they however were roughly comparable to Tailed beasts for the time being. And when Camilla and Dragon Emperor wanted to jointly attack Ren Tianyou, Isobu in that sea began to directly use large-scale water style attack towards Dragon Island, wanting to flood this entire island. So with no other choice, Camilla had to fly out of island and began to fight with Isobu. In just this fashion, all True God realm experts were dragged away, greatly reducing the pressure on Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But looking at those 100 or so dragons hovering behind Dragon Emperor, Ren Tianyou inwardly thought, \u201cI must find an opportunity to eliminate all of those annoying lizards first, otherwise with so many of them working together, they will be able to affect our fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, the Sharingan of Ren Tianyou firmly stared at Dragon Emperor in front of him. And an invisible illusion power entered the eyes of Dragon Emperor from his eyes.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Dragon Emperor sensed the surroundings around him had greatly changed. This moment, the original huge island had changed into a vast expanse of whiteness space.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d Looking at the changes in the surrounding environment, Dragon Emperor confusedly thought inside his heart.</p><br/><p>Just then, the sky above suddenly cracked open, and countless huge sharp swords suddenly appeared in the sky above him. After that under the unexpected expression of Emperor Dragon, they rained down towards him in high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion? Didn\u2019t expect you are actually able to cast illusion on me, this is something that happened for the first time in these past thousands of years, is this because of your eyes?\u201d Looking at the surroundings around him, Dragon Emperor talked to himself, as he recalled those unusual eyes of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Dragon Emperor raised his head, then issued a loud dragon roar from his mouth, and the huge sound wave of this loud dragon roar quickly spread in all direction. Suddenly the environment around quickly scattered and disappeared, including those glimmering with pallid light sharp swords.</p><br/><p>When his vision restored, the surroundings around him had already revert back to original state, and Ren Tianyou was still in front of him just like before, hadn\u2019t even budged.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect your illusion is so powerful, actually able to make me fall into it.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou in front of him, Dragon Emperor said while praising a little, despite being enemy. Now he was able to confirm Ren Tianyou\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, there are many things you don\u2019t except. Now that it\u2019s like this, we don\u2019t need to play any of these boring game, let\u2019s begin for real.\u201d Seeing his illusion losing efficacy so quickly, Ren Tianyou was very surprised, but his face nevertheless was calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, if that is your wish.\u201d Along with the voice of Dragon Emperor, suddenly powerful aura which could cover the sky and earth rose from his body, pressuring Ren Tianyou as if Emperor had descended.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ren Tianyou also released as if vast starry sky powerful aura, which welcomed the aura of Dragon Emperor. Under the confrontation of these two aura, the ground around slowly cracked open unable to endure the pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery powerful aura, didn\u2019t expect this wicked human could actually contend with our His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d Looking at those two people with evenly matched strength, the numerous dragons hovering in the sky thought in surprise.</p><br/><p>At this time, the two people who were releasing this powerful aura suddenly moved simultaneously, rushing towards each other. Suddenly a huge golden battle halberd appeared in the hand of Dragon Emperor which he stabbed towards Ren Tianyou, while on the other hand, Ren Tianyou had pulled out Uchiha Round Fan to receive it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d two people collided with each other in the sky. Uchiha Round Fan and Golden battle halberd which were holding by these two people unceasingly tried to forcedly advance towards the other party.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Dragon Emperor suddenly kicked towards Ren Tianyou with his right leg covered with majestic golden light. But Ren Tianyou who was looking at every moment of Dragon Emperor attentively had already noticed this kick the instant Dragon Emperor had initiated the kicked with his Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou immediately circulated huge amount of chakra in his right leg and kicked towards his right leg\u2019s calf. Along with a muffled sound, the ground around suddenly cracked open, creating a huge crater with them as a center.</p><br/><p>And just a that time, the right eye of Ren Tianyou spun rapidly, and a huge amount of eye power gushed out from his eyes, forming a huge spiral shaped space ripple which slowly surrounded the body of Dragon Emperor, wanting to suck him in inside his right eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Starting from illusion of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Sharingan, Dragon Emperor had always paid special attention to Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes. And when he saw the change in the space around him, he instantly had ominous foreboding, so at that instant, he released majestic golden light from his body, and forcedly struggled free of Ren Tianyou\u2019s binding and retreated back quickly.</p><br/><p>And after seeing his kamui had lost effectiveness, Ren Tianyou also retreat back without staying on that same place.</p><br/><p>And while still in the sky, Dragon Empire waved his right hand. Then the holy elements between Heaven and Earth quickly gathered, forming several tens of huge golden light arrows which shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing light arrows glimmering with pallid light incoming towards him, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted. Then began to quickly make a series of hand seals while the chakra within his body also quickly circulated, and the ninjutsu quickly took shape, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Mokujoheki! (Wood Style\u2014-Domed Wall Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front of him cracked open, and a huge wooden pillars flew out from underground, forming a huge wooden rampart in front of him, blocking his front.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng\u201d, \u201cpeng\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.. The light arrows of Dragon Emperor hit this wooden rampart. And this wooden rampart trembled endlessly due to the attack, but it strongly blocked all the attacks of Dragon Emperor.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Dragon Emperor landed on the ground with cold sweats on his forehead, while thinking, \u201cThe information about him being able to use space magic was really not mistake, he unexpectedly almost had his way just now. That really was a close call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut his that space magic of just a moment ago seemed to want to suck me in, and he had initiated that move only when my and his body was joined together. Although there is no way to guard against it, but very probably that move is effective only when the opponent is close, and from the change in his eye, this move ought to be part of his blood lineage power. What a troublesome blood lineage.\u201d Dragon Emperor who had huge amount of battle experience continuously analyzed the brief exchange of just a moment ago, \u201cSince it is like this, let\u2019s give energy attack a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this way, Dragon Emperor stared at Ren Tianyou in front of him, and began to circulate the energy within his body. And just at that time, in the mind of Ren Tianyou, the system voice however suddenly sounded\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

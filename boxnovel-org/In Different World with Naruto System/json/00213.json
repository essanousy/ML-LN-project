Then this tall platform slowly tilted, and fall towards the underneath waters, and finally the final piece of platform where Ling Yanqi was standing also collapsed with a loud crash.</p><br/><p>Along with the collapse of earth platform, immediately the balance of confrontation between Ren Tianyou and Ling Yanqi broke down. While defending, along with the collapse of earth platform, Ling Yanqi very quickly stabilized himself, and floated in the midair, ready to fly upwards.</p><br/><p>But don\u2019t forget Ren Tianyou who was basically staring continuously at Ling Yanqi. Now due to the collapse of earth platform, a small flaw had appeared, so how could Ren Tianyou let this great opportunity slip by.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou immediately controlled his huge water dragon and directly attacked towards Ling Yanqi. And just when the attack hit that earth yellow colored energy shield of Ling Yanqi, the water dragon suddenly exploded. As a matter of fact, Ren Tianyou had directly detonated water dragon. This huge explosion energy suddenly wreak havoc towards the shield of Ling Yanqi, and the huge impact directly send Ling Yanqi flying out. He was send flying towards underneath water, the shield around his body also issued a light cracking sound, and originally dazzling earth system magic element had also become incomparably dim.</p><br/><p>\u201cGroan!\u201d Down on the waters, Ren Tianyou also issued a muffled groan, and a little bit of blood slowly flow out from the corner of mouth. After forcedly detonating the water dragon, Ren Tianyou had received a slight backlash, causing him a minor internal injury.</p><br/><p>After wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Ren Tianyou quickly rushed towards the location where Ling Yanqi had fallen. While running he made a series of hand seals, and Ren Tianyou\u2019s clone was also quickly running behind him and had begun to make a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuiton\u2014-Daibakufu no Jutsu! (Water Style\u2014-Giant Vortex Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After making a series of hand seals, he spat out chilly voice, speaking the name of this ninjutsu. Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, a huge cataract suddenly appeared in the sky above the head of Ling Yanqi, then endless water of this cataract with huge impact force directly collapsed at the body of Ling Yanqi.</p><br/><p>That energy shield around the body of Ling Yanqi which had already become incomparably dim under the explosion of water dragon immediately issued a series of cracking sound, then with clear and melodious scattering sound, that shield which was already filled with large amount of cracks, directly broke before the terrified expression of Ling Yanqi. Then that huge amount of water of Daibakufu no Jutsu which carried huge impact force directly fell upon his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d After Daibakufu no Jutsu fell on his body, his face immediately become red, and he suddenly spat out large amount of blood from his mouth. Under the effect of Daibakufu no Jutsu, his body immediately received a serious injury.</p><br/><p>No kidding, magicians in themselves had a very frail body, and Daibakufu no Jutsu was a * rank ninjutsu, so how could magicians be able to resist the might of this ninjutsu?</p><br/><p>And after that, the big cataract in the sky slowly disappeared. As a matter of fact, Ren Tianyou had directly stopped this ninjutsu, as his aim was already achieved. The shield of Ling Yanqi was already broken, and he was already down, still Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t kill him, because he had promised Jade Maiden to capture this guy alive, then hand him over to her disposal.</p><br/><p>And after Ren Tianyou undid his ninjutsu, the water clone behind him immediately accelerated, passing by Ren Tianyou, he arrived at the side of Ling Yanqi, then quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cSnake-Ram-Horse-Hare-Ram-Horse-Hare, Suiton\u2014- Suiro no Jutsu! (Water Style\u2014- Water Prison Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, suddenly a huge water ball formed in the location of his right hand, directly surrounding and trapping the body of Ling Yanqi inside it, causing him powerless to move.</p><br/><p>Suiton\u2014- Suiro no Jutsu (Water Style\u2014- Water Prison Jutsu), although this ninjutsu was merely C-ranked, but the effect of this ninjutsu however was extremely powerful. After finishing making hand seals, the water around would immediately form into a water prison trapping the enemy inside it. The user merely needs to insert his one hand inside this water prison, then the enemy would remain imprisoned. And the person trapped inside this water prison couldn\u2019t breathe but was also unlikely to suffocate immediately, but the time they would not suffocate was not too long. Once the oxygen they possess runs out, they would suffocate to death.</p><br/><p>But this jutsu also had a great weakness, which was, while in the process of carrying out this jutsu, his right hand must absolutely not leave water prison, otherwise water prison would immediately break. Just like at the time when Kakashi who was trapped by Zabuza, due to his carelessness, the genin Sasuke and Naruto joined force and forced him to pull out his right hand from water prison, freeing Kakashi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026.\u201d Looking at the water ball which had surrounded his body and sensing he was powerless to move his body, the face of Ling Yanqi immediately fill with dread, then he opened his mouth, but suddenly the stream of water flowed into his mouth, immediately chocking him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if this goes on like this, I will definitely die, I must seize the moment and flee.\u201d Looking at water prison all around him, Ling Yanqi thought. Finally seeing his right hand was still holding his magic staff, his eyes displayed a cruel expression, \u201cNow I can only use this spell risking great injury to my vitality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, done!\u201d Seeing his water clone had already trapped Ling Yanqi with water prison, Ren Tianyou immediately cried out happily. Then snapped his finger, and the ocean he had created using Dai Bakusui Shoha (Super Exploding Water Shockwave) slowly reduced, and water level also slowly dropped, finally disappeared with the speed which could be seen by naked eyes.</p><br/><p>While in the sky above, seeing Ren Tianyou had already resolved his battle, Jade Maiden and others also slowly flew down, and arrived at the side of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, are you alright? Did you get hurt?\u201d After coming down, Wang Yuxin immediately rushed to the side of Ren Tianyou and sizing him up and down to see whether there was any injuries or not, she worriedly asked hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Little Yu, I\u2019m fine, him alone doesn\u2019t have any qualification to injure me. If it was not for the promise to Jade Maiden to capture him alive, he would have already died several thousand time.\u201d Ren Tianyou gently smiled seeing worried Wang Yuxin, then comforted her. These words of Ren Tianyou were not nonsense he had sprouted, no need to mention anything else, one Amatarasu, and he would be directly burned without leaving any residue, kamui of left eye and directly twist his head off, killing him easily. Moreover there was unparalleled demon god\u2014-Susanoo, directly grinding him into a dregs.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou however was not that perfect in controlling these moves, so if he use these move, then he would definitely kill Ling Yanqi. But Ren Tianyou however boasted to Jade Maiden before, to capture him alive, and hand him over to her disposal. As a result, with no other choice he was forced to spend a little bit more effort to capture Ling Yanqi alive.</p><br/><p>But from this, he also saw his own shortcoming, without using any of his doujutsu, he had spent nearly two-thirds of his chakra to sort out one Low God realm magician. \u201cIf one day I lost Sharingan, then wouldn\u2019t I just become good-for-nothing?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems, I have to reinforce flying god thunder technique and wood style very soon.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed inside his heart. This battle made Ren Tianyou deeply realize his weakness.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, thanks a lot.\u201d Seeing the tired face of Ren Tianyou, and Ling Yanqi trapped inside the water prison, gratitude appeared on the face of Jade Maiden, then gave a sincere word of thanks to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Jade Maiden, you are speaking as if I am a stranger, since we are in same organization, your matters are my matters, beside I have already promised you to help you to capture this guy.\u201d Looking at Jade Maiden, Ren Tianyou said with a giggle, and then looking at Ling Yanqi trapped inside the water prison, he said, \u201cJade Maiden, wait a bit, I will seal the strength of this guy, then hand him over to your disposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou walked over and arrived at the side of water prison. Then looking at downcast Ling Yanqi, he prepared to make a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>But just then, unusual change suddenly occurred, the eyes of Ling Yanqi who was trapped inside water prison suddenly lit up, and that earth yellow colored crystal core embedded on the magic staff in his right hand absorb the blood of Ling Yanqi, then suddenly released blood red and earth yellow colored mixed radiance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

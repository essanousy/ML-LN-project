The highest amount for that previous weapon was around 8,000 Gold coins, but she was able to draw out 13,000 Gold coins.</p><br/><p>In the private room number 03, Lan Yan and others were looking at each other in blank dismay, then inside the heart of Lan Yan and Lan Yin, they simultaneously thought, \u201cIs this really our sister which we\u2019ve known all along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, elder sister Xinmeng is so cool ah.\u201d Looking at Lan Xinmeng who was on the stage, suddenly a stars of worship appeared on the eyes of Long Luoluo, this little beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Luoluo, you absolutely must not learn anything from this appearance of Xinmeng.\u201d Looking at his younger sister, suddenly cold sweat started to flow from the forehead of Long You.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Long Luoluo curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this behavior of Xinmeng is wrong.

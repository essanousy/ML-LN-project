Although while walking upstairs, other female students were looking at him with the expression as if they were guarding against some wolf. But this time they didn\u2019t block his way.</p><br/><p>Going against innumerable peculiar gaze of female students, Ren Tianyou ran inside his room and closed the door. Then he took off his shoes and lied on the bed. Then he picked up the \u2018chronological history of continent\u2019 book and started to read seriously.</p><br/><p>As he was reading, 4 \u20135 hours had passed unknowingly. When he lifted up his head and looked outside, the sky was already pitch-black. From this \u2018chronological history of continent\u2019 book, although not finished reading it, nevertheless he understand a great deal regarding this Divine wind continent.</p><br/><p>At this Divine wind continent, altogether there were 5 heavenly empire, hundreds and thousands of king countries and countless general countries. The 5 heavenly empire are Aileke Empire, Supreme feilu Empire, Light Empire, Dark Empire and finally Divine yu Empire. The King countries and general countries couldn\u2019t resist the strength of these 5 heavenly empire. Once a ruler of a king country had offended the emperor of heavenly empire, merely within 5 days, this ruler of king country was captured. This shows the strength of these 5 heavenly empire. They not only have strongest army and war weapons, in addition they had a large amount of experts to take part in the battle. Although the experts at Saint Class and above were not permitted to join the war of secular world, nevertheless they still had countless experts beneath that level.</p><br/><p>And at Divine wind continent, other than 5 heavenly countries, there were still several super power. Namely mercenary union, Light palace, Dark imperial court, Illusory shrine, Flame phoenix villa and Magic domain.</p><br/><p>Mercenary union is the birthplace of all the mercenaries of Divine wind continent. And its main headquarter is at mercenary city which is at the border of both Divine yu empire and Dark empire. And in every large city or town of Divine wind continent, all have branch of mercenary union, making it easier for mercenaries to receive the tasks.</p><br/><p>All the mercenaries associated with this mercenary union are classified in accordance with SS, S, A, B, C and D, these 6 ranks. SS rank mercenary is known as mercenary kings. The mercenary union specially grants an exclusive title for each Mercenary kings, furthermore the birth of mercenary king is announced to the whole continent, just like Ice cold heaven sword\u2014\u2014Han Tiandu. Apart from Han Tiandu, there were still 2 other mercenary king. SS ranked mercenary party is known as God of mercenary party, and currently there are 4 god of mercenary parties. And among them, 2 god of mercenary party already announced that they had joined mercenary union. From this, the strength of mercenary union could be seen.</p><br/><p>Light palace is the holy land for all the light system cultivator of the continent. And this place is the gathering place of a large number of light system warriors and magicians. They believe in only one word, Light! They believe that light gave life to all the living things of the continent.</p><br/><p>The ruler of the Light palace is referred as brilliant light. This Light palace have 7 big palace, and 32 hall master. Each of this big palace has a single holy son and a single daughter. And brilliant light is chosen from these holy sons and daughters. The strongest among them becomes brilliant light. The main headquarter of Light palace is at the imperial capital of Light empire.</p><br/><p>Dark imperial court is exactly opposite to Light palace. They believe in darkness. There are a large amount of dark system cultivators in this place.</p><br/><p>Illusory shrine was the holy land for all the illusionist cultivators. Every illusionist dreams to join this place, because there are tens upon tens of thousands of cultivation manuals of illusion.</p><br/><p>Flame phoenix villa, they are Huofeng clan who inherits the divine phoenix blood lineage. This is a high-saint class blood lineage. They can use the flame of divine phoenix, as well as if their bold lineage reached the highest degree, then they can bath in rebirth fire while battling just like Phoenix and can revive from the ashes. Only the female member of Flame phoenix villa can inherit this divine phoenix blood linage, but the strength of this place should not be underestimate.</p><br/><p>Magic domain is a mysterious country. Outsiders didn\u2019t know anything about this place, even the ruler of this land is unknown. Many thinks this place is the paradise for magicians. Magic domain have the strongest magician army of Divine wind continent. Once the ruler of King country offended Magic domain, its outcome was that a God class magician of Magic domain casted a strongest forbidden magic\u2014\u2014\u2013groups of meteorites fall. This completely flattened that king country\u2019s imperial capital. Till this date there is only pile of debris in that place.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou carefully read this book and learnt those things. The more he read, the more shocked he became. He had never known that, Divine wind continent had these 6 major super power. And there may be many other super power which was not recorded in this book. But even these 6 major super power that was recorded in this book were not to be trifled with. Mercenary union, indeed worthy of the title super power, not afraid to have a group or individual battle.</p><br/><p>Light palace and Dark imperial court focuses on light system and dark system cultivators respectively. Their strength shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Illusory shrine also possessed all the elite illusionist cultivators available in the continent.</p><br/><p>Flame phoenix villa can be called abnormal. They have high-saint class blood lineage called divine phoenix blood lineage. And the people possessing this blood lineages are definitely not weak. And according to the records, they can even bath in ribirth fire while fighting. Isn\u2019t this too abnormal? And this place only have females. As the proverbs says \u2018only a villain makes it difficult for females\u2019. This sentence is even more correct towards these females who excels in strength.</p><br/><p>Magic domain is a mysterious place. It is already recorded that a God class magician from Magic domain had used forbidden magic to destroy the whole town and shocked the whole continent. Because to destroy the town along with its ruler, the range of the magic should be ultra large ranged as well as it also needs to have equally strong attack power. Because if the attack power is not strong enough then it won\u2019t be able to break through the defense barrier of that town. And Ren Tianyou remember that there were several ninjutsu that could bring out the same effects such as Raiton\u2014Raimu Raito (Limelight Jutsu), Raiton\u2014Kirin and in addition to this there was also Mokuton\u2014Kajukai K\u014drin (Wood Style\u2014Deep Forest Bloom) and other similar level ninjutsu. And other ninjutsu having large range but not enough attack power or the ninjutsu having enough power but not large range cannot destroy the whole town. For example, Naruto\u2019s Rasensuriken have enough attack power, but its attack range is limited. Also Garra\u2019s sand styles attacks have large range but not enough attack power. But we don\u2019t need to talk about Shinra Tensei (Almighty Push) and Chibaku Tensei (Catastrophic Planetary Devastation) of Rinnegan as well as Tengai Shinsei (Shattered Heaven) which was used by Madara. These are abnormal doujutsu, only few can use.</p><br/><p>But currently Ren Tianyou cannot use all these jutsu. It is possible for him to use Raiton\u2014Raimu Raito (Limelight Jutsu) and Raiton\u2014Kirin, but even though he had already learnt nature change of lightning attribute chakra, he still need to train to use these ninjutsu. And also to use Raiton\u2014Raimu Raito (Limelight Jutsu), it needs 4 elite ninja so if Ren Tianyou used shadow clone and try to use this ninjutsu then there will not be enough chakra. As for Kirin, he had practiced it several times. In fact this was his current most destructive ninjutsu, although he have the assistance of Mangekyo Sharingan, he hadn\u2019t perfectly mastered this ninjutsu so he had never used it before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even with their profound cultivation, now they couldn\u2019t stay calm and collected. Because this Divinity crystal was far too important for their Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>Ximen Shu, Ximen Xinbo, and all the younger generation, the travelling party of more than dozen or more people left their private box. Then in the midst of the envious, admiration and hate fill gaze, they walked towards the backstage. Everyone from Ximen clan were ready to take over the Divinity crystal and immediately return back to their Ximen household.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, are we going to\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Inside the 1st private room, a warrior wearing a suit of armor asked Liu Yuan while looking at the leaving members of Ximen clan. His eyes was glittering with an ominous glint, and moving closer to Liu Yuan, he made a beheading gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ximen clan is not easy to deal with, if we move without careful consideration, it is equivalent to thoroughly breaking off the relation with Ximen clan. And also Ximen clan furthermore is our old friend, so until it is absolutely necessary, we won\u2019t make any move ourselves.\u201d Without even the slightest hesitation, Liu Yuan refused the proposal of his subordinate, he clearly understood that it would be many times more difficult to rob this Divinity crystal from them compared to robbing from ordinary people.</p><br/><p>In the other private rooms, everyone were also having this thought, nevertheless after considering this for a while for a while, all of them gave up. Because they clearly understood the consequence of breaking the relation with Ximen clan. Although they were not necessarily afraid of Ximen clan, but even if they exterminate current members of Ximen clan, they absolutely would also suffer from heavy loss, and also would have their own strength reduce, this would only give other people chance to take the advantage. So if they don\u2019t have 100% certainty, they won\u2019t upset the balance between each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one, we\u2019d better get out of here without losing any time. I fear those guys will not be able to bear and will make a move.\u201d Coming out from Lan Diyin auction house, Ximen Xinbo seriously said to Ximen Shu.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, those guys are very smart, and they should clearly understand the consequence, so they are unlikely to make a move.\u201d Ximen Shu calmly said, \u201cHowever just in case we must leave this city tonight, and hurry over to clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d All of them answered.</p><br/><p>But what they didn\u2019t know was, in the darkness, a pair of eyes were already staring at them, and was following behind them all the way, to Kalisi imperial capital.</p><br/><p>After about 3 or 4 hours, inside the forest in front of Caryl plain, the group of people of Ximen clan were riding a gale horse. Under the moonlight they quickly ran down towards Caryl plains.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Suddenly, Ximen Xinbo who was in the front pulled the reins and signaled to stop everyone behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened number two, why would you suddenly stop?\u201d Ximen Shu also pulled the reins of the gale horse and arrived near Ximen Xinbo, and asked with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Show yourself.\u201d Ximen Xinbo didn\u2019t answer Ximen Shu, rather firmly stared at the tree in front, and asked in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? There is someone there. Everyone get ready to defend.\u201d Hearing Ximen Xinbo, Ximen Shu was stupefied however he immediately reacted, and told everyone behind him to prepare for defense. Then he immediately got down from the horse, waved his right hand, and with a rays of light a sword filled with rich gold colored huge dragon sword qi appeared on his right hand. He didn\u2019t doubt Ximen Xinbo, because the range of magicians\u2019 spiritual perceptive was many times larger and powerful compared to warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, didn\u2019t expect your perceptivity was this good, actually able to discover me.\u201d At this time, a hoarse voice suddenly sounded from behind the tree in front of them, followed by a mysterious masked person wearing a black windbreaker with a red cloud pattern came out from behind the tree, then walked towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Excellency, who are you? Why are you blocking our way?\u201d Looking at this mysterious person without any aura, Ximen Shu seriously stared this person and asked.</p><br/><p>This mysterious masked person was naturally Ren Tianyou. Since the people of Ximen clan had left the auction house, Ren Tianyou was following them all along the way. Ren Tianyou had decided to make his move, when they almost arrived at Caryl plains. Because if they were too close to Kalisi Imperial capital, then the repercussion of battle would be perceived by those experts in the city, and that could be troublesome. But Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t expect that when he had just stopped, he was immediately discovered, so he couldn\u2019t help but was forced to move now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the leader of Akatsuki organization\u2014\u2014\u2013Pein, as for my purpose\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ren Tianyou touched his chin, and stared at the members of Ximen clan in front of him and said, \u201cI want something from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing? Do Your Excellency plan to fight us for Divinity crystal?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo both quickly thought, but they had never heard the organization having this name, and instantly they understand that it was a lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Sooner or later Divinity crystal is mine, I came here for another thing.\u201d Ren Tianyou extend the index finger of his right hand and waved, \u201cAnd that thing is your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Your Excellency is cracking jokes.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo simultaneously laughed, but all of them unconsciously had already loosen the grip on their weapons. Since the other party had dared to come alone, then they had nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, is it?\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t contradict, just stared at the peoples of Ximen clan. But under the mask he had a cruel smile, then he suddenly parted his legs and started to quickly make a series of hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, prepare to fight.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had started to move, Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu immediately roared towards the peoples behind them. And shortly afterwards a dragon shaped magic wand appeared on the hand of Ximen Xinbo, and he started to chant an incantation in a very high speed. On the other hand, the body of Ximen Shu flashed with golden colored battle qi, then along with the dragon roar, he directly rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cNimpo\u2014\u2014Ryusa Bakuryu!\u201d (Ninja art\u2014\u2014-Sand Tsunami!) Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, suddenly several mouth of spring appeared in the ground in front of him, but it was not water that flowed out from it, rather it was sands. After that immediately a towering sand waves appeared in front of him and advanced towards peoples of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Seeing this towering sand waves, the eyes of Ximen Shu flashed with surprise, then his body immediately changed into gold colored light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater magic arts\u2014\u2014-Magnificent Heaven Water screen!\u201d At this time, Ximen Xinbo complete the incantation of his magic, then a huge water colored magical power water ball suddenly appeared above the people of Ximen clan. After that under the control of Ximen Xinbo, that huge water ball changed into huge water screen around them to protect all of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong long long!\u201d A loud sound rang out, this towering sand waves covered all the peoples of Ximen clan with an irresistible force. Then gradually flowed all around the surroundings like a river, numerous trees in the surroundings were already collapsed, and the surrounding terrain also had thoroughly changed into a desert.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

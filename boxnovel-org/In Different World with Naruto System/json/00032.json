Just now Ren Tian You had suddenly felt a formidable energy quickly approaching towards his location. Also compared to the energy of the mysterious girl whom he had encountered last time, this energy was stronger, so it meant that the approaching person was at least Siant class. Although Ren Tian You was not afraid to confront this person, still if he fought inside this imperial capital, which was also the stronghold of other person, he would be the one to suffer most. As a result he had quickly left that place. From start to finish he had never cared about that kid from Zhao clan, as for Ximen Zi Yue, she will return and report about this matter to Ximen clan. Ren Tian You didn\u2019t think about this matter anymore, after all if his strength is strong enough, then he didn\u2019t need to fear about any things or anyone. Just like Madara who alone confronted the whole ninja world and the past Kages who were completely fearless. They can do so because they had strength!</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You before long reached the entrance of Supreme light academy, there he suddenly discovered several human vague figure. After carefully looking, he found out that they were Lan Yan and others. Ren Tian You quickly walked towards them and said, \u201cHello, uncle, why are you standing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, didn\u2019t I say not to call me uncle, but you are still calling! Do you need a beating?\u201d Hearing the word uncle, Luo Tian Xing violently rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, then lets go to training ground ah, by coincidence, my hand is itching a bit.\u201d Ren Tian You spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026..today I am feeling unwell, some another day I will hit you.\u201d Luo Tian Xing knew that if he accept the proposal of Ren Tian You, then he would be in great tragedy under the fists of Ren Tian You. So he quickly refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d After listening to the words of Luo Tian Xing, Lan Yan and others suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were not waiting for you without reason, it\u2019s just we wanted to hear about your enrollment test, but you were not inside the academy. So with no other choice we had to wait for you here.\u201d Lan Yan slowly talked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so it was like that! I had just went to buy something, nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, why are we still standing here, let\u2019s go inside the academy.\u201d Ren Tian You and others walked inside the academy. Just when Ren Tian You was about to speak, suddenly a loud sound rang from the nearby training area.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Hearing the sound of explosion, Ran Tian You and others stopped their steps and looked at the door of training area.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Long You asked with uncertainty. Just at that time the door opened, and a person suddenly came out from there. Seeing this person, suddenly the eyes of Ren Tian You and others shrunk, as all the hair of this person was standing erect.</p><br/><p>This young man was wearing a gray colored clothes, had an elegant face, and if you look at him calmly, then you could immediately tell that he was from a large clan just like Lan Yan and others. He had white colored hair all over his head, as well as his skin was also so white in color, that it was almost scary, as it felt like he was issuing a pale death aura from all over the body.</p><br/><p>That fellow glanced at Ren Tian You and others, and then as if he didn\u2019t see anyone he walked inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGudong\u2026\u2026who is this person, and why the aura of his is body like that, it remind me of dead person.\u201d Li Feng swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and asked stammeringly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know. He came out from inside that door, should be a new student like Tian You.\u201d After thinking deeply, Lan Yan said slowly.</p><br/><p>Just then, that door again opened, the same guard that Ren Tian You had met came out while carrying unconscious Yi Yun. Lan Yan and others looked at each other and went towards that guard, \u201cHello, what is going on inside the room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the test teacher is knocked out again by the challenger, just like your friend over there did in his test. Damn it, what is happening today? Only abnormal people are coming to take the test.\u201d After giving a reply and muttering something to himself, he quickly rushed towards the treatment room.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Tian You, so you knocked out the test teacher?\u201d Luo Tian Xing was covered with cold sweat and asked Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ha ha, I just come across a tough tortoise shell, as a result I use a bit more force.\u201d Ren Tian You replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Li Feng and others all gave thumbs-up to Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa, still big brother Tian You is awesome!\u201d With the stars forming inside her eyes, Long Luo Luo spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, he he, he he\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Ren Tian You embarrassedly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, I still don\u2019t know the location of dormitory where I will be staying. So you should take me there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere was you assigned?\u201d Li Feng asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoys dormitory, 3rd area, 2nd floor, room number 202.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, 3rd area, what? You were assigned at 3rd sector!\u201d Li Feng roared in surprise, and Luo Meng Wu and all others also had a look of surprise in their face.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, why on earth are you all surprised? I don\u2019t think I said anything that shocking!\u201d Ren Tian You said gloomily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, although 3rd district used to be boys dormitory but now it is already decided, to change this area into the girls dormitory area. Thanks to this no male lives in this dormitory. Although currently there are not many students living in this dormitory, but all the resident of this dormitory are females. Meng Wu also resides there.\u201d Li Feng explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Ren Tian You was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout doubt it\u2019s real. In this dormitory you get a single room per person, and the living conditions is much better that other ordinary dormitory!\u201d Luo Tian Xing said in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Wu, what is your room number, if I cannot fall asleep at night, I can come to your room for a heart to heart talk with you ah.\u201d Ren Tian You suddenly said to Luo Meng Wu with a vulgar appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie already!\u201d Hearing to Ren Tian You, Luo Meng Wu\u2019s beautiful face became deathly pale and in a bad mood she kicked Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tian You, I am quite worried that you and my sister will be living under the same roof, so let\u2019s exchange our room!\u201d Luo Tian Xing suddenly whispered in the ear of Ren Tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your dream!\u201d Ren Tian You directly refused, and inside his hear he thought \u2018on the Earth, I had never got the chance to enter girl\u2019s dormitory, but here at different world I got this opportunity and what\u2019s more I can live with them under the same roof.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You followed Lan Yan and others, and walked all the way to the northern part of the academy. After about 10 minutes, crossing the bamboo forest, they arrived in front of 5 storied building. At this moment, Luo Meng Wu said, \u201cThis is our dormitory, let go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, Tian You, go to your room and you can wait me there.\u201d Luo Meng Wu said that and entered her room in first floor. Ren Tian You and others went straight to 2nd floor to room number 202. After that Ren Tian You took out his room card, and inserted in the groove at the front of door. A surge of magic flashed and the door automatically opened. Then Ren Tian You took back his room card and all of them enter inside his room.</p><br/><p>This was 2LDK room. This room was comparable to the room of residential buildings on the earth without any electric appliances.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I am more and more envious, Tian You, you really don\u2019t want to exchange our rooms?\u201d Luo Tian Xing again asked this question.</p><br/><p>Seeing the facial expression of Luo Tian Xing, Ren Tian You suddenly shuddered. And coldly said, \u201cYour sister, don\u2019t disgust me!\u201d And after this he kicked Luo Tian Xing and because of the impact of kick Luo Tian Xing fell towards the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, with only this much do you think this will hurt me, do not underestimate copper skin ability of 7 broken bone, blood lineage of our clan\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Luo Tian Xing spoke while patting his body. But just as he finished speaking, \u201cBang!\u201d the door heavily hit his head, this caused Luo Tian Xing to roll on the ground while holding his head. Luo Meng Wu came inside from the door and seeing her fallen brother, she was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, copper skin\u2026\u2026 Hey, Lan Yan, do you think the hit from this door can improve his brain?\u201d Looking at the fallen Luo Tian Xing, Ren Tian You asked Lan Yan!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, laughter is killing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Lan Yan and others laughed while holding their belly. Especially Long Luo Luo, she was already tearing up while laughing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

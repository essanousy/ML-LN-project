Due to this muffled sound, the blood of his body were rolling over and over. Then the magic wand in his right hand started to flash with flame radiances, and surrounded Wang Yanli. Then he changed into a long flame light beam and moved downwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame spirit shift!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a \u201cswish\u201d sound, Wang Yanli who was completely surrounded by burning hot flame magical power appeared on the arena, and had barely dodged the undead waltz attack of Yan Xinluo. Just when Wang Yanli had landed on the ground, Yan Xinluo also started to fall on the ground from the air, and directly landed on 20 meter away opposite from Wang Yanli.</p><br/><p>Looking at Yan Xinluo who was at the opposite side of him, Wang Yanli displayed a bitter smile. Wang Yanli had overestimated the strength of Yan Xinluo as much as possible, but that was useless as his flame dragon break was destroyed too easily, and still had enough energy to force him to use flame spirit shift to dodge that attack. In this case\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>A fiery colored light flashed in the eyes of Wang Yanli, the flame magical power around his body gradually changed into boiling hot lava, and was released all around him in a very high speed. Gradually the whole arena changed into a boiling hot lava zone. \u201cLava Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Wang Yanli waved his magic wand, while quickly mumbling something, then a lava wave which could bolt out the sky and cover up the earth threw itself towards Yan Xinluo. \u201cLava Tide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the advancing lava waves, a pallid light flashed in the eyes of Yan Xinluo, then the karma transmigration on his hand automatically flew in front of him. Shortly afterwards, Yan Xinluo also took a large stride with his right leg, and the grey colored radiances on his body was poured into karma transmigration. Then suddenly a huge grey colored sword slash which looked like it could split heaven and earth apart advance towards the lava wave.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst dance of death\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014undead slash open the heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHong long long\u201d a loud sound of explosion rang out, just like a hot knife cutting through a butter, the \u2018undead slash open the heaven\u2019 of Yan Xinluo completely cut through the waves of lava, and still continued to advance towards the direction of Wang Yanli.</p><br/><p>When they saw that the Lava Tide was so easily cut through, they discovered that they couldn\u2019t find even the shadow of Wang Yanli, he had already disappeared without a trace. Only heard a \u2018hong\u2019 sound. And \u2018undead slash open the heaven\u2019 had left behind a deep ditch. Yan Xinluo was still standing at the same place, and the karma transmigration circled around in the sky and flew back in the right hand of Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>When Yan Xinluo was searching for Wang Yanli, suddenly, in the sky above his head, he sensed a huge fire system magic power. Yan Xinluo couldn\u2019t help but immediately lift up his head, only to see Wang Yanli who had spread open his wings of heavens and was floating in the air right above his head. His mouth was noiselessly muttering, and a huge magical power sprang out from his body. Then in the air above the arena, innumerable huge lava ball appeared, it was densely packed, and gave the people a kind of strong visual sense of shock feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice trick, but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Looking at those densely packed lava balls in the sky above his head, a cold light flashed in the eyes of Yan Xinluo, but there was not even the slightest amount of fear in his eyes. Shortly afterwards just like before his karma transmigration automatically flew before him along with grey colored light, and started to revolve around the body of Yan Xinluo in a high speed.</p><br/><p>He quickly clasped both of his hand together, then a rich undead battle qi poured out, and flowed into the blade of karma transmigration. \u201cVoid undead, karma change to nil. 6 transmigration change, undead 6 shield. Open!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Yan Xinluo, with a \u2018swish\u2019 sound, karma transmigration suddenly divided into 6 and dropped on the arena from the air. Shortly afterwards, Yan Xinluo opened both of his hands towards the sky, then from both of his hand a strong undead battle qi came out, then it changed into 6 path of radiance and poured into karma transmigration. Immediately 6 cold ashes colored radiance protective screen was raised from the blade of karma transmigration, and surrounded the body of Yan Xinluo. Even at above the head and beneath the toe, similar protective screen appeared. On the top of this protective screen, a mysterious grey colored rune appeared which exude a mysterious aura.</p><br/><p>Just then, the magic of Wang Yanli who was floating on the air was also completed. Looking below at Yan Xinluo who had already prepared for the defense, his eyes burned with flame, then he said, \u201cMeteors fall. Give me a destruction!\u201d Along with the voice of Wang Yanli, suddenly innumerable lava balls that were floating in the air, just like a meteors shower, they started to directly rain down towards the arena. Although this magic looked extremely magnificent, but its destructive power actually was\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHong longlong\u201d, \u201chong longlong\u201d, \u201chong longlong\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Along with the fall of these lava balls on the arena, a series of loud explosion sound rang out, causing the whole arena to fill with dusts, and these dusts blocked the vision of everyone from seeing what was going in the arena. After the lava balls in the sky fell, again another batch of lava balls appeared in the sky and started to fall towards the arena.</p><br/><p>This magic continued to fall for whole 1 minute. Although 1 minute seems extremely short duration of time, but for the peoples of the audiences who are watching the battle, they actually felt that 1 minute a very long period of time. Everyone in the audience, including Ren Tianyou were looking at the arena without blinking their eyes, all of them wanted to see the circumstance of Yan Xinluo. But this boundless dusts were blocking their line of vision, even the Mangekyo Sharingan of Ren Tianyou was useless in this condition, and after all it didn\u2019t possessed the see through function like Byakugan. [T.L: finally author mentioned Byakugan. Hope he can exchange Byakugan too.]</p><br/><p>Just when everyone were holding their breath, a grey colored \u2018+\u2019 shaped battle qi radiance slash advanced towards Wang Yanli who was floating the sky. Shortly afterwards a person silhouette broke out from the dusts of the arena, if this person was not Yan Xinluo who was holding karma transmigration then who else could it be.</p><br/><p>Wang Yanli who had not prepared for the defense was hit by this slash attack, but that flame god shield which he had released at the beginning blocked this attack.</p><br/><p>Yan Xinluo held the karma transmigration, and he was also floating in the sky, his strong grandeur which was accompanied by rich undead battle qi were spreading all around him.</p><br/><p>Sensing the aura which belong to saint class expert, and seeing the ability which solely belong to saint class and higher level expert to fly without any skill from Yan Xinluo, Wang Yanli showed a bitter smile, and said, \u201cI had never expected that you were powerful to this extent. Although now I know that it is impossible for me to win this match, nevertheless I will not admit defeat. I want to use my strongest final move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is much better, if you had really admitted a defeat, then I would have look down upon you. If you have any move left to use then use it. I want to see the strongest attack of the member of Magic domain.\u201d Hearing Wang Yanli, the eyes of Yan Xinluo flashed with the strong fighting spirit, and the aura of his body became even stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Saying that, Wang Yanli held his magic wand, and quickly poured the magic power from all over his body towards his magic wand, and with a strong aura of peak-Great magic master, he started to chant the incantation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This town have extremely rich marine resources, the residents of this town depend on the neighborhood sea area to make their living.</p><br/><p>At the Mercenary guild branch of Sea heaven town, a person wearing a white haori entered. This person was naturally Ren Tianyou. After he was fed up with the clothing of Sasuke, Ren Tianyou decided to exchange the haori of 4th Hokage. After he wore this haori, it seemed like Ren Tianyou gave other peoples a kind of extremely positive appearance.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had inquired about how he could reach God weeping region, and it seems he first had to arrive Sea heaven to do so. As a result Ren Tianyou had hurried to this Sea Heaven town. Then without much extra effort he found the Mercenary branch of this town and decided to accept the mission of Purple gauze sky magnificent flower from this branch.</p><br/><p>Arriving at this Sea heaven town, Ren Tianyou saw a huge building at the center of this town, and the sigh above it reads\u2014\u2014\u2014-Mercenary Guild. Many peoples were entering and exiting from the main entrance of this Mercenary guild branch, and overwhelmingly majority of them were mercenaries. These mercenaries all depends on the missions of Mercenary guild to support their family and themselves. And some portion of those peoples had come to issue the missions.</p><br/><p>Entering the Mercenary guild, Ren Tianyou instantly felt that the world outside and inside the mercenary guild was different. The bustling noises just like a swarm of flies buzzing in ears, constantly buzzed in his ears. First time entering the mercenary guild and Ren Tianyou instantly felt that his mind was spinning, and he started to get agitated. Now Ren Tianyou finally clearly understood, why Sun Wukong couldn\u2019t bear Tangseng. This noise really is f**king irritating, don\u2019t you think so?</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou raised his head, and looked inside the mercenary guild. Then he instantly discovered the mission taking window. After that he directly walked towards that window. The crowd of peoples in the mercenary guild couldn\u2019t obstruct the steps of Ren Tianyou, and it seemed like Ren Tainyou was walking in an empty street. He directly walked pass the crowd of mercenaries in front of him, but it seems all those mercenaries didn\u2019t find anything strange about this.</p><br/><p>Walking all the way without stopping, Ren Tianyou arrived near the mission taking window, and lined up. Waiting for a long time, finally the turn of Ren Tianyou came. Ren Tainyou walked forward, and he said smilingly to the girl whose brows were beaded with sweat, \u201cHello, I\u2019m here to accept a mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you please show me your proof of mercenary?\u201d That female replied back after hearing Ren Tainyou.</p><br/><p>Hearing this female, Ren Tianyou was clearly stunned. He had not thought that he needs the proof of mercenary to accept the mission. \u201cEh, I don\u2019t have any proof of mercenary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do not have the proof of mercenary, then you are unable to take missions. First you need to get the identity of mercenary to take any mission issued by mercenary guild.\u201d Hearing that Ren Tianyou was just a green horn, this girl didn\u2019t mock him, but explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do to get this identity of mercenary?\u201d hearing this girl, Ren Tianyou directly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor identity of mercenary, you need to pay the handling fee of 10 gold coins. No need to do anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, please get me an identity of mercenary. After that help me register 10 member mercenary group.\u201d After hearing this female reply, Ren Tianyou thought for a bit, then decided to establish the prototype Akatsuki group in this different world. And when he found a suitable person, he would invite them to join this group one by one.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tainyou handed the gold coins, this girl adeptly helped Ren Tainyou to register as a mercenary and also registered his mercenary group. After about 5 minutes, this female took out a copper colored card and handed it to Ren Tianyou, \u201cThis is your mercenary identity card. Right now you are D-ranked mercenary. From now on if you want to take or issue a mission, you have to use this card. If you lost this card, please visit any mercenary guild to re-issue it. Currently you are only D-ranked mercenary, so you can only take those C-ranked or lower ranked missions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the insignia of your mercenary group. The insignia for all B-ranked or lower mercenary group is same. Only A-ranked or above A-ranked mercenary group are qualified to create their own exclusive insignia on our mercenary guild. SS-ranked mercenary group will be crowned with a title of \u2018God of mercenary group\u2019. Now please tell me your mercenary group name.\u201d That female handed over 10 insignia to Ren Tianyou while explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cAkatsuki mercenary group!\u201d Without a slightest hesitation, Ren Tianyou replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Akatsuki mercenary group has now been formally established, and the information about your mercenary group is already spread to all other mercenary guilds too. Now please tell me the mission you wanted to take.\u201d That female inputted the information of Ren Tianyou\u2019s mercenary group on the magic screen, then asked Ren Tainyou about the mission he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want S-ranked mission\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-mission of Purple gauze sky magnificent flower.\u201d Ren Tainyou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, S-ranked mission? What, you want that mission of Purple gauze sky magnificent flower!\u201d Hearing that Ren Tianyou wanted an S-ranked mission, that girl didn\u2019t have any big reaction, but when she heard what S-ranked mission it was, she was dull for a moment and exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>When other mercenaries inside the hall heard the surprise shriek of that girl, all of them looked towards their direction. And when they saw that the person accepting the mission which was known as death mission was a young person who looked only 17 or 18 years in age, and possessed only intermediate warrior ranked strength, each and every one of them sneered at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoungster now a days are really confident, only an intermediate-ranked warrior, but daring to take this S-ranked mission, I don\u2019t know from where his confident is coming.\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou was the only intermediate-ranked warrior, a middle aged mercenary couldn\u2019t help but became dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening these days, even an intermediate-ranked youngster dare to take that S-ranked mission. I, your father is already Great Swordsman, even so I don\u2019t dare to even look at this mission, although the rewards are extremely attractive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he is clearly courting death. I estimate that he would be swallowed by the magical beasts of boundless sea before he could even enter the God weeping region.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tainyou didn\u2019t cared about the voices of others, but just directly replied to that girl, \u201cYes, I want to take that mission. Is something wrong, or that I can\u2019t take this mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! No, no! There is not any restriction for this mission, anyone can take this mission. But noble son, do you really want to take this mission?\u201d Hearing Ren Tainyou, that female quickly waved his hand and denied. Then asked Ren Tainyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I will complete the procedure.\u201d Hearing the determined voice of Ren Tianyou, that female was helpless, and was forced to complete the procedure to assign this mission to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your mission identity plate. When you complete this mission, identity plate, mercenary card and in addition the mission item, all of them is needed. If the mission fails\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d That female quickly registered the mission, then hand over a purple colored identity plate to Ren Tainyou. And started to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not fail.\u201d Ren Tianyou directly interrupted the explanation of this female. Then taking that identity plate, he directly left the mercenary guild without looking back.</p><br/><p>Looking at the departing back of Ren Tainyou, that female seems to have an illusion that maybe this youth would really complete this task. But when she thought this, she made a self-ridiculing smile. Countless mercenary had failed this mission, so how could a mere intermediate warrior who is just a D-ranked mercenary complete this task.</p><br/><p>After leaving the mercenary guild, Ren Tianyou looked at the mercenary identity card, and had a smile on his face, \u201cSince Akatsuki is already established, it\u2019s time to find the member, and let everyone know this mighty name as in Naruto world.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tainyou stored his identity card inside his space ring. Then he took out a ring which was engrave with one strange word on its top from his space ring. If the people who had seen Naruto series sees this ring, they would obliviously recognize this ring, this was the ring worn by Pein, the leader of Akatsuki organization, codename zero. [T.L: most of you may know but still\u2026.the word engraved on the ring of Pein is Zero.]</p><br/><p>In just this fashion, the Akatsuki group of another world was successfully established on this remote seashore small town. Who would have thought that the organization which would shook the whole universe of this world was created this hastily.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou walked towards the north direction of the town, and was prepared to take the ship to go to the God Weeping region. Although Ren Tainyou could use kamui and directly go to God Weeping region, but Ren Tianyou had never rode a ship before and also wanted to learn the sea navigation system of this world. Anyway the time limit for this mission was 3 months, this was plenty of time, so he didn\u2019t need to urgently rush towards God weeping region.</p><br/><p>But when Ren Tainyou had just left the center of the town, he suddenly saw the long queue of many peoples on the street, and each and every one of them were extremely excited. Instantly Ren Tianyou was very curious, so he couldn\u2019t help but walk over there. Generally Chinese peoples were full of curiosity, and even after arriving at this different world, Ren Tainyou was unable to change this trait.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou walked over to that queue of peoples, he looked at the front of the line. There he saw a delicate beauty who was wearing a purple colored clothing with skirt. Her figure was charming, and had a pitch-black pretty long hair. And she was sitting on the table. At her side, several middle aged huge peoples who were releasing powerful aura were standing as if they were her bodyguards. And at the side of the table there was a sign that reads, \u201cSS-ranked mercenary group \u2018Jealous Heaven\u2019 mercenary group is recruiting mercenary who have at least Sword master-ranked strength to go to God weeping region. Help \u2018Jealous Heaven\u2019 mercenary group to accomplish their mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, now I no longer need to look for a ship.\u201d After seeing the content of the sign, Ren Tianyou instantly became happy. After that he also directly joined the line.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

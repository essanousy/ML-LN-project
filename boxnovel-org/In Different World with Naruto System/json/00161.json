Ren Tianyou turned around his head, and calmly looked at the rapidly approaching Old Six who was holding his huge sword. After that a huge amount of eye power sprang out from both of his blood-red colored Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSUSANOO!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the emission of huge amount of eye power from the eyes of Ren Tianyou, a cold and menacing red-purple colored energy quickly spread out from the surface of Ren Tianyou\u2019s body. And under the control of two eyes of Ren Tianyou, this energy swiftly changed into incomparably huge red-purple colored skeleton. And under the support of the eye power of Ren Tianyou, this huge red-purple colored skeleton rapidly rose, changing into more than 30 meters giant demon god. The whole body of this giant demon god divulged a heart palpitation power, and its whole body was burning with red-purple colored flame, and overall it looked like a demon god capable of destroying the heaven and exterminate the earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing!\u201d Along with the sound similar to metal colliding sound, the huge sword held by Old Six which was filled with golden colored Saint Dragon Battle Qi, directly stabbed the exterior energy membrane of Susanoo. And due to the extremely powerful defense of Susanoo, even though Old Six had exerted his full strength in this attack, this huge sword was not even able to stab through a tiny bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the giant described by Yue\u2019er that was used to kill Eldest Brother and Second brother?\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of huge demon god, the eyes of Old Six widened, and he immediately recalled the Yue\u2019er\u2019s description about the condition of fight where Number One and Old Second were killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing to court the death.\u201d Seeing that elder of Ximen clan, Ren Tainyou sneered with disdain, didn\u2019t look back, just moved his right hand. Along with the movement of his hand, the Susanoo around his body, under his control also waved its right hand towards his back. As if an adult was slapping a child to death, the huge hand of Susanoo slapped towards Old Six.</p><br/><p>But was is this easy to knock down Old Six who was an intermediate god ranked expert? When Old Six sensed a huge movement, he quickly snapped out from his reminisce, then tightly clutched his huge sword, his body directly changed into eye dazzling golden colored radiance and disappeared from there. The big right hand of Susanoo slapped the empty air, and sweeping away its hand arrived at the nearby wall, directly destroying it. Vermilion Bird at the other end of the wall nearly fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all go to the roof of the backyard. Don\u2019t get caught up in the attack of my Susanoo, I will find you after settling this.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at White Tiger and other two near the walls and slowly opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Seeing the huge Susanoo around the body of Ren Tianyou, furthermore that ice-cold energy which made their heart palpitate, they hastily answered, because they also knew that, they won\u2019t be able to help Ren Tianyou in this current situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d The sixth elder holding the huge sword fell on the ground at the side of Ximen Batian and Old Five, and was gasping for breath. Just a moment ago, he luckily slip away quickly, otherwise it was very likely for him to unable to get away from the slap of that giant demon god. If he had not prepared to flee in advance, then he absolutely could not have escaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the giant demon god that Yue\u2019er was speaking about?\u201d Seeing the lofty Susanoo around the body of Ren Tianyou, Ximen Batian and others eyes flashed with deep powerlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLets try and see if we can break through his secret skill with our big moves?\u201d Old Five had a determined look on his face, seeing 4th brother and Old Seven fall before his own eyes, how could he just give up and accept the fate, no matter how much big price he had to pay, he would exhaust all of his power to kill Ren Tianyou to avenge them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ximen Batian and Old Six replied. Afterwards Ximen Batian turned around his head yelled towards Ximen Feng and others, \u201cFeng\u2019er, Yue\u2019er, you guys quickly evacuate to backyard, otherwise all of you will be swept in this battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Father.\u201d Ximen Feng hastily answered, and quickly evacuate to the backyard, at the same time other member of Ximen clan also quickly followed after him. Only the eyes of Ximen Yue\u2019er flashed, and when no one was paying attention to her, she slowly disappeared from the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Seeing the peoples of Ximen clan wanted to leave this place, White Tiger and others took out their weapons and prepared to engage in a battle, because Ren Tianyou had previously said that no one was to leave from this courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Tiger, let them go, only keeping an eye on them is enough.\u201d At that time, the voice of Ren Tianyou drifted over and interrupt their action, \u201cAfter I finish off these peoples, it will be their turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Hearing the voice of Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and other replied, then slowly put down their weapons, and also slowly retract their battle qi, allowing Ximen Feng and others to leave this place.</p><br/><p>Turning his head, Ren Tianyou fold his arms in front of his chest, and the purple colored flame on the surface of susanoo burnt even more violently. \u201cNow how do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, don\u2019t look down upon others.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s arrogant tone of speaking, Old Six who had a bad temper couldn\u2019t help but roared first. Then the golden colored Saint Dragon Battle Qi quickly flowed to his huge sword, and a formidable power condensed above his huge sword. Ximen Batian and Old Five also gathered formidable strength in their right hand and attacked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoaring dragon heaven cleaving sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201cDragon\u2019s fist!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>Ximen Batian and others loudly roared, then from the right hand of Ximen Batian and Old Five, a huge golden colored spiraling energy wave came out, which changed into huge gold colored energy ball and directly shot towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo.</p><br/><p>Dragon\u2019s fist was the unique skill that could be used only in the form of Saint dragon heavenly cross. Just like the name, this skill was able to send a fist of dragon flying towards the opponent. The power behind this fist was very formidable, it is stated that this fist could even break through the hard dragon scales of actual dragons.</p><br/><p>And the golden huge sword in the hand of Old Six directly extend rapidly, and changed into 7 or 8 meters long golden huge sword. After that with a splitting the heaven and earth apart momentum, that sword shot towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing 3 attacks filled with terrifying aura advancing towards him, Ren Tianyou just stand there folding his arms in front of his chest, while unceasingly pouring out huge amount of eye power without a slightest fluctuation in his expression.</p><br/><p>When these 3 attacks nearly landed on the Susanoo, the pattern in the eyes of Ren Tianyou suddenly rotated rapidly, suddenly the purple colored flame on the surface of Susanoo violently burnt, then the huge left arm with Yata mirror arrived in from of him, to defend against these attack. Along with \u2018honglong\u2019 sound, these 3 attacks were actually reflected and were sent flying outside the barrier which was surrounding Soaring dragon mountain villa, leaving behind only a small ripple on the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing the finishing blow of all of them were actually reflected and were sent flying, Ximen Batian and other 2 were thoroughly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the extent of your power? And here I especially used Susanoo, truly too disappointing.\u201d Still folding his arm, Ren Tianyou said with disappointed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful bastard!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s mocking tone, Ximen Batian and other 2 suddenly felt their face burning, then looked at each other, and all of them suddenly released a small gold colored energy ball, gathered them together, then under their control, these 3 energy ball flew towards the sky.</p><br/><p>After flying towards the sky, with a \u2018hong\u2019 sound, these 3 gold colored energy balls exploded. After that 3 huge black hole appeared in the sky, then Ximen Batian and others roared simultaneously, \u201c\u201c\u201cCome, my battle partner.\u201d\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>After all of 3 of them roared, under the surprise gaze of Ren Tianyou, 3 loud dragon roar rang out from inside that black hole. Afterwards along with huge 3 dragon heads, red, yellow and cyan colored huge dragons bored out from those 3 huge black holes, and landed on the side of Ximen Batian and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened here for all 3 of you to simultaneously summon us?\u201d That fiery red flame dragon asked to Old Five.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdelieya, we are in critical juncture of a fight, so we had no other choice but to seek your help.\u201d Old Five answered that flame dragon by his side. His face revealed a half-crying half-smiling expression, how could he have ever thought that this great rejoicing day for Ximen caln would unexpectedly turned into this state.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Cyan colored wind dragon also asked Old Six. After that carefully looking all around him, especially seeing the barrier, and furthermore seeing that huge Susanoo form of Ren Tianyou, this huge dragon couldn\u2019t help but quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts like this Bulaici\u2026.\u201d Old Six opened his mouth and briefly explained everything that happened here.</p><br/><p>After hearing the brief explanation of Old Six, that earth yellow colored earth dragon turned around and stared at Ren Tianyou, then opened its dragon mouth, \u201cSo this fellow is the murderer of Adelaide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Buluke!\u201d Ximen Batian walked over to the side of this earth dragon, and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, last time this fellow ran away from God weeping region, lets see where he will run away this time. You guys stall him, I will return to Dragon Island and inform His Majesty the Dragon Emperor. At most after 10 minutes, the main forces of our dragon clan will arrive here. At that time, I will torture his soul under the dragon flame.\u201d The huge dragon Buluke firmly stared at Ren Tianyou, even he himself felt an extreme danger from Susanoo around Ren Tianyou, so he decided to return to the Dragon Island to call for reinforcements.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Buluke, come back soon, we will stall this fellow.\u201d Adelieya agreed to Buluke, and Bulaici at the side also nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I will come back very soon.\u201d Finished speaking, the body of Buluke directly changed into earth yellow radiances and disappeared, returning to the Dragon Island to call in reinforcements.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the members of Dragon clan are also participating? Truly troublesome.\u201d Seeing the appearance of 3 huge dragons, in addition seeing the disappearance of one dragon, the eyes of Ren Tianyou lit up, shook his head, \u201cBut that\u2019s ok, like this the situation will be even more turmoil.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, under the curious gaze of Ximen Batian and others, the Susanoo around the body of Ren Tianyou slowly disappeared, revealing the body of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did he exhausted his energy?\u201d Seeing the disappearance of Susanoo, Ximen Batian said with a surprise, and his face revealed the excited expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts not that simple, just look at him, is that the appearance of someone who has exhausted his strength?\u201d Old Five shook his head. In a single glance at the complexion of Ren Tianyou, he knew that he was not exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like you guys like group brawl very much.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Ximen Batian and others, furthermore 2 huge dragons by their side, then pointing at them, he counted, \u201c1, 2\u2026\u2026..5, 5 god ranked experts, very good, 5 against one, that isn\u2019t fair.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou made a hand sign, \u201cKage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Shadow Clone Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with a series of \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..sounds, suddenly several white smokes appeared around Ren Tianyou, then 5 exactly same Ren Tianyou appeared around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoppelganger?\u201d Seeing 5 clones had appeared at the side of Ren Tianyou, the eye of Ximen Batian flashed with surprise, but seeing the next moves of Ren Tianyous thoroughly terrified three human and 2 dragons.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a red-purple colored energy appeared around the body of all 5 clones of Ren Tianyou, slowly condensing into Susanoo, which released a horrifying aura.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou just stood behind folding his hand in front of his chest, then said with a smile, \u201cThis is called fair.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After that looking at Camilla who was standing at the location where he was standing just a moment ago, Ren Tianyou frowned, then looked towards the location where his Amaterasu\u2019s flame had burned.</p><br/><p>In the location where his Amaterasu\u2019s flame had burned Camilla, there was basically only dragon scales nothing more. \u201cIt seems this fellow used Shadow Clone Jutsu like magic to avoid my Amaterasu, now this is troublesome. Originally I was thinking of using doujutsu to instantly finish off this most dangerous fellow, but now it seems that is not possible. Because this fellow is already wary of my doujutsu, as soon as there is slight change in my eyes, he will instantly discover it.\u201d Ren Tianyou frowned as he thought inwardly. He had never thought that this Camilla\u2019s alertness was actually so strong, even before he had used Amaterasu, he had actually already used a clone to replace himself and he himself secretly hide on one side. Just now, if it was not for his Hiraishin no Jutsu, then he would really have fallen in a bit of trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your speed very fast? You ought to be using space magic, isn\u2019t that so? Never thought after so long period of time, I am able to actually see space magic again.\u201d Looking at suddenly appeared Ren Tianyou, Camilla who was standing at a distant place slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you expect me to tell you my secrets?\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, while thinking, \u201cThis won\u2019t do, this way the situation will become more and more unfavorable for us. One True God realm expert and 5 High God realm experts, it will be very hard even for me to deal with all of them unless I summon Shukaku and Matatabi. But this time, my goal is not the life of these guys, rather the location coordinate of Dragon Island. And I also must not kill that sole remaining person of Ximen clan, because there is a use for the Hiraishin mark on his body in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, I will directly use a big move, and capture one dragon alive first.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou no longer hesitated, he quickly made a series of hand seals, and the chakra within his body quickly circulated, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Jukai Kotan! (Wood Style\u2014Deep Forest Emergence)!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the chakra within his body quickly flowed into the ground, then the ground around immediately began to violently sake, and huge cracks appeared on the ground. After that countless huge trees instantly burst out from the ground in succession. Now with Ren Tianyou as a center, huge trees suddenly appeared in the area of 500 meters which became just alike a small forest.</p><br/><p>This past three years, every day every night Ren Tianyou had continuously refined Forever Green\u2019s life-force which was inside his body. And now he had finally refined and assimilated nearly one-tenth of it. So with his current strength, he could finally use Jukai Kotan (Deep Forest Emergence) with some difficulty, but Ren Tianyou was still powerless to accomplish instantly creating continuous chain of wide forest as he please like Senju Hashirama. However this 500 meters small forest was already sufficient for current Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing the instant change of terrain with the forest growing out from the ground, Camilla, Ximen Wuwang and other four dragons were greatly shocked, while thinking, \u201cHow can this guy be so powerful in nature magic, don\u2019t tell me he has some kind of relation with Elf clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>But what they didn\u2019t know was, that beautiful face of Elf Queen hidden in the dark was now filled with extreme shock, \u201cHow is this possible? So powerful nature magic, this scale is comparable to the nature magic when I use it, just why can he be so skilled in nature magic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>But Camilla and others didn\u2019t have any time to think, countless huge trees which grew from the ground directly surrounded them inside the forest, simultaneously countless huge vines suddenly flew out from woods attacking towards them, causing them to have no other choice but to struggle to dodge.</p><br/><p>Mokuton\u2014-Jukai Kotan (Wood Style\u2014Deep Forest Emergence), this jutsu used particular chakra within body (i.e. Sage body\u2019s that huge life-force) to create plant life, and transform the surrounding terrain in large scale, changing it into a favorable environment. Everything within this tree domain were under the control of user, and the user could use everything inside this tree domain at will.</p><br/><p>And within this tree domain, those countless vines attacked Camilla and others sparing no effort under the control of Ren Tianyou. Although Camilla was extremely powerful and these vines couldn\u2019t injure him, but there was no issue in just stalling him. Moreover Camilla also didn\u2019t dare to let these vines tie him, because just a moment ago when one vine hit his back, in that split-second, he clearly notice that a little bit of his energy was absorbed by that vine. Although not much, nevertheless it caused Camilla to instantly raise his vigilance inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoid, begin your move.\u201d After having done all this, Ren Tianyou immediately roared towards Void and others who were at the distant valley.</p><br/><p>Void, White Tiger, Great Bear and all other sat surrounding a magic formation, and all other\u2019s power was being transmitted to Void with a special method. And void was silently chanting the incantation while floating cross-legged in the midair. Along with the sound of incantation, a large amount of ash colored radiances slowly rose from that magic formation in front of them.</p><br/><p>Along with the rise of ash colored radiance, an illusionary space door floated in the midair. And after hearing the roar of Ren Tianyou, everybody who were already prepared for a long time immediately opened this magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath door, open!\u201d After hearing the voice of Ren Tianyou, Void immediately opened this door. Along with the opening of door, ash colored dense fog slowly floated out from inside, slowly gathering behind Void.</p><br/><p>This ash colored dense fog slowly gathered, gradually forming a person\u2019s projection. Upon closer look, this however was a middle aged man with ash colored long hair. He was wearing ash colored suit of armor with jade tied on his waist. And he was holding a huge scythe in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ready, Zero!\u201d After everything was ready, Void yelled towards far away Zero.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I was waiting for those words.\u201d Ren Tianyou laughed, then clones slowly separated out from him, this was in fact Moku Bunshin no Jutsu (Wood Style\u2014-Wood Clone Jutsu). After two clones separated, one flew towards the location of Void, and another one walked inside the woods. But the original body of Ren Tianyou stood on the same place. Along with the change in his hand seals, those vines inside the tree domain become even more concentrated while flying around. And the situation of those people who were already struggling hard inside the woods become worse.</p><br/><p>One Moku Bunshin (Wood clone) of Ren Tianyou arrived inside the woods, and very quickly targeted one of the dragon. Seeing this dragon was already tired, Ren Tianyou laughed, and made a series of hand seals, \u201cGenjutsu\u2014- Kokuangyo no Jutsu! (Genjutsu: Infinite Darkness Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou completed making hand seals, suddenly the vision of this huge dragon directly become dark. The environment around him suddenly become pitch-black, nothing was visible. And taking advantage of this chance, the vines around firmly tied up his body in the midair. Now he couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, damn it!\u201d Feeling his body was firmly tied up although he didn\u2019t understand why his vision went dark, nevertheless he instinctively began to resist. He wanted to struggle free from these vines\u2019 binding, but it was too bad, he would never get that chance.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ren Tianyou\u2019s other Moku Bunshin (Wood clone) arrived at the location of Void, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Finished speaking, he immediately took Void and disappeared, then he appeared at the side of other Moku Bunshin (Wood clone) within the woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry Void, these vines will not be able to hold him much longer.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Void, then looking over the projection behind Void, he thought, \u201cIs this the projection of Lord God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this guy can\u2019t escape.\u201d Void slowly said, then a radiances immediately rose from his body, and he quickly made hand gestures. Along with his movement, the projection behind him also moved. That projection raised the scythe in its right hand directly pointing towards far-off huge dragon. \u201cDeath God Reap Soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Void, that illusionary scythe directly rose in the air and fell at that dragon\u2019s huge body. After that suddenly an illusionary dragon shadow flew out from the body of that dragon towards the direction of Void, this precisely was that dragon\u2019s soul.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

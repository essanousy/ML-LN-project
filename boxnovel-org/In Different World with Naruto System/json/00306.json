Ordinary people wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to see this type of treasure throughout their life, but here Ren Tianyou had encountered such treasures one after another.</p><br/><p>The power of Forever Green had bestowed him eternal life, making his body to stay young forever. Moreover combining it with his chakra, his physique transformed into a powerful sage body which was comparable or stronger than the sage body of Senju Hasirama, letting him obtain the power of Wood style.</p><br/><p>Although he had only obtained a piece of Earth Emperor Crystal, but that also gave him 7.5 million system points, with which he was able to exchange Eternal Magekyo Sharingan. Never in his wildest dream did Ren Tianyou ever thought that he would encounter similar treasure here.</p><br/><p>But this crystal known as Eternal Dark Night however was on the body of this terrifying beast in front of him. As a result obtaining it would not be any easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to take you out, I have no problem with it, and I also have a way to take you out from this seal, but I have a condition.\u201d Ren Tianyou instantly thought of a plan, while speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat condition?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast asked while staring at Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want that crystal on your forehead.\u201d Ren Tianyou pointed towards the forehead of this Thousand Eyes Evil Beast with his right hand and said loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant this crystal on my forehead\u2026\u2026?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the speaking tone of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast suddenly become incomparably unusual, then laughing loudly, powerful aura of this Thousand Eyes Evil Beast suppressed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d Hearing unconcealed mocking laugh of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, as well as sensing that oppressing aura being emitted from its body, Ren Tianyou became serious, and asked a little bit coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I laughing? I am laughing at your ignorance. Never expected that you not only not feel grateful towards me for letting you go away with your life intact, you unexpectedly even covert my Eternal Dark Night, you are truly bold sufficiently.\u201d Thousand Eyes Evil Beast stopped laughing, then looking at Ren Tianyou underneath, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast said with his tone filled with ill intention, \u201cBut your eyesight is pretty good, actually able to recognize the Eternal Dark Night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, then you can stay here forever. With no reward, do you think I will take a risk to let you out from here?\u201d Ren Tianyou sneered, then began to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say you can leave?\u201d At that moment, the voice of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast came, and Ren Tianyou instantly felt a powerful aura was locked on to his body. If he again make even a slightest amount of movement, then he would be greeted by rain shower like fierce attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ren Tianyou stopped his steps, then turning around his head, he asked Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally I planned to let you go with your life intact, but now that you don\u2019t know how to be tactful and cooperate with me, I am forced to control your consciousness to take me out, after that it will be your time of death.\u201d Thousand Eyes Evil Beast itself possessed power to absorb that evil emotions within the heart of people. And those thousand eyes on its body also possessed all thoughts of 1000 people\u2019s heart, so if it wanted to completely control one person, one might well say that it was as easy as turning one\u2019s hand over.</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast gave out a loud roar, and direct those numerous huge tentacles to attack towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, my life is not even within the grasp of myself, let alone yours.\u201d Seeing the swift and fierce attack of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, Ren Tianyou sneered, then quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Kajukai Korin! (Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Bloom!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front of him suddenly began to shake violently, and terrifying cracks appeared on the ground, flowed by countless thick vines breaking out from the ground which attacked towards the incoming attack of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.</p><br/><p>With a series of \u2018pa\u2019, \u2018pa\u2019, \u2018pa\u2019\u2026\u2026..sounds, the tentacles of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast were suddenly knocked down.</p><br/><p>The current Wood style of Ren Tianyou was already beginning to show the real power of Wood style. Although there was a large gap between the strength of Ren Tianyou and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, but Thousand Eyes Evil Beast had underestimated him, so Ren Tianyou was able to instantly block this wave of attacks.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, the flower buds on the branch of these vines slowly burst forth into a huge bewitching flower, and yellow colored pollens spread all over the place from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cBye, but rest assured, I will definitely come back.\u201d Seeing Thousand Eyes Evil Beast was surrounded by the pollen, Ren Tianyou spoke his mind, then making a hand sign, he said, \u201cHiraishin no Jutsu!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou instantly disappeared from that location. Shortly afterwards, a terrifying energy storm from within the pollen suddenly spread out directly dispersing the pollens, and also destroyed the tree domain, and was finally blocked by the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, next time I meet you, I will definitely devour you alive.\u201d Thousand Eyes Evil Beast roared loudly. Although it was sealed in this Endless Abyss, but it didn\u2019t place even Demon Emperor of Demon World in its eyes, but it had never expected that today a \u2018nobody\u2019 forced him to fall, making it very angry.</p><br/><p>But despite getting angry, it could do nothing as Ren Tianyou had already left this place. Finally after venting off its anger to the ground, it again entered into the abyss, disappearing from there.</p><br/><p>The reason why Ren Tianyou had left that place so fast was because he basically was no match for Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, so fleeing was correct choice. Although the temptation of Eternal Dark Night was very big, but big temptation also needs life to enjoy.</p><br/><p>As long as his strength rose to the level of being able to rob this Eternal Dark Night from its body, he would again come back. Moreover if he had really fought with Thousand Eyes Evil Beast at this time, then with the battle of their level, the activity would definitely be very large, and would definitely attract the attention of the experts of Demon clan. This was something Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want.</p><br/><p>Appearing beside the Hiraishin kunai inside that same cave of nameless mountain of before where he had restored his chakra, next he had nothing to do, so he just sat down to rest.</p><br/><p>After going out and bumping into Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, this terrifying magical beast, now he clearly didn\u2019t want to go out for the time being. If he again come across another such terrifying existence, then he would have physical and mental suffering, so he decided to wait here until the opening of Demon Emperor\u2019s City.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

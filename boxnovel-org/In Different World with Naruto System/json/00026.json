After we finished visiting our clan, we will look for you inside the academy.\u201d Nodding his head, Lan Yan mentioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I will first go to academy. This 4 gale horse, Long You I think you should return them to its rightful owner!\u201d Ren Tian You after finished speaking, he laugh heartily and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Tian You, you are heading towards the wrong direction. You are heading towards east, Supreme light academy is at west side!\u201d At this time LuoTianXing spoke with his loud voice. Hearing this RenTian You immediately stopped and he staggered and almost fell down on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister, don\u2019t speak so loudly ah.\u201d Ren Tian You turned his head and roared towards LuoTian Xing with grief and indignation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Suddenly Lan Yan and others burst out with laughter, after hearing RentianYou.</p><br/><p>After separating with others, RenTian You found Supreme light academy at noon. Finally seeing this academy, immediately he was shocked in his heart, F**k, is this still in the middle of city!</p><br/><p>At the entrance of this academy, there was 2 tall and upright statues. These were the creator of Supreme light academy. One of them was director named, Divine king Xing Huo and other was vice director named, Sword god Yan Li Luo!</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You arrived at the entrance of academy, but the guards suddenly stopped him and asked, \u201cHalt, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, I came to register and enter this academy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnrollment time is already over. Currently there is only one other method to enter the academy, that is to use force, however is your strength enough to force your way inside the academy\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.zeze(TL: clicking the tongue), still not leaving already!\u201d After hearing the purpose of Ren Tian You, he looked at Ren Tian You for a while and determined the strength level of RenTian You was only intermediate fighter level, clicking his tongue he spoke.</p><br/><p>Previously Lan Yan had already informed about these things to Ren Tian You, the enrollment time of the academy was already over, so if he wish to enter then the only way was to battle with someone! Correct, battle with someone from the academy, if that person gave up or he defeated that person, then he could enter Supreme Light Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I want to enroll this academy!\u201d RenTian You smiled towards that guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That guard carefully looked towards Ren tian You and measured him, \u201cFine, you come with me!\u201d After speaking, that guard started to enter the academy through the right hand side gate.</p><br/><p>Inside the gate there was a huge training area, and there was also a huge statue. At this huge training ground two middle-aged people were talking with each other. That guard advance towards them and spoke few sentences, after that the gaze of those two people suddenly concentrate on the body of Ren Tian You! After finishing listening to the guard, those two middle aged man slowly advanced towards RenTian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you want to take the exam!\u201d The robust muscle man among the two, asked Ren tian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d RenTian You firmly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, you with the insignificant strength of intermediate fighter level came here to take the exam, interesting, you should already know the rules, right.\u201d Little thin and weak looking middle aged man spoke with the smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRen Tian You!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am called Wang Li, and he is Li Yun. No need to talk any more nonsense, lets directly begin the exam.\u201d That robust man spoke and he walked towards training ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, boy, give me all you got!\u201d Seeing that Ren Tian You was standing firmly, that robust man spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it is like that, I will be impolite!\u201d RenTian You replied with a broad smile. The eyes flashed with a dim light, and then he exerted the force from his right leg and directly rushed forward. Only the afterimage was left in the place where he was standing before, and he quickly appeared at the right side of Wang Li, and kicked.</p><br/><p>Leaf Whirlwind!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng.\u201d The extremely fast kick of RenTian You didn\u2019t give Wang Li the chance to dodge. The kick caused Wang Li to lose his balance. Then Ren Tian You landed his both hands on the ground and kicked the face of Wang Li with a powerful strength.</p><br/><p>Lead Strong Whirlwind!</p><br/><p>Because of the force of the kick, Wang Li flew in the air and was slowly fell on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Yun and the guard who was looking at the battle from the sideline were completely surprised, they looked at each other with wide eyes which didn\u2019t hide any surprise they were feeling. They also never expected that, Wang Li who was at the level of great sword master would be flying in the air with the kick of a little fellow who was only at the level of intermediate fighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u2026..\u201d At this moment Wan Li coughed several time and slowly stood up from the ground. The attacks of Ren Tian You had only caused him minor injuries, that all. Considering that Wang Li was at the pinnacle of great sword master, this was nothing for him, nevertheless his face couldn\u2019t conceal any of the surprise he was feeling.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You was standing straight, his left hand was behind his back and right hand was stretching straight towards Wang Li\u2019s direction. [T.L: Rock Lee\u2019s stance] Seeing that Wang Li had stood up, he slightly smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on me just because you thought that I am intermediate fighter level. Do you really think that my strength is only intermediate fighter level? If this was life and death battle, then you would have died just a moment ago from my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I have never thought that I, Wang Li after leaving house for 30 years, a youngster would taught me a lesson. You are absolutely correct. I have offended you by looking down on you, however now I will use my full power to fight against you, prepare yourself!\u201d After standing up, Wang Li looked towards the sky and laughed heartily. After that all around his body, suddenly earth element appeared, these earth element had suddenly gushed out from Wang Li\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth blood lineage, appear!\u201d Along with the loud roar of Wang Li, suddenly his body was covered with thick and heavy earth element, just like a battle armor. An invisible shockwave spread out with Wang Li as the center, this was the power of blood lineage of Wang Li.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, again the yellow earth colored battle qi sprang out from Wang Li, and in his right had appeared a huge two handed sword!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my full power strongest state, boy, are you ready?\u201d Wang Li roared towards RenTian You.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was ready already at an earlier time!\u201d RenTian You said with a slight smile. After that his 2 eyes suddenly changed into blood red color. And 3 tomoe quickly spin, within those each eyes.</p><br/><p>An outstanding battle was about to begin\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And while the enemy was being distracted due to the loud sound of thunder, using this weapon to suddenly attack and land a fatal blow to enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just after Ren Tianyou used kamui of his right eye, that huge sword directly stabbed through the body of Ren Tainyou and stabbed the ground. Suddenly a loud deafening sound of explosion rang out, and the ground around was directly split open, creating a deep crater.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d Ren Tianyou jumped out from the clouds of dust and landed on the ground in front of the cloud of dust. Then looking at Li Jianrong in front of him, Ren Tianyou helplessly said, \u201cYou are really ruthless, directly using such killing move. Do you really want to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you still alive and kicking, and also\u2026\u2026..\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Li Jianrong pulled the iron chain with his right hand, and the dark god sword quickly flew back to his hand from the middle of the deep crater. \u201cAnd also I don\u2019t believe that you will die this easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your trust, since it is like this, I will also get serious.\u201d Hearing Li Jianrong, Ren Tianyou slightly smiled, then released a huge amount of eye power from his right Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>\u201cKamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the space in front of him suddenly started to distort, and a spiral shaped space ripple appeared and spread in all direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026..space magic?\u201d Seeing the space around were distorting, the complexion of Li Jianrong suddenly changed. Among all the elements, space was the most mysterious and hard to deal with element. He didn\u2019t have any time to think why Ren Tianyou possessed this most mysterious space magic, he immediately held his huge sword tightly and carefully prepare himself to guard against any attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014\u2014 Bakufu Ranbu! (Fire style\u2014-Bomb Blast Dance!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, then expelled out a powerul flame form his mouth. Next he quickly used kamui of his right eye, and created a space ripple towards Li Jianrong. And because of this space ripple, these flame covered extremely large area, and the speed of these flames were also extremely fast.</p><br/><p>After using this ninjutsu, Ren Tianyou heavily stamped on the ground with his right foot, and immediately jumped up just like a the arrow that was fired from the bow inside the center of the flame vortex, and he quickly advanced towards Li Jianrong who was in the air along with this flame vortex. Furthermore he was continuously releasing huge amount of eye power from his right eye, to maintain the space ripple around him.</p><br/><p>Looking at that boundless flame, and furthermore Ren Tianyou in the middle of that incoming flame vortex, the complexion of Li Jianrong changed greatly, and he firmly waved his huge sword with his right hand. Then he immediately crazily poured his battle qi towards his dark god sword, after that the sword blade of dark god sword flashed with dazzling white colored powerful sword qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark lightning secret sword art\u2014-3rd form\u2014\u2014Myriad sword form!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Li Jianrong, suddenly innumerable energy sword blade flew out from the blade of dark god sword, and these tens upon thousands of energy sword blade shot towards the incoming giant flame vortex. After that Li Jianrong threw the dark god sword towards front, then heavily kicked the hilt of this dark god sword with his right leg, which caused it to change into a light and directly advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Looking at those innumerous energy sword blades, furthermore that dark god sword which was in the middle of those energy sword blade, Ren Tianyou frowned. Right now he was using the power of his right eye to maintain the space ripple of Bakufu Ranbu (Bomb Blast Dance), so he couldn\u2019t use kamui to transfer his body to kamui dimension. But even in this case, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any fearful expression on his face.</p><br/><p>At that time the space ring in his right hand flashed, then 10 kunai appeared in both hands of Ren Tianyou. After that he firmly started at those incoming sword blades with his Sharingan, and when the flame of Bakufu Ranbu (Bomb Blast Dance) made a contact with these sword blades, many of those sword blades were immediately swallowed by the flames. But there were also many sword blades that passed through the center of the flame vortex without making any contact with the flame. And that dark god sword was also one of them, and was still advancing to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>The Sharingan of Ren Tianyou slowly rotated, and the path of these attacks slowly appeared on the brain of Ren Tianyou through Sharingan. After that he waved his right hand, and the 5 kunai on his right hand immediately shot towards the sword blade attack of dark god sword. But if one looked carefully, one would discover that the distance between these 5 kunai were more than 10 centimeters, and the shooting angles were also different.</p><br/><p>\u201cDang!\u201d The first kunai hit the sword blade\u2019s side of dark god sword, then the sword blade of the dark god sword slightly inclined to the side. After hitting the blade of the dark god sword, this first kunai was immediately bounced back by the rebound force of this sword. And after bouncing back by chance, the flying angle of this first kunai was in the way of second kunai, so the second kunai bumped against this first kunai, and this first kunai again flew towards dark god sword, then again bumped against its blade, changing its angle by a bit. In just this fashion, the 5 kunai successively hit the blade of the dark god sword, and successfully deviated its flying direction.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou tossed the kunai in his left hand in front of him, then lightly stepping on those kunai, and he immediately borrowed the power of 5 kunai and depending the ability to see everything clearly of Sharingan, he narrowly dodged all the other energy sword blade that had successfully pass through the center of flame vortex.</p><br/><p>And seeing that his attack had failed, Li Jianrong immediately started to fly towards the sky. After that he pulled the iron chain with his right hand, and the dark god sword flew back and arrived in his right hand. After that he flew around in the sky, then he waved his right hand which was holding dark god sword and slashed towards the direction of Ren Tianyou. Immediately a huge sword blade flew out from the dark god sword, and this sword blade quickly elongated, and become the sword blade which was more than 10 meters in length, and advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Landing on the ground, he looked towards the quickly advancing energy sword blade, Ren Tianyou slightly smiled, \u201cToo late for you.\u201d After that he heavily stepped on the ground with his right leg, and facing the direction of incoming sword blade, he rushed towards Li Jianrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d The huge energy sword blade directly chopped through the body of Ren Tianyou and landed on the ground, after that a deafening sound of explosion rang out.</p><br/><p>When Li Jianrong in the air saw that his attack had successfully cut Ren Tianyou, he frowned. Because from the expression of Ren Tainyou, it looked like getting cut through the body was a trifling matter to him. He didn\u2019t even had a change in expression even after getting cut, then his body gradually released a green colored energy, and a terrifying aura slowly spread to all direction from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHachimon Tonkou\u2014-Dairoku\u2014-Keimon, kai! (The Eight Inner Gates\u2014-6th gate\u2014-Gate of joy, open!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou yelled, a green colored aura appeared all around him, and blue nerves appeared on his forehead. After that he instantly flew above Li Jianrong, then started to quickly punch numerous punches. And along with every punch, flames rose in the air, and these flames shot in all direction with Ren Tianyou as the center. All these fists and flames advanced towards Li Jianrong, and this sight looked extremely gorgeous.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsa Kujaku! (Morning peacock!)\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After standing from the ground he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, then looked at Ren Tianyou who was standing before him. A peal of fear appeared inside his heart, he had never thought that this guy was not only extremely fast, but his attack power was also this high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t continue to waste time like this. He is much faster than me, if this goes on like this, sooner or later I am going to consume my energy to death. So I must resolve this match in shortest time possible.\u201d Cai Minghui decided inside his heart. Then he tightly held his two-handed sword with his both hands, suddenly a towering fiery red colored energy sprang out from the huge sword. Even the exploding flame battle qi around his body suddenly rose sharply and gradually changed into huge fiery red colored light.</p><br/><p>\u201cExploding flame soaring cut!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the roar of the Cai Minghui, the huge fiery red colored light of his body and towering fiery red colored energy from his huge sword advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the attack of Cui Minghui advancing towards him, a seriousness appeared in his eyes. Both hands quickly made a series of seals, only after 2 seconds, suddenly a strong lightning appeared on the right hand of Ren Tianyou. The lightning was accompanied by the sound which sounded like the chirping of thousands of birds. Then he quickly pulled out his snake sword from his waist with his right hand, then he rushed towards Cai Minghui.</p><br/><p>\u201cChidori!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the shout of Ren Tianyou, they finally collided with each other. \u201cHong!\u201d an explosion sound rang, immediately the arena was filled with dust and smoke, and because of that it was difficult to see what was happening in the arena. When everyone was full of curiosity to know what was happening in the arena, suddenly a shadow flew out from within the smoke and fell on the edge of the arena. After carefully looking, they discovered that it was Cai Minghui. But now he didn\u2019t have any majestic appearance which he had at the beginning, the radiance of his flame lion armor was already dimmer, and the blood was flowing out from the corner of his mouth. He looked extremely battered and exhausted.</p><br/><p>At that time, the silhouette of Ren Tianyou gradually came out from the smoke. And seeing his condition, everyone cry out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Because compared to the sorry figure of Cai Minghui, one may well say Ren Tianyou was completely clean, basically not soiled by a speck of dust. Under the impact of such strong energies, Ren Tianyou was capable enough to maintain such perfect condition, no wonder all of them were surprised.</p><br/><p>Actually it\u2019s not like, Cai Minghui was weak, but Ren Tianyou was much stronger. Beside all of his movements were clearly seen through by Sharingan of Ren Tianyou. So Ren Tianyou had already believed that he would be victorious in this match.</p><br/><p>But suddenly a towering flame light beam sprang out from the body of Cai Minghui which was lying on the ground. The body of Cai Minghui was completely wrapped by that light beam and gradually started to float. The injuries on his body quickly healed, and his strength also started to slowly recover to his peak, no it cannot be said to peak. Because Ren Tianyou\u2019s mental perception could sense that compared to before the strength of Cai Minghui was actually higher and was still rising.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Watching Cai Minghui who was wrapped by the fiery red light beam, a question appeared in his mind.\u2019 This guy was already half-dead, but how can he get up again and his strength is also continuously climbing higher compared to before.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar.\u201d When Ren Tianyou was wondering, suddenly he heard an utter sad calls of lion. Still wondering, Ren Tianyou lifted his head, coincidently he caught the sight of a fiery red colored \u2018overbearing lion\u2019 entering the body of Cai Minghui. After this flame lion entered the body, the closed eyes of Cai Minghui suddenly opened. With the help of Mangekyo Sharingan, Ren Tianyou vaguely saw a trace of flame was flashing in the eyes of Cai Minghui.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t this \u2018flame lion heart\u2019 of old Bei Ming? How could this kid use it?\u201d Seeing the changes on the Cai Minghui, Long Feilu cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-hm, it is indeed the blood lineage secret skill of old Bei Ming. Eh, isn\u2019t that flame lion blood lineage used by that kid just a moment ago also same blood lineage as old Bei Ming?\u201d Thinking about the flame lion blood lineage, the eyes of Zhao Guanghui suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. On this basis, we can say that this kid is either old friend\u2019s disciple or\u2026\u2026\u2026.heh heh, illegitimate child.\u201d Hearing the reminder of Zhao Guanhui, Long Feilu clapped his thigh and immediately responded with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is the case, and since he had already learned flame lion heart, there is high chance that he had also learned \u2018brilliant exploding flame destroyer formula\u2019. Heh heh, now this match is even more worth watching.\u201d Zhao Guanhui also said with a laugh. Thinking about the \u2018brilliant exploding flame destroyer formula\u2019 of old Bei Ming, he was full of expectation for this match.</p><br/><p>The so-called old Bei Ming by Long Feilu and Zhao Guanghui, full name was Bei Minghu. He was one of the three mid-god level exploding flame warrior of Divine wind continent. His first-rate flame lion blood lineage with his brilliant exploding flame destroyer formula was well known in the whole continent. And that flame lion heart was blood lineage secret skill created by Bei Minghu according to his power of blood lineage. Using this secret skill, not only it could heal all the wound in an instant as long as that is not a mortal wound, but it can also increase the strength level for a short time. Furthermore for a short time, it can cause flame lion armor to advance into dragon lion armor. However the side effects were also extremely great, it causes users\u2019 strength to lose a single level after its use.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know why Cau Minghui decided to use such a forbidden skill in this simple match, however it was not the time to investigate. Because Cai Minghui had already recovered and had started to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cExploding flame destroyer formula, fist formula\u2014exploding flame meteor drop!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou and Cai Minghui was about 20-30 meter distance apart, suddenly explosion sound rang. Suddenly a flame sprang out from the huge sword which was in the hands of Cai Minghui. Then that flame gradually safe guard his body, afterwards he suddenly jumped in the sky and his silhouette gradually disappeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stood on the same place, he raised his head and carefully looked towards the sky with his Sharingan. At that time, Ren Tinayou suddenly discovered a fiery colored radiance had appeared above his head. This huge fiery red colored radiance was just like a meteor and was advancing towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing this sight, the pupil of Ren Tianyou shrunk. Then he firmly stared at that fire ball which was rapidly descending towards his direction. He was preparing to defend whenever it was necessary.</p><br/><p>Along with the rapidly approaching fire ball, Ren Tianyou could even feel the astonishing quantity of heat from above. When the distance between them was just 4-5 meters, Ren Tianyou disappeared from the location where he was standing, leaving behind only his afterimage.</p><br/><p>And just after Ren Tianyou had left that place, Cai Minghui who was turned into a meteor, attacked at that place where Ren Tianyou had been standing. But the expected explosion sound didn\u2019t rang, but he could see that huge fiery colored energy along with the energy from huge sword had quickly spread all around the arena. Then the surface of the arena suddenly changed into fiery red in color.</p><br/><p>The energy wave was quickly spreading all over the arena, in a flash it was about to overtake Ren Tianyou. Seeing the situation, the pupil of Ren Tianyou contract again. \u2018Not good, when did this guy\u2026\u2026.\u2019</p><br/><p>It turned out that the attack of Cai Minghui was not a single target attack, rather a large area of effect attack. But Ren Tianyou had mistakenly believed that this attack was single target attack and thought as long as he stay out of this attack line, it would be enough. But this thought had caused him to fall in a dangerous situation in a flash.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked at the fast approaching fiery red energy wave, then he quickly formed series of hand seals. Only after 3 seconds, he completed forming hand seals, \u201cShunshin no jutsu!\u201d (Body Flicker Technique!)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhew!\u201d In a flash, Ren Tianyou disappeared from that location.</p><br/><p>Just after Ren Tianyou used Shunshin no jutsu and disappeared, fiery red colored energy wave quickly sweep over that place where Ren tianyou was standing just a moment ago. Then that energy wave covered the whole arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me an explosion!\u201d Seeing the whole arena was covered by his energy wave, coldness flashed in his eyes, and without the slightest hesitation, Cai Minghui released the true power of \u2018exploding flame meteor drop\u2019.</p><br/><p>Along with the shout of Cai Minghui, the whole arena which had already changed into fiery red, suddenly a huge sound of explosion rang out. After the huge explosion sound, thick smoke firmly covered the whole arena. The pieces of stone of the arena hit the barrier of the arena and those pieces of stones were again rebounded inside the arena.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So sitting on the ground physically paralyzed, he could only look helplessly at Fang Qian stabbing towards him with her dagger.</p><br/><p>But at this critical moment, a figure suddenly appeared between them, and the hand of Fang Qian which was holding the dagger was held by a sturdy hand. Carefully looking, if this person was not Ren Tianyou, then who else it could be.</p><br/><p>After holding the right hand of Fang Qian, Ren Tianyou reached out his right hand\u2019s index and middle finger towards her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t harm her!\u201d Seeing the movement of Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng who was sitting on the ground physically paralyzed immediately roared anxiously. He believed that Ren Tianyou wanted to harm Fang Qian. And at the same time, from behind the screen, a figure suddenly appeared and quickly rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cKai!\u201d Ignoring the roar of Bu Feng, Ren Tianyou directly placed the fingers of his right hand on her forehead, then circulating the chakra within his body, he immediately undid the illusion. After the illusion was undid, the expression in her eyes suddenly began to change, revealing a confused expression.</p><br/><p>And at that moment, that figure of a person had also already arrived in front of Ren Tianyou. But after undoing the illusion of Fang Qian, Ren Tianyou immediately pulled Bu Feng with his left hand and used Hiraishin to appear next to the window, where he had stuck a special kunai in advance.</p><br/><p>After three people stabilized themselves, the saw the figure appeared inside the room was a mature middle-aged woman wearing white colored bishop clothing, and her body was emitting mature charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho on earth are you? Actually daring to ruin my good deed!\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, this woman coldly said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Zero of Akatsuki, and this Bu Feng is member of my Akatsuki organization, so how can I watch him being killed by you?\u201d Looking at this middle-aged mature woman in front of him, Ren Tianyou slowly said. \u201cNow who are you, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too contemptible doing this sort of thing relying on your Intermediate God King realm strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, when did I\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng by his side suddenly roared.</p><br/><p>But before he finished speaking, the voice of Ren Tianyou was transmitted into his ear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die together with your this little lover, then don\u2019t speak too much nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, the expression of Bu Feng gradually became sober and clam while looking towards Fang Qian, then the gloomily thought, \u201cForget it, for Qing\u2019er, I will eat loss this time. Once my strength restores, I will immediately take Qing\u2019er and fly away from here. With my speed, you won\u2019t be able to do anything to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>But what Bu Feng don\u2019t know was, once he stepped into this \u201cpirate ship\u201d, how could he easily escape form it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, my name is Ji Ruyue, am second generation Holy Maiden of Light Temple.\u201d This middle-aged woman who was second generation Holy Maiden of Light Temple Ji Royue stared at Ren Tianyou with eyes full of killing intent. \u201cRegardless of who you are, daring to intervene on my Light Temple\u2019s matter, I think you are too impatient to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, this woman, second generation Holy Maiden of Light Temple Ji Ruyue was there from the first day when Bu Feng had stepped into this pavilion for the first time, so she had already discovered the existence of Bu Feng. But the speed of Bu Feng was too fast, and she understood that even she herself wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him from leaving.</p><br/><p>As a result, after considering for a long time, in today\u2019s circumstance, in accordance with her plan, she used illusion to control Fang Qian, making her to secretly poison Bu Feng, and in order to punish Bu Feng, she intentionally controlled Fang Qian to say those words to Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing was, after Bu Feng died, he won\u2019t be able to come to see Fang Qian, so after a long time, she might even forget Bu Feng, and concentrate her attention to become the Holy Maiden of Light Temple.</p><br/><p>But this plan was completely ruined by Ren Tianyou. With the illusion level of Ji Ruyue, how could it hide the truth from the Sharingan of Ren Tianyou?</p><br/><p>And while Ren Tianyou and Ji Ruyue were confronting each other, Fang Qian also completely awoke form illusion, then she instantly discover Bu Feng by her side, \u201cEh, Little Feng, why are you here? What\u2019s wrong with you? How come you are sitting on the floor motionless ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Qing\u2019er, you don\u2019t need to worry. This time I have come to take you away from this place.\u201d Bu Feng shook his head, then said with a smile. He didn\u2019t say anything about the matter of her giving him poison just a moment ago so as to avoid making her feel bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, leave, none of you can leave this place today.\u201d Hearing Bu Feng, Ji Ruyue coldly said while her beautiful eyes staring at Bu Feng with ill intention.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, go outside and wait.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Bu Feng and Fang Qian behind him, then turning around and looking at Ji Ruyue, he said, \u201cHand over the antidote of God Shackling Water, don\u2019t force me to take it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had stayed here, naturally because he wanted the antidote for God Shackling Water, otherwise he would have already taken both of them and use Hiraishin to leave this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for you to make me hand over the antidote!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ji Ruyue disdainfully laughed. \u201cFurthermore today you and this brat will not leave from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, it seems there is no choice but to use force.\u201d Hearing Ji Ruyue, Ren Tianyou merely shook his head because he had already expected this answer, then he stamped in the front with his right leg while suddenly releasing huge amount of chakra. This momentum directly strike towards Ji Ruyue, and the floor around suddenly became full of cracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Feeling the huge pressure from Ren Tianyou, Ji Ruyue suddenly exclaimed in surprise, then she also released her powerful momentum to firmly withstand the momentum\u2019s strike of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing Ji Ruyue had blocked his momentum, Ren Tianyou just snorted coldly. Then looking at the special kunai which he had used to block the dagger of Fang Qian, stabbed on the floor next to Ji Ruyue, he slightly smiled. After that he disappeared from that place and instantly appeared by the side of Ji Ruyue, then under her surprise as well as disbelief look, rasengan quickly appeared in his right hand which hit towards her abdomen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Holy Light Shield!\u201d At the time of imminent peril, Ji Ruyue immediately used a rank 8 light defense magic, safely blocking the rasengan of Ren Tianyou. And Ji Ruyue immediately borrowed the impact force of rasengan to withdraw and retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was a close call!\u201d After stabilizing her body, Ji Ruyue immediately wiped cold sweat on her forehead with lingering fear inside her heart. Just now in an instant, she was nearly injured seriously, fortunately she reacted timely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, now do you still think you can kill me?\u201d Looking at retreated Ji Ruyue, Ren Tianyou sneered. \u201cIt would be best for you to hand over the antidote quickly, otherwise even though I can\u2019t kill you in a short time, I can still change your Light Temple into ruins within fraction of a minute. Furthermore you should be clear that with our level, it is easy to do what I have mentioned just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the threat of Ren Tianyou, the face of Ji Ruyue slowly sank. Although she was unwilling to admit, but she was clear that what Ren Tianyou had said just now was a fact. If he really want to destroy Light Temple, then she would basically be powerless to stop him.</p><br/><p>In their level, every one of their movement contains huge amount of power and influence. No need to mention this small Light Temple, even this entire Radiance capital city, if given enough time, they could easily change it into a pile of debris.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want to be enemies with our Light Temple? Although you are very powerful, but don\u2019t forget, if we want to kill you, then that is also not impossible.\u201d Ji Ruyue stared at Ren Tianyou with eyes filled with killing intent, then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already stated, this fellow if member of my Akatsuki organization, and we Akatsuki never let anyone bully and humiliate us.\u201d Saying this, Ren Tianyou looked towards Bu Feng, then said, \u201cHey, what do you think, isn\u2019t the things I said right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we Akatsuki aren\u2019t afraid of any enemies!\u201d Seeing the meaningful glance of Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng had no choice but to say this against his will, while thinking, \u201cWait until I get the antidote and the recovery of my strength, then I will see how you will chase me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you antidote.\u201d Ji Ruyue was clear that if she didn\u2019t gave antidote today, then this matter would not end easily like this, so she had no other choice but to take out antidote from her space ring and threw it towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHope you gave me a real antidote, else you will know my means. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Ren Tianyou accepted the antidote and slowly said a sentence. After that turning towards Bu Feng and Fang Qian, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, you can\u2019t take Fang Qian away.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou wanted to take away Fang Qian too, Ji Ruyue immediately panicked. She was very clear about the blood lineage of Fang Qian, so for making her drop the idea of leaving here forever, she had arranged this drama of today, so how could she let Ren Tianyou take her away.</p><br/><p>But her movement however was slow, as Ren Tianyou had already placed his hands on the shoulder of both Bu Feng and Fang Qian, and immediately launching Hiraishin no Jutsu, he disappeared from there with both of them.</p><br/><p>Seeing the disappearance of Ren Tianyou and others, Ji Ruyue gnashed her teeth and said, \u201cAkatsuki, I will definitely make you die without a place for burial.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After flying to the front of this star, his Rinne Sharingan began to emit large amount of eye power, reflecting it off this huge star.</p><br/><p>In the Divine Wind Continent which was nearest to this star created by Ren Tianyou, countless people walked out from their room, and looking at that earth-shattering huge moon in the sky, all of them couldn\u2019t believe that this star was man-made.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Looking at that huge moon in the sky, White Tiger couldn\u2019t help but asked everyone of Akatsuki beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know, but I am having a kind of bad feeling.\u201d Bu Feng shook his head, and expressed that he also didn\u2019t know what was happening in front of him.</p><br/><p>But just then, the complexion of Void beside them suddenly change greatly, then pointing towards that huge moon in the sky, he said to everyone present, \u201cQuickly look!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the pointing out of Void, the gaze of everyone couldn\u2019t help but again turned towards the distant sky. At this moment, the heaven concealing huge moon in the sky suddenly had a great changes. Its original bright and clear moonlight suddenly changed into blood red, moreover in this blood red moon, slowly nine tomoe appeared. Precisely was Eye of the Moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Seeing that as if huge blood-red eyes moon, White Tiger instantly asked in confusion, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the pattern of Zero\u2019s eye? How can it appear in the moon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that something happened to idiot?\u201d Seeing the pattern that had suddenly appeared in the moon, Little Yu also immediately felt this was very similar to the pattern of the eyes of the person she was very worried about, merely she didn\u2019t know why such pattern suddenly appeared in the huge moon.</p><br/><p>Moreover thinking about her husband was currently fighting with Yaorao, the strongest expert of Demon World, she couldn\u2019t help but instantly began to worry about Ren Tianyou\u2019s safety even more.</p><br/><p>But just then, the eye in the moon suddenly emitted an obscured power that spread towards the universe. The very first that came into contact with this power was Divine Wind Continent that was nearest to this moon. Under powerful dojutsu Infinite Kotoamatsukami, the consciousness of everyone began to slowly disappear, and the pattern of all these people\u2019s eyes instantly changed into the pattern of Rinne Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Now everybody were blankly looking towards the sky. Even the people possessing exceedingly high strength were unable to resist the effect of this powerful dojutsu, and all of them were controlled by Infinite Kotoamatsukami.</p><br/><p>White Tiger, Southern Dipper, Jade Maiden, Little Yu and all others had also fallen into this dojutsu and lost their consciousness. Mo Yun who was in the process of setting up his scheme, as well as Ling Weiwei who was flying towards endless ocean had also fallen into this dojutsu. No matter how far you hide, no matter how deep you hide, no one was able to escape from the effect of this dojutsu.</p><br/><p>But all these people were merely caught in this dojutsu, and were controlled by Ren Tianyou, nothing more. He didn\u2019t harm the life of any of these people.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the outer space, after Ren Tianyou used Eye of the Moon to reflect his eyes on the moon he had created, he immediately gathered together all the power of his Infinite Kotoamatsukami, and shone upon the moon.</p><br/><p>Since the time he had exchanged the eyes of Uchiha Shisui, Ren Tianyou had never once used Kotoamatsukami, fearing he would waste the eye power of Kotoamatsukami. But today, he gathered together all the eye power of Kotoamatsukami, making it one-time use dojutsu. In other words, after using Infinite Kotoamatsukami once, Ren Tianyou would no longer be able to use Kotoamatsukami ever again.</p><br/><p>After the success of Infinite Kotoamatsukami, Ren Tianyou sat cross-legged in the outer space, then closing his eyes, he link up with Eye of the Moon. After that all kind of information came to Ren Tianyou from these controlled people. After the people were controlled by Kotoamatsukami, all the secrets in the heart of all the people were transmitted to the mind of Ren Tianyou, all without exception.</p><br/><p>After everyone present in the Divine Continent were controlled, the eye power of Eye of the Moon slowly advanced towards the depth of the universe. After that all the life of the planets were under the control of Ren Tianyou, and even the Universe Boundary Artifacts of these planets were under his control.</p><br/><p>Roughly after one day, the closed eyes of Ren Tianyou slowly opened, and taking a deep breathe, he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve already found all 3000 Universe Boundary Divine Artifacts, merely I\u2019ve never expected to discover such interesting matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou controlled Divine Wind Continent, the memory of everyone including Little Yu was transmitted to Ren Tianyou\u2019s mind, which naturally includes the controlled Mo Yun.</p><br/><p>And to the surprise of Ren Tianyou, this Mo Yun was unexpectedly a human, furthermore he was that Dark Saint that should have already died 30,000 years ago.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, Ren Tianyou had already thought about this possibility, because the time when this Mo Yun had appeared in Demon Word was after Demon World failed their invasion to Divine Wind Continent.</p><br/><p>In fact, at that time, after Seven Great Saints sacrificed their blood lineage and all battle qi to jointly issue an attack, they all didn\u2019t die, rather lost their cultivation and changed into waste without any power.</p><br/><p>But just because they all had become waste, after the conclusion of Demon World\u2019s invasion, they were unexpectedly subjected to pry of Evil Eyes clan, as they wanted to obtain the method to open God rank blood lineage and also their cultivation technique. And confronting against Evil Eyes clan in the state when they had already lost their cultivation, the other six Great Saints naturally had no power to resist and finally they all choose to commit suicide.</p><br/><p>But Dark Saint was lucky enough to escape this disaster, and luckily got a cosmic energy crystal called Evil Cloud Celestial Body, then completely recovered his strength, and moreover his strength was strengthen further.</p><br/><p>But when he wanted to take revenge against Evil Eyes clan, each and every big powers of the continent stopped him. This made Dark Saint hate all humans and 100 clans of Divine Wind Continent in secret. Finally thinking to carry it through, whatever the consequences, he directly went and joined Demon Empress, then helped her to create Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers and came to invade Divine Wind Continent to avenge his six younger brother and older sister.</p><br/><p>And the mother of Great Bear Di Qingyu was precisely Fire Saint, and she had also died in the hands of Evil Eyes clan, and even though he wanted to take revenge, he however didn\u2019t have any opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect this Mo Yun to truly be Dark Saint.\u201dRen Tianyou slowly thought in his heart, \u201cBut since this Evil Eyes clan killed the mother of Great Bear, I will help him take the revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, with a single thought of Ren Tianyou, all the clansmen of Evil Eyes clan who were under the complete control of Ren Tianyou due to the effect of Infinite Kotoamatsukami, all of them choose to cut their own throat to commit suicide. Now the life and death of all these people without exception were completely under the control of the single thought of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>And the matter that surprised Ren Tianyou the most was, the identity of Yaorao. Although Yaorao was sealed, but also wasn\u2019t able to escape Infinite Kotoamatsukami, and he was able to peep through all of her memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this, never thought that in this world, I have a partner ah.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed with feelings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

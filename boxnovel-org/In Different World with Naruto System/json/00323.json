In those years, I sustained an injury that was hard to recover from completely. Even after I lied dormant, it didn\u2019t recover, so I was forced to use a reincarnation method where I had to divide my soul into two. One soul would reincarnate achieving rebirth, and other part of soul would retain my previous memory and my origin power while hiding within the rebirthed life. Then at the suitable opportunity, the new soul and the other part of my soul will merge together to obtain my former power.\u201d This virtual shadow slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if you fused with the soul of Ling Weiwei, will she still be herself?\u201d Having heard up to here, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but asked tensely, as if he greatly feared that Ling Weiwei would disappear. But he himself didn\u2019t realized this feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am Ling Weiwei, and Ling Weiwei is me, both of us together is entirety nothing more. After we fused together, she will receive all of the previous memory and abilities. Naturally the memory of this new life will also not disappear!\u201d This virtual shadow slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, but who are you?\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head. After listening to her explanation, it seems this was just like merging together of his soul which had crossed over and the soul of Ximen Tainlong. But Ren Tianyou was quite curious with regarding to the identity of this virtual shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak about my identity now, moreover now that I have reincarnated, my name has also disappeared, so now I am only Ling Weiwei now.\u201d This virtual shadow didn\u2019t answer the question of Ren Tianyou. \u201cI can only say that with your potential, someday, you can absolutely reach my level of that time. And only when you are able to truly shuttle back and forth between 3000 great realms, you will know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3000 great realms?\u201d Hearing this, Ren Tianyou was puzzled, so he couldn\u2019t help but asked while feeling surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, our universe is made up of 3000 layer of space, not one more not one less. And there are various kind of life forms in these realms. For instance this Divine Wind Continent and Demon World, both of them are among those 3000 realms.\u201d This virtual shadow said. \u201cI hope you will not contain yourself only within this small Divine Wind Continent. Although this Divine Wind Continent also possess a number of secrets, but compared to entire 3000 realms, one can say that it\u2019s merely a drop in the ocean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo do you know how to break through this universe and reach another universe?\u201d After hearing this virtual shadow, Ren Tianyou asked with some excitement. Till now he had never got any clue with regarding to breaking this limit of this universe and return back to Earth, but now this virtual shadow in front of him was definitely a peak expert, so perhaps she knew the methods to break through this universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak through this Universe? How did you get this kind of idea?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, this virtual shadow looked at Ren Tianyou with surprise. She didn\u2019t understand why he asked about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is very important to me, if you know any method, please tell me, I will be very grateful. And if you have any matter you need me to do, then I will absolutely do all I can to help you accomplish it.\u201d Anxiously looking at this virtual shadow, Ren Tainyou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe matter of breaking through the universe, within my knowledge, only one man had ever accomplished it, but this is also merely a legend nothing more.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou getting anxious, this virtual shadow slowly said,</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really want to break through the universe, you have to master space magic in addition to having absolute power. But these are only the perquisites.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most important thing is to obtain all the Universe Boundary Divine Artifact of every one of these 3000 realms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUniverse Boundary Divine Artifact?\u201d Having heard up to here, Ren Tianyou instantly thought of Tower of Babel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, moreover you must gather all 3000 of them, even one less wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d This virtual shadow nodded her head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this Universe Boundary Divine Artifact? I have once seen our realm\u2019s Universe Boundary Divine Artifact\u2014Tower of Babel, but what are they, I however truly don\u2019t understand?\u201d Ren Tianyou really didn\u2019t understand what these Universe Boundary Divine Artifacts truly were, and why the help of all 3000 of them was required to break the universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cUniverse Boundary Divine Artifact is every realm\u2019s origin power. When the realms form, along with the appearance of realm, the Universe Boundary Divine Artifact would also simultaneously appear within that realm. Once you obtain this Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, then that is equivalent to you obtaining the origin power of that realm. And everything in that realm will be subjected under your control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if you obtain all 3000 Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, then that\u2019d be equivalent to you obtaining the origin power of all 3000 realms. And gathering their power, it is possible to break this universe\u2019s restriction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it is basically impossible to obtain all 3000 Universe boundary Divine Artifacts. You should know that the Universe Boundary Divine Artifacts are either in the hands of the strongest person of the realm or in ownerless state or hidden within the space, so relying on the strength of one person to obtain all 3000 Universe boundary Divine Artifacts is\u2026\u2026\u201d Saying up to here, this virtual shadow couldn\u2019t help but shake her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it even if it\u2019s very hard. Hope is created by oneself, not God.\u201d Ren Tianyou resolutely said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, hope you can accomplish this.\u201d That virtual shadow chuckled, then said to Ren Tianyou, \u201cBoy, I hope you are able to protect my successor, because of my origin power, her body will emit a kind of energy fluctuation that would have powerful effect of attracting magical beasts. And when she becomes powerful enough to accept my inheritance, she will inherit everything, after that I will use my power to help you look for those 3000 Universe Boundary Divine Artifacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can be at ease, I\u2019d have done so even if you hadn\u2019t asked me, after all she is my friend.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen thank you, now I will use my origin power to help you completely refine the power of Forever Green within your body.\u201d This virtual shadow nodded, then waving her right hand, from the heart of Ling Weiwei, suddenly a blue colored radiance shot towards Ren Tianyou and entered inside his body.</p><br/><p>After this blue colored radiance entered inside his body, Ren Tianyou sensed that the power of Forever Green unexpectedly spread rapidly, and were absorbed by his body. Furthermore the chakra within his body also strengthen rapidly.</p><br/><p>In less than ten minutes, the power of Forever Green within his body was completely refined. And now the chakra capacity within his body was actually twice as much compared to before, which was basically already comparable to tailed-beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis power is too strong. Never thought that I\u2019d be able to completely refine Forever Green this quickly.\u201d Ren Tianyou clenched his hands, and feeling colossal amount of chakra within his body, he sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, if it was not you\u2019re your help, then it would have taken at least 5 more years to completely refine the power of Forever Green.\u201d Ren Tianyou thankfully said to this virtual shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreat this as my payment.\u201d This virtual shadow nodded her head, then her figure slowly faded away, \u201cHope you\u2019ll be able to obtain all 3000 Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, goodbye youngster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with her voice, this virtual shadow disappeared, and the water energy leaking out from the body of Ling Weiwei also disappeared slowly.</p><br/><p>And when Ling Weiwei fell down from midair, Ren Tianyou stepped forward and caught her body in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Just then, Ling Weiwei slowly opened her eyes, and looking all around with confused eyes, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did I fell asleep?\u201d Just then, she suddenly noticed that she was actually lying in the embrace of Ren Tianyou. Immediately afterwards she suddenly cried out in alarm, jumped out, and then her face became very red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, now that you are awake, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Seeing that Ling Weiwei had woken up, he stood up, and then taking out Hiraishin kunai and a talisman, he handed them over to her. \u201cAlways keep these things with you. If you encounter any danger hereafter, then burn this talisman, and I will instantly appear by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d With her complexion still a bit red, Ling Weiwei stepped forward and took both talisman and kunai, and placed them into her space ring.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

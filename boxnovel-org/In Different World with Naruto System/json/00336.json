What is this?\u201d The crowd couldn\u2019t help but ask confusedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you all think that Demon clan had nothing to do and build such a place dedicated to torturing our clansmen? They are using that blood filled with resentment qi of those tortured to death clansmen to complete this magic formation.\u201d Ren Tianyou pointed that huge magic formation ahead and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all can perceive that these demon soldiers are dead long ago, and they are merely a corpse without any consciousness. But Demon clan use this magic formation to inject baleful resentment power into these corpses, allowing them to gradually restore their strength before death, then controlling them using a secret technique, they turn them into a killing machine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore the most terrifying matter is, the attack of these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier contain baleful resentment power, if one suffers even a single wound from these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier, then the baleful resentment power will enter into their body, which will then infiltrate deep into their body, changing them into similar Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier without any consciousness, this is very troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect these demons still have such hidden trump, if you didn\u2019t inform in advance, then we\u2019d have absolutely paid bitterly.\u201d Looking at Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier, Ling Xiaotian solemnly sighed, and became grateful to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, the strength of these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier in itself is not too hard to deal with, although they don\u2019t have any consciousness, don\u2019t know pain, and even if they are able to recover their strength before death, that is not too much of a problem. The main problem is these baleful resentment power.\u201d Brilliant also nodded his head and said.</p><br/><p>If you are wounded even once, the baleful resentment power would change them into similar Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier, this made everyone present to feel thorny.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve seen all the things you should see, so let\u2019s return to reality first, and then discuss together about how to deal with these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then said to everyone present. After that, stretching out is right hand, Ren Tianyou snapped his fingers. Along with this sound, everybody only felt their vision blurring, and they had already return back to the square of Holy Light Hill.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill truly a mystical illusion technique.\u201d Seeing the surrounding environment, as well as the stool where they were sitting hadn\u2019t move even a bit, it was basically unthinkable that all of these people had gone to another place just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I have a way to somewhat restrain these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier.\u201d Just then, Brilliant slowly opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You have? Then why don\u2019t you quickly tell us how to deal with these troublesome things?\u201d Ling Xiaotian hastily asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis baleful resentment power is actually a part of dark energy, if we use light magic, fire magic and Elf clan\u2019s life magic, then I believe these three magic can definitely deal with these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier.\u201d Brilliant slowly expressed his view.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt make sense, light in itself is bane of dark, although the power of fire magic is not as good as light magic to cope with dark magic, but fire magic is much stronger compared to other magic. And the life magic of Elf clan along with light magic are called the two great nemesis of dark magic.\u201d Ling Xiaotian nodded his head, then said, \u201cNow that this is the case, our plan is changed, we will take out some excellent light magician from sixth medical unit, then take out half of total fire magicians and everyone of Elf clan from other units to deal with these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers. As for the leadership of this group, it will be given to\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When speaking about who to give the leadership, Ling Xiaotian was unable to think of a suitable person for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to our Akatsuki\u2019s Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird and Northern Dipper.\u201d Ren Tianyou stood up and said to Ling Xiaotian. \u201cThey are fire and light cultivators, and they have great restraint against these Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the team of Akatsuki\u2019s three people will lead this unit. Hope you all will be able to succeed in blocking Demon Spirit Baleful Soldier of Demon clan at that time.\u201d Ling Xiaotian thought for a brief, then agreed to the opinion of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, I don\u2019t want to lead fourth unit, you can give it to White Tiger, and all the remaining members of my Akatsuki including White Tiger will assist this unit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lead this unit?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Ling Xiaotian couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to, I will move freely and that will suffice. Since you all will lead experts to block Three Great Demon God of Demon clan, then it\u2019d be better to let me deal with the Demon Empress of Demon clan.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to deal with Demon Empress? Then do you need the help of our experts?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou wanted to deal with Demon Empress, everyone present were greatly shocked, they thought that Ren Tianyou was intentionally cracking a joke, but thinking of that illusion of just now, they also felt that his strength might be higher than everyone present here.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, you will only hold me back. Without God Emperor realm in strength, it is basically impossible to injure Demon Empress, otherwise why do you think that Seven Great Saints burned their blood lineage and life?\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, and refused the kindness of Ling Xiaotian, \u201cMoreover, sooner or later Demon Empress and I must fight, this fight will be the continuation of our last time\u2019s unfished battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfinished battle? Don\u2019t tell me that you and Demon Empress clashed?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Brilliant exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we clashed.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then disregarding the shock and astonishment of the crowds, he continued, \u201cand more than once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou said these because he wanted a deterrence force, and this will be convent for him to move without any interference or questioning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that is the case, then I hope you can really stop Demon Empress, after all currently we do not have any way to deal with Demon Empress, as all the original Seven Great Saints no longer exists.\u201d Ling Xiaotian slowly sighed and said, \u201cBut at that time, if you need any help, feel free to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head without any refusal.</p><br/><p>Next, the gathering continued to discuss and formulate the details of plan. All in all this was a battle concerning the continuation of Divine Wind Continent and every races, basically unable to be bear any carelessness. This gathering continued for nearly 10 hours before it gradually ended.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There they sat on the empty chair, then ordered the delicacies. Just after they ordered the delicacies enough to completely fill the table, Luo Tianxing and Li Feng also arrived at the 2nd floor of the dining room and walked towards their table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, your match already ended ah.\u201d Even before Luo Tianxing arrived near the table, Ren Tianyou and others heard the big voice of Luo Tianxing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, do you think I would lose?\u201d Having a bit of ringing sensation in his ear, said Ren Tianyou in a bad mood while giving a supercilious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, just joking.\u201d Luo Tianxing answered and carefully thought for a bit. \u2018With the strength of Ren Tianyou, how can he lose in a 1st match? Perhaps the 1st position of this cultivation room ranking competition of 1st grade might really fall in the head of Ren Tianyou.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, congratulation to you, Tianyou. Continue to win every match and become the champion.\u201d Li Feng pulled a chair and congratulate Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, thanks a lot. Oh, that\u2019s right, why were you called by your teacher?\u201d Ren Tianyou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe called us to tell us some details about the next match, after all the competition has just begun today. Even we are not that clear with regards to who would be our opponent in the next match. It is so because all the other classes hide their name lists of participants in advance. It is done so in order to not give any chance for other participants of other classes to gather the information and to not let their opponents to make the appropriate preparation in advance. Only after the match starts, will we know who the opponent is. So, just now our teacher had called us, merely to tell us to be more careful against the opponent and their powers. Tianyou, don\u2019t tell me your teacher didn\u2019t tell you anything?\u201d Li Fen explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this ah, our teacher also told about it.\u201d After listening to the explanation and question of Li Feng, Ren Tianyou said awkwardly answered. Inside of his heart he was sweating heavily, \u201cF**k. It looks like I made an unexpected big mistake. I never thought, there would be such explanations. I thinks the teachers are quite angry with me as I have already left the arena.\u2019 Thinking about the anger of Wang Jiafei, the whole body of Ren Tianyou shivered.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had remembered, several days ago in the classroom, a student of his class was joking by using the talking accent of Wang Jiafei. By coincidence, she was passing through the class and heard it. The result of it was, that student was turned into \u2018simmer-fried chicken\u2019. All the hairs all over the body were completely burned by the exploding flame battle qi of Wang Jiafei. And the thick smell of roasting could be smelled from the body of that student. After seeing that, Ren Tianyou finally understand the temperament of this sexy female teacher. And he didn\u2019t want to be roasted by her anytime soon.</p><br/><p>While they were chatting, all the ordered delicacies arrived in succession. Then they started to eat while chatting among themselves. After they finished eating, all of them separated.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou returned back to dormitory and lied on the bed. First he decided to take a nice nap for a while. The afternoon matches starts at 2 o\u2019clock. So now he was bored with nothing to do. As a result he decided to take a nap for a while.</p><br/><p>When it was 1:30, Ren Tianyou opened his eyes. Then he got off the bed and exit the door of his room and head towards the direction of match arena.</p><br/><p>At last when he arrived at the arena, he saw Wang Jiafei\u2019s face which was spitting anger. When she saw Ren Tianyou, in an instance she arrived before Ren Tianyou and said, \u201cWhere have you been after the morning match? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know that you had to come and listen to the information on other participants? I\u2019ve been looking for you all this morning but I didn\u2019t see even your shadow. Don\u2019t you know the difficulty of remaining matches are as high as heavens and as deep as the earth? Fine, since it is already like this, if you don\u2019t bring back the championship of this competition to me, see how I will take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the condition of Wang Jiafei, the complexion of Ren Tianyou collapsed and he said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be so ruthless. I truly didn\u2019t know anything about it ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Don\u2019t give me any excuses. Last time I already stated about this matter in the classroom, you don\u2019t know! This time you must seize the championship for me, otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2026.hee hee, you should know the consequences.\u201d Wang Jiafei didn\u2019t listen to the explanation of Ren Tianyou and directly gave such punishment.</p><br/><p>Watching the beautiful figure of leaving Wang Jiafei, Ren Tianyou grinded his teeth until his gum started to itch. Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t dared to refute. Otherwise, if she became unhappy, she might roast him, char-grilled or something like that. That would be a huge laughable matter. However to seize the championship, without exposing his ninjutsu and genjutsu would be bit harder. After all no need to talk about other peoples, even Yan Xinluo from his own class is not to be underestimated. After all he possessed the power of supreme blood lineage of Sishen clan, \u2018Heart death\u2019. And Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have much information on the abilities of this \u2018Heart death\u2019 blood lineage. He only knew 2 abilities, they were undead battle qi and other was to summon soul of deceased person. Even this 2 are terrifying, no need to mention about other unknown abilities.</p><br/><p>Furthermore there was that Wang Yanli from magic court. And from the narration of Sun Chuqian, he know that Wang Yanli was definitely not weak. He was also another formidable opponent. And furthermore there may be other hidden formidable opponents too. In short, to win this competition using only taijutsu is absolutely not a small pressure.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless Ren Tianyou still had a huge advantage, which is Mangekyo Sharingan. Although the powerful doujutsu of Sharingan is not that convenient to use in the match, but even the simplest observation ability could hugely increase the chance to win the matches.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, he no longer thought about this matter. Now he would proceed without any plan and if the worst comes to worst, he would just use \u2018that\u2019 trick.</p><br/><p>All the matches of following 3 days, Ren Tianyou won all of them. So he successfully qualified for top 16. Among the 10 matches in those 3 days, thanks to his great luck, he didn\u2019t ran into any strong opponents. That\u2019s why he finished all of his match within seconds. Among the participants of his class, Yan Xinluo, Sun Chuqian, and Wang Haiqian also successfully entered top 16. But Li Yun had a bad luck and encountered the runner up \u2018Li Xinyun of illusion court\u2019 from the last competition. And had his advancement stop at top 20.</p><br/><p>Now all the following matches of top 16 would be elimination match. It is so because the real cultivation room ranking competition starts from top 16. All the students who are able to reach top 16 among the several hundreds of participants are already genius. And each and every match from now on would be absolutely peerless.</p><br/><p>The top 16 matches would officially start from tomorrow morning at 9 o\u2019clock, in this square. On that occasion, vast majority of teachers would come and watch the battle. This can be said to be an unforgettable gathering. But Ren Tianyou was afraid about a matter, which is the match between the students of his own class. If one or more were defeated from the hand of the person of same side, then that would be a tragedy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

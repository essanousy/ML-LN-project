Then she suddenly screamed, then clutching her body she half squat on the ground, \u201cYou damned pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, your clutching is of no use. My eyes have omni-directional see through ability.\u201d Watching Sun Chuqian who was hugging her own body and squatting on the ground, Ren Tianyou lewdly smiled and continued to tease her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t stare me with those strange eyes. Quickly turn around so I can leave this place.\u201d Hearing the magnificent ability of Ren Tianyou, the face of Sun Chuqian became even redder through and through. Then she angrily said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026aiyo, this pain is killing me. Ah it\u2019s burning.\u201d Seeing the embarrassed appearance of Sun Chuqian, Ren Tianyou laughed feeling proud of himself, but just as he start laughing, he suddenly felt a strong heat wave behind his back. Shortly afterwards, his buttocks was on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell Ren Tianyou, your blood lineage still had such shameless ability. And you also dared to uses this ability to peep my body before. Humph, damn you pervert, see how I take care of you.\u201d From behind Ren Tianyou, the ashen faced Wang Jiafei looked at lively Ren Tianyou and then said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, teacher, please listen to my explanation.\u201d With great difficulty, he put out the fire from his buttocks. Hearing the voice behind him, he turned around his head only to see the fierce Wang Jiafei walking towards him. Suddenly inside his heart, he realized that his joke was heard by Wang Jiafei and he immediately opened his mouth to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain the fart, you quickly gouge out your eyes and hand it over to I, your old mother. Otherwise be careful I, your old mother will make you unable to see the sun forever.\u201d Wang Jiafei simply didn\u2019t allow Ren Tianyou to explain. Seeing he was using his eyes to firmly stare at her again, immediately she got angry inside her heart and said in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, teacher, my eyes do not have see through ability. Just now, I was only teasing Sun Chuqian.\u201d Ren Tianyou hastily explained. If he hesitate to explain now, he would definitely create a disaster for himself. He already knows that he couldn\u2019t afford to offend these females.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no see through ability?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Wang Jiafei stared blankly for a while. Then she slowly withdrew her battle qi, and doubtfully looked towards the direction of Ren Tianyou. Sun Chuqian was also a little dazed, but very quickly responded, \u201cNo, if you don\u2019t have see through ability, then how you can see what is happening in the arena? You should know that currently the whole arena is covered with the purple black colored fog released by Zhou Guangsheng, so it is impossible to see the situation within the arena. If you don\u2019t have see through ability, then how do you clearly know the situation inside the arena?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh this, how do you explain, I was almost deceived by you.\u201d Hearing Sun Chuqian, Wang Jiafei was stunned, then she quickly put on her guard and looked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Seeing the embarrassed appearance of Ren Tianyou, Wang Haiqing and others were covering their mouth and laughing. None of them stepped forward to rescue him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that way, my eyes have the ability to see through illusions. All illusions as long as they do not exceed my strength won\u2019t affect me. This purple black colored fog released by Zhou Guangsheng, in the end is also the part of illusion power, and to this added a special skill to successfully release it. So, nevertheless before my eyes it is nothing. So I could see what was going on in the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sun Chuqian and Wang Jiafei still doubtfully asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout doubt, its real, 2 beautiful ladies. You should have faith in me. I am not deceiving you.\u201d Ren Tianyou pulled a long face and said towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, we will believe you for the time being.\u201d Wang Jiafei considered for a bit, then decided to believe in him temporarily. Because she had a bit of understanding on the character of Ren Tianyou after contacting with him for a month. As a result she decided to believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuuuuuuu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Ren Tianyou let out a long breath of relief, then wipe out the cold sweat on his forehead. \u201cA close call.\u201d At this time, from the corner of his eyes, he suddenly discovered the situation on the arena had changed. Without losing any time, he stood up and said, \u201cLook, the match is almost over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After the \u2018illusion country\u2019 attack of Zhou Guangsheng surrounded the arena, a section of strange power unceasingly enticed his state of mind and he sunk into unlimited illusions. Despite being a powerful magician with powerful resistance against the illusions, nevertheless he wasn\u2019t able to compete against this illusion attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this fellow possessed move like this. It seem this fellow is also looking down upon me, but\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I will end this match now.\u201d Seeing endless illusions before his eyes, Wang Yanli discovered that he himself was also being underestimated by Zhou Guangsheng. However he didn\u2019t panic, the magic wand which he was holding with his right hand started to twinkle with red colored magic radiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice but to say, this move is quite powerful. And I can see that you have a great confidence in this move.\u201d Wang Yanli slowly said. Although he didn\u2019t know where Zhou Guangsheng was, nevertheless he didn\u2019t care about it.</p><br/><p>But Zhou Guangsheng didn\u2019t replied him, because Zhou Guangsheng was afraid about exposing his location, if he spoke now. And if his location was exposed then the magic could easily lock on to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to be this careful, because even like this you can\u2019t change the result of this match. It is so because this move of yours simply don\u2019t have any effect upon me, as I have this move, flame heart skill.\u201d After he finished speaking, the red colored magic radiances that was gathered in the magic wand of his hand changed into flowing light and entered inside the head of Wang Yanli.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Flame heart skill, you actually possess this skill.\u201d Even though Zhou Guangsheng had complete confidence in his move, but when he heard the three words \u2018Flame heart skill\u2019, his complexion had a huge changes. His mind was in chaos.</p><br/><p>Flame heart skill, one of the most supreme bluff magic of fire system magicians, is a rank 8 saint class magic. But its learning degree of difficulty alone was grade 3.</p><br/><p>The main effect of Flame heart skill was to protect your mind, and increase the comprehensive power. In addition to this, for a short period of time, the user is completely immune to all illusion skill below the level of saint class. Even the saint class illusions skills effects were greatly reduced by this flame heart skill.</p><br/><p>But this magic skill can only be learnt at \u2018Magic domain\u2019, and outsiders had next to nothing chance to learn this skill. And even the members of the Magic domain were not qualified to learn this skill, only the core members with the significant contribution towards Magic domain or the members who exercise control over Magic domain and the next generation who were chosen to exercise control over were only qualified to learn this skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end who are\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, you will never have the chance to know who I am. I will end this match now. Wings of heaven.\u201d Along with the voice of Wang Yanli, suddenly inexhaustible fire system magic sprang out from behind Wang Yanli. Gradually it changed into 2 meter long fiery red colored phoenix wings. Then he lightly flapped his wings and rise in the air above the arena. Then he looked downwards to that endless purple black colored magic fog, then he started to chant the incantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cScorching hot star fall!\u201d After completing chanting the incantation, a powerful fire system magic fluctuated above the magic wand at the right hand of Wang Yanli. Then gradually take the form of huge fiery red energy ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cFall.\u201d Seeing the magic was completed, Wang Yanli waved the magic wand. Immediately the huge energy ball directly fall down straight toward the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Seeing the magic of Wang Yanli, the pupils of Zhou Guangsheng shrunk tightly, and his complexion immediately changed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

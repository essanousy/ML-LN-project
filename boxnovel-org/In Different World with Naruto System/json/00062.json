In the eyes of others, Feng Wu had barely won this match with great hardships and danger, but from the observation of Sharingan, Ren Tianyou had clearly saw that, many time a strong fluctuation of special energy sprang out from the body of Feng Wu. But every time it appeared, she forcedly suppressed it. Ren Tianyou was completely sure that, within her body she conceal a powerful unknown power.</p><br/><p>Over time, slowly following several match quickly passed. Yan Xinluo, Sun Chuqian and furthermore Wang Haiqing also smoothly won their respective match and advanced to top 8. The participants of the top 8 were already determined.</p><br/><p>Warrior court: Ren Tianyou, YanXinluo, Sun Chuqian, Wang Haiqing, and Feng Wu;</p><br/><p>Magic court: Wang Yanli, Hai Fu;</p><br/><p>Illusion court: Li Xinyun.</p><br/><p>The quarter-finals matches will take place tomorrow. And there will also be the matches for the remaining 8 participants to determine their ranking.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the matches for today was complete, Ren Tianyou also withdrew his eyes from the arena. Then he started to leave the square with Wang Jiafei and others. Then he walked towards the square where the matches of 2nd year students were taking place.</p><br/><p>He arrived at the location where matches of the 2nd year were taking place, then he saw that the square was still bustling with matches to determine top 8. Ren Tianyou looked carefully for a while, and finally found Lan Yan and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Yan, how are things? What is the outcome of Tianxing and Li Feng\u2019s matches?\u201d Arriving next to Lan Yan, Ren Tianyou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Tianyou.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou, Lan Yan revealed the smile on his face and said, \u201cTianxing already won the match and advanced to top 8, but Li Feng lost his match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is understandable. Tianxing has, in addition to his 7 star broken bone blood lineage, still has a great strength. And once he activate his blood lineage, his destructive power is extremely terrifying. But the strength of Li Feng is relatively a bit lower.\u201d Hearing Lan Yan, Ren Tianyou sighed with feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind, for Li Feng, it was pretty good to advance into top 16.\u201d Long You said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he! Oh, that\u2019s right, since the matches are already over, where is Tianxing and Li Feng?\u201d Ren Tianyou looked around but he didn\u2019t catch the sight of Luo Tianxing and Li Feng, so he asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianxing went to his teacher\u2019s place. As for Li Feng, hei hei, his fianc\u00e9e dragged him away to console.\u201d With a vulgar smile on his face, Lan Yan answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, fianc\u00e9e? That fellow Li Feng is already engaged?\u201d Hearing Lan Yan, Ren Tianyou was surprised and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, big brother Tianyou. His fianc\u00e9e is my 2nd big sister.\u201d Long Luoluo jumped in and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour big sister?\u201d Ren Tianyou was even more surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, It\u2019s this way. Li Feng and my 2nd big sister Long Bingyun know each other from childhood. And their marriage was also set from childhood. I guess in another 2 years, they will hold the marriage ceremony.\u201d Long You explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is like that.\u201d Hearing Long You, Ren Tianyou was somewhat clear. It turned out to be arranged marriage of minors but it seems those 2 are not against this marriage arrangement. And it was obvious that they really loved each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way Tianyou, do you have time 5 days later?\u201d At this time, Lan Yan asked Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201c5 days later? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Hearing Lan Yan, Ren Tianyou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way, 5 days later, our auction house is holding a grand auction. I hope you are interested, at that time you can check out if there is anything you like.\u201d Lan Yan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, auction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the auction of this time is the grand auction which is held by our \u2018Lan Diyin\u2019 auction house once in a year. On the occasion of this auction, nearly all the super power of Divine Wind continent will come to our auction house to attend this auction. Although our auction house always holds a continent-wide grand auction every year, but this is the 1st time this many people are attending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost all of them wanted to attend this auction for a thing, Power of god crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPower of god crystal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, power of god crystal. It is said that, long time ago an expert who had turned into a god died, and by a lucky chance his power of god congealed into a kind of most valuable treasure, that is \u2018power of god crystal\u2019. It is said that within this power of god crystal, there are some insights of that expert. So it is extremely useful for us cultivators. If the god class expert use this \u2018power of god crystal\u2019, then it will increased the probability to comprehend his domain, and advance into true god class powerhouse. The probability is as high as 90%. And there is also a possibility for god class expert to comprehend the insights within it and turn into a god, but I haven\u2019t heard of anyone who had successfully advance and turned into a God. This is only the legend, nevertheless it truly is an undisputable fact among advanced god class experts. Only this ability of \u2018power of god crystal\u2019 to help experts to advance into god class, is enough reason for everyone to long this valuable treasure for day and night. How\u2019s that Tianyou, at that time don\u2019t you want to see all the experts fight with each other for this power of god crystal?\u201d [T.L: here god class is one of the cultivation stage, and in \u2018turned into a god\u2019, god is not the stage of cultivation but actual god. But I don\u2019t know how the god died.]</p><br/><p>But even after Lan Yan cried out for a long period of time, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t answered. They could only see that the face of Ren Tianyou was shaking with excitement as if he caught the sight of something inconceivable.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian You, Tianyou, what happened?\u201d Luo Mengwu was surprised to see Ren Tianyou like that, so she shook his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, eh, it\u2019s nothing. Rest assured, I will also attend the auction at that time.\u201d Ren Tianyou responded. Then he hastily said, \u201cI have something urgent to do, so I will leave first.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou turned around and left quickly before they could question him.</p><br/><p>Luo Meng Wu and others looked at each other in blank dismay. Seeing the quickly disappearing back view of Ren Tianyou, they didn\u2019t know what had happened. \u201cWhat happened to big brother Tianyou?\u201d Long Luoluo said in surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, normally only you girls have \u2018that urgent matter\u2019 for several days in a month. And it looked like his state of mind was unstable, don\u2019t tell me, Tianyou also got infected with that disease?\u201d Lan Yan stroked his lower jaw and said with a vulgar face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrop dead!\u201d Lan Xinmeng and other girls violently kicked Lan Yan with their beautiful legs and send him flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Instantly Lan Yan suffered his retribution.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had hurriedly left that place because he had unexpectedly heard a prompt from the system within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cTriggered mission\u2014\u2014\u2013open mission system: regardless of using any method, seize the power of god crystal, then pour the energy into the system. Mission rewards: open mission system, 30,000 system points, and increase the exchange function of exchange system. Mission fail: forever close mission system. Time limit: 7 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Precisely because of this system prompt, Ren Tianyou had excitedly left, while thinking about plans. Previously this mission system, one may well say, was not shaken by thunder, and regardless of any method it didn\u2019t have any movements. And after he had carefully examined the system, the result he got was lack of core energy of the system, and unable to open. But unexpectedly without doing anything this system actually activated now.</p><br/><p>The reward of this mission was extremely rich. If the mission system was opened, then he would have a new ways to earn system points. But this mission was not easy to accomplish. So many peoples will come to seize this power of god crystal, and with his little bit of gold, it won\u2019t even be enough to call a price once for that crystal. So he had only one way left to get it, i.e. Rob.</p><br/><p>He had to rob it after someone buys it from the auction, as he don\u2019t want to create a trouble for Lan Yan\u2019s family. But the person capable enough to seize the \u2018power of god crystal\u2019 in the auction, would definitely not be a simple person at all. So at that time he must have a great battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

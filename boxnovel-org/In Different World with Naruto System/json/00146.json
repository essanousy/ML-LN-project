The actual strength of these super powers were very deep. For example, about the strength of her Illusory Shrine, everyone only knew the hall master and his 5 powerful subordinates, these 6 god ranked Illusion Gods, but she clearly knew that there were still many God-ranked hidden experts inside Illusory Shrine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy, actually thinking of attacking Ximen clan?\u201d Li Xinyun stared at Ren Tianyou as if she was staring at a big idiot, and she couldn\u2019t even guess why he wanted to attack Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy? Maybe.\u201d Hearing Li Xinyun, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t retort. In the eyes of other people, his action of trying to touch Ximen clan, this type of behemoth clan with only 3 peoples was only courting the death, but was it really like that, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know whether I can completely destroy Ximen clan or not at this time, but I am confident in destroying at least 2/3rd of its force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really that confident?\u201d After hearing the resolute and decisive voice of Ren Tianyou, Li Xinyun lightly asked with curiosity. She didn\u2019t know what was giving him this much confidence, although she clearly knew that the strength of Ren Tianyou was not weak, and the other 2 member of organization were from ancient 100 clans, and their strength were also not weak, but one could say that this level of strength was merely a joke against Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not confidence, rather already planned fact of the future.\u201d Ren Tianyou lightly smiled. Then he lifted his head, and looked towards the sky, his eyes seemed to penetrate the boundless void, and directly looked at situation of Ximen clan of Ailer Empire which was thousands of miles away. \u201cAnd now I only need to make this future fact a present.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, if that is the case, I will also lend you a hand after we get out from here. When the time comes, I will also hurry to Ailer Empire.\u201d Thinking a bit, Li Xinyun also decided to go to Ailer Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also want to go?\u201d Hearing Li Xinyun, Ren Tianyou suddenly paused. He had never intended to let her join this fray, so he said, \u201cWhat sort of joke is this, with your strength of only low-illusion saint, going to Ximen clan is just courting death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what you say, I am also a member of our organization. Since this is the first action of our organization, how can I not participate in this?\u201d Li Xinyun didn\u2019t care about the dangers Ren Tianyou told her. Because the only reason she was living in this world was to kill Ling Yanqi, but she clearly understood that it was impossible to fulfill this aim relaying on Illusory Shrine, and she didn\u2019t know how long it would take for herself to became powerful enough to kill him because when her strength increases, the strength of Ling Yanqi may also increase at that time. And now Ren Tianyou gave her a hope to achieve her aim of killing him, so she would naturally help Ren Tianyou to complete his task. \u201cAnd I do not believe that you will not take care of my safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Since it is like this, after you leave this place, directly hurry over to the imperial capital of Ailer Empire. And go to the 2nd floor of Heavenly fragrance restaurant of that city, White Tiger, Void and I arranged to meet at that place. And after you reach there, meet with White Tiger and Void, and show them your clothing and the ring. After they see your clothing and ring, they will recognize you as a member of Akatsuki.\u201d Thinking a bit, Ren Tianyou agreed to Li Xinyun. When all was said and done, her ability may come in handy at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get out from here now.\u201d After hearing Ren Tianyou, a small transparent bead appeared in her right hand, this was the transfer bead to get out from this place which was to be used when one\u2019s life was in danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going out now? Could it be that you don\u2019t intend to continue the test? You should know that the blood core of the blood beats of this Tower of Babel is very useful to increase your strength. And did you complete your test assignment? If you fail this time, then you have to wait for a year to come here again.\u201d Seeing a transfer bead on her hand, Ren Tianyou asked whether she intend to abandon her test assignment.</p><br/><p>If one fails the test assignment of Tower of Babel, one needs to wait for a year and again had to complete refine with fire assignment, to get the chance to enter this Tower of Babel again. It is so because, although the cultivation environment of the academy was high-end, but it was also impossible for academy to provide unlimited supply, otherwise the academy would not be able to maintain the cost.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I have already found a way to get my revenge, as far as I\u2019m concerned this test is of no point for me. So I don\u2019t want to delay, and hurry over to Ailer Empire without wasting any time. Now I am more worried about whether I can cross two big Empire within 9 days or not.\u201d Li Xinyun was actually frank about it, because she had come to study at the academy to quickly increase her strength so that she could get her revenge by killing Ling Yanqi, but now Ren Tianyou had agreed to help her, so she didn\u2019t intend to waste her time in this place.</p><br/><p>Hearing Li Xinyun, Ren Tianyou was a bit curious about the hatred between her and this Ling Yanqi, in the end what kind of hatred was able to make one give up so many things and made them wanted to take the revenge by any means possible. But since Li Xinyun was unwilling to speak about it, he had also no intention of asking, because he know that even if he ask about it, it was extremely less likely to get an answer, besides he was also not interested to know all the matters of other peoples.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, then its fine, just hurry over to Ailer Empire. I will also immediately rush over there after I handle the matter of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Li Xinyun agreed, then she crushed the transfer bead on her hand. After that a soft silver colored radiance suddenly wrapped the body of Li Xinyun and she disappeared form that place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I need to speed up the things here, I have wasted too much time here.\u201d Seeing that Li Xinyun had already disappeared, Ren Tianyou murmured to himself, then he directly walked over to the small stone platform. After that he took out a card and insert that card inside the groove of that small stone platform. Suddenly golden colored radiances flashed from the stone platform, and 3000 points were added to his card. After that an entrance was opened on the barrier in front of him.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stepped forward, and entered the entrance of this barrier, and along with the white light, he disappeared form the 1st domain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

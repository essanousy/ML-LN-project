Now Akatsuki formally have 3 members, although his organization still needed 7 more members to reach the full 10 members, nevertheless Ren Tianyou believed that very soon he would be able to find suitable candidates to join his organization. After giving the ring to Yan Xinluo, Ren Tianyou gave simple introduction about the rules and objectives of Akatsuki. In addition to that, he also gave the robe of Akatsuki and bamboo hat to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, face paralyzed man, what are you doing here?\u201d Ren Tianyou curiously asked to Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to have a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust in time, we two just came back, and still haven\u2019t eat anything. So let go together to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo agreed. Then seeing Li Jianrong who was carrying 3 swords and wearing the robe of Akatsuki behind Ren Tianyou, he frowned and asked about him. Yan Xinluo could feel a powerful pressure from that guy, and especially that faintly discernable aura on his body, he felt that was not the aura of ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Li Jianrong, and like you, he is also from ancient 100 clan, member of Holy sword clan. Furthermore he is also the owner of our Akatsuki\u2019s White tiger ring.\u201d Ren Tianyou introduced Li Jianrong to Yan Xinluo with a smile. After that he said to Li Jianrong, \u201cWhite tiger, just like I have already stated, he is Void. He is the member of Death God clan, and his name is Yan Xinluo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Li Jianrong walked over, extend his right hand towards Yan Xinluo and greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I didn\u2019t expect that your Holy sword clan also come into this world.\u201d Yan Xinluo deeply looked at Li Jianrong and said with deep lamentation. No wonder he sensed a powerful aura from his body, he turned out to be the member of Holy sword clan. At the same time, he also extend his own right hand and hold the hand of Li Jianrong.</p><br/><p>After both of them held the hand of each other, suddenly a powerful qi wave spread in all direction with both of them as a center. After that both of them gradually released their battle qi, and flowed their battle qi towards their hand. After that a terrifying energy overflowed outside, and apparently, both of them were increasing the power in their hand. At that time, two hands hold their hands of both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we all are already the member of same organization, so we have plenty of time in the future to have a competition. And I think this is not the place for that.\u201d Ren Tianyou gathered powerful chakra in his hands, and use the strange power of Tsunade to forcedly separate their hands.</p><br/><p>After their hands were separated by Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo and Li Jianrong looked at each other with full of fighting intent, after that the battle qi on their body started to slowly weaken and finally disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. First we will go to dormitory to find my other friends, and then we will go to eat.\u201d Ren Tianyou said towards both of them, and continued to walk towards the dormitory of Lan Yan and others. And Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo naturally followed Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Finally they reached the dormitory of Lan Yan and others, and Ren Tianyou met Lan Yan and others there. After meeting with Ren Tianyou, they naturally were extremely happy, and was surprise that Ren Tianyou had completed his task very quickly without any injuries. Towards this, Ren Tianyou just laughed, and gave no explanation. He couldn\u2019t tell that he had used Kamui to travel, so he was able to save a lot of time. Next they went to the dormitory of the girls, and found Lan Xinmeng and others, and walked towards the entrance of academy. En route, Ren Tianyou introduce Li Jianrong to them, and of course, he concealed the matter about the Akatsuki organization while introducing Li Jianrong to them.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Arriving at Fragrance Heaven restaurant, Ren Tianyou and others directly walked to the second floor. There they found an empty seat near the window, and all of them walked over and stay next to each other. After that Ren Tianyou called waiter, and gave menu to Luo Tianxing and others to choose the dishes. And Ren Tianyou directly ordered 30 bottles of Fragrance heaven wine. Ren Tianyou was already carving for this wine for a long time, since the time he had drunk this wine at Eiffle capital, he was always carving for this wine. And now he finally got time to fulfill his carving.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Tianyou, why are you being so generous today? Ordering 30 bottles in one breath, are you not afraid of getting poor?\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had ordered 30 bottles of Fragrance heaven wine at once, Li Feng said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, Tianyou you are rarely this generous.\u201d On the side, Luo Mengwu also covered her mouth and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you are speaking as if I am usually very stingy.\u201d Ren Tianyou gave a supercilious look and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Lan Xinmeng said pretending to be full of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d Looking at the appearance of Lan Xinmeng, Ren Tianyou immediately became speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ren Tianyou was speechless, Luo Tianxing and others immediately laughed heartily. While they were joking and drinking wine, and waiting for the meal they had ordered to come, very quickly Li Jianrong blend into this group. As for Yan Xinluo, no need to speak about this paralyzed face man. While chatting, Ren Tianyou also talked about his journey, naturally they cried out in alarm when they heard the adventure of Ren Tianyou, and asked many questions. Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t mentioned several things, and with the exception of those things, he explained other things in details.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Very quickly the meals they had ordered arrived, and many staffs of Fragrance heaven restaurant serve the dishes in succession.</p><br/><p>After that Ren Tianyou stood up, raised his wine cup, looked towards Luo Tianxing and others and said, \u201cTianxing, Luoluo, Mengwu, Longyou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. You can say that you all are the 1st friend of I, Ren Tianyou in this world, before I met you all, I\u2019ve been confused, also a bit overwhelmed, but after I met you all, I really felt very happy, I thank you very much for your help. I will not say may grateful words, all the words are inside this cup of wine, and I offer this wine to you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou don\u2019t say that, in fact, after knowing you, we are also very happy. We\u2019re extremely happy to have a friend like you.\u201d Long You and other hastily stood up, and Long You seriously said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, you don\u2019t need to say anything, let\u2019s just have a cup of wine, cheers.\u201d Luo Tianxing also raised his right hand which was holding the cup of wine towards Ren Tianyou and said.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cCheers!\u201d\u201d\u201dLan Yan and others also lifted the cup of wine, even Long Luoluo, this little beauty also raised the cup of wine with her little hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d Seeing that Lan Yan and others had lifted up the cup of wine, Ren Tianyou suddenly felt a kind of excitement inside his heart which couldn\u2019t be describe with words. He also raised his cup of wine with his hand and said loudly. Finished speaking, he take the initiative and drain the cup of wine in one gulp. Lan Yan and others also simultaneously drank their wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cXinluo, Jianrong, I offer you this cup of wine, although we know each other for only short period of time, nevertheless I, Ren Tianyou sincerely hope to keep going, and accomplish out common wish.\u201d After drinking first cup of wine, Ren Tianyou poured another cup of wine by himself, and said to Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will absolutely accompany you until the end.\u201d Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo also stood up and lift their cup of wine and said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s eat now.\u201d After drinking wine, Ren Tianyou sat down and said. After that everyone started to eat.</p><br/><p>In just this fashion, Ren Tianyou and others ate their meal. Joking, chatting with one another, the atmosphere of dinner was very pleasant. But the following words of Lan Yan immediately struck the heart of Ren Tianyou just like a bolt of lightning. And his complexion had a huge change all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know? The eldest son of Ximen clan of Ailer Empire, Ximen Feng and the daughter of Wang clan, Wang Yuxin are going to marry after 10 days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Just after Lan Yan had finished speaking, the cup of wine in the hand of Ren Tianyou fell on the floor and broke into pieces.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

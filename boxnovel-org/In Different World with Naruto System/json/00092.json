Although Ryusa Bakuryu (Sand Tsunami) was difficult to deal with, nevertheless currently he was dealing with 2 God-ranked experts, so it alone wasn\u2019t quite enough to defeat them.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ren Tianyou suddenly heard a sound above his head. So without even thinking, Ren Tianyou quickly jumped to the right side to dodge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong long!\u201d An explosion sound rang out. The gold colored battle qi energy hit the place where Ren Tianyou was standing just a moment ago, and a deep hole suddenly appeared on that surface of ground. At the same time, a huge water spear was suddenly shot out from the bottom of desert, and shot towards airborne Ren Tianyou in a high speed.</p><br/><p>Seeing water spear advancing towards him in a high speed, a light flashed in the eyes of Ren Tianyou. The attack was advancing towards him exactly when he was airborne to dodge the previous attack, now due to him being airborne he was unable to dodge this attack, one may as well say that this attack was precise to extreme. Now battling with God-ranked expert, he knew that they not only excel in strength, but their battle experience was also extremely high. As they had to pass thorough innumerable life and death battle to reach God-rank, and as for those lucky fellow who reached God-ranked without much effort, they were only part of small minority.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure enough, it really is difficult to deal with them, but you are underestimating me, Ren Tianyou too much.\u201d Looking at the Water spear which was advancing quickly towards him, Ren Tianyou made a hand seals quickly. Just after Ren Tianyou had finished making the hand seals, that water spear also hit him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess.\u201d Seeing that the water spear had hit Ren Tianyou, landing on the ground, Ximen Shu exposed a joyful smile on his face. But before he could finish smiling, Ren Tianyou who was hit in the sky suddenly turned into a log and that log dropped on the ground. And furthermore the figure of Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing this circumstance, the expression of Ximen Shu was as if he had seen something unthinkable, he didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and how could a living person change into a piece of broken wood.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ximen Shu clearly heard a sound coming through his right side, then he immediately waved the huge sword in his right hand. \u2018Ding!\u2019 a sound of metal collision was heard, and he saw a thin needle like thing had hit his weapon, then with the pull of string, that thin needle retreated back, and a hand wearing a glove appeared out of thin air and caught this needle. Carefully looking, if this was not Ren Tianyou then who could it be.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still not coming out?\u201d Catching the Nuibari (Needle Sword), Ren Tianyou turned his head towards the desert he created, then looking towards it, he sneered and slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou spoke, the sands in the middle of desert suddenly issued a round of wriggling sound, then a pothole appeared at that place, after that a huge water ball suddenly shot out from inside it, and floated in the air. Inside the water ball there were Ximen Xinbo and others who were swallowed by the sand waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect Your Excellency actually possessed sand control special system magic arts, but did Your Excellency really believed that can wipe us out?\u201d Floating in the air, Ximen Xinbo looked at Ren Tianyou and asked in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>Special system, not among 7 great common element of continent, it is even more difficult to deal with compared to power of 7 great common element, so they couldn\u2019t help but become even more serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, want to test to understand clearly whether or not it can wipe you out?\u201d Hearing Ximen Xinbo, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t deny and also didn\u2019t affirm.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber two, no need to speak superfluous words with him, apparently toady is not good.\u201d Ximen Shu flew in the sky and arrived to the side of Ximen Xinbo and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this case, we are forced to use this method.\u201d Ximen Xinbo replied, then turned around and said to two of the five Saint-ranked bodyguards, \u201cYou two protect the juniors of our clan, and keep them safe.

Then under the control of these 3 Saint-ranked experts, this energy dragon advance towards desert palms.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dragon origin war formation\u2019 was a war formation passed down in Ximen clan. This formation could combine the energy of several people and display a powerful energy attack, could be used for both attack and defense, but it requires at least 3 people and at most only 5 people could use this formation. Therefore this formation was \u2018compulsory to learn\u2019 secret warrior skill of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>This energy dragon destroyed the remaining 3 sand palms just like a hot knife through the butter. Then directly advanced towards the direction of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cExtremely capable.\u201d Seeing his ninjutsu was directly destroyed, Ren Tianyou laughed, then immediately jumped in the air to dodge, simultaneously his right hand entered inside the ninja backpack on his right leg and took out several kunai.

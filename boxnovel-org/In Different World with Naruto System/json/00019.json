Actually, he was not worried all whether these 3 Rashomon could withstand her attack or not, as he already knew that in Naruto world, Orochimaru had used this jutsu to withstand the powerful attack of Naruto who was in tail beast mode. Although Naruto had only released 4 tails, but the power of the Kyubi should not to be underestimated. So he had full confidence in these 3 Rashomon.</p><br/><p>He saw that the huge black light beam had hit the 1st Rashomon gate after a brief resistance the 1st gate broke and the black light beam headed towards the 2nd gate. With its power greatly reduced , the black light beam hit the 2nd gate and could only create a small crack before it disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ..!?\u201d</p><br/><p>With the black sword in her hand, that young lady was gasping for air and her face was full of indescribable fear towards the strange gates which had obstructed her attack. To her surprise, her \u2018Dark annihilation slash\u2019 had merely destroyed the1st gate and before it could break the 2nd gate its energy was already consumed, what the hell is this?Furthermore she had never seen a skill surrounded by that kind of deathly aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew!\u201d Seeing that the attack of that young girl was stopped, he vanished and reappeared on top of the Rashomon gate, and stared at the female.</p><br/><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t wish to ruin a flower like you, as long as you tell me why you were monitoring me outside my place , I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d He said after staring at that girl for a while. Simultaneously he was also pondering in his heart \u2018who his enemy could be ,except for duel with the son of the Tian clan, he hadn\u2019t made any other enemies. But the the Tian clan is situated fairly far away, at the imperial capital, even if the master of the Tian clan knew that his son had an accident, it would be impossible for the people who were assigned, to arrive here this soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph. If you want to know, then defeat me first. The winner is not determined yet.\u201d Hearing the question of Ren Tianyou, she responded with scorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I have to find the answer myself. Although I hate to fight with women, I hate trouble even more. So I would like to evade it by cutting off the trouble at its origin. I\u2019m terribly sorry, your actions gave me a hunch that if I let you escape here alive, I will be plagued by quite a lot of trouble. So I have no alternative but to eliminate you.\u201d Knowing that the girl didn\u2019t have any intention to comply with him, he had no choice but to unleash his killer moves, and if possible capture her and using his illusions to acquire the information he required.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014Goka Mekkyaku! [Fire Style\u2014Majestic Destroyer Flame!]\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou quickly formed hand seals, after that he took a deep breath in one , then facing the female, he spit out numerous flames. This fire encompassed a broad range of more than 100 meters in front of him.</p><br/><p>Fire Style\u2014Majestic Destroyer Flame, formerly this was the wide range fire style jutsu which was first utilized by Madara against the ninjas of the allied forces, to resist this jutsu, more than 20 water element ninja had to use the water screen jutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026!?\u201d The face of that girl was filled with terror, watching the vast flames advancing in her direction. She realized that this was not the time to be in a stupor, and she had to immediately figure out how to resist this fire magic.</p><br/><p>The girl landed, both of her hands firmly gripping her sword, stabbing it into the ground, she started to chant. Along with the chant.A tremendous amount of dark fog gathered around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDark guardian.\u201d Along with the roar of that female, the tremendous black fog formed into the shape of a 30 meter tall protective screen in front of her, which blocked the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Just when she released a sigh of relief, a bright gleam had reached her. Inside her heart she was awed and shocked. Without thinking, she dodged to the side. After that she stood up and saw that there was an odd hidden weapon stuck into the ground where she was just standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cClose call\u2026\u201d The girl released a long sigh of relief inside of her heart and simultaneously cursed Ren Tianyou, for suddenly using that hidden weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, you fell into my trap!\u201d Seeing that the female had dodged his sneak attack, Ren Tianyou sneered. He pointed at the ground where the female was standing with his right hand and clutched his hand. After that an endless amount of sand sprung out of the ground and gradually spread around her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSand Coffin!\u201d Ren Tianyou finally trapped her, he snapped his fingers, jumped from the Rashomon and walked towards her. The female had not noticed that behind the Rashomon, another Ren Tianyou turned into smoke and disappeared.</p><br/><p>After he saw that she had landed on the ground, taking the advantage of the time when she was confronting his flame jutsu, he had formed a shadow clone and hid it behind the Rashomon, and let that shadow clone summon sand around her.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t summon the sand directly where she was standing, to not raise her suspicion. And when she had just repelled his fire attack, he used a kunai for a surprise attack. Sure enough, she didn\u2019t have the sword as she had stuck it into the ground to repel his flame attack and could not block it, so she dodged by moving right into his trap.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Looking at the sudden appearance of the vast amount of sand wrapping her body, she was utterly baffled as she had never thought that Ren Tianyou could even control sand. Seeing that he was nearing her, she ground her teeth, and used her final plan. Above the ring of her right hand a black light flashed, and a scroll appeared in her right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back!!!\u201d She said with a cold voice, following that she immediately crushed the scroll. An invisible fluctuation of space became visible and a short moment later she vanished. The sand which was enveloping her lost its target and showered down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d Seeing the action of hers, he cried out in alarm and directly charged forwards but he was too late as she had already vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, unexpectedly it was space transmission scroll.\u201d Ren Tian You cursed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And along with a huge explosion, their body were immediately sent flying.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, Amike jumped down from the top of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast\u2019s head, then rushed towards Ichibi and Sanbi</p><br/><p>And the Baleful Heaven Demon Blade in the right hand of Amike glimmered with a demonic light which would make the heart of people palpitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Killing Six Secrets\u2014Fourth Form\u2014-Breaking Down the Heaven!\u201d Along with the voice of Amike, Baleful Heaven Demon Blade suddenly flew out from his hand, then slashed out towards Ichibi and Sanbi.</p><br/><p>The falling speed of this huge sword slash was not fast, but strength however was incomparably powerful, as even the space underneath this falling blade was cracking. It seems the space itself was being cut into pieces by this blade slash.</p><br/><p>One might well say this move was one of the strongest attack of Amike.</p><br/><p>And seeing this huge blade slash falling down, Sukaku immediately gathered chakra, then manipulating the sands, he created a huge shield in front. This precisely was Saiko Zettai Bogyo\u2014-Shukaku no Tate! (Ultimate Defense\u2014-Shukaku\u2019s Shield!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak for me!\u201d Seeing that huge sand shield, Amike roared loudly. And that huge blade slash landed on the Shukaku\u2019s shield, but it was immediately cut through. After cutting through the Shukaku\u2019s shield, that slash continued to advance towards Ichibi and Sanbi.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, there was no such thing as absolute defense in this world. Even Full Body Susanoo of Uchiha Madara was broken through by Senju Hasirama, let alone this Shukaku\u2019s Shield. In case the attack power was sufficiently strong enough, there was no defense in the world that couldn\u2019t be broken through.</p><br/><p>This blade slash landed on Sanbi first. The Susanoo armor which was surrounding the entire body of Sanbi immediately give rise to purple ash colored lightning light. And this flickering lightning sparks firmly stopped this blade slash.</p><br/><p>But although the attack was blocked, the Susanoo armor surrounding the body of Sanbi become dim as if it would disappear at any time.</p><br/><p>When all is said and done, Ren Tianyou on the top of Sanbi\u2019s head was merely a clone, so its strength was merely one-tenth of real body.</p><br/><p>And at this time, the wood clone on the head of Shukaku immediately manipulated the Susanoo to brandish Futsu no Mitama Sword to send out a huge sword slash towards Amike.</p><br/><p>\u201cDang!\u201d A metal colliding sound resounded. Amike had used Baleful Heaven Demon Blade to block sword slash of Ren Tianyou, but the impact force still sent him flying.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, Matatabi and Son landed on the ground. Even after receiving their own reflected attack, they didn\u2019t suffer any big wounds, but other than Son, the Susanoo armor around the body of Matatabi had become somewhat dim.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough my clones can also obtain chakra from tailed-beasts, but there is no way to replenish my eye power!\u201d Looking at other three tailed-beasts, Ren Tianyou who was standing on the head of Son thought inwardly, \u201cFurthermore although these four tailed beasts have large chakra reserve, but when all is said and done, they don\u2019t possess endless amount of chakra like kyuubi. As a result after continuously supporting my four Full Body Susanoo to fight, their chakra might be consumed a lot faster than usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou made a plan, then made three cones to lead three tailed-beasts beside Son.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot go on like this, although the fighting capacity of four is stronger, but this won\u2019t last long, as my eye power and your chakra is also consuming very rapidly.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked towards the four tailed-beasts and said, then looking towards Amike standing on the head of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, he added, \u201cSo we might as well combine our power and use one strongest attack to directly finish off our opponent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou four concentrate together and use strongest bijudama, and at that time I will also add my Susanoo\u2019s power in that bijudama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd after we finish attacking, all of you immediately leave this place. Although your attack power is very powerful, but your defense however is a bit insufficient, so it\u2019s better for you all to return back, and let me wind up this battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut little You, this fellow is very strong, so won\u2019 t there be a problem with only you?\u201d Hearing the plan of Ren Tianyou, Son a little bit worriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all can rest assured, it is not certain that they might survive our strongest combined attack. Even if they did survive, under our all-out attack, I don\u2019t think they can escape unscathed even with their very strong strength.\u201d Looking at Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, Ren Tianyou sneered and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have already decided, then we will move according to your plan.\u201d Nibi glanced at Ren Tianyou, then said.</p><br/><p>After that four tailed-beasts simultaneously half-squatted, faced upward, and opened their mouth. After that huge amount of chakra gathered above their mouth, forming a huge chakra energy ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere I go too.\u201d Seeing tailed-beasts were in the process of gathering the energy, the eyes of Ren Tianyou shone. After that the huge amount of eye power poured out from the Sahringan of Ren Tianyou and his three clones simultaneously, and the energy of Susanoo was poured into the bijudama from Futsu no Mitama Sword. This moment in the middle of this bijudama formed by the gathering of four tailed-beasts\u2019 huge amount of chakra, a huge lightning sword blade formed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevouring Heaven, it seems this time it will be difficult for us to resist.\u201d Seeing that huge bijudama as well as sensing that powerful energy as if it contains might to even destroy space itself, Amike made a wry smile and said to Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will try my best.\u201d Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast solemnly said. After that taking a deep breathe, it slowly gathered all of his energy in its wide open mouth, then a huge space black hole came out from its mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll also help you.\u201d Amike retracted Baleful Heaven Demon Blade, then poured all the energy within his body into the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast. After Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast received the energy of Amike, the area of that space black hole become even larger.</p><br/><p>Amike was betting everything on Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, because although his attack power was very strong, but in terms of defense, he was lacking. As a result with regarding to the combined attack of Ren Tianyou and four tailed-beasts, he didn\u2019t have any confidence to block on his own. Furthermore he was sealed within the ninth floor of Tower of Babel, and this ninth floor was not that big place, so he didn\u2019t have any choice to run away too.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, bijudama was slowly forming under the energy of four tailed-beasts and Ren Tianyou. This bijudama was oval\u2013shaped, and there was huge energy sword blade stuck into it in the middle. And right now the Susanoo armor and the clones of Ren Tianyou had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>This was because all the energy of his clones were used up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBijudama!\u201d All four tailed-beasts simultaneously roared, then this huge bijudama suddenly shot towards Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven beast as if the arrow that had left the bowstring.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevouring Heaven\u2019s Domain!\u201d</p><br/><p>The preparation of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven beast\u2019s space magic was also already complete. Right now very large black hole had appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>Final collision was about to begin!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

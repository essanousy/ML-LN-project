And along with the move of Yue\u2019er, white colored dusts slowly emerged on the surface of his body, and his two eyes also opened slowly.</p><br/><p>After this middle-aged man walked out of coffin, he looked all around in confusion, then clenching his hand into fists and feeling he could move about his body, he muttered, \u201cWhere is this? Shouldn\u2019t I be already dead? What the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have indeed already died, merely I resurrected you.\u201d Looking at this middle-aged person in front, Yue\u2019er said. From the explanation of Ren Tianyou, she knew that this middle-aged person in front was a very dangerous figure, and at his time, even demons were greatly afraid of him. Moreover because this fellow was a person without moral standard and handled affairs according to his one feeling, finally, he was personally executed by contemporary Demon Empress i.e. Yaorao, so he had notorious reputation in Demon World.</p><br/><p>The name of this fellow was Aierke, was one of the early three Great Demon God, Shadow Demon God, and was the younger brother of Dark Night Demon God. Moreover this fellow was downright assassin.</p><br/><p>He loved to move at night, and lurking in the shadows, when enemy was in most relaxed state, he would gave them a fatal blow. In his time, countless experts had died in his hand. Moreover he had once tried to assassinate Demon Empress Yaorao, although was not successful, but relying on his that remarkable assassinating means, he successfully injured her, this shows, the how dangerous this fellow was.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You all are human?\u201d Hearing the voice of Yue\u2019er, Aierke slowly sized up Yue\u2019er and others, then said: \u201cPretty good strength, so young yet already peak God King and True God realm in strength, furthermore you, little girl is strangest, even I actually can\u2019t see through your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that Aierke who was once known as Shadow Demon God can actually praise people.\u201d Yue\u2019er indifferently said, but her eyes were continuously fixed on Aierke, while maintaining the position of putting the palms together, so she can act at any time. After all this fellow in front of her was too dangerous, and she couldn\u2019t afford to be careless. As Demon God, he dared to try and assassinate Demon Empress, this shows his madness level.</p><br/><p>So once this fellow in front make even a slightest movement, then she would immediately bind him, thoroughly sealing his consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had no idea that my name would unexpectedly still be preserved, it seems Yaorao, that little lass\u2019s magnanimity however is a little outside my expectation.\u201d Hearing Yue\u2019er, Aierke unhurriedly thought, then asked to Yue\u2019er and other people in front of him, \u201cTell me, why on earth did you, humans resurrected me with this kind of special method? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple reason like you all resurrected me just to accompany you all to chat like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we want you to go and assassinate a number people of Demon clan.\u201d White Tiger Li Jianrong stepped forward, and said directly coming to the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cAssassinate Demon clan?\u201d Hearing White Tiger, Aierke dazed, then with mocking smile on his face, he said to White Tiger and other in disdain, \u201cAre you all an idiots? Want me to go and assassinate my own clansmen? I think you all are mistaken about me, I myself am a person of Demon clan, and you want me to go and kill my clansmen, this truly is as large as the heavens joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I, Aierke don\u2019t like a number of people of Demon clan, moreover I end up dying in the hand of my own Demon Empress, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will go and assassinate those innocent clansmen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever expected you to be so righteous. Now that this is the case, I have no choice.\u201d Hearing Aierke, Yue\u2019er sneered, then she changed her hand seals. Immediately after that, the body of Aierke shook, and his consciousness gradually disappeared. Now he was thoroughly under the control of Yue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you!\u201d White Tiger also sneered, then said to Jade Maiden Li Xinyun, \u201cJade Maiden, leave a mirror seed in his fellow\u2019s body, and let\u2019s see a good play together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Jade Maiden nodded her head, then walking to the front of Aierke, her body emitted a white colored radiance which gathered in her right hand, forming a white colored bead. After that Jade Maiden shoot this bead into the body of Aierke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s done.\u201d Seeing her surveillance seed had already entered into the body of Aierke, Jade Maiden said to White Tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, Yue\u2019er, begin the operation. Use this pawn to thoroughly dye the camp of Demon clan red tonight.\u201d White Tiger nodded his head, then said to Yue\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Hearing White Tiger, Yue\u2019er directly sat cross-legged, then began controlling Aierke. A black colored demonic light appeared around the body of Aierke, this his body slowly disappeared in the night.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, Jade Maiden also activated her blood lineage power, then linking up with the seed within the body of Aierke, a huge white colored light mirror appeared in front of them, and inside this mirror appeared the scene of Aierke and his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Aierke rushed towards the campsite of Demon clan at full speed, with dark colored demonic light emitting from his body. This demonic light slowly absorbed the dark element of surroundings, making him completely blend with the surrounding dark night.</p><br/><p>More than 10 minutes later, Aierke arrived in front of the campsite of demon soldiers. Demon clan had used earth magic to form a large-scale mountain stronghold kind of village with earthen city wall was all around this village, but these city wall didn\u2019t have any guards at all. That was became there was a barrier above the city wall. This barrier encircled the entire campsite of Demon clan, but this barrier didn\u2019t have any defensive ability, rather had strong perceiving ability.</p><br/><p>This barrier could perceive everything including living and inanimate things that passes or touch this barrier. If anything was discovered, then it would immediately locate them, giving them nowhere to run.</p><br/><p>But this barrier had no effect on this King of Assassin.</p><br/><p>Aierke concealed within the night, walked to the front of city gate, then his body slowly shrunk, and finally disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? How did this fellow disappeared?\u201d Seeing Aierke disappeared, Little Yu curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has not disappeared in real, rather he has entered inside the shadow.\u201d Yue\u2019er slowly introduced, \u201cThis fellow can enter into any shadow and move. This is his very rare ability I am using to sneak into the campsite of Demon clan from the crack between the barrier and city wall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Yue\u2019er, the body of Aierke slowly became visible within the campsite of Demon clan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did I mishear you?\u201d Ren Tianyou scooped his ears, trying to prove that he had not heard wrongly. Did this Feng Yunmeng take wrong medicine today, actually taking the initiative to deliver expert to him.</p><br/><p>You should know that with regarding to the matter of Ren Tianyou kidnapping her daughter, and making her join his organization, the complexion of Feng Yunmeng had become extremely unsightly. Then when she knew that her daughter had accompanied him to attack Ximen clan, the unsightly complexion of Feng Yunmeng had turned green on the spot, her gaze nearly spout fire, and looked as if she would chop him at any time with her sword.</p><br/><p>But now she however was taking the initiative to deliver an expert to him. So how could this matter not cause Ren Tianyou to think this was merely a beautiful daydream?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, aunt, how can you let me join any organization, moreover what\u2019s the use.\u201d Di Qingyu also confusedly said. He didn\u2019t understand what his aunt was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingyu, don\u2019t say anything, you only need to know your aunt is doing this for your best.\u201d Looking at Di Qingyu at her side, Feng Yunmeng softly said, then turning around her head and looking over to Ren Tianyou, \u201cWell boy, about this matter, will you agree or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, naturally agree, you are delivering an expert to my doorsteps, so why won\u2019t I agree.\u201d The strength of this youth had already reached High level God rank, and currently his organization was eagerly seeking after men of worth and ability, so Ren Tianyou naturally agreed without slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tianyou was also well aware that Feng Yunmeng definitely must have some kind of intention for letting this youth join his organization, but at least she was very unlikely to have any ill intention towards his organization, because when all is said and done her daughter Vermilion Bird was also part of hiss organization.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, now why don\u2019t you go out first, I have a matter to talk with Qingyu.\u201dAfter hearing the answer of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, and began walking towards outside. When he walked two steps, he suddenly remembered a matter he had forgotten, so turning around, he said, \u201cVilla Mistress Feng, I have already brought Spring of Life. So about the matter regarding the resurrection of my elder sister Yue\u2019er\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will begin preparations first, and we can begin the resurrection ritual tomorrow.\u201d When Jade Maiden and others had returned back, Feng Yunmeng had already learned about the information that Ren Tianyou had already successfully obtained Spring of Life, so was not too surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen at that time I will trouble you Villa Mistress Feng.\u201d Ren Tianyou cupped his hand and slightly bowed, then directly turned around and walked out to backyard, entering the lobby.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Zero, how come you are coming out from inside?\u201d Inside lobby, keen-eyed White Tiger saw Ren Tianyou coming out from inside the hall, so he confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I used space magic to first arrive at behind hall and talked with Villa Mistress Feng about the matter of resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er.\u201d Hearing White Tiger, Ren Tianyou touch his head and awkwardly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Zero, why is your body scarred everywhere?\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou as if he had received severe injuries, Jade Maiden confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes that\u2019s right, idiot, why are you so heavily injured ah?\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou was injured, Wang Yuxin threw herself into the bosom of Ren Tianyou with red eyes. Then carefully size up his body as if she wanted to examine his injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cSi\u2026\u2026..\u201d Ren Tianyou immediately hissed, and with the muscles of his face unceasingly twitching, and cold sweats streaming down his cheeks, he felt waves of pain all over his body which nearly made him lose his consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle\u2026..Little Yu, you first\u2026\u2026\u2026first stand back, your bumping is going to kill me.\u201d Looking at Little Yuxin in his bosom, Ren Tianyou revealed an unsightly smile with great difficulty, then stutteringly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, idiot, are you alright?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, and seeing his unceasingly twitching body, Little Yu cried out in alarm, and immediately fell back few steps, then asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured, it\u2019s not a big deal, merely when I was chasing Bu Feng, I used forbidden move to forcedly increase my speed. So this is merely the side effect of that forbidden move. I will be fine after I take a rest for a while.\u201d Ren Tianyou forcedly calmed down his mind. Seeing the worried expression in the face of everyone, a warmth rose in his heart, as he slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurned out to be so, I\u2019m glad you are fine.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Little Yu slightly felt relieved.</p><br/><p>After everyone calmed down, Ren Tianyou began to narrate the matter he had encountered in Elven forest in simple version. When he mentioned Spring of Life, the space ring in his right hand flashed with blue light, then several small bottles with green colored liquid inside it appeared in his hand, \u201cThese are Spring of Life, wait until you return to your room before take this. After you absorb the energy inside it, not only can it increase your strength and lifespan, it can also make you stay young forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I want, quickly give me.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the eyes of Vermilion Bird, Jade maiden furthermore Little Yu suddenly emitted wolf light, and firmly stare at him. For women especially for beautiful women, staying young forever was too tempting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI give\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the expression in the eyes of three women, Ren Tianyou suddenly shivered, and before he could finish speaking, three women had already arrived in front of him, then they directly snatched Spring of Life from the hand of Ren Tianyou. Moreover Vermilion Bird accidently kicked him to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026..!\u201d Instantly a blood-curdling scream reverberated through entire lobby. And now Ren Tinyou was lying on the ground, unceasingly twitching, and foam unceasingly flowing out from his mouth. It was too miserable sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cE\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing the miserable condition of Ren Tianyou, black lines suddenly appeared on the face of both White Tiger and Void, still Void who had good heart, walked to the side of Ren Tianyou, then supported him to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, what was that sound just now?\u201d Just then, Feng Yunmeng and Di Qingyu came over, then asked confusedly. That screaming voice of just a moment ago made her think of the sound pigs give out before getting butchered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing, nothing at all.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his hand and hastily said. Such losing face matter, how could he be willing to speak about it. Afterwards he looked towards Di Qingyu, and said, \u201cWell, do you agree to join my organization?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI Agree.\u201d Di Qingyu walked over and said with determination in his voice. Nobody knew what Feng Yunmeng had told him just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen good, since you agreed, I grant you the codename \u2018Great Bear (North Dipper) of Akatsuki\u2019!\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then took out Great Bear ring and robe of Akatsuki and hand them over to Di Qingyu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What are these things? Could it be that these things are needed for resurrection?\u201d Ren Tianyou doubtfully asked. Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t notice the change in Void\u2019s expression when the Revenant stone was mentioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think reviving people was an easy thing to do?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng grumpily gave a supercilious look, then slowly explained to Ren Tianyou and the others, \u201cReviving people is completely going against the law of heaven and earth. First the soul of the person must be recalled from death domain, then the life-force must be restored into an already deceased mortal body, restoring this dead mortal body to its original living state. Finally after that, using a type of special power to return the soul back into the human body and let them merge, successfully reviving that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut wanting to fulfill these conditions is easier said than done, even the first step is just as hard as ascending the heavens.\u201d Speaking up to here Feng Yunmeng sighed, then continued, \u201cDeath domain is a special plane, where the souls of the deceased gather. This is not only for our Divine Wind continent, but the same for other planes too. So anything that possesses flesh is basically unable to survive in this death domain. The environment of that place is suitable for the existence of the soul only.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, recalling the soul from this Death domain is easier said than done. First we basically don\u2019t have enough strength to break through and enter the Death domain. Secondly, even if we use special means to enter Death domain, not to mention that the surrounding of that plane is basically unsuitable for us to exist in, just finding a particular soul of a person in that vast Death domain is simply like trying to find a needle in a haystack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard up to here, the complexion of Ren Tianyou slowly sank, he had never though that the resurrection of a person was this difficult. Feng Yunmeng was absolutely right, he was powerless to accomplish even the first step with his current strength.</p><br/><p>And he thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many years it would take for me to be able to awaken my Rinnegan, so could it be that I really have to learn Edo Tensei (Reanimation Jutsu), then resurrect elder sister Yue\u2019er, but if I resurrect her like this, she would basically turn into neither dead nor alive zombie. This move should be used on enemies, not on my own close ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the next explanation of Feng Yunmeng ignited the hope of Ren Tianyou once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever although this matter can\u2019t be accomplished by ordinary means, but there is one thing that can help us to accomplish it. That thing I mentioned before the Revenant stone.\u201d Seeing the dejected expression of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng didn\u2019t torment him, and said the method directly. As expected, after hearing Feng Yunmeng, the eyes of Ren Tianyou immediately lit up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Revenant stone is the most valuable treasure passed down within the Death clan of the Divine Wind continent. Legends say that, because of their special blood lineage \u2018Heart Death\u2019, the Death clan possesses an innate ability to communicate with Death domain. And in the past years, Revenant Stone was bestowed to the Death clan by the Master of Death Domain\u2014\u2013the Death God himself, and were simultaneously bestowed a special spell\u2014\u2014Revive magic spell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people of Death clan can use the blood of the deceased and drop it on the Revenant stone, then use their special Undead battle Qi and chant the Revive magic spell. Only after that the barrier of Death Domain would directly open, and the owner of that drop of blood\u2019s soul would be summoned back into this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut only those guys of Death clan have the ability to use this Revenant stone, so even if you were somehow able to acquire the Revenant stone, you also need to find a member of Death clan who would be willing to cooperate.\u201d When she spoke up to here, Feng Yunmeng suddenly found that Ren Tianyou\u2019s complexion was very brilliant, as it seemed shocked, happy, doubtful\u2026and so on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, boy! What\u2019s going on with you? Did you hear what I said?\u201d Seeing the foolish look of Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng immediately gathered Qi and yelled loudly into the ears of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Ren Tianyou felt as if his ears exploded, and his ears turned deaf for a moment, then rubbing his ears, Ren Tianyou snapped from his daze, then without telling her about Void, he urged her to continue, \u201cAh, I\u2019m fine, Villa Mistress Feng, please continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second step of resurrection is restoring the life-force of the deceased\u2019s mortal body. Since after the death of a person, the body gives rise to a type of special death-force. This death\u2013force slowly swallows the remaining life-force of the deceased\u2019s mortal body. Even if you use a special method to take care of the mortal body, it\u2019s useless, because this is the law of Heaven and Earth, so there are no other ways.\u201d After taking a quick look at Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng didn\u2019t bother with him, rather continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd once this death-force completely swallows the remaining life-force, the deceased is basically impossible to resurrect, because the instant the deceased is revived, then their soul would be immediately devoured by that death-force, leaving nothing behind. After that there will be no method to revive that deceased person ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd to expel that death-force, the second thing I mentioned earlier is needed\u2014- Spring of Life\u2019s spring water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpring of Life, is the most valuable treasure of one of the ancient one hundred clans, Elven clan\u2019s. It has the ability to completely heal injuries very quickly. Even if you are injured very heavily, if you drink from this Spring of Life, then all the injuries will be healed rapidly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpring of Life possesses an extremely strong life-force. After drinking it, it still could increase the life span of people. Legend says that, a small bottle of Spring of Life could make people maintain a youthful appearance for more than five hundred years. But every year the Spring of Life gives birth to spring water, which is enough to fill only a small medicine bottle. This shows the preciousness of the Spring of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose elves hold this Spring of Life more dearly than even their own lives, so wanting to obtain this Spring of Life as an outsider is very, very difficult. Legends say that until now, only very few people were able to get the Spring of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose peoples of the elven clan are one of the most ancient one hundred clans, their strength is also very high. They possess High-Saint ranked Nature blood lineage, innately possess the ability to control plants, ability to communicate with plants, and furthermore could use special nature magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you gather these things, I will help you in the final step of resurrection by igniting Fire of life and reviving them, however that is on the premise that you can get these things first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I will not help you in getting any of these things. So your primary task is to collect the things I mentioned.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou, Feng Yunmeng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured senior, I will absolutely gather all of those things and place them before you.\u201d Ren Tianyou said with a determined face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Right now his body was glimmering with green radiance, and one could sense particularly fresh aura and strong life-force in this green radiance. And on his forehead, a green colored six edged star mark had appeared indistinctly. Furthermore in the originally barren cave, unexpectedly several small saplings slowly broke out from the ground, which added a life aura inside this barren cave,</p><br/><p>At that time, as if whale swallowing water, this green colored powerful life-force instantly enter inside the body of Ren Tianyou and disappeared. And after that, Ren Tianyou snapped open his eyes. And this moment, that mysterious pattern in his eyes were unceasingly spinning, giving people a kind of mysterious feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect this time I unexpectedly gained profit from a disaster. Now I have actually already refined roughly half of the life-force of Forever Green. Finally my wood style can also be counted as real Secret Wood Style, and can gradually show the might of First Hokage Senju Hasirama\u2019s Wood Style.\u201d Feeling the changed within his body, Ren Tianyou excitedly though inwardly. Previously, the wood style used by Ren Tianyou could be counted as merely pseudo wood style, otherwise how could this wood style which Senju Hasirama relied to suppress that time\u2019s chaotic times of ninja world, and got respectfully addressed as God of Ninja by people of ninja world be that weak. Moreover relying on this wood style when he fought against Madara and Kyuubi in Iso\u2013Susanoo (Majestic Attire\u2014Susanoo), he sealed kyuubi, and defeated Uchiha Madara. This clearly shows the true might of wood style.</p><br/><p>But previously when Ren Tianyou used wood style, even Mid-God King realm Dragon Emperor was able to break it open, this was not because the power of wood style was weak in this world, rather the strength of Ren Tainyou was too weak. Previously the strength of wood style used by Ren Tianyou was not even one-quarter of the strength of wood style used by Senju Hasirama.</p><br/><p>But now, because he was up against life and death imperil, he was able to squeeze out his potential in that life and death situation, and was able to refine roughly half of the power of Forever Green, so now he could display nearly two-third of Senju Hasirama\u2019s strength at his most flourishing time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the basis of this evaluation, after I completely refine this Forever Green, the strength of my wood style will basically exceed Senju Hasirama\u2019s.\u201d Ren Tianyou inwardly estimated, \u201cAnd this is not the end, after Forever Green is completely refined, I can still exchange the life-force of Senju Hasirama, at that time adding both of them together, to what extent the strength of my wood style will reach, I am really looking forward to see it ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the most unexpected thing was, the eye power of my Sharingan was unexpectedly enhanced a step further. Now the power of my doujutsus are increased by more than one-tenth compared to before.\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou placed his hand on his eyes, and feeling the power of his eyes, he sighed inwardly, \u201cNo wonder in the Naruto manga and anime series of previous world, Tobi had once stated, this Sharingan is eye for real combat. Only after undergoing the real battle, the eye power of Sharingan will be slowly squeeze out, gradually strengthening them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I was really guarding a treasure mountain without knowing the truth. This Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan however possessed the power to tame kyuubi and have enough power to rival wood style of Senju Hasirama which was able to suppress chaotic times, but currently I could only display a little bit of its might.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder at the time when I was at Mangekyo level, system said to polish my eye power, and only after really mastering my Mangekyo Sharingan, I should exchange another pair of Mangekyo Sharingan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I didn\u2019t understand the meaning of this sentence. It seems that the System was already aware of the secrets of Sharingan, and he had also told me, merely at that time I didn\u2019t understand that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Thinking this, Ren Tianyou slowly stood up, and the pattern inside his Sharingan also spun rapidly, \u201cNow that I already know this, hereafter I will intensify my daily cultivation to polish my Eternal Mangekyo, awakening those hidden powerful eye power of my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that three years had already passed, there is only less than two years of time left for the invasion of Demon clan. Although I don\u2019t have any responsibility with regarding to invasion of Demon clan, but White Tiger, Jade Maiden, Void\u2026\u2026\u2026their families are here, so in the big war against Demon clan of that time, they will definitely not stand by with folded arm.\u201d Thinking about the invasion of Demon clan, Ren Tianyou became worried inwardly, especially towards that mysterious Demon Emperor of Demon clan. 30,000 years ago, one might well say, it was 100 clans\u2019 flourishing age. There were many True God realm expert, and even God King realm experts were many in numbers, but even with that kind of lineup, when they resisted the Demon clan, even with the combined power of the entire continent, they were not able to kill Demon Emperor, merely injured him severely.</p><br/><p>And after undergoing that great war, the strength of both 100 clans and humanity reduced greatly. And with their vitality greatly damaged, they were no longer able to restore themselves to their previous flourishing age, so they could only go and live in seclusion to rest and build up the strength.</p><br/><p>And now, seeing the situation inside Tower of Babel, 30 or so peak experts of Divine Wind Continent couple with that unknown power of Tower of Babel, all of those people acted together unexpectedly could only withstand the bombardment of Demon Emperor on the seal from the other side, moreover they could only delay the breaking of seal for next two years or so.</p><br/><p>So with regarding to the strength of this Demon Emperor, Ren Tianyou was also not very clear, and could only make a guess. According to the words of Tower of Babel, All Seven Great Saints had already advanced their blood lineage to God rank, moreover they themselves were also Peak God Lord realm in strength, but even like that, the attack unleased by all of those people burning their life was only able to injure Demon Emperor, and was powerless to kill him. This meant the strength of Demon Emperor must be God Emperor realm, what rank of God Emperor realm, he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why at that time, Tower of Babel had said to come back there and look for him after I have sufficient strength to confront God Emperor realm expert.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought about the words of Tower of Babel, and became clear in his heart. \u201cBut since it is like this, I need to advance me eyes to Rinnegan as quickly as possible before the start of this war. Even if I am not able to advance my eyes to Rinnegan, I should at attain the strength of Senju Hasirama\u2019s Wood style at his most flourishing time, or even beyond.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd before that, I must complete that jutsu as soon as possible.\u201d After thinking about the upcoming war, he instantly recalled that ninjutsu. He must complete the preparation of this ninjutsu before the war.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems there is a lot of task to do ah, but after a week of self-cultivation, all of my injuries are already healed thoroughly. Now it\u2019s also time to go and explore that mysterious place of before.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought of that mysterious cliff in the place he had fallen into when he was severely injured, as well as that long mysterious blood colored river, then instantly disappeared from that place targeting the Hiraishin mark he had left behind at that time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

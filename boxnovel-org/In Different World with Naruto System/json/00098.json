How is this possible?\u201d Looking at his finishing blow\u2014\u2014-absolute zero being directly destroyed this easily, Ximen Xinbo was unable to accept this outcome for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this your strongest attack? You really disappoint me.\u201d Getting rid of those layers of ice, Ren Tianyou said with disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end just who are you?\u201d Looking at Susanoo as if it was devil king, Ximen Shu stared towards Ren Tianyou with hideous face, and asked in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already stated, I am the person that will take your life, and as for my identity, you can ask that to death god.\u201d Ren Tianyou finished speaking, and continued his steps towards the member of Ximen clan. When the younger generation of Ximen clan saw the present plight of their Great elder and second elder whom they worship at ordinary times, each and every one of them were completely terrified. And seeing the advancing Ren Tianyou, they could sense a scythe of Death god was approaching towards their direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one, what should we do now?\u201d Ximen Xinbo nervously asked Ximen Shu who was at his side. Right now he was completely out of ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know. If Diaixinao and Adelaide were able to escape from that trap now, we could gather the power of us 4 God-ranked experts, and perhaps we might be able to break through his defense.\u201d Ximen Shu shook his head, and express that he also didn\u2019t have any measure. Shortly afterwards he raised his head and look over to porcelain statue of two huge dragons, with eyes full of expectation.</p><br/><p>And just when Xiemn Shu had finished speaking, the mud plaster around the body of both Diaixinao and Adelaide started to slowly disintegrate, and a \u2018ka ka\u2019 scattering into pieces sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d All the mud plaster thoroughly changed into a powder and dissipated in the air. \u201cAooooo\u201d, \u201cAooooo\u201d, two loud dragon roar resounded through heaven and earth, and this sound immediately aroused the original low moral of member of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, god-ranked dragons of elders broke out from the trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, now we are saved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAdelaide, Diaixinao, you finally came out. If you hadn\u2019t come out, both of us would have been thoroughly wiped out.\u201d Ximen Shu looked at two huge dragons with excitement and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to keep you waiting for a long time.\u201d Adelaide and Diaixinao flapped their huge wings and flew at the side of Ximen Shu and Ximen Xinbo and apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we still need to think how to deal this guy.\u201d Ximen Xinbo said towards Diaixinao.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though we were trapped, we could see what was happening on outside, so we know the circumstance of this battle. From the battle state just a moment ago, we know that not only the attack power of this guy extremely formidable, but even his defense power is also extremely terrifying. Now I think there is only one way left, that is all 4 of us attacking him simultaneously with our strongest move, and perhaps our combination attack may break through his defense.\u201d Adelaide said with serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we should act quickly. If we delay any longer, that guy will arrived in front of us.\u201d Ximen Shu agreed the idea of Adelaide, because it seemed that was their only choice in this circumstance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then quickly get on our back, we should seize this time and make our move.\u201d Adelaide spoke without wasting any time.</p><br/><p>Immediately Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu got on the back of their respective dragons, after that both Adelaide and Diaixinao simultaneously flapped their huge wings and flew in the sky. Then both Diaixinao and Ximen Xinbo quickly started to chant magic incantation, and innumerable ice system elements of the air gathered around them. Adelaide also opened its huge dragon mouth and started to chant the incantation, and prepared to use a high level draconic magic of dragon clan. And Ximen Shu held his dragon sword vertically above his head and he started to pour a huge amount of his gold colored battle qi on his dragon sword. And after a while, a powerful sword qi appeared from this huge dragon sword.</p><br/><p>Looking at those 2 humans and 2 dragons who were in the process of preparing their strongest attack, Ren Tainyou slowed down his steps, \u201cPreparing to jointly use a big move to forcedly break through my Susanoo? Just in time, I wanted a chance to test how powerful the defense power of this Susanoo is. So I will give you an opportunity to attack once.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t intend to attack them with Yasaka no Magatama (Yasaka Beads) to interrupt their chanting, because in the Naruto world, the defense power of Susanoo was absolutely miraculous, and each and every one who possessed Susanoo were abnormally powerful. But Ren Tianyou had never got the chance to test its defense power himself, and by coincidence now he got the opportunity to test its defense power, so he wanted to see whether Susanoo could block the combination full power attack of 4 god-ranked experts or not.</p><br/><p>After about a minute, just when Ren Tianyou was starting to get impatient by waiting, the preparation of big moves of all 4 of them were completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon exterminates the heaven!\u201d Ximen Shu loudly yelled, then the huge dragon sword suddenly leave his hand, and flew in the sky and destroyed the black clouds in the sky. After that that huge sword rapidly condense innumerable gold colored clouds, and innumerable swords made up of extremely powerful sword qi appeared out from those clouds, just like a rain drops. \u201cFall!\u201d Ximen Shu raised both of his hands, then immediately those innumerable huge swords fell down towards Susanoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDraconic magic\u2014\u2014gold stripped!\u201d The huge dragon underneath Ximen Shu also completed the chanting of incantation, immediately after that huge gold colored light beam unexpectedly appeared and surrounded the huge body of Susanoo. This gold colored light beam possessed a special power, all the elements exited in the air around them were quickly removed and clean out by this light beam. And also this magic furthermore had extremely formidable binding ability, as yet another aim of Adelaide was to prevent Ren Tianyou from fleeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDraconic magic\u2014\u2014Disaster of ice and frost!\u201d Simultaneously Frost dragon Diaixinao also completed the preparation of its magic, and immediately the huge amount of ice system elements condensed in the sky, forming a huge ice balls. And terrifying ice qi condense above these huge ice balls, if ordinary person was exposed to these ice qi, then that person would be changed into an ice sculpture in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIce forbidden magic spells\u2014\u2014-ice intensity of dragon god!\u201d The preparation of magic of Ximen Xinbo was also complete, this time he had selected to use the forbidden magic he was capable to using with highest attack power.</p><br/><p>Forbidden magic spells, only god-ranked experts can use these spells, and in the eyes of everyone, Forbidden magic spells represents merciless destruction. If a god-ranked magicians were given enough time to prepare, they could easily destroy entire town. But although the current magic spell used by Ximen Xinbo was forbidden magic spell, in terms of range, this forbidden magic spell cover less area compared to other large range forbidden magic spells. But in terms of attack power, nevertheless it was even more powerful and concentrated. So this forbidden magic was even more suitable to use in this condition where his had only one target.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the strongest attacks of all 4 God-ranked experts which contained the hope of all those 4 god-ranked experts and all the other members of Ximen clan, advanced towards that giant. And under these strongest attack of 4 God-ranked experts, even this terrifying Susanoo appeared extremely insignificant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong longlong!\u201d, \u201chong!\u201d, \u201chong!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the thunderous sound of explosion rang out, and everyone felt that their ears were ringing due to this sound, and temporarily lost their sense of hearing. Shortly afterwards a powerful explosion shock wave came towards them. Everyone immediately made a great effort to stand steadily, so that they don\u2019t get blown away by this shock wave.</p><br/><p>After about a minute, when the vision of everyone recovered, the saw a large amount of dusts floating in the sky of explosion zone. Although they couldn\u2019t see the state inside it, but looking at the incomparable giant crater around it created by the attack, everyone felt that Ren Tainyou was unlikely to survive this attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s great, finally we eliminate the enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, since this person dared to challenge our Ximen clan, he was courting his death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The younger generation of Ximen clan were jumping with excitement. Just a moment ago when they sense the evil power of formidable Susanoo, everyone felt that their death was near them. Now that enemy had finally perished, how could they not be excited? Even Ximen Xinbo and Ximen Shu were revealing a happy smile, but the following voice coming form that large crater thoroughly froze their smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo is this your strongest attack? Petty good power.\u201d A light voice came from the large crater, and reached the ears of Ximen clan\u2019s members.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ximen Xinbo and others turned around their neck and look towards the large crater. Then they suddenly saw two fiery red lights in the midst of smoke, and shortly afterwards a huge figure appeared in front of them. This was Susanoo of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Looking at this huge giant without a single injury, Ximen Shu and others exclaimed in alarm. They couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d Ren Tianyou lightly said, their attack just a moment ago was actually horrifying, if Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have this Susanoo, then it was certain death for Ren Tianyou without doubt. When these 4 attacks landed on Susanoo, Ren Tianyou felt that the consumption of his eye power of Mangekyo Sharingan suddenly accelerated, and shortly afterwards these 4 attacks were completely blocked by his Susanoo before this attack could reach him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

From the body of these peoples, Ren Tianyou sensed a shred of unparalleled atrocity aura, and felt as if he was being stared by a terrifying ferocious beasts of primeval times.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou carefully stared at them, and made a series of hand seals with both of his hands, \u201cDoton\u2014-Taju Doryuheki! (Earth Style\u2014-Multi Mud Wall!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou completed his ninjutsu, the ground in front of him started to violently shook. After that one huge earthen wall after another grew out from the ground in succession. About 7 or 8 huge earthen walls rose from the ground in front of Ren Tianyou blocking his body. After earthen walls rose, Ren Tianyou again started to make a series of hand seals in preparation of next ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>Seeing the rise of earthen walls, the golden light in the eyes of Ximen Batian and others rose suddenly and sharply, that unparalleled atrocity aura on their body also quickly condensed, and directly changing into 4 golden light beam, they collided with the earthen walls which was created by Ren Tianyou. Along with a \u2018hong\u2019 explosion sound, the first earthen wall was directly torn into pieces.</p><br/><p>After using Saint dragon heavenly cross secret skill of their blood lineage, their body had already changed into that of dragon, so several ordinary moves were no longer of any significance to them, compared to them, using their physical power which was greatly increased by their dragon change was more effective. Because of the hard dragon scale, their defense power was also strengthen.</p><br/><p>Under the continuous assault of Ximen Batian and others, the earthen walls created by Ren Tianyou crumbled one after another. Ren Tianyou jumped into the air, and looked at the circumstances below, and seeing the state below, he couldn\u2019t help but thought inside his heart, \u201cIsn\u2019t this basically a human shaped ferocious beasts? There is no technique, only the physical strength is very powerful, however let\u2019s see if your defense is also extremely powerful like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014-Goka Mekkyaku! (Fire Style\u2014-Majestic Destroyer Flame!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After finished make hand seals, Ren Tianyou placed both of his hands in front of his mouth, opened his mouth, then suddenly boundless flame was spat out from his mouth. And this blazing hot flame advanced towards Ximen Batian and others.</p><br/><p>Immediately the ground below was engulfed by the boundless flame created by Ren Tianyou, even Ximen Batian and others were also completely engulfed by this flame.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou fell down from the sky and landed on the ground, then looking at the flame which was sending out intense heat wave in front of him, he kept on carefully looking inside this flame.</p><br/><p>Just at that time, a loud shouts suddenly came out from inside this flame, \u201cHa, Dragon\u2019s smashing fist!\u201d Along with these loud shout, 4 successive huge dragon roar sound rang out from inside the flame, then 4 huge golden light suddenly rose from the heart of the flame, and spread in all direction in a high speed. Due to the impact of these 4 huge golden light the floor around them were broken into pieces in succession, and the flame created by Ren Tianyou was also swept and extinguished by this golden light.</p><br/><p>Along with a \u2018hong\u2019 sound, a huge windstorm spread in all direction, and Ren Tianyou used the sleeve of his robe to cover his face. When this windstorm stopped, and clouds of dusts dissipated, Ren Tianyoyu was finally able to clearly see the circumstance of that place. The body of Ximen Batian and other 3 were dazzling with gold colored Saint dragon battle qi, and all of them were still in the state where their fists of right hand was on the ground.</p><br/><p>Looking at the gradually standing Ximen Batian and others, Ren Tianyou gradually became solemn, \u201cAfter half-dragon change, it seems it really is not that easy to deal with these 4. And I also can\u2019t use kamui of right eye to absorb them because Little Yu and Jade Maiden are still inside the kamui dimension. It looks like I must think of a new way to finish them off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou thought of a way to deal with the current situation, and his eyes lit up, \u201cLet\u2019s do it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished thinking, a powerful lightning appeared around his whole body, which took the form of lightning armor. After that his body changed into a lightning light and disappeared from that location.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou had disappeared, Ximen Batian and others quickly stood back to back, started to scan the surroundings around them, and took the precautions against the surprise attack of Ren Tianyou. Just at that time, they suddenly sensed a movement above their head, so they looked up. Then they saw a right leg which was covered with powerful lightning, and as if this right leg had changed into a huge lightning battle-ax, it was directly chopping down towards them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014- Girochin Doroppu! (Lightning style\u2014- Guillotine Drop!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ximen Batian and others simultaneously raised their both hands, which were filled with dazzling golden lights. After that a muffled sound rang out, as the attack of Ren Tianyou directly landed on the hands of Ximen Batian and others, and the force of impact of this attack forced all of them to heavily kneel down on their one knee. And the floor beneath their kneel downed one knee, immediately issued a \u2018ka ka\u2019 disintegrate sound, and a huge shockwave was spread in all direction from that impact point.</p><br/><p>Although the power of his ninjutsu had forced all 4 of them to kneel down, nevertheless after this force of impact passed by, the Girochin Doroppu (Guillotine Drop) of Ren Tianyou of Ren Tianyou was successfully blocked by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke, actually able to block my Girochin Doroppu (Guillotine Drop) relaying upon their human body.\u201d Ren Tianyou sensed the palms were firmly holding his right leg, a great strength was also coming from the palms on his right leg, and now his right leg didn\u2019t have any means to move downwards.</p><br/><p>At that time, Ren Tianyou sensed that the palms around his right legs suddenly began to squeeze his legs harder, as if they wanted to crush his right leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Ren Tianyou snored coldly, then the magatama of his right eye quickly rotated, after that his right leg as if was transparent directly passed through their body, and landed on the ground. After that Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t retreated, but directly attacked the abdomen of the one called Old Seven with his right hand which was glimmering with powerful lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014- Raigyaku Suihei! (Lightning style\u2014- Lateral Bolt of Pain!)\u201d</p><br/><p>The attack of Ren Tianyou directly sent the body of Old Seven flying just like a cannon ball, and he collided with the wall which caused a huge amount of smoke to rise.</p><br/><p>Just at this time, Ximen Batian and other 2 reacted. They attacked with their right hand which was emitting powerful golden light towards Ren Tianyou. But Ren Tianyou had already used kamui of his right eye, so the 3 fists of these 3 people directly passed through his body. Shortly afterwards he heavily stepped on the ground with his right leg and directly jumped towards one side, and simultaneously made a series of hand seals in a high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoton\u2014-Otoshibuta! (Earth Style\u2014-Buta Futa!)\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou completed his ninjutsu, above Ren Tianyou, Ximen Batian and other two, suddenly a huge black hole appeared, then from inside that black hole, a huge green colored boar shaped earthen lid dropped down towards all of them.</p><br/><p>Because Ren Tianyou was also below this huge earthen lid, he himself would also be smashed, but Ren Tianyou used kamui of his right eye, and disappeared from that place, successfully dodging his own attack. But this huge earthen lid continued to drop towards Ximen Batian and others who were underneath it. Along with a \u2018hong\u2019 sound, this green colored earthen lid directly smashed the ground, covering Ximen Batian and other two.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou appeared in the sky and slowly fall down. After that ignoring Ximen Batian and other 2 who were smashed by that earthen lid, he firmly stared towards the direction of Old Seven who was sent flying by him. Relying on his dragon change, Old Seven had blocked Raigyaku Suihei (Lateral Bolt of Pain) of Ren Tianyou, so he was not that injured by this attack. So he slowly stood up.</p><br/><p>Looking at the unscathed Old Seven, Ren Tianyou sneered, \u201cYour defense power is truly powerful, but I don\u2019t know whether your body can defend against my space attack or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, his left eye suddenly became bloodshot which looked very frightening, and a huge amount of eye power came out from his left eye, which slowly spread in all direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cKamui!\u201d</p><br/><p>After this single word came out from Ren Tianyou, Old Seven who was in the process of stepping forward suddenly sensed something unusual around him. He suddenly discovered that the space around his head seemed to be distorting. He clearly felt that his head was as if in the process of swaying due to the huge anonymous power.</p><br/><p>Feeling this, Old Seven was suddenly terrified, and the Saint dragon battle qi above his body suddenly rose sharply in a high speed, then huge power fluctuation spread in all direction. But all of this was in vain, no matter how powerful his body was, meeting the space attack of kamui, all of this was useless.</p><br/><p>Along with an appearance of space black hole, the head of Old Seven was also twisted off and sucked by the huge space power, leaving behind only the headless corpse which was spurting the bloods.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Soon afterwards everyone entered his room, and after closing the door, Ren Tianyou looked towards Great Bear and said, \u201cGreat Bear, set up a mute barrier, otherwise when that dragon yell loudly after coming out, the people underneath might come over to take a look, which is certainly bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Great Bear answered, then took out his spear from his back, and poured his battle qi into this spear. Along with the input of battle qi, suddenly a golden colored flame with burning qi appeared on his spear. \u201cDivide!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Great Bear, from this spear, four illusionary spear shadow appeared, which dispersed and stood on the four corner of the room respectively, making an illusionary golden colored energy barrier shield surrounding the whole room.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, Void, let that guy\u2019s soul out.\u201d After Great Bear had finished setting up barrier, Ren Tianyou said to Void.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Void answered. Then with his left hand, he took out that bottle where the soul of that dragon was sealed, and he gradually raised his right hand which was covered with ash colored light and pressed that talisman stuck the bottle, while noiselessly whispering an incantation. This was Death clan\u2019s special sealing soul secret magic. If one doesn\u2019t possess the Death clan\u2019s dispel incantation, then this talisman was basically impossible to tear off. Moreover if someone tried to forcedly break the bottle, then that would only make the soul inside scared out of its wits.</p><br/><p>Along with incantation, this charm slowly loosen and finally came off. After that opening the bottle cap, that soul of dragon immediately fly out from inside the bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, wicked human, what do you want to do?\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou and others who were glaring it like a tiger watching its prey, this dragon soul couldn\u2019t help but roar while floating in the midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you say it yourself, why do you think we went through a lot of troubles to bring you here?\u201d Hearing this dragon soul, Ren Tianyou smiled with disdain, then said. While Great Bear and others in his side also employed eyes with harboring evil designs to stare at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s taunting words, this dragon soul immediately got angry inside his heart. But this moment he was just a soul, so he was basically unable to bring out to play any of its previous strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, no more nonsense. Void, control him, don\u2019t let him move randomly.\u201d Ren Tianyou was not in the mood to waste any more time. He wanted to quickly interrogate it (Dragon\u2019s soul) and know all the things he wanted to know, so as to avoid any complication that may arise due to long delay.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, Void concentrated his ash colored battle qi within his body, and used his clan\u2019s special secret magic. An illusionary chain flew out from his right hand binding this dragon soul. When this chain bound this dragon soul, many sharp pointed thorns came out from this chain, directly stabbing this soul, making it unable to move.</p><br/><p>This was Death clan\u2019s another secret magic\u2014-Soul Binding Chain. This chain possessed extremely powerful binding effect towards soul or soul kind body, making them unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, what is this, quickly release me, release me, otherwise we Dragon clan will definitely hunt you down to the ends of the earth. Even your brothers, sisters and friends will all die without a place for burial, quickly\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Feeling that strange soul chain, this dragon unceasingly tried to struggle while his mouth continuously roared loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, too talkative. Doujutsu\u2014-Tsukuyomi!\u201d Hearing the loud roars of this dragon, the complexion of Ren Tianyou slowly sunk. He actually dared to use his (Ren Tianyou) dear ones to threaten him, this was simply courting death. His eyes slowly changed into the eyes of Uchiha Itachi, and initiated the Tsukuyomi.</p><br/><p>Along with the start of Tsukuyomi, this huge dragon slowly quieted down, and motionlessly floated in the midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak out the location of your Dragon Island.\u201d Looking at this dragon who had fallen into the illusion of Tsukuyomi, Ren Tianyou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Island is at endless west sea area\u2019s most center location.\u201d This dragon who had fallen into illusion answered without slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many True God realm and above experts are there in Dragon clan?\u201d Ren Tianyou again asked. Since he wanted to destroy the entire Dragon Island, he should at least know how many experts are there in Dragon clan, so he could make preparation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know our dragon clan\u2019s 4 prince are all True God realm expert, and our Dragon clan\u2019s His Majesty the Emperor is God King realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? God King?\u201d Hearing the answer of this dragon, the complexion of Great Bear and others changed. God King realm expert was not that easy to deal with, because after entering God King realm, they begin to slowly comprehend elemental law. With every move, they could use elemental power between Heaven and Earth, which would make their strength truly astonishing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is God King realm expert, then I should postpone the trip to Dragon Island, until I exchanged Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought inside his heart. Only after he awaken Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, he could possibly fight evenly with God King realm expert, otherwise it would be useless even if there was large amount of people.</p><br/><p>These past three years, coupled with the war at Magic Domain, altogether Ren Tianyou now had only around 600,000 system points. But compared to require 2.5 million system points to exchange Eternal Magnekyo Sharingan, this was too low.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, now I have already asked all the things I need to know, your existence is no longer necessary.\u201d Looking at this dragon soul, the eyes of Ren Tianyou flashed with pallid light. Now he and Dragon clan were already mortal enemies, so he would not be softhearted towards Dragon clan. Just when he was intending to exterminate this dragon soul, Void stopped Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, you should never do this kind of soul exterminating thing.\u201d Seeing what Ren Tianyou was about to do, Void solemnly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ren Tianyou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe soul of all living things under heaven are the creation of this world. If someone dares to exterminate soul, then he/she will be marked by this world, and at the most crucial juncture of his/her life, heaven will send down a punishment, making you unable to reincarnate.\u201d Void solemnly said. With regarding to the study of soul, no one could compare their Death clan in any expect.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurned out to be so.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head. The Xianxia novels he had studied before in the earth had also stated something like this, and it was called the principle of karma or something like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo let me handle this guy.\u201d Finished explaining, Void stepped forward, and waving his right hand, he pulled Soul Binding Chain, causing this dragon soul which had fallen into illusion arrive next to his right hand. Then placing his right hand above this dragon soul, he circulate his ash colored battle qi inside his body, while noiselessly chanting incantation. After that this dragon soul actually began to quickly shrunk, finally assembling at the center of his right hand\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead Six Dao, everything dissolve into a liquid; Dead spirit\u2019s path, answer me and open!\u201d Along with the voice of Void, an illusionary ash colored passage suddenly appeared in the space in front, which emitted a chilling cold aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet in for me.\u201d Seeing this illusionary passage was opened, Void\u2019s eyes shone, then he threw that dragon soul into this passage. Shortly afterwards, Void recalled his energy causing this passage to slowly close and disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing the move of void, Ren Tianyou asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was Dead spirit\u2019s path which leads to Death Domain. I delivered his soul to Death Domain.\u201d Void explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurned out to be so.\u201d After they had finished all their matters, Ren Tianyou and everyone else walked out from the room. But to their surprise, Jade Maiden and others were already outside.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou, Jade Maiden walked over to him. After that she took out an earth yellow colored magic staff from inside her space ring and gave it to Ren Tianyou. Seeing this magic staff, Ren Tianyou suddenly felt it was a bit familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, this is magic staff is Ling Yanqi\u2019s that magic staff.\u201d Jade Maiden explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why it looked a bit familiar.\u201d Ren Tianyou understood inside his heart, then he said, \u201cThen why are you giving this thing to me, even if I take it, it\u2019s of no use to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want to give you is not this magic staff, rather this crystal core embedded on this magic staff.\u201d Jade Maiden pointed at that huge crystal core embedded on the top of this magic staff. That crystal core was emitting simple and vigorous earth element power. Even though it no longer had master, people could still sense profound feeling from this crystal core.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crystal core is?\u201d Seeing that out of ordinary crystal core, Ren Tianyou curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crystal core is Earth Emperor Crystal, originally was our family\u2019s heirloom treasure. In this crystal core, it contains extremely powerful earth magic power, but even after researching it for a long period of time since our clan obtain this, we only know two things, with it if we use earth magic, not only the casting speed is faster by 10% compared to speed without using it, but even the consumption of magical power is reduced by 20%. Outside of this, we didn\u2019t get any clue of its uses even after researching countless time again.\u201d Jade Maiden slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with only that, this crystal core is extremely powerful treasure. But why did it fall into the hand of Ling Yanqi?\u201d Vermilion Bird walked over and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause this crystal core attracted the calamity of extermination of our entire family. After Ling Yanqi heard we have Earth Emperor Crystal, he directly slaughtered to our house, and exterminated our whole family of 13. If it were not for my master\u2019s coincident appearance, I would have also already died in that bastard\u2019s hand.\u201d Recalling this, Jade Maiden\u2019s eyes slowly become red.</p><br/><p>\u201cJade maiden, now you have already killed your greatest enemy with your own hand, so don\u2019t be sad.\u201d Ren Tianyou said. Then taking the magic staff he intend to give it to Little Yu, \u201cAlthough this magic staff is good, but I don\u2019t have any use for it, so\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>But when the right hand just touch that magic staff, the sound of system rang inside his brain, making Ren Tianyou blankly stand on the spot.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

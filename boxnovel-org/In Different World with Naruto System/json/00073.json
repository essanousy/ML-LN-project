It seemed at the last second, Feng Wu had released the shield to protect both herself and Golden Wing phoenix from explosion. Still, blood could be seen on the corner of her mouth, and the shield was also already very dim. From this you can understand that it was not that easy for her to block the continuous attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Wu, are you all right?\u201d Golden Wings Phoenix flapped its wing and floated in the air, then asked Feng Wu who was on its back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Withdrawing her energy shield, Feng Wu nodded her head and answered. She forced down the turmoil of blood within her body, then firmly stared at Ren Tianyou, as if to prevent him from initiating a surprise attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wu, it seems you were right, the speed of this fellow is too fast, it is very difficult to hit him with our attack. And his attacks are also extremely powerful. If this goes on then we will only sink in passive situation and take a beating.\u201d Looking at the Ren Tianyou, Golden Wings Phoenix said seriously. Although after hearing the warnings of Feng Wu, it was also somewhat prepared, but it had never thought the speed of Ren Tianyou was fast to this terrifying degree, they couldn\u2019t respond in time, and even the phoenix god shield was also destroyed by his attack.</p><br/><p>Even if the move is very powerful, but it couldn\u2019t land on the opponent then that was just a garbage. Both Feng Wu and Golden wings phoenix understood this point very clearly. And from the current situation they already knew clearly that they were not comparable to Ren Tiianyou in terms of speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like this then let\u2019s use omni-directional attack to attack indiscriminately, ok.\u201d After thinking for a while, Feng Wu come to this decision. After all that was the only way left to them. Finished speaking, and Golden wing phoenix easily understood the intention of Fen Wu. Along with the sharp cry, Golden Wings phoenix let Feng Wu jump out from its back, then it flew opposite direction to Feng Wu, and together locked on to Ren Tianyou who was on the arena beneath them.</p><br/><p>Feng Wu saw that Golden Wing Phoenix was already ready, then simultaneously both of theirs body released a golden yellow colored radiances. Feng Wu held fire phoenix sword on her hand, pointing sword point in the sky, then a golden colored battle qi soared to the sky. Gold wing phoenix was also doing the same kind of movement as Feng Wu. A perfectly straight two golden colored light beam soared towards the sky, and was glittering just like a shining mirror. Seeing this the people of the audience have no choice but to close their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCombination skill\u2014\u2014-phoenix wings soar in the sky.\u201d Both Feng Wu and Golden Wings phoenix simultaneously shout loudly. Suddenly the golden yellow colored light beam of both Feng Wu and Golden Wings phoenix spread in all direction. The two light beam gradually joined together, and spread on the whole arena, without doubt it also swallowed Ren Tianyou who was within the arena.</p><br/><p>The light beam lasted for about 30 seconds, then it slowly became weak and finally disappeared. After the light beam had disappeared, seeing the circumstance in the arena, everyone couldn\u2019t help but became greatly surprised. Because they couldn\u2019t see even a shadow of any person in the arena, there was only a 10 meter radius deep hole on the arena. And even the shadow of Ren Tianyou had disappeared from the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou.\u201d Seeing this, the classmates of Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but became greatly surprised, and they were worried whether Ren Tianyou was able to survive that attack or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan he reach only to this extent?\u201d Seeing and sensing that the aura of Ren Tianyou had disappeared without a trace, disappointment flashed in the eyes of Yan Xinluo. Although the combination skill of Feng Wu was quite powerful, but if he was in the position of Ren Tianyou, then he could have still blocked this attack. But Ren Tianyou whom he had viewed as a rival\u2026\u2026\u2026.. When Yan Xinluo felt disappointment, his blood lineage \u2018death heart\u2019 was suddenly filled with aura of destruction, \u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Experiencing this familiar aura, the eyes of Yan Xinluo flashed with a sharp light.</p><br/><p>Feng Wu saw that the arena was destroyed by her and Golden wings phoenix combination skill and Ren Tianyou also had disappeared, while breathing heavily. The radiance of battle qi on her body was also very dim, then flying to the side of Golden Wings phoenix side she said, \u201cLittle gold, isn\u2019t this a bit overkill? It seems that guy is dead from our hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThai is impossible A\u2019Wu. Although our combination skill is powerful, nevertheless that guy is also extremely powerful. From his earlier offensive power, you should also know it. At most this combination skill will only heavily injure him, I think even the heavy injury is impossible. We shouldn\u2019t lower our guard.\u201d Golden Wings phoenix was not that optimistic within its heart, as a saint class magical beasts, its capacity to judge the opponent was not that bad. From that extremely high speed and that incomparably violent offensive power of Ren Tianyou, it had guessed that it was not that easy to kill Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>When the Golden wing phoenix was carefully being on the alert, under its mental perception, suddenly an incomparably violent aura appeared. The violent aura was from\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.right beneath them.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Wu, be careful. That guy survived, he is coming.\u201d Just when Golden wing phoenix had yelled, suddenly an incomparable violent aura came out from inside that deep hole of the arena. Even the Golden wing phoenix itself felt a strong pressure from this aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d an explosion sound rang out from that deep hole of arena, shortly afterwards, a blue purple colored lightning was launched from underneath the arena, straight towards Feng Wu in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Wu, be careful. Phoenix guard.\u201d Seeing the purple light advancing towards them from under the arena, Golden Wings Phoenix anxiously cried. Then quickly flashed and arrived at the side of Feng Wu, opened its wings, then a golden colored radiance was released from the head of Golden Wings Phoenix, which encircled both itself and Feng Wu. This was the one of the lifesaving skill of Feng clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Rariatto! (Lightning style\u2014Lariat!)\u201d An explosive sound come out from inside the blue purple colored light beam, shortly afterwards this light beam as if changed into a board sword advanced towards both Feng Wu and Golden Wing Phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d sound rang out, the Phoenix guard of Golden Wing Phoenix received a violent strike, but it didn\u2019t break. Due to the impact behind the attack they directly fell towards the arena.</p><br/><p>The blue purple colored light beam and the shadow of a person within it, if not Ren Tianyou then who else could it be. However the current appearance of Ren Tianyou was not like when he had first stepped inside the arena. The clothes on his upper part were already utterly tattered, the sexy muscles of Ren Tianyou were completely visible. And a trace of blood was visible on the corner of his mouth, it seems like it was not that easy for Ren Tianyou to block that attack. Looking right now at Ren Tianyou, his body was violently leaking a deep blue colored chakra, even the body had changed into red in color.</p><br/><p>The fact was Ren Tianyou had already opened 6th gate\u2014\u2014\u2014- Gate of View of hachimon tonkou (The Eight Inner Gates). After concealing it for 4 days, he had finally used hachimon tonkou (The Eight Inner Gates), as he had to hide his greater part of the strength, he couldn\u2019t use ninjutsu, and couldn\u2019t use doujutsu. So, he had to opene hachimon tonkou (The Eight Inner Gates) to successfully defend from that attack, but who would have thought that he would be forced to open up to 6th gate\u2014-gate of view to completely block the impact of attack.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked at the falling Feng Wu and Golden Wings Phoenix, since he had already opened 6th gate, then he had to use this to end the match.</p><br/><p>He turned around his body, then he tightened up his arms, and started to pour a strong chakra towards his arms, then looking below at the targets, he punched in an extremely high speed. Because the speed of his punch was too fast, the sky was filled with the afterimages of the punch of Ren Tianyou, and no one was able to determine which one was real.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsakujaku!\u201d (Morning Peacock!)</p><br/><p>Along with the explosive shout of Ren Tianyou, innumerable fire meteors suddenly appeared in the air along with the punches of Ren Tianyou. And it pursued the falling Golden Wings phoenix and Feng Wu. Innumerable fire meteors just like a peacock tail looked extremely gorgeous, but within this gorgeousness, endless dangers were hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d After Feng Wu landed on the ground, and just as with great difficulty she stabilized herself, she heard an unusual sound from above her. Lifting her head and looking towards the sky she discovered the innumerous fire meteors were advancing towards her. Seeing this she had no other choice but to increase the energy into her Phoenix guard. Just after she had increased the energy on her phoenix guard, the Asakujaku (Morning Peacock) of Ren Tianyou hit the target.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonghong\u201d, \u201chonghong\u201d, \u201chonghong\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..As the fire meteors of Asakujaku (Morning Peacock) hit the target, immediately a round of violent explosion sound rang out, and the whole arena was covered with dusts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

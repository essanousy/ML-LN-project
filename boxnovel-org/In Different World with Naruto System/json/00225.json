His consciousness sunk inside his brain\u2019s Naruto system. He planned to begin his training plan\u2019s first objective\u2014-Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu)!</p><br/><p>Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu), was a kind of time-space ninjutsu developed by Second Hokage Senju Tobirama who was the younger brother of First Hokage Senju Hasirama in Naruto World. Later Fourth Hokage Namikaze Minato improved this jutsu, making his speed to reach real pinnacle. And precisely this Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) made Namikaze Minato famous as Yellow Flash. Moreover relying on this ninjutsu, Namikaze Minato had become terror of enemies during ninja war. The ninjas of Iwagakure no Sato (The Village Hidden in the Stones) were even commanded, as long as they saw Namikaze Minato, run away as fast as possible without losing any time.</p><br/><p>The principle of Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) was using jutsu\u2019s mark to achieve instant movement and space skipping. As long as user placed a jutsu\u2019s mark on the target, then the user could send himself or the entity which is in contact with his chakra instantly to the location of the marked target at any time. User could leave behind the mark at any place the user comes into contact, and also could use special kunai with jutsu\u2019s mark. When the mark is made in the body of the enemy, then that signify the enemy got the curse seal of death. In absolute majority circumstance, the mark of Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) would never disappear once it is marked with the exception of certain special circumstance (Like when Uchiha Obito became host of Ten-tailed beast, the mark disappeared).</p><br/><p>Only Senju Tobirama and Namikaze Minato were able to independently use this ninjutsu. Genma Shiranui, Raido Namiashi and Iwashi Tatami could also use this ninjutsu with joint effort, but they required several seconds of preparation time, nothing like Second and Forth who could use as they please.</p><br/><p>After coming into contact with Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) created by Second, Namikaze Minato further developed series of attack means fitting in with Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) relying on his ability and wisdom. Such as: Hiraishin \u2014 Ni no Dan (beheading technique) (Flying Thunder God \u2013 Level Two): In the midst of war, throwing many marked kunai, then instantly teleporting to those kunai moving in high speed. After that before the enemies could react and defend, completely eliminating all the enemies within seconds. In those years during the 3rd Great Ninja World War, relying on this move, Forth had instantly killed 50 or so ninjas, shocking the entre ninja world.</p><br/><p>Hiraishin\u2014Dorai (Teleportation Barrier): Hiraishin using in defensive form. Using jutsu\u2019s mark to open up a space barrier, which could warp anything that comes into contact with it to elsewhere. At that time when Kyuubi who was under the control of Tobi attacked Kohona, Namikaze Minato had relied on this move to warp away Kyuubi\u2019s bijudama.</p><br/><p>Hiraishin Goshun Mawashi no Jutsu (Reciprocal Round-Robin Flying Raijin Jutsu): Both Second Hokage and Forth Hokage would use this ninjutsu simultaneously after leaving behind their respective marks on each other in advance. After this they can switch their position at any time.</p><br/><p>Rasen Senko Cho Rinbuko Sanshiki (Rasen-Flash Super-Circle Dance Howl Stage Three): This was the ninjutsu when Forth Hokage use Hiraishin no Jutsu combined with the shurikens and his shadow clone. Have shadow clone throw many marked kunai around the enemy, then simultaneously attack the enemies using Hiraishin. It could also be use inducing tactics.</p><br/><p>Because Forth Hokage had proficiently grasped this Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu), he was able to practically avoid any danger under any circumstance. But Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu) also had a shortcoming, which was this ninjutsu didn\u2019t have any offensive power, rather was an S-ranked auxiliary ninjutsu in the Naruto World, otherwise Fourth Hokage would have already become invincible. But even as an auxiliary ninjutsu without any offensive power, the function of this ninjutsu was incomparably powerful.</p><br/><p>And from the Ninjutsu System, Ren Tianyou learnt the training method of this ninjutsu. First step was one must be able to perceive the existence of space.</p><br/><p>Because only after one was able to perceive the fluctuation of space, one would be able to use this jutsu\u2019s mark to move through space. Otherwise just like in Naruto world, even though there were many people who knew the training method of Hiraishin no Jutsu, but only very few were able to use it.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was still sitting cross-legged, and he was unceasingly perceiving the space fluctuation all around inside his mind. Only after one could perceive the space fluctuation, they would have the qualification to train Hiraishin no Jutsu.</p><br/><p>Slowly calming down his heart, Ren Tianyou unceasingly spread his perception all around. He didn\u2019t enlarged his perception, he limited his perception within his room. In just this fashion, he slowly began to comprehend the surrounding environment\u2019s power of space, and very carefully examined the rhythm of space fluctuation.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed, the sky outside had also slowly turned black. And Ren Tianyou who was still sitting cross-legged on the floor slowly opened his eyes. A trace of helpless emotion flashed within in eyes. Within this nearly three hours, he basically didn\u2019t perceive any space fluctuation, instead because he was continuously in the state of heightened spirit concentration for these past three hours, the consumption of his sprit power was quite large. Now he had opened his eyes because his felt faint dizziness and was unable to keep going.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, as expected, this ninjutsu famed as the Naruto World\u2019s number one auxiliary ninjutsu is not that easy to learn.\u201d Rubbing his little bit aching head, Ren Tianyou helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Just then, the voice of Muyue came from outside, \u201cLittle You, come out to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, elder sister Yue\u2019er, I will come immediately.\u201d Hearing the voice, Ren Tianyou replied. After that standing up, he opened the door and walked outside.</p><br/><p>Vermilion Bird and others had already arrived, and were busy with miscellaneous work while making appetizing cooked dishes. Void this Death son was serving as ingredients cutter under the tugging of Vermilion Bird. He was unceasingly chopping ingredients taking advantage of his that exquisite skill in using kitchen knife.</p><br/><p>And our newly joined member Great Bear was very unfortunate as he was being used as worker to tend the kitchen fire, because his true sun fire was very violent. However looking at his face smeared with ashen carbon, it seems he was not feeling any better.</p><br/><p>As for our His Excellency the Sword God White Tiger, he had squatted down in one corner with face worse than crying and was washing ingredients in basin.</p><br/><p>While women were in charge of ladle, string the fry to make dishes, and cooking soup. They were also extremely busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, is this our handsome guy White Tiger? How come you change into ingredient washer?\u201d Looking at the miserable appearance of everyone, Ren Tianyou pulled an expression that needs spanking in his face, then squatting in front of White Tiger, and made fun of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away, you damned Zero, not giving the hand yet speaking irresponsible and sarcastic remarks.\u201d White Tiger said in depressed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d Hearing White Tiger, Ren Tianyou immediately laughed happily.</p><br/><p>But probably because Ren Tianyou was laughing too rampantly, Little Yu by his side opened her mouth, \u201cIdiot, we are out of firewood, go and chop some woods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!\u201d Hearing Little Yu, the corner of Ren Tianyou\u2019s mouth suddenly twitched several times. He helplessly stood up, then walked towards the pile of short woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Zero, you woodcutter nicely chop the firewood.\u201d The rampant voice of White Tiger came from behind.</p><br/><p>Finally the meal was ready under the combined effort of everyone. Everyone sat together outside chatting and laughing while drinking alcohol and eating the meals made through their own effort.</p><br/><p>But just then Ren Tianyou however discovered the complexion of elder sister Yue\u2019er however was not very good. Walking over to her side, Ren Tianyou asked with concern, \u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, what happened, your complexion looks not so good, are you ill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am fine Little You. You don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d Muyue shook her head, and softly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, how can you say that, you know you are my elder sister, my one and only family in this world. So there is no matter that you cannot speak with me.\u201d Ren Tianyou firmly said while staring at the eyes of Muyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, fine, I will tell you. As a matter of fact, I was afraid to implicate everyone.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Muyue sighed and said slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cImplicate, why are you speaking like this elder sister Yue\u2019er?\u201d Hearing Muyue, Ren Tianyou asked feeling strange.</p><br/><p>Next Muyue slowly explained to Ren Tianyou. As it turned out, after resurrection, although her physique was much better than average physique under the effect of Spring of Life and Phoenix God Fruit, but her blood lineage was already stripped by Ren Tianyou. And according to Feng Yunmeng, she could not receive Holy Dragon blood lineage in this life, otherwise her body would explode and die, as a result Ren Tianyou had chosen to use Totsuka Blade to permanently seal her Holy Dragon blood lineage.</p><br/><p>But the blood lineage however was supreme in the power system of Divine Wind continent. All the cultivation methods and warrior skills were developed with the view to deepen the strength of power of blood lineage. Stronger the blood lineage the faster the cultivation speed, without regard for whether it was magician, warrior or illusionist, all were of same principle. As a result, their strength basically cannot be separated from their blood lineage.</p><br/><p>But now the blood lineage of Muyue was already stripped by Ren Tianyou, and even if she cultivates the methods of this continent, the effect naturally would be very slow. Just like original Ximen Tianlong, regardless of how hard he tried, only reaching Intermediate Warrior in ten years of time.</p><br/><p>Precisely because of this reason, Muyue was feeling troubled. She was afraid she would implicate everyone else, because of her lack of strength.</p><br/><p>Finished hearing Muyue, Ren Tianyou got lost in thought. After a long time, Ren Tianyou lifted his head, then looking at gloomy Muyue, he slowly said, \u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, since that is the case, I will teach you a different cultivation method. This method doesn\u2019t rely on blood lineage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat cultivation method?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Muyue immediately asked happily. Because of losing memory, she now knows only Ren Tianyou and others. In addition, Ren Tianyou this younger brother of hers and others truly cared for her, so she however thought that she would implicate them because of her low strength, so was constantly worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cultivation method is called ninjutsu. It is also my cultivation method.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said. He had decided to pass on ninjutsu to Muyue, so that she could have the power to defend herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinjutsu?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Muyue immediately frowned, clearly didn\u2019t understand what ninjutsu was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, well elder sister Yue\u2019er, don\u2019t think too much, after I give you basics of ninjutsu, I will slowly teach you again. I assure you, the strength of this ninjutsu is not worse than the strength of this world\u2019s cultivation.\u201d Ren Tianyou explained with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>Next because the knot inside her heart was already untied, smile again appeared on the face of Muyue. And she happily ate meal together with everyone.</p><br/><p>After eating, the shadow clone of Ren Tianyou and Muyue returned to her room to guide her most basic chakra cultivating.</p><br/><p>And after Ren Tianyou himself also returned to his room, he again created another two shadow clone. One shadow clone continued to comprehend space fluctuation to train in Hiraishin no Jutsu. While another shadow clone began to deepen the understanding of Sharingan. Although he already own many Mangekyo Sharingan, but he however was too poor in using only Sharingan\u2019s ability, such as illusion of Sharingan.</p><br/><p>One should know that Uchiha Itachi could make other people unconsciously fall in his illusion relying on his Sharingan. Uchiha Shisui could also make other people fall in his illusion even though he was several tens of meters away. Uchiha Madara and Tobi were able to tame Kyuubi relying on their eyes.</p><br/><p>So after Ren Tianyou knew his own weakness, how could he not increase training on the use of Sharingan, and this training could also be preparation for the future when he exchange Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>As for his true body, he was rushing to refine that endless amount of life-force of Forever Green inside his dantian. This life-force however was related to the strength of his mokuton, so Ren Tianyou naturally was not careless. Moreover continuously refining this Forever Green\u2019s life-force was also slowly increasing his chakra limit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

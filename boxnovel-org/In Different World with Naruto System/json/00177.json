Trees were standing in large number in this mountain, so this mountain was fresh green in color giving peoples a kind of pleasant mood. And at this mountain, one long mountain road spiraled around this mountain all the way to this mountain\u2019s peak. And at the most summit of this mountain, a huge villa stood straight and upright. The style and decoration of this villa in the summit gave people a kind of unsophisticated magnanimous feeling.</p><br/><p>This mountain was called Phoenix God mountain, and that villa at its summit was whole continent wide famous Flame Phoenix villa. Although there were many peoples who wanted to climb to the top of this Phoenix God mountain, and enter Flame Phoenix villa, but thanks to off limit command placed by Flame Phoenix villa, that stated \u2018anyone other than someone invited by villa master are forbidden to enter this mountain, and all the violator are to be kill without any pardon!\u2019</p><br/><p>And at the mid-mountain path of this mountain, 6 peoples wearing black robe with red clouds imprinted in them and wearing bamboo hat in their head were walking towards the summit. This group was naturally Ren Tianyou and others.</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou decided to go to Flame Phoenix villa, they immediately set out, because Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want to wait, because if he dragged on for a long time, then perhaps the resurrection of elder sister Yue\u2019er would become even harder.</p><br/><p>After deciding his next move, Ren Tianyou opened the Naruto system within his body and exchange new pair of eyes. This time he exchanged Uchiha Sasuke\u2019s eyes, because Sasuke\u2019s doujutsu\u2014\u2013 Enton\u2013Kagutsuchi (Inferno Style\u2013 Flame Control) could let him even more easily manipulate Amaterasu\u2019s black flame. And more than anything else, after exchanging Sasuke\u2019s eye, Ren Tianyou could also dream about awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, the supreme form of Sharingan, the evolution method to attain it were extremely severe. After one already awaken Mangekyo Sharingan, one must transplant another pairs of Mangekyo of one\u2019s brother, and after that it relies on one\u2019s talent and ability to achieve it. And till this moment, there were only Grandfather Madara and Sasuke this brat who had successfully awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>By transplanting the eyes of his own younger brother Uchiha Izuna, Uchiha Madara became the first person to ever achieve eyes of eternity. And after the fusion of these two eyes, not only did his eye power became even more powerful, but also developed unique secret jutsu. And under the hoodwinked of Obito, Sasuke this brat carelessly used his Mangekyo\u2019s doujutsu without any restraint, resulting him to greatly reduce his visions. And ultimately under hoodwink and lure of gains from Obito, he transplanted his elder brother Uchiha Itachi\u2019s eyes, successfully becoming second person to ever achieve eyes of eternity.</p><br/><p>This Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan\u2019s eye power is very fascinating. First, it get rid of the curse of getting blind when using doujutsu of Mangekyo Sharingan, letting one to use doujutsu without any menace, as the eyes would possess eternal light. Once upon a time, relying on this Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan\u2019s never wither away ability, Uchiha Madara had conquered various clans, leading Uchiha clan to achieve the most flourishing time, and with Senju clan became two most powerful clan in the ninja world.</p><br/><p>Second, it vastly increases the eye power, even to the extent that, they could easily tame kyuubi (9 Tailed) this paramount tailed beast. Uchiha Madara had used these eyes to tame kyuubi, and fought with Senju Hashirama. And in the battle between Itachi and Sasuke, Itachi had acknowledged that Madara had the ability to control Kyuubi. And after Ren Tianyou thought this, he estimated that after achieving Eternal Mangekyo Saringan, his eyeballs\u2019 supporting capability would also greatly increase, and it was very unlikely to have any big side effects when he used doujutsu. And his eyes would also not suffer for any great injuries. This was quite qualitative improvement.</p><br/><p>Third, he could use complete Susanoo, not that half-body shaped susanoo of normal Mangekyo Sharingan. User could directly magically change into huge mountain like humanoid giant, and user would occupy the forehead location of Susanoo. The entire body of susanoo would be covered with a layer of simple energy battle armor, and possess the power to destroy heaven and exterminate the earth. The single sword slash could easily cleave big mountains, and this mere single slash of the sword would be able to match tailed beasts\u2019 bijudama. Even 5 kages succumbed to the complete Susanoo of Uchiha Madara.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing for Ren Tianyou was, after awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, he would be eligible to upgrade his eyes to the most exalted form of Sharingan, Rinnegan this eyes of creation or destruction. It was still unknown whether Flame Phoenix villa could revive elder sister Yue\u2019er, so he still needs to enhance his eyes as soon as possible, so that he could awaken Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tianyou was thinking about awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, the ban on the panel of Sharingan system to upgrade Eternal Mangekyo lift up. And when Ren Tianyou saw the required number of system points to upgrade, he nearly lost his consciousness. If he wanted to upgrade to Eternal Mangekyo, he required whole 1 million system point. And this was not the most fraudulent, the system warned him, this was most ordinary and also most normal upgrading. If he select this option to upgrade, then only the eye power of Itachi and Sasuke would remain in his eyes, and the remaining Obito\u2019s and his own eye power would disappear for his eyes. And if he want to still retain those powers, then it was very simple, he just need to add system points, i.e. 500,000 system points to each additional pairs of eyes. In other words, if he don\u2019t want to lose ability of other Mangekyo while upgrading to Eternal Mangekyo, then he needs to spend 2 million system points.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was very reluctant to give up these eyes ability. Obito\u2019s kamui was very practical and also not that weak ability. And his own eyes had the ability to control time, which was also very rare ability, so he had no other choice but to select the second type of upgrade method.</p><br/><p>After seeing the required number of system points to exchange Eternal Mangekyo, Ren Tianyou gritted his teeth, either give up, or go through the end, directly exchanged eyes of Shisui too. Anyway have many debts then no worries about additional one debt, and have many louse then no need to worry about tickling. But like this the required number of system to upgrade to Eternal Mangekyo also rose by 500,000, reaching to 2.5 million system points.</p><br/><p>Immediately after seeing this figure, the corner of his mouth began to twitch several times. 250? Is this talking about me or other people? [T.L: 250 means idiot]</p><br/><p>The doujutsu of Shisui\u2014- Kotoamatsukami (Distinguished Heavenly Gods), Ren Tianyou had admired for a long time. He would never give up this kind of doujutsu which could initiate a miracle.</p><br/><p>Kotoamatsukami (Distinguished Heavenly Gods) was known as the strongest genjutsu, second to none. And everything that are branded as strongest shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. In the Naruto world, this genjutsu beat thousands of other genjutsu, even to the extent that even Tsukuyomi was second to this genjutsu. This shows the might of this jutsu.</p><br/><p>Kotoamatsukami (Distinguished Heavenly Gods) could unconsciously manipulate opponent\u2019s thoughts, and let them act according to user\u2019s wish. It was regarded as a miracle doujutsu because the victims himself and other would entirely become unaware that they were being manipulated.</p><br/><p>This jutsu was powerful even to the extent that, it could even break the control of reanimation jutsu caster on the reanimated peoples. This technique have the ability to thoroughly convert good people into evildoer, evildoer into good people, make alive people to commit suicide, free reanimated peoples, and so on. But this justu also had a weakness, i.e. cooldown period of this jutsu was too long. If one didn\u2019t have Senju Hashirama\u2019s chakra, one could use this jutsu once every 10 years, and even if one had Senju Hashirama\u2019s chakra, one would not be able to use this jutsu more than once a single day.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou could find Senju Hashirama\u2019s chakra without any trouble, because inside store system there was Senju Hashirama\u2019s Mokuton (Wood style). Ren Tianyou asked system, \u201cWhy is Mokuton so expensive like this? In Naruto world, there were several people who used mukuton, but their mukuton\u2019s power was far too weak compared to 1st hokage. So if the power of this exchanged mukuton is also too weak like that, then wouldn\u2019t I suffer too much loss?\u201d</p><br/><p>But the answer of system completely satisfied Ren Tianyou, because the system\u2019s mokuton was Senju Hashirama\u2019s intact mokuton. And those pirated versions of Senju Hashirama\u2019s mokuton would not be able to compare the might of system\u2019s mokuton. Moreover after exchanging mokuton kekkei genkai, system would modify Ren Tianyou\u2019s body structure into that of Sage body, then his body would have powerful vitality just like Senju Hashirama.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t bear but roared excitedly, \u201cSystem, your products are certainly fine works.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this, Ren Tianyou directly allowed Little Yu to join Akatsuki organization. Although her actual strength was not too high, merely Earth system Great Magic Master, but it didn\u2019t matter. Ren Tianyou let her join the organization so that to be together with her, and he would also be able to protect her if she was by his side. As for her strength, he would help her to increase later. As Wang Yuxin originated from one of the major 4 clans, Wang clan, her innate talent and blood lineage was also not too low. And her strength was low only comparing to those abnormal geniuses. Ren Tianyou gave Little Yu Santai () ring, then began their following move.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion Bird, you are returning back to your home, but why aren\u2019t you excited even a bit, instead all along you have this bitter expression on your face.\u201d En route, White Tiger looked at Vermilion Bird\u2019s that anxious expression, then asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, I forgot to tell you that, in fact from the time I secretly ran away from home, this is the first time I am returning. So I don\u2019t know how my mother will scold me?\u201d Seeing that they had nearly arrived at Flame Phoenix villa, Vermilion Bird forced a smile on her face as she replied. When she thought about the scene of her mother losing her temper, she involuntarily shuddered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t expect Vermilion Bird, you unexpectedly ran away from your house. Ha ha, I truly have never though that.\u201d Hearing Vermilion Bird, Ren Tianyou suddenly burst into laughter, next White Tiger and other also laughed staring at Vermilion Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this funny?\u201d Seeing her companions were laughing, Vermilion Bird\u2019s complexion instantly became red. Then with a cold murderous look, she stared at Ren Tianyou and others. She especially stared at Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the laughter of all of them stopped, they clearly felt that thick murderous look as they suddenly felt chill. Ren Tianyou saw Vermilion Bird was continuously staring at him, so he lightly coughed few times, raised his head to look at the sky and opened his mouth, \u201cCough cough, today\u2019s sun is very big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I\u2019m dying with laughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Just after Ren Tianyou spoke, White Tiger and others burst out laughing, because currently there was no sun in the sky as today was cloudy day, and the sun was completely blocked by dark clouds. After hearing Ren Tianyou, Vermilion Bird also couldn\u2019t help but laugh, no longer continued to stare Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Vermilion Bird, why did you run away from home?\u201d At this time, Little Yu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was no reason, I merely felt that staying at home was too boring. My mother also never allowed me to go out from the mountain, so I didn\u2019t know anything about the world outside this mountain, as a result I became curious. Therefore one day, I secretly ran away from Flame Phoenix villa.\u201d Vermilion Bird said with a helpless smile. Although she was born in big family, she didn\u2019t have any freedom.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally Flame Phoenix villa.\u201d When everyone were chatting, teasing and walking, the voice of Void who was walking at the front entered their ears. Then the eyes of everyone were drawn towards the front.</p><br/><p>In the summit of mountain in front of them, a huge villa appeared before the eyes of everyone. The area of this villa was very large, compared to Ximen clans\u2019 that Soaring dragon villa, this villa was 7 or 8 times more larger. However this was also understandable, this after all was the supreme headquarter of super big power, so how could it be shabby and miserable.</p><br/><p>In front of large entrance door of Flame Phoenix villa, Ren Tianyou and others saw two beautiful guards dressed in fiery red leather armor. And those guards also similarly discovered Ren Tianyou and others, so they immediately became alert.</p><br/><p>After seeing Flame Phoenix villa, the steps of Ren Tianyou paused, then all of them continued to walk forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

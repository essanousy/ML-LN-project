Peak Transformed Buddha)</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at my strongest state.\u201d Ren Tianyou standing on the head of that giant Buddha, whose body was completely covered with his Susanoo armor, had his palms put together, and similarly the giant Buddha was also maintaining the action of putting the palms together. And after the head of this giant Buddha was covered with Susanoo helmet, he said, \u201cThis is my strongest state after combining my Full Body Susanoo and Sage Art\u2014-True Thousand Hands, Heavenly Buddha Descend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sage Art\u2014-True Thousand Hands, is wood style\u2019s supreme secret technique, can instantly form a nearly 100 meters Thousand Hands Giant Buddha. And now Ren Tianyou had used his Susanoo as the armor for this giant Buddha, which not only greatly increased its already great defensive power, but also sharply increased its attack power. And this was also Ren Tainyou\u2019s final means to rely on.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Under the control of Ren Tianyou, this giant Buddha rushed towards distant Yaorao\u2019s Demonic Buddha.</p><br/><p>Soon these two giants collided, and without any means and without any skill, they only used most direct physical power to collide. With two giants reaching nearly 100 meters directly meeting force with force and colliding with each other, a powerful impact force spread all around with these giants as the center.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa ka\u201d A loud shattering sound resounded, and a huge and long fissure densely covered the ground around.</p><br/><p>And the arms of Demonic Buddha of Yaorao and Ren Tianyou\u2019s Heavenly Buddha firmly held each other\u2019s hands. Both of these giant Buddha were unceasingly emitting power, wanting to rely on their power to overwhelm other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, overestimating your capability!\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou standing on the head of giant Buddha, Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha coldly snorted and sneered appeared on her mouth. Shortly afterwards, she made hand signs, and purple colored sigil flew out from her hands, then a huge purple colored halo appeared behind Demonic Buddha.</p><br/><p>Along with the appearance of this purple colored sigil, suddenly a loud sound as if Heavenly Buddha was singing sound resounded between the heaven and earth, seemingly only this sound was remained under the entire sky.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, behind this Demonic Buddha, suddenly a nearly 200 meters huge statue of Buddha sitting cross-legged with purple colored radiance flashing around it appeared, and this statue of Buddha stretched out its huge right hand. In front of this suddenly appeared energy purple colored statue of Buddha, Ren Tianyou\u2019s that giant True Thousand Hands however looked like a child.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Moves the Mountain and Rivers!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the explosive shout of Yaorao inside Demonic Buddha, that heaven concealing huge right hand of that huge Buddha behind her swatted towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Under this heaven concealing huge hand, Ren Tianyou felt great sense of pressure, as if he was not facing a person rather the heaven, and he felt that he was incapable of stopping this move. Now he felt that his strength which he was intensely proud of was really too insignificant in front of Yaorao\u2019s this absolute strength.</p><br/><p>But at this time, in the brain of Ren Tianyou appeared a scene of how he got together with Little Yu with great difficulty, and with her weak and tender disposition, if he died then what would she do? Moreover his elders sister Yue\u2019er who was resurrected with great difficulty, how sad she would be if he died? Furthermore there were still White Tiger and others, his life and death companions.</p><br/><p>And finally appeared the scene of, when all nine tailed-beasts were swallowed by Gedo Statue, all of them resolutely saying those words to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou slowly raised his hand, and looked towards that heaven concealing hand that had already covered the entire sky above him, he recalled the sacrifice of nine tailed-beasts for him, then the fighting will slowly ignited again in his heart.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou gathered all the chakra within his body, then quickly made a series of hand seals. And at the same time, his Rinnegan also emitted large amount of eye power, and the surrounding Susanoo glimmered with purple colored lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenpo\u2014-Chojo Kebutsu!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou finished making hand seals, he placed his palms together, then shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>Along with the completion of ninjutsu, the eyes of giant Buddha suddenly flashed with bright radiance as if alive. After that those thousand hands behind giant Buddha moved, and with all hands changing into fists, they punched towards those huge hand in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019\u2026\u2026a series of loud sound resounded. Countless arms hit the giant hand above, issuing a thunderous sound. And under the grand power of that heaven concealing hand, countless arms also broke and changing into wood, they fell down. But even more hands would replace those broken ones to punch towards that huge hand.</p><br/><p>Under the attack of Chojo Kebutsu combined with the power of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, the attack power of this giant hand was finally depleted, and slowly dissipated in the air. Moreover that huge statue of Buddha behind Yaorao also disappeared slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuhu!\u201d After seeing that huge hand had disappeared, the complexion of Ren Tianyou loosened, and he fell down to one knee on the head of giant Buddha, then began breathing heavily, while unceasingly shouting loudly in his heart, \u201cFinally stopped, Shukaku, Kuruma, I didn\u2019t disappoint your expectation. I will definitely win this fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I still underestimated you.\u201d Looking at heavily breathing Ren Tianyou, Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha slowly said. But seeing that incomparably dim Susanoo around the huge body of giant Buddha, a sneer appeared on her face, \u201cBut do you still have the ability to stop my attacks again? Now let me split open your tortoise shell, and send you to meet Death God, then I will retrieve the thing that should originally belongs to me from your corpse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Demonic Buddha\u2019s right hand slowly raised Void Slaying Sword which was emitting powerful sword light, and under the control of Yaorao, it chopped down. With the space in front of this sword breaking into pieces, it directly chopped down towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s giant Buddha.</p><br/><p>With a \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, the Susanoo armor was instantly shattered, and the giant Buddha created by True Thousand Hands also was chopped into by this sword. Then changing into pieces of woods, they rained down from the sky. As for Ren Tianyou, under Rinnegan\u2019s remaining eye power, he used Baleful Transposition to instantly land on the distant ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other means do you have now?\u201d After splitting open the last defense of Ren Tianyou, Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha indifferently looked at Ren Tianyou, and slowly raising Void Slaying Sword once again, she said, \u201cIn front of absolute strength, any of your stratagem will not ensure success, now you no longer have a chance, just go and report to Death God, that old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly stood up from the ground. Even though he was wounded all over, he still had a smile on his face, \u201cTime has come, it\u2019s time to draw a full stop to this battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, Uchiha flame formation was shattered with a bang. And with a huge sound of explosion of barrier breaking resounding throughout the horizon, and a huge dusts and smokes rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026?\u201d The eyes of Yaorao standing within Demonic Buddha flashed with purple radiances. Just now in the midst of explosion dusts and smokes, she had indistinctly seen a huge figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to end everything.\u201d Looking at the center of the explosion, the Rinnegan of Ren Tianyou who was standing far away shone, then he rushed towards the center of explosion without any hesitation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

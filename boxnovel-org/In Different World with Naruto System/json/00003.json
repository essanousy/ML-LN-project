Soon a white rabbit appeared in front of him. From his memory, he knew that this rabbit was a class 1 magical beast called \u2018Rumbling Rabbit\u2019. Other than firing Water Arrow, it could do nothing.</p><br/><p>He quickly advance toward that rabbit, and at this moment the Rumbling Rabbit also notice him. Facing him, it fired a water arrow, turned around and started to run.</p><br/><p>At this time, his body suddenly erupted with weak white colored radiance, this was his original battle qi cultivation. However, this battle qi amount was too low and it enclosed his body extremely weakly. It looked like it could disappear at any moment and he could only use it for an extremely short period of time.</p><br/><p>And his new cultivation of chakra was even more lacking, after all he had only cultivated chakra for a couple of hours.</p><br/><p>With the help of his battle qi, he dodged the Water Arrow and ran towards the Rumbling Rabbit and attacked it with his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>His fist landed on Rumbling Rabbit, causing that Rumbling Rabbit to fly out and roll on the ground. After which it directly fainted.</p><br/><p>He ran toward the fainted rabbit, picked it up by its ears, and then ended its life by twisting its neck with his other hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing: Congratulations, host for killing your first magical beast, Rumbling Rabbit. You earned 10 system points.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, the system voice rang in his ear. After that, he opened the system. Sure enough, his system points had already increased to 110. Not bad, hunting and getting system points, not a bad business.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, this battle qi is quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought for a while, even with this weak battle qi, his speed and attack power had suddenly increased.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cultivation system deserves to be called the millions \u00adyear heritage of the Divine Wind Continent. But I have ninjutsu, so I don\u2019t need to care much about this battle qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted the dead body of the Rumbling Rabbit, walked towards the stream and started to peel off the skin. Originally doing these types of things was quite difficult for the previous him, but now he had battle qi so now it was quite easy.</p><br/><p>However after completely peeling off the skin, worry appeared on his face. \u201cAfter all this time I, your father do not have fire ah.\u201d His battle qi was not fire attributed but wind attributed battle qi. Fire ninjutsu!? He had only cultivated chakra for a couple of hours and he didn\u2019t know even the simplest taijutsu which was the easiest among the three, not to mention fire style ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, I, your father cannot eat it raw.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gloomily scratched his head, and looked at the rabbit meat. He considered eating it raw but seeing that the meat was still dripping blood, he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no other way but to force myself to use our ancestors\u2019 ways, drill wood to make fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking this, he was already going to die from hunger. So he forced himself to stand up and search for a piece of dead wood. After that he found a little branch, put a bits of dry grass on it and with a serious look he started to turn and twist the branch above the dead tree piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the sake of food, stake it all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the rapid turn and twist, he saw some smoke emerged above the piece of dead wood, and quickly after that a surge of flame was lit. [ED: This is nowhere near as easy as this in our world]</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, got a fire, I, your father no longer need to eat raw meat like a barbarian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the fire, he was so happy that he almost jumped up. At last, he no longer needed to eat raw meat. He immediately stood near the fire, pierced a branch through the rabbit meat and started to roast it. After about half an hour, he could no longer endure his hunger and birds were fluttering around the roasted meat because of its aroma.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using his battle qi to wrap his hand to deal with heat, he quickly took the meat, tore it and threw some of it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHum, although there was no seasoning, this meat of magical beast is still delicious. Oily but not greasy, unexpectedly compared to this meat, the meat from Earth is as dull and dry as bark, and is not oily but greasy to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>He ate all the rabbit meat completely in a short time. He was surprised, even after that meat entered his stomach, he was still hungry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder all the ninjas inside of Naruto had big appetites, Naruto in particular even ate 8 large bowls of ramen. At that time I had secretly smacked my lips in disapproval with Kishimoto a bit. I didn\u2019t expect cultivating chakra consume this much energy from body ah.\u201d He recalled the time when he was watching Naruto and those ninjas having a huge appetite. No wonder those ninjas often went to complete tasks for earning money. Otherwise, just eating would make them poor.</p><br/><p>With no other way, he forced himself to stand and go hunting. He continued to hunt and eat Rumbling Rabbits until he was completely full.</p><br/><p>\u201c*burp*\u2026\u2026\u2026finally full.\u201d</p><br/><p>He finally let out a burp of satisfaction. Seeing the bones of the Rumbling Rabbits around him, he couldn\u2019t help but blushed with shame as he never thought that he would also turn into a glutton. If it was on Earth, eating half of this rabbit meat would be incredible for him.</p><br/><p>After finishing eating, he decided to continue cultivating his chakra. This world was not like his previous world, here a single person can simply toss a stone and kill 8 out of 10 people who are stronger than him. Not to mention him.</p><br/><p>Beside this, previously on Earth he was extremely fond and dreamed of becoming a ninja, and now he got a chance to realize this dream. So how can he not be excited to cultivate chakra?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, I still don\u2019t know my chakra attribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about cultivating chakra, he was curious about his chakra attribute. Finally to know his chakra attribute, he couldn\u2019t help but became excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have any chakra attribute testing paper ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was very impatient to know his chakra attributes but for this he needed chakra testing paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, why am I so stupid? I already have the Naruto System.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hit his head and also cursed himself, hurriedly opened the Naruto System and went to the Store. Thanks to this system he could learn ninjutsu, and he had directly started to learn cultivating chakra and hadn\u2019t paid any attentive to this Store System. Now was the first time he had opened to see it. Good heavens, inside the Store there was a wide variety of things. There were basic ninja tools like kunai, shuriken, detonating paper and all other essentials, to the extent that there was even the clothing of all lead characters of the Naruto world such as Naruto\u2019s clothes, Sasuke\u2019s clothes, Akatuski\u2019s clothes and even different kinds of masks. And there was even the thing that make him completely ashamed, that was a lighter, correct a lighter. Just now he had drilled a wood to make a fire but here he found a lighter, this made him depressed.</p><br/><p>The lighter could be exchanged with 2 system points which he exchanged immediately. And after that, he found chakra attribute testing paper too, which could be exchanged with 10 system points. He immediately exchanged it too.</p><br/><p>After this, he turned off the system and took out the chakra testing paper which he had exchanged just a moment ago. Slowly he started to channel a little bit of his chakra into this paper.</p><br/><p>As its name suggest, chakra attribute testing paper is a type of paper which tests the attribute of chakra. Chakra attributes are classified into fire, wind, earth, water and lighting. If the chakra is fire attribute then this paper will burn, if it is wind attribute then it splits into two, if it is earth attribute then it will disintegrate, if it is water attribute then it will become wet and finally if it is lightning attribute then it will wrinkle. If you have all 5 attribute then one part will burn, one part will split open, one part will disintegrate, one part will become wet and last part will wrinkle.</p><br/><p>And when Ren Tian You channeled his chakra into this paper, first the paper wrinkled, then it split into two and finally one part caught the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnexpectedly my chakra is 3 attributed\u2014\u00adlightning, wind and fire, I\u2019m quite lucky. However this fire attribute should be because of Sharingan.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the members of Uchiha clan, having the Sharingan, are natural masters of the fire style. And now Ren Tian You was quite excited as all of his attribute was attack oriented.</p><br/><p>With the lightning attribute he could learn Chidori or Raikiri and furthermore that S \u00adclass ninjutsu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2018Kirin\u2019. With the wind attribute he could learn the super BUG class ninjutsu which he had admired for a long time\u2014\u2014\u00ad \u2018Rasenshuriken\u2019. Fire attribute power is not bad, he had seen Madara release \u2018Katon: Gouka Mekkyaku\u2019 [Fire Style: Majestic Destroyer Flame] and only after ten other ninja released Water Wall Jutsu had they blocked it.</p><br/><p>After knowing his own chakra attributes, he started to cultivate chakra in a very good mood.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

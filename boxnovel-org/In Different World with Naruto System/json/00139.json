As a member of ancient 100 clans, he clearly understand that these types of big power of humankinds are not that easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore anything else, I still have a small matter that needs to be done. If there is nothing for you to do here, then you can hurry over to Ailer Empire. And after I finish this small matter, I will also immediately hurry over there. When all is said and done my speed is much faster than you.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a matter? What is that matter?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo said with a bit of surprise. He didn\u2019t understand what other matter was more important than going to Ximen clan. Li Jianrong also curiously looked towards Ren Tianyou and wanted to know what this other matter was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore going to Ximen clan, I want to go to Tower of Babel.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked towards the direction of academy, slightly sighed, and replied them. If he were to go to Ximen clan now, according to his temperament, he would definitely cause a great havoc in that place. And at that time, if he were to encounter those peoples who used to bully him, he would absolutely go on a killing spree. Let\u2019s say, luckily he was able to completely annihilate Ximen clan, or he was able to partially destroy Ximen clan, after that, he would definitely be chase to kill in this whole continent. And at that time, he absolutely couldn\u2019t come back to the academy, and he would not have another chance to go to Tower of Babel. As a result, Ren Tianyou decided to explore Tower of Babel first, and after completing this matter, he would directly head to Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I hope you rush over as soon as possible. We will make a move only after you arrive there.\u201d Listening to Ren Tianyou, Li Jianrong nodded his head and said. He clearly knew that Ren Tianyou could use space magic to travel, as he had personally experienced that mystical space magic of Ren Tianyou. So he agreed to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we will now hurry over to Ailer Empire\u2019s Ximen can. Then we will try to find out more about the current circumstances, and make our preparations.\u201d Yan Xinluo said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, in that case, White tiger and Void, both of you hurry over to Ailer Empire. After I finish exploring Tower of Babel, I will also immediately hurry over there.\u201dRen Tianyou nodded his head, and agreed with Yan Xinluo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, then we are off.\u201d Li Jianrong nodded, after that both Li Jianrong and Yan Xinluo disappeared from that location. Looking at place from where the duo had disappeared, the Sharingan unconsciously manifested itself, and extremely dense and powerful killing intend was clearly visible in them. \u201cXimen clan\u2026\u2026\u2026.Humph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Then next morning, inside the office of the dean, dean Long Feilu was sitting on the seat. And there were more than 10 peoples standing in front of him. Today these peoples were preparing to enter Tower of Babel, and Ren Tianyou was naturally among them.</p><br/><p>After returning to Supreme Light academy yesterday, he directly went to South Yuan hall and handed over the item of the trial by fire assignment. And naturally the person in charge of the South Yuan hall exclaimed in admiration at the efficiency of Ren Tianyou. After completing the formalities of the assignment, he obtained the qualification to enter Tower of Babel. But Tower of Babel could only be opened at 10 o\u2019 clock every day, and the dean of the academy would personally lead them there. So Ren Tianyou was forced to wait for a day, and when he arrived at the office of dean, Ren Tianyou nevertheless became surprised. He saw several familiar person among the group of people who were going to enter the Tower of Babel at this time. Feng Wu from Flame phoenix villa, and also Li Xinyun who had slapped him were among the group. When they saw Ren Tianyou, both of them were extremely surprised, nevertheless the reaction of these 2 women had nothing in common with each other. Seeing Ren Tianyou, Feng Wu released faintly discernable fighting intent, and her eyes were also burning, she was clearly dissatisfied for losing a fight against him. As for Li Xinyun, her expression was even more complex. Last time he had held her in his embrace, and she had slapped him, and that slap was still fresh in his memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, everyone is here. Follow me, I will lead you to the Tower of Babel.\u201d Long Feilu saw that the time was almost there, and then looked at the peoples who would be entering Tower of Babel today. After that he got up and ordered Ren Tainyou and others to follow him and started to walk towards the interior of the room, yes, interior of the room.</p><br/><p>Long Feilu walked to the corner of the room, and under the curious eyes of the students, he twisted a protruding stone block on the wall. Suddenly along with \u2018ka\u2019, \u2018ka\u2019 sound, the wall in front of him started to rise and expose a dim path.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Long Feilu notified, then took the lead and enter the dark path. Seeing this Ren Tianyou and others were dumbfounded, then everyone entered this dim path in succession following Long Feilu.</p><br/><p>Entering this dim path, they saw several small magic lamps on the walls, dimly illuminating this path. This dim path was very short, after walking about less than a minute, the reach the end of this path. And a narrow small chamber appeared in front of Ren Tianyou and others. There was nothing inside this chamber, with the exception of a magic formation on the ground of this chamber. A silver-white colored energy had sketched out this entire magic formation, and this formation was filled with mysterious aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace transmission formation?\u201d At this time, Feng Wu who was at the side of Ren Tianyou used her right hand to cover her sexy fiery hot red lips, and exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, never thought that the eyesight of this little girl is this good.\u201d Hearing the surprise voice of Feng Wu, Long Feilu was surprised that someone was able to recognize the space transmission formation which was basically already extinct from Divine Wind continent. Only very few forces of this continent still have the space transmission formation. \u201cYes, this is space transmission formation. We are going to use this magic formation to go to Tower of Babel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Long Feilu, every students were surprised, and all of them looked at this magic formation. For them this space transmission formation was just a myth, but today they have the chance to personally experience this space transmission formation, so everyone were extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Even though Ren Tianyou already had the Mangekyo of Obito, and could use space-time doujutsu, nevertheless he couldn\u2019t help but was curious about this magic formation. So he carefully observed this magic formation with his Saringan. Currently he could use space-time ninjutsu relying on the Mangekyo of Obito, but it was basically still impossible for him to use space-time ninjutsu without relying on his doujutsu. So he thought that if he study this magic formation, then perhaps this could help him to learn Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu), or even develop his own space-time ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>But time do not wait for people, very quickly Long Feilu notified all of them to stand above the magic formation, after that he prepared to activate the space transmission formation. Ren Tianyou had no choice but to reluctantly go and stand above the magic formation with other students. Seeing that all the students were standing above the magic formation, Long Feilu also entered the magic formation, and threw several magic cores inside the several small hole around the magic formation. After that he started to silently mutter magic incantation. Very quickly a silver colored radiance rose from the magic formation and surrounded all of them. After that along with a \u2018swish\u2019 sound, everyone disappeared from this chamber.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

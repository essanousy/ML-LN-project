In the darkness, Ren Tainyou\u2019s pair of eyes firmly stared at Xing Lu who had just entered the room, and his eyes revealed complicated expression.</p><br/><p>After discovering the Spring of Life which he had gotten was fake, Ren Tianyou immediately used kamui and stealthily entered Elf source. With this practical doujutsu kamui, plus with all the ninjutsu he had learned from Naruto system which could be rated as encyclopedia of ninjutsu, he had directly entered the room of Xing Lu without arousing any attention of those patrolling elves all along the road.</p><br/><p>Why did Ren Tianyou directly go to the room of Xing Lu? That was naturally because Ren Tianyou thought that he would be able to get the location of Spring of Life from her mouth, otherwise if he blindly look for Spring of Life, not only would he not obtain it, perhaps he might arose the attention of the experts of Elf clan too.</p><br/><p>And as for those who knew the location of Spring of Life, Ren Tianyou believed that with the exception of Elf Queen, most likely only those 4 elders and Elf Queen\u2019s daughter Xing Lu would know about it. And unless he had a pit in his brain, he would absolutely choose Xing Lu among them.</p><br/><p>First, as a daughter of Elf Queen, Xing Lu was closest person to Elf Queen, so she would definitely know more than those elders. After all regardless of who, people have selfish heart, so certain extremely secret matters, with the exception of their closest person, they would not let other peoples know casually. Just like how much money do you have in your house, with the exception of your wife, parents and children, do you tell other peoples about this causally?</p><br/><p>Second, and the most important point. Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t dare to go to the room of those 4 elders, yes, he didn\u2019t dare to go. Although the strength of Ren Tianyou was very high now, already stepped into initial kage level, but currently he could truly fight and kill single High God only with great difficulty. Just like last time at Ximen clan, he used the full power of his susanoo once, and after using it, he exhausted almost all of his chakra. And without chakra, Ren Tianyou was just a waste, and if he encounter enemy or people with evil plan towards him at that time, he won\u2019t have any means to resist. And if he encountered True God realm expert, then he could only run away. However fortunately he had 2 tailed beasts.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou however didn\u2019t want to use Susanoo or summoning jutsu here. If someone tells Ren Tianyou that one of the ancient 100 clans\u2019 Elf clan only have one True God and four High God realm experts, then even if he got beaten to death, he won\u2019t believe it. And he was also not sure whether he could conceal himself from High God, not to mention controlling and getting information from them using his Sharingan.</p><br/><p>Although Sharingan was powerful, but also depend upon whom it was used against. If Ren Tianyou had Madara like strength, then using ordinary 3 magatama Sharingan, he would be able to completely control these High Gods, but current Ren Tianyou even if he used Mangekyo Sharingan, he would not be able to properly control them. This was the gap of strength, just like it is impossible for kid holding a magic weapon to defeat expert holding kunai. This was the same kind of principle.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou saw Xing Lu had already closed the door of her room. Then his body immediately flashed, and quietly appeared behind her.</p><br/><p>And after closing the door of her room, Xing Lu turned her body intending to go to bathroom to take a bath, but just after turning, she discovered a person was standing in front of her. From the dress, it seems like this person was the same person who had intrude Elf Source and injured her today, so just when she wanted to open her mouth and scream, that person\u2019s scarlet eyes suddenly rotated rapidly, and she felt her eye lids increasingly getting heavier, slowly unable to open it, and her consciousness increasingly blurred, and finally didn\u2019t know anything at all.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked at Xing Lu who was already trapped inside his illusion, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile, as he asked, \u201cTell me the location of Spring of Life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority of Spring of Life is located inside the secret room under the floor of my mother bedroom\u2019s bed, and she also have some Spring of Life inside her space ring.\u201d With dull eyes, Xing Lu answered everything she knew without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, the location of Spring of Life is too good.\u201d Hearing the answer of Xing Lu, the complexion of Ren Tianyou immediately become bitter. He had already guessed that the location of Spring of Life wouldn\u2019t be ordinary, but didn\u2019t expect it would be located inside the bedroom of Elf Queen. This instantly cause Ren Tianyou to feel great pressure. Stealing a thing from inside the bedroom of True God realm expert, oh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026seems to be very challenging.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where is the place that produce Spring of Life?\u201d Ren Tianyou thought for a while, and asked Xing Lu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpring of Life is produced in Tree of Life. Each year it produces merely a bottle. Only at the end of every year, it is produced, so now there isn\u2019t any Spring of Life.\u201d Xing Lu continued to explain everything she knew systematically and in full details.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this Tree of Life?\u201d Ren Tianyou asked curiously. What kind of thing was actually able to produce such mystical spring water that is actually capable to increase lifespan of people, as well as making them young forever?</p><br/><p>\u201cTree of Life is all of us elves\u2019 mother. Precisely because of this Tree of Life, we elves obtain life. Tree of Life gave birth to us elves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Tree of Life is full of powerful life-force. If we heavily injured elves return to the side of mother tree, all our injuries would immediately healed by Tree of Life, even the broken legs or severed hands will be recovered anew.\u201d Xing Lu dully told everything she knew to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, isn\u2019t this so awesome.\u201d Hearing Xing Lu, Ren Tianyou instantly burst out with swear words, and his two eyes suddenly emitted green lights, Ren Tianyou was jealous of this terrifying healing ability. In the Naruto world, with the exception of 1st hokage Senju Hasirama\u2019s sage body, no one else was able to achieve this. Even the Uzumaki clan who had tenacious life-force just like cockroach were also not capable. In this moment, the attention of Ren Tianyou was attracted to Tree of Life.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it is like that, first I will obtain Spring of Life, and after that I will go to Tree of Life to see it.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought slowly, then he looked at Xing Lu who was standing in front of her, used his right eyes\u2019 kamui, and directly sucked her inside the kamui dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this time just like Grandson monkey stealing Most Exalted Lord Lao\u2019s elixir of life [, anyone have better words for this?], I will definitely steal all the stock up Spring of Life of your Elf clan, this will be the consequence for deceiving me with fake water.\u201d Ren Tianou laughed mischievously. And with a sinister smile on his face, Ren Tianyou continued, \u201cAh pei, I, you father is taking, correct, am taking, not stealing. I\u2019m such a clean and honest person, how can I steal things?\u201d Finished speaking, the figure of Ren Tianyou disappeared along with the spiral shaped space ripple from inside the room of Xing Lu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And after I summon other tailed beast, take action according to our original plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, no problem.\u201d Sanbi answered in its muffled voice. And after Sanbi agreed, Ren Tianyou slowly walked on the surface of water towards Dragon Island.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou slowly walking on the water towards them, Dragon Emperor and four princes above the Dragon Island couldn\u2019t help but narrowed their eyes, and prepared themselves to fly out and attack Ren Tianyou. Because at their level, any casual move could cause great damage to the surrounding environment. So if they stayed in the island, then that would be very unfavorable for them, as it was very likely for them to accidently destroy Dragon island.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to fly, who gave you permission?\u201d Seeing dragons wanted to fly, Ren Tianyou sneered. Shortly afterwards, the sea surface in front began to violently roll over and over, as he heard the voice roar of Sanbi Isobi, \u201cWater Style\u2014-Water Flooding Golden Field!\u201d [T.L: \u2014\u2014, don\u2019t know which jutsu it is, if you have any idea, comment below. Thanks]</p><br/><p>Along with Sanbi\u2019s voice, from the sea surface in front, suddenly a monstrous wave reaching up to seven or eight meters high suddenly advanced towards Dragon Island.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Dragon Domain\u2019s Wall!\u201d Seeing this rolling over and over huge sea wave, the eyes of Camilla flashed with disdain, followed by him waving his right hand, causing a huge dim golden colored energy protective screen to appear in the sky in front of Dragon Island. This protective screen safely stopped that monstrous wave outside the Dragon Island, was not able to intrude even a tiny bit of Dragon Island.</p><br/><p>But just at this time, in the sky above this sea wave, Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared. And his hands were quickly making a series of hand seals. \u201cKaton\u2014- Goka Mekkyaku (Fire Style\u2014-Majestic Destroyer Flame!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, he spat out wide ranged blazing flame with surging heat wave from his mouth towards everyone underneath him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly Domain!\u201d Holy radiance rose from the body of third prince Brook, which changed into huge energy barrier in front of everyone, firmly blocking Ren Tianyou\u2019s flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, let\u2019s see how you block this, Enton\u2014-Kagutsuchi! (Inferno Style\u2014-Flame Control!)\u201d Ren Tianyou\u2019s right Sharingan spun rapidly, and huge amount of eye power gushed out, then the blazing flame created by Ren Tianyou\u2019s fire style quickly gathered together and its form changed greatly.</p><br/><p>And along with a loud dragon roar sound, nine huge flame dragon came out from inside the gathered flame, then pressed forward with an indomitable will towards underneath Holy Domain set up by Brook.</p><br/><p>Enton\u2014-Kagutsuchi (Inferno Style\u2014-Flame Control), after Uchiha Sasuke awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan, this was his right eye\u2019s doujutsu. This jutsu could control morphological change of Amaterasu\u2019s eternal black flame.</p><br/><p>When Sasuke was fighting against Raikage, he had controlled flame of Amaterasu to take the form of Amaterasu defense around his body, to counter the speed of Raikage, making Raikage unable to attack him casually.</p><br/><p>This Kagutsuchi (Flame Control) was able to control even Amaterasu\u2019s this kind of eternal black flame, so how could it not control ordinary flames. Moreover in Japanese myth, Kagutsuchi in itself was God of Fire, who could control myriads of flame.</p><br/><p>These nine flame dragons under the control of Ren Tianyou\u2019s doujutsu Enton\u2014-Kagutsuchi (Inferno Style\u2014-Flame Control), pressed forward with indomitable will momentum and lashed on underneath Holy Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong\u201d, \u201chong\u201d, \u201chong\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..extraordinarily large explosion sound unceasingly resounded. Under the assault five flame dragon in quick succession, this originally bright Holy Domain become incomparably dim, as if it would disappear at any time. Then under the assault of additional two flame dragon, this Holy Dragon changed into specks of holy element and dissipated in the air. And the remaining two flame dragons and huge flame created by Ren Tianyou continued to advance towards underneath people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Holy Storm!\u201d Seeing huge flame and flame dragon flying towards them, Dragon Emperor frowned, then with a wave of his right hand, terrifying holy element flew out from his right hand which changed into huge energy vortex flying towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s incoming attacks.</p><br/><p>The first to be affected was two huge flame dragon in the front. Without any time to even reflect, they were directly swallowed by this terrifying energy Holy Storm, next the remaining huge flame was also completely swallowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite competent.\u201d Seeing his attacks were blocked, without even a hint of fretting, he jumped down from the sky directly towards Dragon Emperor and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect even before we came to you, you actually came here yourself to court death. This just so happens to save our time to find you.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou in front of him, Dragon Emperor said to Ren Tianyou in a tone densely filled with killing intent, and was also staring at Ren Tianyou as if he wanted to swallow him up in this instant.</p><br/><p>More than 20 dragons had already met their death in the hand of Ren Tianyou, so he and Dragon clan were already mortal enemy. Moreover Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any good impression of Dragon clan. All day long they believed they were high above the masses, and were the ruler of this world. Furthermore they were helper of his mortal enemy Ximen clan, so how could Ren Tianyou have any good impression on them.</p><br/><p>As for Dragon clan, all of them take a great pride on their existence. But now more than 20 dragons had died in the hand of Ren Tianyou, so with their matchless proud nature, how could they let Ren Tianyou slip by. As a result this fight was already doomed to happen sooner or later, merely Ren Tianyou choose to fight sooner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho will kill who is still unknown, perhaps today could be the day of your Dragon clan\u2019s extinction.\u201d Hearing Dragon Emperor\u2019s those words filled with killing intent, Ren Tianyou smiled in disdain, and then shrugging his shoulder, he indifferently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar, you damned bastard, I had already stated I will definitely butcher you before. So now go to hell, Sky Dragon\u2019s explosion!\u201d Just at that time, in the sky directly in front of Ren Tianyou, Camilla appeared and swung his right fist which was covered a dim golden radiance towards Ren Tianyou\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Last time in Magic Domain, Ren Tianyou had actually killed one of the High God realm dragon silently in his presence. So how could he who was usually extremely proud of himself bear this insult? Moreover after returning to Dragon Island, he was severely reprimand by Dragon Emperor too, so if he could he would have already peel off the skin and pull out the tendons of Ren Tianyou. As a matter of fact, when Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared, the very first person that couldn\u2019t bear any longer was him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Looking at Camilla\u2019s fists covered with dim golden radiances flying toward him, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted, then pulled out Uchiha Round Fan from his back with his right hand, and placed it in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d The fist of Camilla hit Ren Tianyou\u2019s Uchiha Round Fan, \u201cExplode for me.\u201d Yelled Camilla, and his right fist\u2019s dim golden radiance flickered even more violently.</p><br/><p>But to his disappointment, this radiance of light not only failed to explode, but was also slowly absorbed by Ren Tianyou\u2019s Uchiha Round Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d Seeing the bizarre scene before his eyes, Camilla instantly had ominous foreboding.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Ren Tianyou behind the Uchiha Round Fan was flashing with a smile, then he slowly spat out few words, \u201cUchihagaeshi! (Uchiha Reflection!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the words of Ren Tianyou, the Uchiha Round Fan instantly glimmered with dim golden radiance, which directly attacked Camilla who was already too late to defend. The huge explosion had thoroughly hit his body sending him flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamilla!\u201d Seeing Camilla was sent flying, Dragon Emperor instantly appeared behind Camilla and caught him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you, is everything alright?\u201d Putting down Camilla, Dragon Emperor asked in concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks Emperor Father, I am fine, only injured slightly, no big problem.\u201d Camilla wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and settling down his violently rolling over and over qi and blood within his body, he slowly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe more careful, this guy is tough, don\u2019t be reckless.\u201d Dragon Emperor warned, then looked towards the huge cloud of dust raised due to explosion.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou slowly walked out, then looking at those Dragon Emperor, Camilla and his brothers, furthermore other hundred or so dragons flying in the sky, Ren Tianyou bit the thumbs of both hand. After blood flowed out from his thumbs, he said, \u201cLooking at your stance, isn\u2019t this wanting to have a group brawl?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026..\u201d Ren Tianyou\u2019s eyes suddenly glimmered with stern countenance, both hands quickly made a series of hand seals, then placed his both hand on the ground in from of him, causing huge formation to appear, \u201cLet\u2019s see whose helper is biggest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose no Jutsu! (Summoning Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

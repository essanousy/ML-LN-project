That person was our benefactor, but you flounced out like this, wasn\u2019t that very rude?\u201d In the midair, Fang Qian who was tightly holding the shoulder of Bu Feng curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cQian\u2019er, you don\u2019t know the reason, that fellow saved us with bad intention.\u201d Bu Feng answered while shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you saying that?\u201d Hearing the words of Bu Feng, Fang Qian felt somewhat odd and asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain to you after we get to a safe location,\u201d Bu Feng shook his head. Although Ren Tianyou had not followed them, but he still didn\u2019t dare to be careless.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Fang Qian nodded her head and no longer asked another question. They were together since childhood, experienced trials and tribulations together for many years, and had a complete trust in each other, so she didn\u2019t ask any question again.</p><br/><p>After rapidly flying for nearly an hour, they arrived to a nameless mountain top. After that Bu Feng and Fang Qian slowly descended from the sky.</p><br/><p>After finding a place to sit down, Bu Feng narrated from the beginning about the matter of him trying to assassinate the members of Akatsuki organization, then him being chased by Ren Tianyou, furthermore Ren Tianyou inviting him to join his organization just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I urgently take you away for there. Moreover the strength of that fellow is unfathomable, even if we two combined our strength to fight against him, we are definitely not a match for him. So it was best for us to quickly leave that place.\u201d Bu Feng sat beside Fang Qian and slowly explained to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that.\u201d Fang Qian nodded her head. Then looking at Bu Feng\u2019s that a little bit tired face, she reached out her hard and gently caressed his face, while softly saying, \u201cLittle Feng, these past few years were really painful for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, its fine Qian\u2019er. Now all our bitterness ends and the sweetness begins. Form this day forth, I want to accompany you to walk around every nook and corner of this Divine Wind Continent.\u201d Bu Feng placed his hand on the face of Fang Qian, and gently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are quite affectionate, but I will be disturbing you two this time.\u201d At this time, a voice suddenly resounded, interrupting Bu Feng and Fang Qian\u2019s touching conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Hearing the sudden voice, Bu Feng and Fang Qian immediately reacted. They instantly jumped up from the rock they were sitting, then Bu Feng took out his dagger from his waist and Fang Qian also took out magic wand with was glimmering with pure white holy light, afterwards looked all around.</p><br/><p>After that they immediately saw Ren Tianyou not far away in their left side, who was standing while folding his arms in front of his chest and looking at them with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou? How can this be? How can you be here, I should have already shook you off from my tail.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou, the face of Bu Feng was filled with disbelief, and he asked Ren Tianyou in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you are able to run past my control? You can\u2019t run away from me.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026!\u201d Seeing that evil smile on the face of Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng immediately breathe heavily, and he didn\u2019t know what to say. But at this moment, he suddenly recalled how Ren Tianyou had instantly taken both him and Fang Qian several thousand meters away from Light Temple. \u201cYou can actually use space magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I can indeed use space magic. Now you know this, you should be clear that no matter what, you two can\u2019t escape from my control.\u201d Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t deny, because everyone in the continent already knew the matter of him being able to use space magic, so there was nothing good to conceal it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, this fellow can really use space magic, what should I do now, even if my speed is very fast, it is not comparable to space teleportation.\u201d This moment, Bu Feng continuously thought countermeasures, but there was no effective method.</p><br/><p>And currently those beautiful eyes of Fang Qian were filled with shock, she had never thought that this young man before her eyes was actually able to use mysterious space magic. As a Holy Maiden of Light Temple, she was clear about the strength of space magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, want to continue playing? I will not use space magic, but if I am able to stop both of you from leaving, then you must join, and if I am not able to prevent, then I will naturally not bother you both again.\u201d Seeing the unwilling face of Bu Feng, Ren Tianyou slowly said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really mean what you say?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Bu Feng suddenly saw a hope. He immediately looked towards Ren Tianyou, and conformed. Bu Feng was completely confident that no one was able to stop him, if space magic was not used.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, although I, Zero am not a good person, but I never go back on my words.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered with a slight smile. But Bu Feng and Fang Qian didn\u2019t notice the scheme behind this slight smile of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, if it is like that, then I will agree to it.\u201d Bu Feng nodded his head while agreeing to the condition of Ren Tianyou. After that walked towards the side of Fang Qian, and said in a low voice, \u201cQian\u2019er, firmly hold onto me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Little Feng.\u201d Fang Qian nodded her head, and tightly held the right hand of Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will countdown, after I count to one from three, we will begin to move at that time.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready, you can begin the countdown.\u201d Bu Feng nodded his head, then slightly separated his legs, and released a dim starlight from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will begin the countdown.\u201d Finished speaking, he placed his hand together, and circulated the chakra within his body, while his Sharingan firmly stared both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201c3!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ren Tianyou began to countdown, the dim starlight around the body of Bu Feng glimmered even more violently. When the countdown reached \u201c1\u201d, Bu Feng instantly jumped to fly in the sky taking Fang Qian with him, but while he was fast, but Ren Tianyouw as even faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t use space ninjutsu, but I can still use time ninjutsu. You will never understand my means.\u201d Ren Tianyou realistically thought within his heart, while the pattern in his left eye spun rapidly pouring out a huge amount of eye power. \u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Forever Solidity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the surrounding time and space instantly froze, including Bu Feng and Fang Qian. Currently Both Bu Feng and Fang Qian were maintaining liftoff posture little above the ground, which looked very weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t waste time.\u201d Ren Tianyou clearly understood that using his Forever Solidity in such far distance, it would only be able to stop time for three seconds at most, so he quickly began to make a series of hand seals, \u201cMokuton\u2014-Jukai Kotan! (Wood Style\u2014-Deep Forest Emergence!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground suddenly ruptured in succession and began to shake violently, then instantly countless huge trees directly grew out from the ground.</p><br/><p>And at this time, Bu Feng and Fang Qian who were frozen in the sky due to the effect of Forever Solidity had already recovered. But right now even though they were awake, they were helpless, as the surroundings around them had already changed into huge forest, and countless sturdy vines were already advancing towards them in high speed.</p><br/><p>And even with the speed of Bu Feng, confronting against those countless vines attacking indiscriminatingly, he didn\u2019t have any method. Very soon, both of them were firmly tied up by the vines.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think, this time I didn\u2019t use space magic.\u201d At that time, Ren Tianyou landed on the branch of a tree, then said to Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cI miscalculated, never though that in addition to space magic, you actually possessed such powerful nature magic. I, Bu Feng admit my defeat, and as I said before, I will join your organization.\u201d Right now Bu Feng was already firmly tied up with countless vines, and if Ren Tianyou wanted, then he would have already died long ago. So looking at the suddenly appeared Ren Tianyou, he said while being a little bit dejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cDismiss!\u201d Ren Tianyou made a hand seal, and released both Bu Feng and Fang Qian. After that he jumped towards them, and said to both of them, \u201cActually you don\u2019t need to be so pessimistic, my organization is different from other forces, and there is not any big restriction on the members of Akatsuki.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncluding you two, there is only ten members within my organization. Furthermore hereafter there will be only these ten member, will not increase again. Usually you are free without any restriction. Other than the time period of mission, you can freely do anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we Akatsuki organization and other organizations are different. Our objective is not to struggle to dominate the continent, but to support each other and improve our strength, so that all of can reach the pinnacle of this world\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut once someone provoke us, we will also not be afraid to retaliate. Such as former Ximen clan and Magic Domain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut our organization have two requirements that must be abide. First, never betray the organization. You must never tell the secrets of our organization to any outsiders including your closest person. Violators will be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, once the other member of our organization is in danger, everyone must spare no effort to come and save them. No one is allowed to not try to save them when they are in mortal danger. Violator will be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou explained the rule of Akatsuki organization to both of them. After hearing the explanation of Ren Tianyou, both of them slightly relaxed. Then Bu Feng said with a smile, \u201cI thought your organization was also same as other organization who would do everything for the sake of their benefit. But it seems I have understood mistakenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your organization is really like what you have said, then I will definitely be serious to do what I need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe members within our organization use code name. My original name is Ren Tianyou, but organization name is Zero. There is White Tiger who is Holy Sword clan\u2019s Li Jianrong. He is Peak Mid God realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVoid is Death clan\u2019s Yan Xinluo, also Peak Mid God realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJade Maiden is former disciple of Illusory Shrine\u2019s one of the holy envoy Li Xinyun, is finest illusionist expert as well as Peak Low God realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion Bird is Feng Wu, daughter of Flame Phoenix Villa\u2019s Villa Mistress, is Mid God realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Bear is Di Qingyu, nephew of Flame Phoenix Villa\u2019s Villa Mistress, and possess mutated blood lineage \u2018Great Sun Heavenly Phoenix\u2019, is Peak Mid God realm expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSantai is my wife Wang Yuxin, is Low God realm expert, and also an Earth Magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Tortoise is my elder sister Ren Muyue, as for her strength you will know later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now I will give Southern Dipper codename to you Bu Feng, and Azure Dragon for your little sweetheart Fang Qian.\u201d After introducing all the members of Akatsuki to Bu Feng and Fang Qian, Ren Tianyou took out two rings from his space ring and handed it over to them. \u201cThese two rings symbolize the identity of our organization. And there is additional great use in the future, so keep it properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that he gave the robe of Akatsuki organization to them, \u201cThis is the dress of our organization. Usually you don\u2019t need to wear it, but during the mission of organization, you must wear it, because it symbolize the identity of our organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, we got it.\u201d Bu Feng and Fang Qian took ring and clothing, and nodded their head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I am leaving first, and I\u2019ll also tell other members about the matters of you two joining our organization. You can also use this ring to contact them.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, \u201cOkay, now you two are free to do as you please, as our organization is not having any mission for the time being. Now I am leaving first, will not disturb your affection time.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou directly used Hiraishin no Jutsu to immediately disappear from there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, what affectionate time.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s last words, Bu Feng opened mouth to curse, but after Ren Tianyou had left, Bu Feng looked at Fang Qian and said with deep love, \u201cQian\u2019er, it\u2019s been a long period of time since we last see each other, I\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Feng!\u201d Seeing the affectionate look of Bu Feng, Fang Qian blushed and lowered her head.</p><br/><p>The mouth of Bu Feng approached closer and closer to the mouth of Fang Qian. But just when their lips were about to contact with each other, suddenly the voice of Ren Tianyou resounded, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, I forget to tell you how to use the ring to contact other member. Everything is written down here, now you can busy yourself.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou threw a scroll, then he immediately disappeared again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.!\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of Ren Tianyou, Fang Qian instantly blushed and jumped up. And as for Bu Feng, he roared in grief and indignation, \u201cBastard Zero, I, your father will slaughter you ah.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

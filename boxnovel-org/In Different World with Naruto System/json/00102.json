After opening the store system, in the exchange bar of this system, he saw a blinking Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit) exchange function.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou opened this system, then thickly dotted Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit) abilities appeared before the eyes of Ren Tianyou. Such as Yoton (lava style), Shakuton (Scorch Style), Hyoton (Ice style), Jiton (Magnet style), and so on series of Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit) of Naruto world appeared in front of his eyes. Looking at these, Ren Tianyou was completely dazzled, and also made his mouth watery with saliva. It was not limited to these Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit), even Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse), the Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit) of Kaguya clan was also available, and Ren Tianyou even saw the Mokuton (Wood style) Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit) of 1st hokage Senju Hashirama.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap, Mokuton! (Wood style!) I want it, I want it, I want it ah.\u201d When Ren Tianyou saw Mokuton (Wood style) of Senju clan, he instantly jumped down from the rock and started to dance, and roared in excitement.</p><br/><p>It is important to know that Senju Hashirama had completely suppressed the turmoil age of Naruto world, and also suppressed 5 big power with his one strength, and became a myth of ninja world. Even Uchiha Madara with nine tails fox, couldn\u2019t defeat him. Although that battle was the plan of Madara to get the strength of Senju Hashirama, nevertheless this proves the strength of Senju Hashirama. And after both Madara and Hashirama was resurrected, even though Madara already possessed Rinnegan, Hashirama was able to stop him. If it was not for Madara using the black Zetsu to control Obito and let him use Rinne Tensei no jutsu (Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth), and truly came back to life at his peak power, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to defeat Senju Hashirama.</p><br/><p>But when Ren Tianyou impatiently opened the system interference and was preparing to exchange Mokuton! (Wood style!), his whole body paused. Then his mouth started to twitch unceasingly, it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t want to exchange Mokuton! (Wood style!), rather when he took a glance at required amount of system points, he saw a long string of zeros. If he didn\u2019t count mistakenly, then this Mokuton (Wood style) required 60 million system points.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no mistake, it really requires 60 million system points. You are toying with me, this way when can I obtain Mokuton (Wood style)? Wu wu, my Mokuton (Wood style).\u201d Looking at that long strings of zeros, Ren Tianyou instantly felt extreme pain in his ass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi. Forget about it. Temporarily I shouldn\u2019t have such extravagant hopes about Mokuton (Wood style).\u201d Ren Tianyou sigh helplessly, and then started to look at other Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline limit). As a matter of fact just looking at it, there was no problem, but looking at the exchange price, he really wanted to curse out loud. Because Yoton (lava style) was the cheapest one among all available one, but even this required 10,000 system points to exchange. All of them required more system points to exchange compared to Mangekyo Sharingan, it really was not his counting mistake.</p><br/><p>In fact, Ren Tianyou was mistaken, for Sharingan, he had to exchange from 1 tomoe to 3 tomoe, then again needs to exchange Mangekyo Sharingan. After that Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, and after that Rinnegan, all of them should be upgraded step by step. If calculate all the required system points, then the amount of system points will be extremely high.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about it, as per my previous plan, I will honestly exchange another pair of Mangekyo Sharingan.\u201d Ren Tianyou again sighed helplessly. Then opened the system interference of doujutsu system, and said towards system, \u201cI want to exchange Mangekyo Sharingan of Obito.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, exchanging the Mangekyo Sharingan of Uchiha Obito consumes 10,000 system points, now there is 20,600 system points left.\u201d The voice of system rang out directly inside his brain.</p><br/><p>After the system voice, a powerful eye power was poured into the eyes of Ren Tianyou, and he felt extremely a sharp pain in his eyes. But Ren Tianyou already had this painful experience once before, so he just firmly clutched his hands and endured it. Blood started to flow out from his both eyes, and his nose was releasing a dull hum sound constantly.</p><br/><p>Pain continued on, Ren Tianyou was already soaked with sweats, but was still enduring the pains in his eyes, he felt like thousands of ants were nibbling his eyes. His cheeks were already covered with blood which had flown out from his eyes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ren Tianyou felt a cool and refreshing sensation in his eyes. After that he opened his eyes, and inside the mask which belong to Uchiha Obtio, that 3 spiral shaped Mangkyo Sharingan which belong to Uchiha Itachi started to quickly rotate, and slowly changed into three stretched triangles evenly spaced around the pupil that each curve at the top around the eye to form a circle, making it similar to a pinwheel. This was the shape of Mangekyo sharingan of Uchiha Obito.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is Obito\u2019s Mangekyo? As expected, under these eyes, the space around me is completely different, as if it\u2019s transparent.\u201d Ren Tianyo used these new eyes and continuously scan all surrounding around him. And as he had expected, he discovered that now under his these eyes, he could easily sense space around him which was incomprehensive in ordinary times, \u201cBut why am I feeling as if my eye power is enhance by a lot.\u201d Ren Tianyou sensed that compared to before, his this eye power was far stronger, so he wondered about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulation to host for successfully opening Mangekyo Sharingan of Uchiha Obito. Eye power is also enhanced. Reminder to host, before completely mastering these eye power, it is better not to exchange other Mangekyo Sharingan.\u201d At this time, the system voice appeared on his brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hearing the system voice, Ren Tianyou subconsciously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause if host cannot completely control this power, and exchanged another Mangekyo Sharingan, then the eyes of host may not be able to handle the eye power and your eyes will be thoroughly destroyed.\u201d Hearing this indifference system voice, the whole body of Ren Tianyou shivered.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tianyou was very excited to get new powers, nevertheless this system voice gave him a huge pressure, \u201cIt seems I need to be careful when I\u2019m increasing my power, if I only increase my power, without fully mastering it, sooner or later I may have a hidden trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about it, temporarily I also don\u2019t want another Mangekyo.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, and no longer thought about these annoying things. \u201cStill I want to feel this new power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou gathered his chakra, pour it into his right eye, \u201cKamui!\u201d After that his right eye\u2019s doujutsu was activated, then a spiral shaped space ripple suddenly appeared from the right eye of Ren Tianyou and spread all around him, then along with this spiral shaped space ripple, the body of Ren Tianyou slowly disappeared form that place.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>At the peak of the mountain, the sun had just rose, the morning light was shining on this hill top, and this place looked completely silent and amiable. Suddenly, in the space above this hilltop, spiral space ripple appeared and from that, a person wearing a black robe with red cloud pattern with mask on his face appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Mangekyo of Obitio is really useful.\u201d Ren Tianyou just stood there, and remembered the state of space when he had use Kamui. Due to the use of his Kamui, he continuously comprehend many mysterious law of space.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I should exchange tailed beast, I also ought to possess my own tail beast.\u201d After feeling the space power of Obito, the consciousness of Ren Tianyou again entered his mind, then look for the interface to exchange tailed beast. He was ready to exchange his first tailed beast.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

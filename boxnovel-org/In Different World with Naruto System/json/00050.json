And slowly try to digest all the information he had gotten after reading the book.</p><br/><p>Reading these books made his understanding on this Divine wind continent even deeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting, it seems it may not be a bad idea to travel all around the continent when I have time to enrich my experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered to himself, \u201cAs for Ximen clan, heh heh, on behalf of Ximen Tianlong, I have prepared a big gift for them, I hope they will like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou lift up his head and looked toward the sky from his window as his eyes flashed with coldness.</p><br/><p>He got up from the bed and decided to go and eat the meal, and then again continue to read.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..In this fashion, time passed day by day. He also slowly adapted to the student life in this academy and also slowly get acquainted with other students too.</p><br/><p>And Luo Tianxing and others returned back to the academy after 5 days. Every one of them looked dead tired when they came before Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Although they looked exhausted, in their eyes there was a difficult to hide excitement. They had succeed their business at Babel tower and advanced to 2nd year.</p><br/><p>But when Ren Tianyou asked about the details regarding their business at Babel Tower, they had all selected to remain silent about that matter.</p><br/><p>This silent response of them was within the expectation of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Because from his prior understanding, everyone who had entered this Babel tower had kept the matter about Babel tower completely confidential. If this information was leaked then those peoples will not be able to survive at this world.</p><br/><p>At last, Lan Yan told Ren Tianyou that he himself had to personally experience Babel tower to understand about it.</p><br/><p>But this only increased the curiosity of Ren Tianyou towards this Babel tower.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou decided to enter this Babel tower after the end of Cultivating room ranking competition.</p><br/><p>After Lan Yan and others came back, they also reported about their arrival back to their respective class.</p><br/><p>Unknowingly one and half months had already passed after Ren Tianyou started his intense cultivating session.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.more than a month later, within a small valley of mountain area behind the Supreme light academy, a huge waterfall was falling from the high cliff towards the pond at the bottom causing a continuous huge splash.</p><br/><p>In front of this waterfall, a young man with his bare upper body and having a strange white colored kimono tied in his waist, was standing under the waterfall, with his eyes closed. Oddly enough, he was standing on the surface of water without sinking down.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a green colored energy well up in the right hand of that young man, those energy had relaxed and joyful aura. Suddenly that young man controlled that green colored energy in his hand and changed it into thinner and sharper shape.</p><br/><p>At this moment, that man suddenly opened his eyes. Both of his eyes were blood red in color, and each of them contained 3 tomoe, which was spinning rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the shout, that young man waved his right hand towards the waterfall in a slashing motion. Then that green colored energy of his right hand gradually became longer and flew towards the waterfall.</p><br/><p>Along with the contact of this energy with the waterfall, a thunderous sound rang out. The waterfall before him was gradually split into 2 half by that green colored energy slash. And even the yellow colored cliff became visible below the slash.</p><br/><p>This green colored energy had successfully split the waterfall into two half in the middle and the stream of waterfall was stopped in the middle. Then the green colored energy gradually disappeared, causing the waterfall to fall again and the waterfall revert back to its original state.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the waterfall was split open, excitement was revealed in the eyes of that young man. His corner of the mouth also slowly raised. Shortly afterwards, he jumped above the cliff. Then he started to make some hand seals and said, \u201cRelease.\u201d Along with the voice, unexpectedly the waterfall and cliff gradually disappeared and couldn\u2019t be seen again.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026This young man was naturally Ren Tianyou. Finally after intense training for more than 1 months, he had completed his training on nature change of wind attribute chakra.</p><br/><p>He started training by trying to cut the leaf. It took him 1 week of intense training to finally succeed in cutting the leaf.</p><br/><p>And after he successfully cut the leaf, he began the next stage of training which was splitting the waterfall.</p><br/><p>But compared to the difficulty to cut the leaf, splitting the waterfall was very difficult beyond words. It was so because, one must attain the absolute limit in controlling of wind attributed chakra. And also he needs to control a large amount of chakra perfectly in order to successfully split the waterfall.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t train in the illusion magic formation of cultivation room because training time in the cultivation room was too short. So he find this small valley behind the academy and used Earth style and water style ninjutsu to create this waterfall for training.</p><br/><p>After more than a month of intense training, today he finally learned nature change of wind attribute chakra.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou put on his clothes, then he looked at the time, it was already noon. Then he left this valley.</p><br/><p>He directly arrived in front of dining hall and went to 2nd floor. When he arrived at the 2nd floor, Luo Tianxing and others were already there. Seeing Ren Tianyou, they waved their hand towards his direction and called him.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou arrived near the table, found the empty seat and sat down. Seeing that the big table was full of delicacies, suddenly his appetite also rose up. Then he prepared himself to start eating and pick up the chopstick.</p><br/><p>At that time, Luo Tianxing interrupted Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianyou, 3 days later, cultivation room ranking competition will begin. What do you think, will you participate this competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking? With the strength of Tianyou, how could he not participate in this competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the question of Luo Tianxing, Lan yan interjected and gave a supercilious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, to speak the truth, I also don\u2019t know. Wang Jia Fei, that little girl still not have decided the name list of participant for this competition. Are you participating this competition?\u201d Ren Tianyou replied with a laugh, then he asked Lan Yan and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe competition of us 2nd year is even more competitive. Among us Luo Tianxing and Li Feng will participate. And remaining including me will not participate in this competition.\u201d Lan yan said slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, only 2 of you will participate?\u201d Ren Tianyou was surprised hearing that only Luo Tianxing and Li Feng would participate in this competition even though other were also not that weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes only 2 of us are participating. Even though I am participating in this competition, I am not sure whether I could enter top 5 or not.\u201dLuo Tianxing said with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, never mind, take it easy. At that time I will finish the competition on my side as soon as possible and come to cheer for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cultivating room ranking competition is separate for all grade, so altogether there is 5 competition. So one grade competition won\u2019t affect the competition of another grade.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, at that time perhaps I can bring out even more strength.\u201d Luo Tianxing pat his chest and said laughing.</p><br/><p>While talking, they already finished their meal, so they head their own ways. Ren Tianyou walked towards his class as there was a lesson in this afternoon.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the class, other students were also coming to the class just like him. About 5 minutes later, Wang Jia Fei, this beautiful sexy female teacher entered the class, then walked straight to platform. After seeing all the students had already arrived, she opened her mouth, \u201cThere is only 3 days left for the cultivation room ranking competition. The participants of this competition from our class is already decided. The preliminary members are Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo, Sun Chuqian, Wang Haiqing and Li Yundou. These 5 will participate in this competition. I hope you will make a great effort to obtain a good result for our class. Don\u2019t obtain the disappointing result like last time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

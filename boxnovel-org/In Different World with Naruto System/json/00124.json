Even Ren Tianyou with his willpower was unable to bear this unbearable pain and helplessly roared in pain.</p><br/><p>Feeling that boundless pain inside his whole body, Ren Tianyou continuously tried to move his body, but this gold colored light beam had thoroughly sealed all the chakra inside his body, and also firmly bind his body. So, now even if Ren Tianyou wanted to move his finger, he was not able to do so. And his Sharingan were also completely sealed by this strong power, so currently Ren Tianyou was without any power to resist anything just like a lamb to be slaughtered.</p><br/><p>In the ordinary course of even, others people at the pub should have already attracted over due to the loud roar of pain of Ren Tianyou, but currently all the peoples inside the pub were just doing their own things, people eating meals were eating, sleeping were sleeping, drinking were drinking, and so on as if they didn\u2019t hear the painful roar of Ren Tianyou. It seems this mysterious light beam not only seal the power and movement of Ren Tianyou, even his voice was also isolated.</p><br/><p>Along with the passage of time, all the bones inside the body of Ren Tianyou were crushed into powder by this powerful force. Now his body no longer had the support of skeleton, and his body was just floating in the middle of the air due to this gold colored light beam.</p><br/><p>After all the bones inside his body were crushed, new power started to appear inside the body of Ren Tianyou. This power slowly condensed, and took the form of brand-new skeleton and support the body of Ren Tianyou. This new skeleton was many times more powerful compared to the previous skeleton of Ren Tianyou. And this new skeleton granted a special ability to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse), was kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) of Kaguya clan i.e. Otsutsuki clan. User of this kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) could control the horrifying power of bones. They could easily control the quantity of bones and also the skeletal structure of their body, and could freely change their bones shape and size, in order to defend or attack. And the number of bones inside their body were also indefinite. (Normal person had 200 or so bones.)</p><br/><p>In the Naruto world, the last person inheriting this Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse) kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) was Kaguya Kimimaro. And in his final battle against Rock lee of hidden leaf and Garra of the desert, he had used 5 dance of Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse). (Dance of Camellia, dance of clematis, Dance of larch, dance of bracken, and dance of willow.)</p><br/><p>Kimimaro came from the ninja clan with the strongest body and possessed the genuine kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) of Kaguya clan. Due to this kekkei genkai (bloodline limit), Kimimaro could freely manipulate his osteoblast and osteoclast, even to the extent that he could manipulate the calcium density to form a bone. Due to his tough bones, he didn\u2019t even need to defend against any physical attack, and just counterattack. His bones could also be changed into strongest spear to use it as a weapon. Even Orochimaru felt regret when he couldn\u2019t take over his body. \u201cWhen I think about having lost such a specimen, I still can\u2019t accept it, I can\u2019t get him out of my head the man best suited for my spirit, the body I wanted the most, Kimimaro.\u201d From this you could see that the value of Kimimaro was even more higher that the Sasuke who was successor of Sharingan in the eyes of Orochimaru. \u201cIf Kimimaro had joined the war regardless of his sick body, then it would have been even more easier to kill hokage.\u201d This meaning of this sentence did not mean that Kimimaro could defeated hokage, rather if there was the help of Kimimaro, then Orochmaro did not have lose both of his hands to kill hokage. Also Kimimaro possessed the strongest curse seal of Orochimaru, and he could also enter curse seal stage 2 and become human not human, demon not demon form. He would also grow a tail in that form, and the attack of this could even break through the defense of Gaara. Kimimaro was the only survivor possessing this Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse) kekkei genkai (bloodline limit), nevertheless he died after battling with Rock Lee and Gara despite his serious illness, causing this terrifying kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) to extinct forever.</p><br/><p>But now Ren Tianyou possess this heaven defying power. From now on the abilities of this already extinct kekkei genkai (bloodline limit) of original Naruto world, would unfold in this different world.</p><br/><p>After a long time, when the light beam disappeared, Ren Tianyou whose whole body was covered with sweat fell to the floor of the room from the air, and then he just lied there motionlessly as he was entirely lacking in energy. Ren Tianyou was violently gasping for breath, although the pain all over his body had already disappeared, nevertheless he still felt as if the sensation of that endless pain were still present at the moment. He forcedly calmed down his state of mind, then entered his mind and roar with rage, \u201cYou broken system, is this a little bit of pain? I, your father almost died due to pain. If I were to die, where would you find another host like me?\u201d But hearing the answer of this system, Ren Tianyou almost look for a hole in the earth to bury himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I do not have parents. Second, there is no sense of pain in my consciousness, so it is meaningless to talk about sense of pain with me. Third, if you die, I will immediately find another host.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, system answered without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hearing the reply of system, Ren Tianyou was speechless. \u201cYou bull, you system is not my boss.\u201d Ren Tianyou roared with rage with gloomy face. [T.L: Bull=stubborn]</p><br/><p>After that sitting cross-legged, Ren Tianyou started to recover his strength. After a long time, the strength gradually recovered inside his body. After his strength was completely recovered, Ren Tianyou opened his eyes, and looked as if he was lost in thought. He took a quick glance at the system within his body, then slowly stand up.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the successive sounds of crackling rang out, these sounds had come from the bones of Ren Tianyou. Shaking his neck once, immediately 2 sound of bone cracking rang out, \u201cHei hei, Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse), now I am even more powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding to the effect and might of Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse), Ren Tianyou was perfectly clear. It was no exaggeration to say that, the final dance \u2018Dance of Bracken\u2019 of Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse), had almost killed Gaara of desert. That proves the strength of Shikotsumyaku (Macabre Bone Pulse).</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou clenched his fists, and sensed his different powerful strength, and felt that he was a step closer to return back to his world. After that he opened the door of room, leave this pub and walked towards the mercenary guild of this town. Now he wanted to hand over that purple gauze sky magnificent flower and complete the mission. After completing this mission, Ren Tianyou still had extremely important work that needs to be done. He wanted to go to the place were space transmission passage of demon clan was sealed, i.e. mysterious Tower of Babel. He wanted to completely explore this place, then increase the member of Akatsuki, and after that\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked up towards the sky, and a cruel ominous glint flashed in his eyes, \u201cAfter that it\u2019s time to proclaim revenge against Ximen clan for the sake of Ximen Tianlong.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

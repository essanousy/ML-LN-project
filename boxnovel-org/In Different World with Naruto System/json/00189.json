And at this time, nobody noticed the sudden appearance of concealed figure on the top of this palace.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stood on the top of the palace, and carefully scanning all around. He discovered 4 guards were guarding the entrance door of this palace. The sharp eyes of these guards just like eagle were firmly sweeping the surrounding all around them. The vision of Elf clan\u2019s eyes were extremely sharp, even in darkness, their eyes exceed the ordinary person by double the amount. And all around the walls of this building, many guards were continuously patrolling.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou looked all around, then he descended from the top of this house, and just at that time, he heard the sound of footsteps coming towards him. Ren Tianyou immediately made series of hand seals, \u201cDoton\u2014-Iwagakure no Jutsu! (Earth Style\u2014-Hidden in Stones Jutsu!)\u201d After Ren Tiayou used his jutsu, the color of his body slowly overlapped with the color of wall behind, finally as if transparent, his body was concealed inside the wall behind.</p><br/><p>Just after this, a group of more than 10 patrolling elves came over from the corner of this wall, and slowly passed by the wall where Ren Tianyou was hidden without taking any notice of him, then slowly disappeared in yet another turning of wall.</p><br/><p>And after these elves disappeared, an energy fluctuation slowly appeared from this wall, and the figure of Ren Tianyou slowly appeared from there. After that looking at the disappearing patrolling elves, Ren Tianyou slightly smiled, then along with a large amount of eye power poured out from his right eye\u2019s Mangekyo Sharingan, as if transparent, he directly passed through the wall in front of his body, slowly disappearing from that place.</p><br/><p>And inside the palace, Ren Tianyou\u2019s figure emerged from the wall. He carefully scanned all around, and only after he discovered that there was not a single figure, he slowly come out from the wall completely.</p><br/><p>Because Ren Tianyou also didn\u2019t know the way inside the palace, so he also didn\u2019t have any means to find the residence of Elf Queen all at once. Although he could torture Xing Lu to get the way of inside the palace, nevertheless with his poor sense of direction, only listening to the direction from other people to guide himself was a little bit too difficult for him. But if he use sensory type ninjutsu, then there was no guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t be discovered.</p><br/><p>One should know that inside this palace, there was Elf Queen and he didn\u2019t know whether there were other experts or not, but without mentioning about their nature blood lineage, they were extremely sensitive to energy fluctuation, and it was impossible for ordinary experts to hide themselves from them. So Ren Tianyon was powerless to use any type of sensory ninjutsu, and was forced to search room by room.</p><br/><p>Seeing the passage in front of him, he quickly ran forward this passage. While running, he didn\u2019t create any sound of movement, was completely noiseless. Ninja in itself was a type of people who had very good control over their body, just like an assassin.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was continuously ran through the corridor, and just at that time, he suddenly heard the sounds of movement, then his body immediately changed into a blur and disappeared from that place.</p><br/><p>And at that time, 3 elves came over talking and laughing from the corridor ahead, \u201cEric, wait, it\u2019s your turn to take over. Her Majesty the Queen passed down the command that that human trespasser from this afternoon would very likely come again, so guard well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, I will absolutely follow the command of Her Majesty the Queen sincerely. If that human trespasser dared to come, I will personally catch him, and let him know we elves are not pushovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes that\u2019s right, this human not only dared to threaten our Her Majesty the Queen, but also actually hurt our beautiful princess Xing Lu, really courting death. Don\u2019t let me catch him, otherwise\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>And at the crossbeam above the corridor, Ren Tianyou was sitting above it, and his pair of eyes were indifferently staring at those 3 elves underneath. Just at that time, from the turning in front of those 3 elves, the loud sound of footsteps came. This sounded like a couple of patrolling party was coming over here. And hearing this footsteps, Ren Tianyou frowned.</p><br/><p>Because currently Ren Tianyou was at crossbeam which was exactly at the dead angle of those 3 elves who had entered just a moment ago, so at this 3 meters tall corridor, they didn\u2019t discover him, but this position was directly opposite to the turning without any cover, if any elf enter from this turning, then in the first moment, they would absolutely discover Ren Tianyou. So Ren Tianyou could only frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m staking it all, hope lady luck is standing on my side.\u201d Ren Tianyou secretly though in his heart. From the opposite corner, the sound of footsteps became bigger and bigger. It seems these patrolling groups would enter this corridor very soon, but just at that time, those 3 elves slowly passed through from below Ren Tianyou. And immediately after that, Ren Tianyou instantly jump off from that cross beam, noiselessly landed on the ground behind them, then immediately accelerated, and changing into a blur, in one second, he disappeared form that nearly 5 meter long corridor.</p><br/><p>Split second after Ren Tianyou disappeared, one of the three elves who was in the process of walking in the front felt like he heard a sound of movement behind him, so he turned around his head feeling uncertain, and looked behind him, but there was nothing behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, Blatch?\u201d Seeing this elf had stopped, other two elves also stopped and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I heard a gust of wind behind us just a moment ago.\u201d This elf called Blatch said doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cGust of wind? How is that possible, how can a gust of wind appear inside the palace? You are patrolling for whole day, so it seems you are excessively tired, and hallucinating. So return early and have a rest.\u201d Hearing Blatch, another elf was dumbfounded, then laughing he patted his shoulder and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHallucinating? It\u2019s possible.\u201d Hearing his companion, the elf called Blatch shook his head, and agreed. Because he was patrolling for whole day, he was having a bit of headache. And at that time, from the turning of the corridor in front, a couple of patrolling guards entered this corridor.</p><br/><p>And in one corner, Ren Tianyou was firmly leaning on the wall. He was holding his breath, and his forehead was covered with cold sweats.</p><br/><p>After few seconds, only after he heard the sound of footsteps of those patrolling guards, he rubbed the cold sweat on his forehead, then he quickly disappeared from that corridor, advancing inside the palace.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

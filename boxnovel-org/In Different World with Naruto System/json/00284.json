This black hole was emitting devouring power as if it wanted to devour everything.</p><br/><p>Amike who was standing on the head of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast was transferring all the energy within his body to the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, helping it to open Devouring Heaven\u2019s Domain sparing no effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am able to survive by luck this time, then I will definitely learn two defensive move.\u201d At this moment, Amike unexpectedly had a thought like this.</p><br/><p>The bijudama directly entered inside the black hole created by Devouring Heaven\u2019s Domain. After that time seemed to have stopped, and the surrounding space seemed to have solidified, giving people a kind of suffocating feeling.</p><br/><p>This feeling quickly disappeared as fast as it had come, and only after three seconds, \u2018ka ka\u2019 disintegrate sound came. This disintegrating sound had come from the space behind the black hole created by Devouring Heaven\u2019s Domain, and as if the cracks on the glass, cracks appeared in the midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026?\u201d Seeing the cracks in the midair in front of it, the pupil of Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast shrunk, and a terrifying possibility appeared in their brain. After that all the fine hairs on their body instantly stood erect as if an alert kitten who had encountered a danger.</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018hong\u2019 exploding sound, the space suddenly shattered into small pieces, and a huge black colored bijudama broke out from inside that space, and directly hit the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>This bijudama contained the majority of chakra of four tailed beasts and the power of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, so this bijudama directly destroyed the innate space magic of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast and directly landed on its body.</p><br/><p>No one would have thought that this bijudama would unexpectedly possess enough power to even break through space.</p><br/><p>When this bijudama landed on the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, an ear-deafening explosion sound suddenly resounded. And a terrifying explosion wind and waves instantly spread all around, engulfing everything within the radius of 5 kilometers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing quickly spreading wind and waves of explosion, the pupil of Ren Tianyou suddenly shrunk. He had also not expected that the energy of this bijudama would actually be this strong, even affecting him who was far away from the point of explosion. He instantly launched Susanoo to protect himself.</p><br/><p>Within the ninth floor of Tower of Babel, a huge explosion suddenly rose, and terrifying explosion wind and waves instantly engulfed the entire space of ninth floor. And in the center location of ninth floor where the center of explosion was located, the space unexpectedly cracked, and a black hole emitting huge attractive force appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu!\u201d Sound of breaking void resounded, and at that time, a huge purple ash colored lightning suddenly split open the explosion wind and waves, and appeared at the periphery of explosion.</p><br/><p>Carefully looking, this was precisely Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo. But this moment, the energy of Susanoo had already become very dim.</p><br/><p>This moment, purple ash colored Susanoo slowly dissolved, and changing into energy, it dissipated in the air, revealing the figure of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu.\u201d Ren Tianyou wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and exhaled out a long breathe. \u201cFortunately I was at the edge of explosion where the might of explosion was much weaker compared to the center, otherwise it would have really become a tragedy. If I was severely injured by my own attack, then I really would have utterly lost my face.\u201d</p><br/><p>As to why Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t use Hiraishin to dodge this explosion, it was not because Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t want to use, rather didn\u2019t dare to use. Because the explosion winds and waves of that time had already broke the space of surroundings, causing the space around was very unstable, and under these circumstance, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t dare to use Hiraishin, otherwise who knows what would happen.</p><br/><p>As a result Ren Tianyou immediately choose to use Susanoo to resist, otherwise Ren Tianyou would not be so stupid, and directly use Hiraishin to dodge without wasting any time.</p><br/><p>This moment Ren Tianyou was standing in the midair while looking at that terrifying storm in front. Now his hair and clothing were being blown by this terrifying storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, under this kind of explosion, even if you didn\u2019t die, you will also not be unscathed.\u201d Looking at that terrifying explosion in front of him, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly making a wry smile.</p><br/><p>When explosion gradually stopped, the space at the location of explosion had cracked open, creating a huge black hole. This black hole was at least 1 kilometer in radius, and a terrifying suction force was coming out from inside this black hole.</p><br/><p>And on the ground, a huge crater had appeared, and huge cloud of smoke and dusts were rising from the middle of this crater.</p><br/><p>And in the centermost location of this crater, indistinct figures of two people could be seen. The eyes of Ren Tianyou instantly caught these two figures, and he immediately jumped from the sky, and descended towards the location of these figures.</p><br/><p>Arriving on the ground of crater, he saw right now Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast had already lost two legs, and one third of its body was already blown off. Now it was lying on the ground with deep black colored blood flowing out from its body.</p><br/><p>This moment Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast was mortally injured. Even if Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t kill it, it would not be able to live for long.</p><br/><p>And as for Amike, this moment his right arm had already snap off from its base, and had wounds everywhere in his body. The main reason he was still alive was because Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast had desperately protected him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou, Amike revealed a ferocious smile, \u201cNever though that I, Heaven Sealing Demon God\u2014Amike would actually fall in the hand of you human. It seems in this 30,000 years, a group of brilliant younger generation have appeared in Divine Wind Continent ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut.\u201d Looking at the face of Ren Tianyou, Amike insanely laughed, \u201cI, Amike can\u2019t survive, so do you think I will let you live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he immediately launched the already prepared secret magic within his body, \u201cDemonic Self-Detonation!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then he said to Great Bear who was in the process of suppressing Wind System leader\u2014-Feng Yunxiang, \u201cHey, Great Bear, looking at the current movement of Zero, doesn\u2019t that seems he is intending to use that move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOught to be so.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou flying higher in the sky, Great Bear answered while dodging wind magic of Feng Yunxiang. Simultaneously the scene of Ren Tianyou using this move six months ago appeared in his mind. At that time with world destroying momentum, the sea area within entire 5 li radius was completely engulfed by this move. And the region within that 5 li radius changed into death domain, where countless corpses of sea magical beasts floated on the surface of sea. He could still clearly remember that scene till now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen according to our plan, Zero would destroy Magic Domain, when Dragon clan is about to arrive, isn\u2019t that so? It seems we also need to speed up, so that we would not hold up the plan of Zero.\u201d Looking at still rising to the sky Ren Tianyou, White Tiger said while recalling their plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? How could he destroy our Magic Domain? What move does that bastard want to use in the end?\u201d Hearing the conversation of White Tiger and Great Bear, Feng Yunxiang couldn\u2019t help but felt uneasy inside his heart, then looking at Great bear who was holding a spear, he asked in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better ask death god, I don\u2019t have time to play around with you anymore. White Tiger, Void, Little Wu, you all also quickly end your battle. Then move according to plan.\u201d Hearing the question of Feng Yunxiang, Great Bear coldly snorted in disdain. Then spoke towards White Tiger and others. Shortly afterwards, the flame of sun around his body quickly came pouring in towards the spear in his hand, \u201cSet ablaze prairie to nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately Great Bear stabbed the spear in his hand towards Feng Yunxiang with huge might. The spear also send out a surging heat wave of true sun fire. This heat wave was seemingly evaporating all the air in the surrounding practically leaving nothing behind. The wind shield in front of Feng Yunxiang was directly pierce through by his spear as if paper, stabbing his body too. After that even before Feng Yunxiang could give out a horrible shriek, that surging true sun fire burned him to ashes leaving behind one Divinity Crystal, which was caught by Great Bear.</p><br/><p>White Tiger and other also began to show their true might. Their strength was already comparable to four leaders, and especially White Tiger, Void and Great Bear, they had already advanced to Mid-God realm in strength, moreover with their Saint ranked blood lineage, one might well say they were invincible within same realm, even to the extent that they could give a good fight to High-God realm experts. So after they got serious, the four leader were instantly crushed with absolute strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoid, we should go to the place where you had made arrangement yesterday and start our move.\u201d After the enemies were finished off, White Tiger said to Void.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Void immediately changed into ash colored light flying towards west side of this valley. Great Bear and others followed closely afterwards, preparing to make their move according to their plan.</p><br/><p>In the valley, Ren Tianyou quickly flew high up in the sky, then standing in the sky high up, he looked down at underneath Magic Domain\u2019s those towering Magic Towers. He could still indistinctly see human figures in those Magic Towers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful scenery ah, but it\u2019s too bad, very soon it will no longer exist. If you want to blame someone then you can only blame you Magic Domain yourself for protecting Ling Yanqi that scum.\u201d Looking that flourishing scene underneath, the eyes of Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have even a shred of emotion. Along with huge amount of eye power, suddenly purple-grey colored lightning appeared around his body, which slowly changed into huge skeleton. After that it slowly took the form of huge demon god which surrounded his body. This was precisely the Susanoo form of his own Mangekyo Sharingan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does this guy want to do? Everyone make preparation, my heart is feeling strong restlessness.\u201d Looking at Ren Tianyou high up in the sky whose body was surrounded by Demon God, Lei Wuyi couldn\u2019t help but have misgivings, so he advised to everyone. And all the people around this valley who were in the process of watching this battle also couldn\u2019t help but raise their head to look towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou inside Susanoo quickly made a series of hand seals. And along with the hand seals, the chakra inside his body quickly circulated. For ordinary ninjutsu, with the sealing speed of Ren Tianyou, he could basically complete within two seconds, but now he had already made a series of hand seals for almost ten seconds, but was still not completed, moreover what was more surprising was, the Susanoo around his body was also slowly making hand seals using its huge hands which was completely different to what Ren Tianyou was making.</p><br/><p>Mainly this ninjutsu was too multifarious, so Ren Tianyou needed his Susanoo to make yet another hand seals to maintain the balance and flow of chakra within his body. And his body in itself was using these chakra to speed up this ninjutsu.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the hands of Ren Tianyou no longer made hand seals, both hand maintain \u201cOx\u201d seal, and Susanoo\u2019s hands maintain \u201cRam\u201d seal. \u201cNinja Art\u2014- Scorching Stars Fall and Exterminate!\u201d [T.L: Neither Shinra Tensei Nor Meteor summoning]</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, that huge amount of chakra inside his body quickly depleted. It instantly depleted by nearly one-thirds, only then slowly stopped. And after the chakra inside his body was instantly depleted, the sky above Ren Tianyou began to quickly change.</p><br/><p>\u201cReckless Bastard, how could this be possible?\u201d Seeing the changes in the sky, cold sweats began to appear on the forehead of Fen Tian who was standing underneath on the ground, and his eyes firmly shrunk. He opened his mouth and cursed, but no one heard his voice because of that strong dread feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that we can only wait for our ending?\u201d Looking at this situation which was as if the world was about to get destroyed, Lei Wuyi said with fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, how could the strength of this beast be so powerful? Is this really something humans are able to do with their strength?\u201d Looking at the current situation, Ximen Wuwang cursed with ghastly pale complexion.</p><br/><p>And everyone in the cliff around this valley were also frightened seeing this move of Ren Tanyou. And everyone had disbelief expression on their face.</p><br/><p>In the sky, suddenly countless specks of flame appeared. And when distance decreased, they saw these were basically more than 2 meter in diameter fireballs. Upon closer look these were burning red rocks with flame around it, which were falling down towards the ground from the sky in a high speed. This simply was just like a meteor shower, only every meteors were a little bit smaller, but the might contained within them however was not that simple.</p><br/><p>Moreover the area covered by this move was very wide, not only did it completely covered underneath Magic Domain, even the periphery of this valley was within this attack\u2019s range. So naturally all the peoples who were watching this battle from the cliffs which were in the periphery of this valley were also within the range of this attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, quickly run.\u201d Instantly those people watching the battle snapped out of their trance, and began to quickly run away from the periphery of this valley in dread. Now they were hating themselves for not having more than two legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly leave this place.\u201d Seeing that the current situation was far from good, Palace Master of Dark Dynasty couldn\u2019t help but cursed, \u201cThat madman! Quickly leave, otherwise it will also involve us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d All those dark knights bowed and answered. Then taking the lead, they began to quickly run outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect he was actually powerful like this. The might of this one move has probably attain the divine power of Peak-True God.\u201d Seeing those countless bolides in the sky, Elf Queen who was hidden in the dark couldn\u2019t help but praised inside her heart. Shortly afterwards she also changed into green light and flew away from this place. Although this move couldn\u2019t possibly injure her, nevertheless she had to spend certain amount of efforts to defend herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should also get out of here at once. This is not a move we can resist with our strength.\u201d Seeing those countless bolides, Ximen Han said to Fen Tian and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go, I am Domain Master of Magic Domain, so I will not leave this place, I will live and die with Magic Domain.\u201d Fen Tan shook his head and gritted his teeth. Now he really regretted, regretted why he was so arrogant at that time and didn\u2019t hand over Ling Yanqi, bringing this calamity of destruction to their Magic Domain. It was impossible for him to concede and leave this place, because he had devoted his entire heart and blood for this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Tian, quickly leave, else you\u2019ll die.\u201d Lei Wuyi persuaded. This as if world exterminating might made him simply unable to have any thought of resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave, but I will not leave.\u201d Fen Tian tightly gritted his teeth, then shaking his head, he said resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he isn\u2019t leaving, then we should leave now, else it will be too late for even us to leave.\u201d Ximen Wuwang was not in the mood to talk too much with them in current situation. After finished speaking, he and Ximen Han directly changing into light, disappeared from that palace, quickly rushing towards outside of this valley. For the sake of killing RenTianyou they would give a hand, but it was not worthwhile for them to throw away their life for the sake of this Magic Domain.</p><br/><p>Lei Wuyi sighed, directly changed into lightning light and also quickly flew towards outside of valley. Between Magic Domain and his own life, he clearly selected his own life.</p><br/><p>\u201cReduce to ashes.\u201d Looking at underneath Magic Domain as well as those people with dread expression, Ren Tianyou said without a trace of emotion in his eyes. After that he directly disappeared in the thin air. As a matter of fact, he had used Hiraishin no Jutsu to fly away.</p><br/><p>This move Scorching Stars Fall and Exterminate, was one of the three original ninjutsu developed by Ren Tianyou in these past three years. The flame surrounding around those meteorites of this move was also not ordinary flame, but was scorching flame created by Ren Tianyou\u2019s Shakuton (Scorch Style), which had terrifying killing power. Once it came into contact with human body, this flame could completely evaporate all the liquid inside their body, changing them into corpses. Moreover the bolides inside the scorching flame would bring about a huge explosion, completely blowing off their dried corpses into pieces. One might as well say it would not even leave behind intact corpses, extremely ferocious.</p><br/><p>However this move\u2019s consumption of energy was also very large, even with the amount of chakra Ren Tianyou possessed now, it instantly depletes one-third of it. Moreover there was also a risk, which was if he excessively used Shakuton (Scorch Style) bloodline limit ability, along with the acute consumption of chakra, the power of this Shakuton (Scorch Style) had danger of backlash, which might burn his own body.</p><br/><p>As a result, Ren Tianyou had no other choice but to use Susanoo so that both of them simultaneously make a series of hand seals. Helping one another while using this move would greatly reduce that risk.</p><br/><p>Along with the disappearance of Ren Tianyou, countless bolides rained down towards the underneath Magic Domain from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it on, Bastard.\u201d Looking at those falling countless bolides, Fen Tian resisted the fear in his heart, then urged all the flame divine power inside his body, which changed into huge blazing flame wave spreading in all direction.</p><br/><p>But shortly afterwards those falling countless bolides landed on the ground. Immediately series of explosion sound resounded inside the valley. Inside those explosion sounds, indistinct blood-curdling scream could be heard.</p><br/><p>Chapter 236: Ninja Art\u2013Scorching Stars Fall and Exterminate</p><br/>\n</div>"}

(Hell Stab Three-Finger Spear Hand!)\u201d Along with the shout, Ren Tian You looked as if he had turn into sharp spear of lightning rushing towards the \u2018Sky dividing sea wave\u2019 attack of Sun Chu Qian.</p><br/><p>In the Naruto world, Sanbon Nukite (Hell Stab Three-Finger Spear Hand) was one of the unique skill of the 3rd Raikage. The main principle of this skill was to concentrates a considerable amount of lightning chakra into just the finger-tips of a single hand and then thrusting that hand towards the opponents. Initially use 4 fingers to attack, with the reduction of number of fingers, the attack power continuously increase. And when used only one finger, it would have the strongest attack power, thus it was named strongest spear. In those year, when 8 tailed beast of Hidden cloud village had run amok, 3rd Raikage alone had prevented the amok of 8 tailed beast. And at that time, he had used this Jigokuzuki (Thrust of Hell) to completely cut off all the tails of 8 tailed beast. You can say that this jutsu was fierce and cruel to the extreme, and it was similar to Chidori but the power of Jigokuzuki (Thrust of Hell) skill is higher.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>When Ren Tian who had turned into a lightning spear and the \u2018Sky dividing sea wave\u2019 attack of Sun Chu Qian finally met, in an instant the Sanbon Nukite (Hell Stab Three-Finger Spear Hand) of Ren Tian You slowly split open the Sky dividing sea wave\u2019 attack of Sun Chu Qian.</p><br/><p>From the very beginning, Ren Tian You had a plan to learn successive Raikage\u2019s ninjutsu. These ninjutsu of lightning system not only far surpass ordinary people in terms of speed, even the 4th Hokage himself using Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Raijin Jutsu) is powerless and tries to avoid to engage in a close combat. And there is also a ninjutsu to create the armor of lightning chakra for the defense of whole body. Even the Wind style\u2014Rashen Shuriken attack of Naruto was powerless to split open this defense. In addition to this, the attack power was also far more powerful, the Jigokuzuki (Thrust of Hell) skill\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Jigokuzuki Ippon Nukite (Hell Stab One-Finger Hand) was known as the strongest spear of 3rd Raikage.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Ren Tian You had already discovered the method to learn this ninjutsu, but at that time he hadn\u2019t mastered chakra nature change of lightning system. As a result, that time, he could only look at it enviously but cannot cultivate. So at that time, he memorized the learning method of this ninjutsu and prepared himself to learn it first after mastering lightning system nature change. Now Ren Tian You had only learned the initial stage of this ninjutsu. He had already gone through many training, so his body was already capable enough to endure lightning system chakra and cope with fire chakra nature change too. Although the Sanbon Nukite (Hell Stab Three-Finger Spear Hand) attack of Ren Tian You was only of initial stage, and couldn\u2019t even compared to the same attack of 3rd Raikage, nevertheless it shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>The people on the audience saw that Ren Tian You had rushed towards the huge wave (sword slash) without even taking out his weapon, but he was still able to cut open that sword slash, this\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You ignored the amazement of the audience, and still continued to change chakra into lightning system chakra. And continued to press forward his \u2018Sanbon Nukite (Hell Stab Three-Finger Spear Hand)\u2019 towards \u2018Sky dividing sea wave\u2019.</p><br/><p>This \u2018Sky dividing sea wave\u2019 couldn\u2019t stop the step of Ren Tian You anymore. After split opening the \u2018Sky dividing sea wave\u2019, Ren Tian You continued to advance towards blankly standing Sun Chu Qian.</p><br/><p>When the right hand of Ren Tian You was just 10 centimeter away from the forehead of Sun Chu Qian, he stopped his hand. After all this was just a test, it was not necessary to kill the opponent.</p><br/><p>Sun Chu Qian blankly watched the lightning chakra covered right hand of Ren Tian You in front of her. Because the distance between the right hand and her face was very near, her beautiful face was feeling slight numbness. She had used all the power from her body in that attack, but it was unexpectedly split open easily, how can she accept this fact!</p><br/><p>\u201cMatch over, you lose.\u201d Ren Tian You withdraw his hand. All the chakra that was surrounding him also slowly withdrawn inside his body. His standing erect hair also subsided.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026..I\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Sun Chu Qian was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, match over. Ren Tian You wins.\u201d At this moment, Yun Lei Xiao stood up and declared the end of the match.</p><br/><p>Ren Tian You jumped off the arena, and looked for a place to recover his consumed chakra. In this extremely short period of time, he had consumed about 1/3 of his chakra, so without losing time he wanted to recover his chakra. This jutsu was not good to use before he reached Kage level. Because this ninjutsu consumes a huge amount of chakra, and only the person with a huge amount of chakra can bring out the biggest might of this ninjutsu. Just like 3rd Raikage, he once faced an opposing force of ten thousand shinobi single-handedly for three consecutive days and nights, in order to allow his comrades to escape to safety and he eventually died in this battle due to extreme exhaustion of chakra. Due to extreme usefulness of this ninjutsu, Ren Tian You had given more priority to learn this ninjutsu. But for this ninjutsu he needed huge amount of chakra, but after cultivating up to elite senior ninja level, the amount of his chakra was not improving significantly. So for the time being, exchanging one of the tail beast was his top priority.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, now I roughly understand the strength level of you both. I must say, your strength is extremely good. I hope you two will participate for the Cultivation room ranking competition, and achieve a good result for our class. And you all should remember the humiliation of previous Cultivation room ranking competition.\u201d Yun Lei Xiao slowly glanced the students around the arena and slowly spoke. Hearing Yun Lei Xiao, veteran students who had participated in previous completion bowed their heads in shame.</p><br/><p>Cultivation room ranking competition is the specialty of Supreme Light Academy. Every class of Supreme light academy are required to deploy the students to the special purpose cultivation room. The effect of each cultivation room are different. The lowest level cultivation room have the effect of only ordinary cultivation room. But inside the high level cultivation room, not only there is the high level formation which could quickly gather the magic energy and help the student who cultivated inside to quickly absorb elemental power of voids, but also there are gravity magic formation, floating magic formation and so on, other series of high level magic formation. Even inside the current room no. 6 cultivation room, there is a high level gravity magic formation. It can increase the gravity up to 12 times. This is extremely beneficial for warriors in their cultivation. Furthermore, there is illusion magic formation, anyone entering this formation will enter into an illusion world. Inside that world there will be an opponent who had the same cultivation level as the person entering the formation, fighting against this opponent helps any warrior greatly. Also inside that formation one can choose the environment and skills to use too. This is the merely 6th cultivation room, the 1st cultivation room is even more perfect for cultivation.</p><br/><p>If the representative from the class wins, then everyone from their class will have the right to use best cultivation room. As long as your strength is high or your fist is strong enough, best cultivation room will be yours.</p><br/><p>\u2018Cultivation room ranking competition\u2019 is held once every 6 month, all the classes of Supreme light academy can participate in this competition. This was not the competition for only warrior skill court but magic court and illusion court can also take part in this competition. But alchemy court will not participate because they are only few in numbers and type of people who completely indulge in their alchemy world.</p><br/><p>Each class can send only 5 people to participate in this competition. The total points obtained by these 5 people are calculated and highest among them obtains the right to use the best cultivation room. This competition doesn\u2019t depend on the personal strength or the strength of team, but it depends on the points system.</p><br/><p>Everyone will have their points at the final. The final ranking of the class is determined by adding the total points obtained by all 5 members of the class. This is also one of the special rule which was applied by the academy. Teachers of the academy do not pay attention to only those 1 or 2 students whose strength is highest or lowest but all of the students. As a result this rule was made.</p><br/><p>In last competition, the warrior court which Ren Tian You belongs to, had obtained third rank. 1st and 2nd was obtained by magic court and illusion court respectively. To sum it up their overall result was too poor, so they got only number 6 cultivation room. All the teachers of warrior court almost died because of anger, especially Wang Jia Fei, this sexy beautiful lady, used her scorching fire battle qi and almost burned the whole building. So when Yun Lei Xiao mentioned about last competition. Everyone was ashamed, especially those who had participated, their complexion was already becoming red.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is still 2 more months left before the next competition. I hope you all will make great effort to prepare for this competition. Don\u2019t give me any garbage result. You all are the member of special class and you are above the ordinary students. Try your best get back your honor in next competition. Forget about it, I won\u2019t speak about this nonsense any more. Since the test of 2 new students is complete and I got the rough understanding their strength level, the class will be over soon. So you all are free to cultivate until then. You all should know where the switch of magic formation is, so with the exception of Ren Tian You and Yan Xin Luo, all are dismissed.\u201d After Yun Lei Xiao finished speaking, all the students found their cultivation place and started their own training.</p><br/><p>Yun Lei Xiao came before Ren Tian You and Yan Xin Luo, took out a magic card and said, \u201cTake out your student magic card, I will give you access to enter this cultivation room in your magic card. After you got this permission, you can freely access this 6th cultivation room and you can also freely use magic formations of this cultivation room to cultivate or train.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yun Lei Xiao, a card appear from inside the right hand of Ren Tian You and Yan Xin Luo, this was their student card. Yun Lei Xiao hold his card in his right hand and softly muttered the incantation, then a purple colored battle qi appeared from the card of Yun Lei Xiao and that radiance entered into the student card of Ren Tian You and Yan Xin Luo.</p><br/><p>Yun Lei Xiao put away his magic card, then said to Ren Tian You and Yan Xin Luo, \u201cNow both of you can freely access this cultivation room. In addition to this if you wanted to cultivate battle qi, over there is the special purpose private rooms. Inside it contains several magic formation, so compared to cultivating outside, the speed of your cultivation will be much faster inside that room.\u201d Yun Lei Xiao said while pointing towards doors at right side.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber 33 will be the room of Ren Tian You, and number 34 will be the room of Yan Xin Luo. Inside these cultivation rooms, there is also gravity and illusion magic formation. You can activate these magic formation using your student card. Well, just now both of you had a match, so without wasting any time enter the room and take your time to cultivate. After that qualify yourself as a representative of your class and achieve a good result.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d Ren Tian You replied and turned around and walked towards the cultivating room. And Yan Xin Luo without saying anything, directly turned to leave towards the cultivating room.</p><br/><p>Watching the back of two students, Yun Lei Xiao talked to himself, \u201cThese 2 are good seedling. Not bad, next Cultivation room ranking competition will be something worth seeing.\u201d Finished muttering, he walked over and sat on his stool, then he closed his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

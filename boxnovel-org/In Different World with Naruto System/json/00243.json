If host let system absorb it, then host will be rewarded with 7.5 million system points.\u201d This sudden voice of Naruto system instantly froze Ren Tianyou on the spot.</p><br/><p>His face was filled with shock, as well as disbelief and unexpected pleasantly surprise expression, as if he encountered something much unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero, what\u2019s up, are you fine?\u201d Just then, Ren Tianyou suddenly heard someone calling him, and instantly sobered up. Then he saw Jade Maiden unceasingly shaking her right hand before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m fine, no need to worry.\u201d Ren Tianyou adjusted his state of mind, then holding that magic staff, he said to Jade Maiden, \u201cThank you Jade Maiden, this thing is very useful to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, you\u2019ve earned it. Speaking about it, after our family obtain this thing, it didn\u2019t bring any fortune to our family, instead attracted the calamity of extermination of my family. Now handing it over to you however settled one of my worries.\u201d Looking at that earth yellow colored crystal core embedded on the magic staff, Jade Maiden said with a complex expression on her face. Precisely this one crystal core however attracted a calamity which exterminate her family. Perhaps this was the reason why people said treasuring a jade rings becomes a crime.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be sad, all in all this matter is already long passed. Now there is also no mission, so everyone rest well. I have something to do, so I am returning to my room first.\u201d After comforting Jade Maiden once, he was unable to hold himself back to return back to his room with that magic staff.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Zero?\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou hastily returning back to his room, Vermilion Bird curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know, perhaps he is too tried because of that big battle of just a moment ago.\u201d White Tiger scratched his head, and expressed his thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let him take a rest. Now everyone come, let\u2019s drink, everyone was quite tense these past few days, now we can finally relax properly.\u201d Taking the sky fragrant alcohol from the table, Great Bear called everyone to drink.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>After returning to his room, Ren Tianyou closed the door, and sitting cross-legged on the bed, his consciousness sank into his brain\u2019s sea of consciousness. After that entering into that familiar Naruto System interface, Ren Tianyou immediately asked, \u201cSystem, what was that back then? Is the value of this crystal core really 7.5 million system points?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this crystal core in itself is Earth element\u2019s crystallization\u2014-Earth Emperor Crystal. This is the heavenly treasure on the level of that Forever Green you had found in Elf clan.\u201d System slowly explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cForever Green level heavenly treasure?\u201d Hearing the explanation of System, Ren Tianyou recalled that Forever Green he had obtained inside Tree of Life in Elf clan. But at that time system had stated that if he let System absorb it, then he however would get 100 million system points, moreover all the functions of the system would be unlocked. So why was there such a huge gap even though both of them were same level treasure?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not right System, if this is heavenly treasure on the same level of Forever Green, then why is its value only 7.5 million points?\u201d Ren Tianyou confusedly asked to System.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike I said just a moment ago, this is not complete Earth Emperor Crystal, it is only a fragment of Earth Emperor Crystal nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFragment of Earth Emperor Crystal? How could that be?\u201d Hearing System, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but become confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe real Earth Emperor Crystal is the aggregate of all the earth element in this world. Just like its name suggests, \u2018Earth Emperor\u2019, it is the emperor of all Earth element. If one absorb the earth element power inside it, then the earth elements between Heaven and Earth however would change his/her physique into Earth Emperor Body. After that his/her every movement would bring about a powerful feeling of earth\u2019s profoundness and heaviness.\u201d System slowly explained to Ren Tianyou. \u201cBut this piece of crystal core nevertheless is only a piece of Earth Emperor Crystal after it was disintegrate encountering unknown mishap. Moreover Earth Emperor Crystal had already lost majority of its energy when it disintegrated, so its value is very lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurned out to be so.\u201d Ren Tianyou nodded his head, then looking at this piece of Earth Emperor Crystal, he asked, \u201cSystem, according to you, these heavenly treasures are very rare that can only be encounter by chance, but cannot be sought for, but here I encountered two such treasures in an extremely short period of few years, it seems my luck is very good, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, obtaining me in itself is a kind of as large as heaven luck.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou\u2019s that self-important voice, System coldly snorted in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, well, since I don\u2019t have any big use for it, you can absorb it. After that I will exchange Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan with the reward system points.\u201d Ren Tianyou took out that crystal core from that magic staff, then threw that magic staff to one side and holding this crystal core, he said to System.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had never thought to have such a lucky break, now he was actually able to exchange Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. According to his beginning plan, only after next three or so years, he might be able to exchange it, but now, not only could he exchange it, furthermore there was several million surplus system points.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, initiating to absorb Earth Emperor Crystal!\u201d After hearing Ren Tianyou, System replied. Then began to absorb that crystal core in the hand of Ren Tianyou. A vigorous golden colored energy suddenly gushed out from the brain of Ren Tianyou, which surrounded that crystal core in his hand. Instantly this Earth Emperor Crystal changed into earth yellow colored energy and began to enter the body of Ren Tianyou, flowing all the way to the sea of consciousness of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing, congratulation to host for absorbing Earth Emperor Crystal, Reward: 7.5 million system points.\u201d After waiting nearly 5 minutes, the sound of system was transmitted directly into his brain. After that Ren Tianyou opened his eyes and looked at his system points. Sure enough, his system points were already increased by 7.5 million system points. Now he had total of 8.1 million or so system points. This however was huge sum of system points he had never had before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSystem, I want to exchange Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, I want every Mangekyo Sharingan I have already exchanged merged together.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to System.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, exchanging Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan requires altogether 2.5 million system points. Before exchanging, may I ask which Susanoo host want to keep?\u201d System voice sounded in the mind of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich Susanoo I want to keep? What does this mean, System?\u201d Hearing System, Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t help but ask in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal Mangekyo Sharingan is the ultimate evolution of Sharingan. After awakening Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, each corresponding original doujutsu of two eyes\u2014-Susanoo would also reach its ultimate evolution, becoming complete body Susanoo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut once evolved to Eternal Mangekyo, all the susanoo of other eyes will gradually disappear, their strength will be concentrated to one Susanoo\u2019s form, strengthening its strength. This is the reason I asked which Susanoo you want to keep.\u201d System slowly explained to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>After hearing the System, Ren Tianyou pondered for a long time, slowly considering the uses of Susanoo\u2019s form and performances. Uchiha Itachi\u2019s Susanoo had Totsuka Blade that could seal everything, Yata Mirror that could reflect everything, and Yasaka Magatama for long range attack. Uchiha Sasuke\u2019s Susanoo had bow and arrow for extremely long range attack, as well as after Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, his Susanoo had Amaterasu ball. And his own Susanoo had Futsu no Mitama sword, which possessed power to control myriad of thunder, moreover could also seal all soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cSystem, exchange Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.\u201d Ren Tianyou suddenly opened his eyes, and resolutely said, \u201cAs for Susanoo, keep\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

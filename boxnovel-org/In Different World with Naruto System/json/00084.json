The bone dragon had use its own body to block the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Then with a \u2018ka ka\u2019 cracking sound, the bones of the bone dragon cracked, then changed into a skeleton prop. In fact, this Saint ranked bone dragon, still had not bring out its true power, because of error in the command of Yan Xinluo. So under the Hachimon Tonkou (The 8 inner gates), it was completely defeated.</p><br/><p>Looking at the bone dragon falling on the ground and scattering, a grief and indignation flashed in the eyes of Yan Xinluo. He had never thought that he actually had to depend on the summoned bone dragon to save himself, for him who had never experienced a defeat, this was a great irony.</p><br/><p>Landing on the ground, he felt that his body was quite exhausted, so inside his heart, Ren Tianyou thought, \u201cI should not waste any more time. I must hurry and end this match.\u201d He couldn\u2019t delay too much, as while in the state of opening 6th gate, his body had to bear extremely heavy burden, so Ren Tianyou must end this match quickly.</p><br/><p>After thinking, Ren Tianyou quickly rushed towards Yan Xinluo. At this time, Yan Xinluo had also already landed on the ground and he quickly changed into a light beam and dart towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Then looking at Ren Tianyou who was still on the arena, a determination flashed in the eyes of Yan Xinluo. Then he returned Karma Transmigration into its sheath, after that he bit his index finger, then both hand quickly made some gestures, and then put his palms together.</p><br/><p>\u201cTransmigration 6 change\u2014\u20143rd form\u2014\u2014Dark night transmigration!\u201d Along with the voice of Yan Xinluo, a \u2018hong\u2019 sound rang out, and a huge black hole suddenly appeared behind Ren Tianyou. Then a tremendous suction force immediately came from that black hole, and Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t get any time to react and was directly sucked inside the black hole. After that this huge black hole slowly became small, and finally disappeared. And similarly another black hole appeared behind Yan Xinluo too, Yan Xinluo didn\u2019t resist and was also sucked inside the black hole, then disappeared, leaving behind only that empty, destroyed and deformed arena. And all the audiences who were watching the fight could only look at each other in blank dismay.</p><br/><p>After being sucked inside the black hole, Ren Tianyou was in a dark passage, shortly afterwards he sensed that he had entered a completely dark environment. In this place, Ren Tinyou clearly sensed that the power of elements was clearly weaker by many times, you could say it was almost almost zero. And inside this space, Ren Tianyou sensed a strange special power.</p><br/><p>At that moment, again another black hole opened, and Ren Tianyou sensed someone else had entered this space. Carefully using mental perception, he discovered that it was actually the aura of Yan Xinluo. Just when Ren Tinyou was full of curiosity and was about to ask why had he also come here, the voice of Yan Xinluo was heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this moment, I have consumed the remaining 2/3 power of my whole body and barely managed to use Transmigration 6 change\u20143rd form\u2014Dark night transmigration. In this place there is not any power of elements, only inexhaustible spirit power. Do you know why we are named as Si Shen clan? Of course because we have the ability to directly attack the spirit to bring death. Now I will use my remaining little power to defeat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the explanation of Yan Xinluo, Ren Tianyou was clearly surprised. Unexpectedly they had the ability to directly attack the spirit of human beings. This move actually had the similar effect as Tsukuyomi.</p><br/><p>In fact strictly speaking, Tsukuyomi surpass this move hands down. Only those who possess Mangekyo Sharingan are able to resist the effect of Tsukuyomi, and remaining all would be finished off within a second without exception. The effect of this Tsukuyomi was believed to be strongest genjutsu second only to the Kotoamatsukami (Distinguished Heavenly Gods) of Uchiha Shisui in Naruto world.</p><br/><p>But for the effect of Tsukuyomi, it required eye contact with other person, so in the midst of this dark environment, he was not in favorable position to use Tsukuyomi. At this time, Ren Tianyou suddenly sensed a special fluctuation around him, shortly afterwards he felt a severe pain in his brain, as if a needle was pricking his brain. He could not help but to release a groan of pain, and blood came out from the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should not drag on this fight any longer, this way sooner or later I will exhaust my energy to death.\u201d Ren Tianyou thought inside his heart. Resisting the pain in his head, he looked around in that endless darkness, and tried to hear any noise, but couldn\u2019t hear a single sound. \u201cSince you didn\u2019t make any noise, look how this daddy will deal with you.\u201d [T.L: someone suggested me to use \u2018this daddy\u2019 in place of \u2018I, your father\u2019. How is this, please comment your thought! From now on should I use \u2018this daddy\u2019 or use \u2018I, your father\u2019.]</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stood up and straighten his both hands, after that he quickly waved his two fists, then along with the quick punch of Ren Tianyou, flame balls appeared in this space, and these flame balls illuminated this entire dark space. These flame balls formed a huge flame light circle, just like the spread tail of peacock, which was gorgeous to look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong long long!\u201d A loud sound of explosion rang out, the countless flame balls hit all around in the space together with the explosion sound. In less than 2 seconds, the \u2018kacha kacha\u2019 sound of shattering rang out, and a innumerable cracks appeared on the dark space just like a cracked glass, after that with a loud sound of scattering, the dark space all around him scattered into innumerable small pieces.</p><br/><p>All the peoples on the audiences were unceasingly searching for Ren Tianyou and Yan Xinluo, nevertheless regardless of where they looked they couldn\u2019t see even the shadow of both of them. But when they couldn\u2019t bear anymore, suddenly they heard a series of cracking sound from the space in the arena, then innumerable flame balls suddenly flew out and hit the floor of the arena. Then together with the loud sound of explosion, a cloud of dusts rose up.</p><br/><p>After the dust clouds dissipated, in the middle of the big ditch on the arena, they saw the figure of Ren Tianyou who was standing and Yan Xinluo who was lying on the side. The battle clothes of Yan Xinluo was already disintegrated and he looked worse than the beggar. Currently there was a wounds in his body and the blood was flowing out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201d Looking at Ren Tinyou, Yan Xinluo struggled to stand up, but it\u2019s too bad, he felt severe pain and powerlessness and he had no choice but to give up this plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not move, you have already lost this match.\u201d Looking at Yan Xinluo who was struggling to stand up, Ren Tianyou slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I lose in this match. Lost thoroughly, however, I am sincerely convinced about this loss.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo stopped struggling. Then looking at the azure sky, he said calmly.</p><br/><p>After Yan Xinluo admitted the defeat, the barrier around the arena also slowly disappeared. Actually Zhao Guanghui saw that the match was already over, so he had conveniently removed this barrier.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou extended his right hand towards Yan Xinlou, and looked at Yan Xinluo with a smile. Seeing the hand in front of him, Yan Xinluo was clearly dazed, and a smile appeared on his ice-cold face. Then he grasp the hand of Ren Tianyou with his hand. Then Ren Tianyou pulled up Yan Xinluo from the ground.</p><br/><p>At this time, the judge also arrived at the arena, then turned towards the audiences and announced, \u201cI declare Ren Tianyou as the winner of this match. Now this ranking competition of 1st grade reached its ending, and our champion is from special class of warrior court\u2019s Ren Tianyou. Second is similarly from special class of warrior court\u2019s Yan Xinluo. Let us give them a round of warm applause, and thank them for showing us this great match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Judge, all the peoples in the audience immediately clapped warmly. Everyone gave the warm applause for these 2 people on the arena who were already exhausted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And the figure of Ren Tianyou continued to jump towards the direction from where the long arrows were shot.</p><br/><p>And just when Ren Tianyou landed in the middle of that huge thick bush which was able to completely cover any man with ordinary height, a petite figure suddenly shot out from inside that thick bush, and jumped onto a tree and ran away. That figure was very agile and speedy, merely in a blink of an eye, that figure disappeared from before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, running away?\u201d Seeing the figure of that person had disappeared before his eyes, Ren Tianyou snorted coldly, then he also jumped and chased after it.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, 5 long arrows were again quickly incoming towards him from the direction where that figure had disappeared.</p><br/><p>With no other choice, Ren Tianyou was forced to stop and flip backwards several times, to dodge these long arrows. Then with a \u2018peng\u2019, \u2018peng\u2019\u2026..several sounds, these long arrows directly shot at the place where Ren Tianyou was just a moment ago, and the feathers of these 5 long arrows were still unceasingly shaking.</p><br/><p>And when Ren Tianyou had just come to stop his body, that long thick bush in the front, as if alive, continuously extend its long tendrils towards him, as if it wanted to completely swallow him.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had no other choice but to jump and he arrived at side\u2019s huge tree, but when Ren Tianyou had just came to stop, the whole tree suddenly shook ceaselessly, as if it wanted Ren Tianyou to fall down. Then under the unexpected and surprised gaze of Ren Tianyou, the roots of this tree grew out from the earth, and its branches changed into arms, which advanced towards Ren Tianyou who was standing at the tree trunk to capture him.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d The complexion of Ren Tianyou changed, and he couldn\u2019t help but cursed. Then heavily stepping on the branch he was standing, he jumped towards the sky. But those violently growing thick bush also closely followed after him in the sky.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou stepped on the space cross-section which couldn\u2019t be seen with naked eyes, and was dodging unceasingly in the air. And from the corner of his eyes, he saw the roots of those big trees that grew out from the earth were also advancing towards him. And on the ground beneath him, he saw innumerable vines, thick bushes, and branches, under the mysterious power were unceasingly growing and was stretching towards him. And in the middle of this, several arrows were also continuously shooting towards him, making it even more troublesome to deal with.</p><br/><p>The dodging was getting more and more difficult, under such concentrated attacks, if not for his Sharingan\u2019s powerful observation ability, he would have long been swallowed by these attacks. Even kamui was not that big of a help in such continuous concentrated attack, as kamui could be maintained continuously for only 5 minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is getting bad, first I should see whether I can make them stop their attack or not, after all I am here to seek medication. If I get too heavy handed, and unknowingly injured them, then I fear it would be even harder for me to request the medicine.\u201d Ren Tianyou simultaneously thought while dodging, then scanning around, he said in a loud voice, \u201cFriends of Elf clan, please listen to my one sentence, I didn\u2019t came here with any ill intention, rather there is one matter I want to request you Elf clan to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Elf clan does not welcome outsiders, and we can clearly sense dense bloody qi on your body, you must have killed a lot of people just some time ago. You blood reeking human, we Elf clan will not welcome you, so please leave.\u201d After Ren Tianyou spoke, a crisp and beautiful female voice came from all direction.</p><br/><p>And hearing this, Ren Tianyou was stunned, then made a wry smile on his face. He honestly had never though that the perception of the members of Elf clan was actually this powerful. It had already been 5 days he had left the Soaring dragon mountain villa of Ximen clan, but didn\u2019t expect that they could clearly sense the bloody qi that contaminated his body due to killings of that time, wasn\u2019t this too heaven defying. Could it be that the perceptivity of this Elf clan was comparable to the perceptivity of Sage mode?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my hands are stained with the bloods of many peoples, but all the peoples I killed were the peoples I deemed should be killed, so I feel no qualms in my heart. I arrived here to this Elven forest after untold hardships, as I have something important I want to request your Elf Queen, hope friends of elf clan be lenient.\u201d Ren Tianyou said with honest expression. In any case, Ren Tianyou would never show mercy to those peoples who he deemed should be killed, but he also had never killed innocent.</p><br/><p>Even if other people said he was a devil, as long as he firmly stayed true to his original intention, he was okay with it. In this world there was neither devil nor Buddha. And compared to hypocritical Gods and Buddha, Ren Tianyou rather become devil who would remember debts of gratitude coupled with duty to revenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Elf clan doesn\u2019t welcome outsiders, no matter what your matter is, we Elf clan forbid outsider to enter. If you don\u2019t leave now, we will not show any mercy.\u201d This time it was the male voice, which refused the request of Ren Tianyou without a slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I will put off a discussion until I caught you rats.\u201d Hearing that he was refused, the complexion of Ren Tianyou slowly became cold. Then while dodging the surprise attack of 3 long arrows, he saw those insanely growing tendrils and vines which were stretching towards him. Seeing these, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals, and after few seconds of dodging the attacks, he completed making hand seals. After that he placed his right hand in front of his mouth, took a deep breath and spat out huge blazing flame ball, from his mouth towards those stretching vines and tendrils.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014-Gokakyu no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014-Fireball Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018hong\u2019 sound, this huge flame immediately spread and began to rapidly burn innumerable tendrils and vines to ashes. Then remaining power of this flame directly burned those thick bushes too, and began to unceasingly spread to all those stretched thick bushes and vines, also burning them to ashes. The surroundings immediately changed into violently burning sea of flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, since you can\u2019t tell good form bad, then we will also no longer show any mercy. Everyone begin all-out attack, put your life on the line.\u201d After Ren Tianyou counter attacked, the elf man hiding on the dark ordered to launch all-out attack towards Ren TIanyou.</p><br/><p>Then Ren Tianyou saw large amount of dark green colored dense fog spread in all direction, and every vines that were infected by this dense fog began to quickly grow, became bigger, and attacked towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou immediately released fire style jutsu to block these quickly growing plants. Under his blazing flame, all of those plants were burned to ashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, if you don\u2019t stop, then don\u2019t blame me for using too much force.\u201d Ren Tianyou scanned all around, as he slowly spoke this sentence filled with chill air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, with only you alone, you are not qualified to talk such big words. Let\u2019s see if you really have the ability to injure any of us?\u201d A voice full of disdain came through the dark. It seems they were clearly not taking the threats of Ren Tianyou seriously. After that he commanded the surrounding companions, \u201cRelease ten thousand arrows simultaneously, and shot this intruder into a sieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after this voice, the sound of bowstrings vibrating sound reverberated through this place. Ren Tianyou scanned all his surroundings, and discovered innumerable sharp arrows were quickly advancing towards him, giving him nowhere to dodge. Seeing this, the complexion of Ren Tianyou sunk, even clay figurine had three points of anger, let alone Ren Tianyou. These Elves were repetitively making it difficult for him, so he decided to let these guys know his ability. \u201cHumph, since it\u2019s like this, don\u2019t blame me if someone got killed or injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals. Just when these sharp arrows arrived just before him, he finished making hand seals.</p><br/><p>\u201cKaton\u2014-Zukokku! (Fire Style\u2014-Searing Migraine!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took a deep breath, then spat out blazing flame from his mouth, which quickly spread in all direction. And before those sharp arrows were able to reach the body of Ren Tianyou, they were completely burned to ashes by this flame. After that along with loud explosion sound, almost all the trees and plants around were burned to ashes, practically leaving behind nothing.</p><br/><p>And these flame still quickly spread, and all those elves that were hiding in the surroundings were forced to show themselves one after another. Then very quickly retreated to dodge these terrifying flame, so as to avoid getting injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, finally these rats are forced out of hiding.\u201d Looking at those fleeing elves, Ren Tianyou coldly snorted while standing on the sky. After that he stopped this fire style jutsu, then purple lighting appeared all around his body, and in a flash, he disappeared from this place.</p><br/><p>In front of one female elf with long green colored hair and two pointed ears, who was holding green bow and arrows, and wearing light green colored leather armor, lightning suddenly flashed, then a figure of a person suddenly appeared in front of her, blocking the way of this female elf. Seeing this, this female elf who was in the process of fleeing away from the blazing flame was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>But she was not able to stare blankly at this figure for much longer, this lightning figure suddenly flashed and immediately appeared before her. After that before she could react, she was kicked on the flank and was sent flying, as she felt unbearable pain on her body. And only after slamming with two trees, she fell down on the ground, and lied there motionlessly. She was truly kicked just like a football.</p><br/><p>Although these elves didn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them, but Ren Tianyou still didn\u2019t carried away in anger and killed them. He knew that the consequences of killing them, as a result even though his heart was filled with anger, he controlled his strength so as to not kill them.</p><br/><p>And just a moment ago too, he had controlled the spreading speed of his fire style jutsu too, otherwise with his current attainment in fire style, how could these ordinary elves have time to flee. He merely wanted to use fire style jutsu to force them out from their hiding. After that he could easily took out all of them one by one.</p><br/><p>And after seeing the state of that female elf that was attacked by Ren Tianyou, the remaining elves that were also in the process of dodging hurriedly became angry, then angrily raised their bow and shot arrows towards Ren Tianyou. In their opinion, Ren Tianyou had killed that elf.</p><br/><p>Looking at those rapidly incoming long arrows, Ren Tianyou just curled his lips and smiled with disdain. If they shoot like this, then even in their dream they wound not be able to hit him. Controlling his body, Ren Tianyou rapidly rotated his body in the sky, and released powerful chakra from his whole body. As a layer of powerful chakra covered his entire body. The rotation speed of Ren Tianyou become even faster and faster, then this chakra gradually changed into white colored tornado column.</p><br/><p>Suddenly ear deafening sound of dragon roar reverberated through the air, then the tornado column quickly stretched, suddenly changed into huge dragon, and two huge dragon eyes flashed with blue light. After that this huge dragon god directly advanced forward. And the powerful air current around this huge dragon god uprooted the trees around it, and blew it towards the sky. This was the taijutsu which Ren Tianyou had not used for a long time\u2014- Konoha Ryujin (Leaf Dragon God). This move was perfect to use in this scenario.</p><br/><p>The long arrows that were advancing towards Ren Tinyou were not able to arrive in front of him. Before they could arrive, the powerful chakra air current around the body of Leaf dragon god, would directly blew them off. Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t even need to use a bit of strength to block them. After that he directly advanced towards elves. And along with a loud \u2018hong\u2019 sound, a huge dusts cloud suddenly rose. And 5 or 6 figures shot out from this dust cloud, then flying backwards, they heavily slammed into few trees, then falling on the ground, they lied there motionlessly.</p><br/><p>After this dust cloud dissipated, the figure of Ren Tianyou appeared in that place. Standing on the middle of the crater, looking at the figures standing on the branch of the tree in front of him, he opened his mouth, \u201cI will not let any of you flee.\u201d Finished speaking, he changed into a blur, then disappeared from that place.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>After about 3 minutes, several more pits had appeared on the grounds, and the trees around were also upside down, as if prehistoric beast had rampaged here. And many elves was lying on the ground motionlessly as if they were dead. Both male and female elves were lying on the ground without any movement.</p><br/><p>And under one huge tree, one handsome male elf sat exhausted on the ground and was unceasingly retreating until his back touched that huge tree. After he no longer had place to retreat, looking at the figure slowly advancing towards him, he opened his mouth and yelled loudly with voice full of fear, \u201cYou\u2026\u2026you devil, don\u2019t come, don\u2019t come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, devil?\u201d Hearing this, Ren Tianyou smiled with disdain, then firmly staring at this elf, he asked, \u201cWhere is your elf clan located?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil, you devil, you killed so many of my companions. Even if I have to die, I will never tell you. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Finished speaking, this male elf suddenly roared loudly. After from somewhere around the leg, he took out dagger, then stabbed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing this, Ren Tianyou just snorted coldly. He merely used his right hand to pinch the blade of the dagger, stopping all his movements. After that staring at his eyes, his Sharingan rotated as powerful eye power gushed out from his eyes and entered the eyes of this male elf.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion\u2014-Sharingan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the start of Sharingan\u2019s illusion, the eyes of this elf slowly become dull. Finally both of his eyes became lifeless, and his struggling simultaneously stopped. He nevertheless had already fell into the illusion of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me about the location of your elf clan.\u201d Seeing the gaze of this elf was lifeless, Ren Tianyou slightly smiled then slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the middle of Elven forest, our Elf Queen have set up enormous nature barrier. Other than member of elf clan, no outsider could enter this barrier, unless our queen herself create entrance on the barrier to let outsider enter.\u201d This male elf slowly answered to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the middle of Elven forest?\u201d Hearing this male elf, Ren Tianyou looked at the distance place of this forest, as he thought, \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem entering this barrier, because as long as I use kamui no barrier can stop my path.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished thinking, Ren Tianyou looked over to those elves that were beaten by him, and thought. Suddenly he had a good idea, then he took out long rope from inside his pace ring, after that used his Kusanagi sword to cut this rope into short pieces of rope. Then using these short ropes, he thoroughly tied both hands of these elves, then all of them were sucked into the kamui space of his right eye.</p><br/><p>After finishing all this, he patted his hands and said something with a smile, \u201cSettled.\u201d After that looking at that dully standing male elf, he said, \u201cLed the way, and take me to the location of your Elf clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d This elf answered without slightest bit of hesitation. Under the illusion of Ren Tianyou, he didn\u2019t have any resistance. Directly leading the way, he walked towards the center of the forest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And among large scale lightning style ninjutsu, this move Raiton\u2014- Raimu Raito (Lightning Style\u2014- Limelight Jutsu) was relatively a little bit more convenient, furthermore the chakra consumption of this move was also not that large.</p><br/><p>Inside this already changed into piles of debris iron forest, everyone including all those created Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers had already changed into charred charcoal.</p><br/><p>Standing in the midair above this ruins and looking at the mess underneath, Ren Tianyou softly sighed. The people died with this move was not limited to Demon clan, even those pitiful 100 clan\u2019s people were included. But just like Ren Tianyou had said before, rather than letting them live in boundless nightmare and in a life without a trace of living wish, it would be better to become executioner and send them on their way, making them thoroughly free, no longer suffering the harassment of these nightmares. Sometime, for some people, death instead was better ending.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon clan, let me see the strength you have collected in these 30,000 years.\u201d Recalling the scene of before within the iron forest which could be rated as the scene of hell, now Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t have any trace of good opinion towards them. And with his eyes full of dense killing intent, he muttered.</p><br/><p>Before Ren Tianyou considered the war between Demon clan and Divine Wind Continent\u2019s human and 100 clan\u2019s people as a vile against one another between races. But from the time he saw Demon clan in God Weeping Region using the resentment of dead people to create Ferocious Skeleton Beast, he had a trace of ill feeling towards Demon clan. But now seeing the current action of Demon clan, one might well say, Ren Tianyou was full of killing intent towards these Demon clan.</p><br/><p>And with regarding to Demon clan\u2019s Demon Emperor and that mysterious Mo Yun, his killing intent was even denser. If it was not for Mo Yun providing this method to create Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers, then these people of 100 clans might not have suffered such great inhuman torture. And that Demon Emperor was even more ruthless, for the sake of victory, he actually accepted such vicious method.</p><br/><p>Perhaps for these setting oneself high above the masses and great strength people, those captured slaves of 100 clans were merely some nobodies, so why would they care about their life and death.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are able to think of using the resentment power of 100 clans\u2019 people while dying to create Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers, creating an undying army, then I will answer evil with evil. This time when you Demon clan invade, I will let you see what is called true undying army.\u201d Recalling those people of 100 clans hanging down from iron trees with wounds, and their circumstance of death better than living, even stronger killing intent filled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Now that Demon clan were intending to build the undying army, then he will let them see what was called true undying army.</p><br/><p>Only now, Ren Tianyou finally made a firm resolution to learn Edo Tensei (Reanimation).</p><br/><p>Edo Tensei (Reanimation) was a forbidden summoning jutsu created by Second Hokage Senju Tobirama. This jutsu could summon the soul of people who had already passed away from the Pure Land to this world, and binds this soul of decease to a living vessel, resurrecting them. After that they are completely under the control of the user of this jutsu.</p><br/><p>And the resurrected person\u2019s personality, memory, and kekkei genkai power, all of them would exist. One might well say, they were living killing weapon, unlike those killing weapon Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers created by Mo Yun which only know killing without a trace of consciousness.</p><br/><p>And the resurrected people would become undying existence. As their body is filled with dusts, even if their body is completely destroyed, that would be rapidly restored. Only when one use sealing techniques to seal them, or use yinyang style to directly exterminate their origin, they would be powerless to restore themselves.</p><br/><p>Before when Ren Tianyou ran into a number of experts, and finally after killing them, he would intentionally keep the corpse or the part of corpse of them. For instance, Dragon Emperor, four princes of Dragon clan, Ximen clan\u2019s two High God realm experts as well as forced to explode Amike\u2019s left behind arm.</p><br/><p>While Ren Tianyou had been collecting these experts\u2019 DNA, but he however was always indecisive to learn this ninjutsu, because this justu defies the Heaven and was also cruel.</p><br/><p>The people who have seen Naruto would already know the other condition that was required to use this ninjutsu, which was requirement of living person as a sacrifice to use that person as a vessel for reincarnated person. So directly speaking, one resurrection meant sacrificing of one living person.</p><br/><p>This using one living person as container was not a big deal for Ren Tianyou, as, if the worst comes to the worst, then he could just catch a number of strung through and filled with evil people of Demon clan from Demon World as containers. But Edo Tensei (Reanimation), this ninjutsu however required to summon deceased\u2019s soul, one might say that this was great disrespect to deceased people. If outside people knew this, only god would know what accusation others will place on him.</p><br/><p>But after Ren Tianyou saw Demon clan creating those Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers, he instantly had a resolute thought in his mind. That thought was, rumors and so on things can just go to hell, now dealing with Demon clan takes first priority.</p><br/><p>First no need to speak about that tragic scene of them creating Demon Spirit Baleful Soldiers, even Amike almost kill him, so Ren Tianyou couldn\u2019t let these Demon clan easily slip by, and Demon clan will also not easily forgive Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know whether this Edo Tensei (Reanimation) is difficult to learn or not ah.\u201d Ren Tianyou scratched his head while blankly thinking this. One might well say that only a hand full of people were able to use this Edo Tensei (Reanimation) in Naruto world.</p><br/><p>According to the knowledge of Ren Tianyou, the people he know were able to use Edo Tensei (Reanimation) were Senju Tobirama (As a creator of this jutsu, how could it be that he couldn\u2019t use this jutsu?), Orichimaru, Kabuto and Uchiha Madara (Madara had on his own accord removed the control of Edo Tensei (Reanimation), this shows he also grasp this move.)</p><br/><p>And the person who became most famous in the entire ninja word using this Edo Tensei (Reanimation) was Kabuto who had absorbed the chakra of Orichimaru. Only thinking about the lineup of people Kabuto had reincarnated alone was enough to cause other feel fear.</p><br/><p>In the fourth ninja war, Kabuto resurrected former Seven Swordsmen of hidden mist, Hanzo of Hidden Rain Village, Kinkaku, Ginkaku, Kimimaro, Chiyo, former jinchuurikis (such as Nibi Yugito Nii, Sanbi Yagura, Yonbi Roshi\u2026\u2026), past kages (second tsuchikage, second mizukage, third raikage, fourth kazekage), Akatsuki organization\u2019s dead members (such as Sasori, Deidera, Uchiha Itachi, Nagato possessing rinnegan\u2026..), and even Uchiha Madara this big *OSS was also resurrected, one might say this was powerful lineup to the extreme.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, first I should gather some necessary materials for Edo Tensei (Reanimation) in this Demon World, in any case, there is still two years or so time left for the invasion of Demon clan. Before then, I want to master yet another ninjutsu, Edo Tensei (Reanimation) instead is not urgent.\u201d Thinking about yet another ninjutsu, Ren Tianyou decided to first gather a number of things required for Edo Tensei (Reanimation) to be ready to learn Edo Tensei (Reanimation). After thinking, he disappeared along with the spiral shaped space ripple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then this mysterious person waved his right hand, and a magic wand which was made up of bone with a human shaped skull embedded on its top appeared in his hand. After that along with the flash of black radiance from his body, suddenly innumerable thickly dotted pitch-black energy arrows appeared in front of him, and those arrows shot towards Ren Tianyou. Also those 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts at his side, released a blood red colored radiances, then they changed into a two light beam, and advanced perfectly straight towards Ren Tianyou behind those arrows.</p><br/><p>Confronting the attack of this mysterious man and bones of dead ferocious beast, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t try to dodge or block these attacks, he just released a powerful eye power from his right Mangekyo Sharingan. After advancing to the kage level, and in addition with vastly increase in eye power of his Sharingan, now Ren Tianyou could control his Sharingan with even more high proficiency.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d As if the body of Ren Tianyou was transparent, the energy arrows of that mysterious person and those 2 bones of dead ferocious beast directly penetrated through the body Ren Tianyou, and without decreasing his speed, Ren Tianyou continued to advance towards that mysterious person. And just after Ren Tianyou passed those 2 bones of dead ferocious beast, boundless amount of sands appeared out of nowhere directly burying those 2 bones of dead ferocious beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two skeleton, allow ore-sama to temporarily play with you.\u201d Seeing that its yellow sand had buried both bones of dead ferocious beasts, Shukaku spoke with disdain. But at this time, suddenly 2 crater appeared on the surface of sand, then with \u201cpeng\u201d, \u201cpeng\u201d sound, 2 blood-red colored radiance came out from inside the sand, and continued to advance towards Shukaku.</p><br/><p>On the other side, when that mysterious man saw the move of Ren Tianyou, he couldn\u2019t help but to stare blankly. He couldn\u2019t even understand how Ren Tianyou had dodged his attack and in addition the surprise attack of 2 bones of dead ferocious beast just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>But he knew that now was not the time to hesitate or to ponder about it, as Ren Tianyou was already about to arrive in front of him. His body suddenly released a huge amount of black colored light, then his body immediately changed into a black colored shadow, after that he instantly reached 50 meter away.</p><br/><p>But just when he come to stop at that location, his mind suddenly felt extreme sense of danger, so without slightest bit of hesitation, he immediately released huge amount of energy and completely covered his entire body. Just after he had finished casting his magic, he immediately sensed a numerous sharp stabs on his energy cover. And when he carefully looked, he suddenly discovered thin needles made up of lightning energy were continuously attacking him. This was Ren Tianyou\u2019s ninjutsu, Chidori Senbon.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his Chidori Senbon was blocked, Ren Tianyou thought, \u201cThis guy is highly alert.\u201d Again looking at that cloak that was completely covering the head of that mysterious man, Ren Tianyou hatefully cursed inside his mind, \u201cF**k, why the hell is he covering his head? Could it be that he knows about my doujutsu of Sharingan, but this is clearly the first meeting between us, so how could he know about my doujutsu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he felt extremely powerful pressure from this guy, plus Shukaku had said that this guy was gathering resentment power, Ren Tianyou had directly wanted to use Tsukuyomi, and directly knock him out, so as to avoid many troubles. But this fellow had covered his head with that headgear, so Ren Tianyou had no choice but to give up that plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I can\u2019t use Tsukuyomi, I can only try other methods. I must capture this guy alive, then use illusion to get the information out of him, about the secrets of this God weeping region.\u201d Ren Tianyou tightly clutched his hands and firmly stared at this mysterious man. At that time, that mysterious person suddenly made a move, around his body suddenly a green colored bits and pieces of flames just as will-o\u2019-the-wisp appeared. Then these bits and pieces of flame combined in the air to take the form of huge green colored flame ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell! The nether world wildfire ball!\u201d That mysterious man roared loudly, then under the commanded of this man, that huge green colored wildfire ball quickly advanced towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Looking at the wildfire ball and again looking at the Shukaku who was fighting against those 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts behind him, Ren Tianyou instantly made a decision. After that Ren Tianyou firmly locked on to the wildfire ball with his left eye, and gradually powerful eye power poured out from his left eye, after that a black hole suddenly appeared in the space in front of this wildfire ball. Then this black hole gradually enlarged, and this wildfire ball was absorbed inside it.</p><br/><p>Although Ren Tianyou knew that even if he let this wildfire ball hit Shukaku, this flame ball would absolutely cause no damage to Shukaku who had the strongest absolute defense. Nevertheless even if this attack couldn\u2019t cause any damage, it absolutely would disrupt the battle moves of Shukaku, so he decided to use Kamui of left eye to get rid of it.</p><br/><p>After getting rid of the attack, Ren Tianyou quickly made a series of hand seals with both of his hands. \u201cFuton\u2014\u2014Atsugai! (Wind Style\u2014\u2013Pressure Damage!)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Suddenly a compressed to the very high density wind quickly advance towards that mysterious man. This wind attack covered extremely large area, and that mysterious man was completely swallowed by the blast of this attack. After that \u201chong long long\u201d continuous sound of explosion rang out.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou was not concern about that mysterious person, rather he quickly jumped back, and landed on the head of Shukaku. \u201cShukaku, why didn\u2019t you finish this battle till now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because these two skeleton is too nimble, so it\u2019s hard for me to catch them.\u201d Shukaku was also little helpless, he didn\u2019t expect that he would feel this vexed in his first fight in this different world. So Shukaku who already had a bad temper was almost about to blow up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is also quite hard for me alone to deal with that guy over there, so when that guy over there is defending against my Futon\u2014\u2014Atsugai (Wind Style\u2014\u2013Pressure Damage), lets join force and quickly deal with these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts first.\u201d Looking at those 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts, Ren Tianyou said to Shukaku.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Shukaku agreed. Now Shukaku only desire was to use its sand to completely crush these 2 ants.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou make sandstorm to pin them down, and I will seize the chance to catch both of them.\u201d Ren Tianyou said to Shukaku. And after hearing Ren Tianyou, Shukaku immediately caused towering sands waves to appear and press down those 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts.</p><br/><p>But these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts was after all at least God-ranked expert level, so they were able to easily dodge these sand waves, by flying in the sky.</p><br/><p>But this time, from beneath the sands, several huge hands made up of sands appeared and directly caught the ankles of these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts, and then they were pulled down from the sky. From the head of Shukaku, Ren Tianyou had used Sabaku\u2014Hando (Desert hands), and these desert hands had caught both bones of dead ferocious beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal them. Shukaku, act quickly.\u201d Seeing that he had already caught the targets, Ren Tainyou immediately yelled towards Shukaku.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Let me turn these 2 flies into bone dregs.\u201d Before Ren Tianyou had reminded him, after seeing that Ren Tianyou had caught the targets, Shukaku had already made his preparation. Suddenly the sands at the side of these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts violently stirred, and gradually the sands started to surround their bodies, and after completely surrounding the bodies of these 2 bones of dead ferocious beasts, the sands took the form of two huge desert pyramids. After that numerous mysterious runes unceasingly appeared on the surface and covered the whole pyramid.</p><br/><p>\u201cSabaku Sotaiso Fuin! (Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal!)\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

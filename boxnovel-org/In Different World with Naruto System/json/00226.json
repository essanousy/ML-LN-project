Right now, out in the water, Ren Tianyou was standing on the surface of water while folding his hands. And with a slight smile on his face, he was staring at Muyue who was practicing walking on the water in front of him.</p><br/><p>Right now, the body of Muyue didn\u2019t give any kind of weak feeling as before. Now her legs were stepping on the surface of water, and slowly controlling her body, she was very carefully walking and running on the surface of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever thought the chakra control ability of elder sister Yue\u2019er is actually this strong. She is far better than me.\u201d Seeing elder sister Yue\u2019er currently running around the surface of water without any mishap, Ren Tianyou sighed inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince elder sister Yue\u2019er have such powerful chakra control, she ought to learn medical ninjutsu. Should I give her that medical ninjutsu of Tusnade?\u201d Seeing elder sister Yue\u2019er had very good chakra control, Ren Tianyou slowly thought inside his heart. Currently they lacked a healer, so elder sister Yue\u2019er might be a good candidate.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about it, first I should test her chakra nature, only after that I can decide her training direction.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, then sunk his consciousness into the system inside his brain, then exchanged chakra test paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, come here for a minute.\u201d Holding this paper, Ren Tianyou called over Muyue who was practicing treading on the water.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, Little You?\u201d Muyue wiped the sweat on her elegant face, then asked after walking over to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Yue\u2019er, this is chakra test paper, you only need to pour your chakra into it, and you will know your chakra nature. After that I will decide your training direction.\u201d Ren Tianyou gave chakra test paper to Muyue and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this paper that chakra test paper you had talked about before? How do I use it ah?\u201d Looking at this extremely thin test paper, Muyue curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple, as long as you inject you chakra into this paper, that enough. If your nature is fire, this paper will burn; wind, split from the middle; lightning, it will crumple; earth, it will crumble; water, it will be soaked.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s only it, then here it goes.\u201d Hearing the explanation of Ren Tianyou, Muyue was excited, then she slowly poured her very hardly cultivated chakra into this chakra test paper. And the reaction of this paper appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>First the test paper split from the middle, then two half directly crumbled, following by suddenly burning into ashes. And the ashes fell down to the beneath sea surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t expect elder sister yue\u2019er, you actually possess fire, earth and wind, these three nature, truly awesome.\u201d Seeing the reaction of chakra test paper, Ren Tianyou sighed a bit and said to Muyue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, never though I am also a genius.\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, as well as seeing the reaction of chakra test paper, Muyue excitedly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, yes, you are gen\u2026..\u201d Just then, suddenly a thought appeared in the mind of Ren Tianyou, and he didn\u2019t say the original words already in his mouth. He just muttered to himself, \u201cFire, Earth, Wind, these three nature, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Little You?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou muttering to himself, Muyue asked.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou ignored Muyue, rather his consciousness directly sunk into his brain\u2019s Naruto System. Only after a long while, Ren Tianyou opened his eyes, and a pleasantly surprised expression was flashing in his eyes, \u201cSure enough, it is like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened, Little You? Are you okay?\u201d Seeing the unusual condition of Ren Tianyou, Muyue asked with concern. She didn\u2019t understand, why he who was fine just a moment ago suddenly became this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, elder sister Yue\u2019er. But your chakra nature gave me big shock.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, then excitedly staring at Muyue, he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy chakra nature? Although I have three nature, still didn\u2019t you also have so?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Muyue confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not same, elder sister Yue\u2019er. Your chakra nature relates to a kind of transcended Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline Limit)\u2019s blood lineage, i.e. Kekkei Tota. This Kekkei Tota will later turn into your most powerful blood lineage.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly explained.</p><br/><p>Yes, the unexpected thing for Ren Tianou was, Muyue\u2019s all three nature were exactly same as the composition nature of Naruto world\u2019s Second Tsuchikage and Third Tsuchikage\u2019s Kekkei Tota Jinton (Dust Style). Fire, Earth and Wind, combining all these nature together would form Naruto World\u2019s sole transcended Kekkei Genkai, Kekkei Tota\u2014\u2014Jinton (Dust Style). And all the people who had watched Naruto would definitely know the might of Jinton (Dust Style). The Jinton (Dust Style) user could create a barrier with both hands, which could directly disintegrate anything or any human on a molecular level within that barrier. It\u2019s too powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cKekkei Tota, what is this?\u201d Muyue confusedly asked. It was obviously her first time hearing these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is for later, now let\u2019s go, we are returning first. And after I teach you basic ninjutsu of Earth, Wind and Fire style, you can practice them.\u201d Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou took Muyue and returned to the place everyone were residing. But inside wooden house, everyone were already in closed door cultivating.</p><br/><p>As before, Ren Tianyou let his shadow clone guide the training of Muyue, and he himself also began to continue his cultivation of before.</p><br/><p>Another week later, in the attic, \u2018hong\u2019 sound could be heard. Ren Tianyou who was sitting cross-legged on the floor had directly hit the floor with his right fist, \u201cDamn, two weeks, already two weeks, but I still am powerless to perceive this space fluctuation, don\u2019t tell me I really don\u2019t have aptitude to train Hiraishin no Jutsu (Flying Thunder God Jutsu)?\u201d</p><br/><p>Up till now, Ren Tianyou was still not able to perceive that so-called any space fluctuation. In his perception, space was still same as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do, don\u2019t tell me I truly need to give up training this Hiraishin no Jutsu?\u201d Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Ren Tianyou spoke in vexed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, I also don\u2019t know how Second and Fourth accomplish this in the first place?\u201d Ren Tianyou helplessly though inside his heart. With regarding to giving up in training Hiraishin no Jutsu, Ren Tianyou was truly reluctant. Mainly because this jutsu was too powerful, so powerful the even as Sharingan user, he didn\u2019t want to part with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, if I can find a method to disrupt the space around, then I could have clearly captured the space fluctuation around.\u201d Ren Tianyou shook his head, and helplessly muttered. But just then, an idea flashed inside his brain, then he became dull for a while. Then his complexion slowly filled with excitement and vexed expression. He immediately hit his own head, directly jumped up, and cursed himself, \u201cF**k, how can I be so stupid ah, I myself possess the Sharingan of Tobi, so if I want to make a space fluctuation, then isn\u2019t that an extremely simple matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Ren Tianyou wanted to collide against the wall. He had never thought all this time he was running on a misconception. Mainly because Hiraishin no Jutsu\u2019s training method as well as his thirst for Hiraishin no Jutsu. This thirst already made him forget everything, forget the means he possessed, and also forget that he could use his ability to make the training perquisites.</p><br/><p>\u201cKage Bunshin no Jutsu!\u201d (Shadow clone Jutsu!)</p><br/><p>Along with a \u2018peng\u2019 sound, white smoke appeared inside the room, from which his shadow clone appeared by his side. Ren Tianyou and shadow clone simultaneously sat cross-legged. He slowly closed his eyes, and began to perceive this whole room with his perception. But the shadow clone by his side didn\u2019t close his eyes, rather his eyes slowly changed into Sharingan of Tobi. Then he released a huge amount of eye power from his right eye. Under the effect of eye power, the space all around slowly distorted, and a huge spiral shaped space ripple appeared, thoroughly disrupting the space inside the room.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou who was sitting cross-legged with eyes closed, suddenly felt the change in space with his perception. The room was full of special energy fluctuation, and under these fluctuation, the shape of space around was slowly changing. One moment twisted, another moment deformed. A lively fluctuation was clearly transmitted into his bran.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally good.\u201d Ren Tianyou roared inside his heart with pleasant surprise. But along with the huge fluctuation in his state of mind, the space fluctuation he had grasped began to disappear slowly.</p><br/><p>With no other choice, Ren Tianyou used his utmost effort to calm down his excited state of mind, and continued to carefully perceive the space fluctuation around him.</p><br/><p>The space fluctuation of around sensed from his perception was slowly transmitted to his brain. The change in space was slowly being broadcasted in his sea of consciousness just like a movie. The nature of space slowly resolved, and come off, then unreservedly transmitted to his sea of knowledge. Slowly Ren Tianyou got drunk, got drunk in this vast space storm.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed, in just this fashion nearly two weeks passed. Ren Tianyou was still sitting cross-legged on the floor without any motion, but the shadow clone he had created had already disappeared. Now in his mind, there was one square shaped silver energy barrier. And a powerful space energy was coming through this barrier.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou used spirit power to stir up this barrier wall. Then this barrier wall immediately distorted quickly, and in reality, the space in the right hand side of Ren Tianyou also slowly began to distort violently. Furthermore this distorted shape and the distorted shape of that barrier wall in his sea of knowledge was exactly the same.</p><br/><p>After the space slowly calmed down, Ren Tianyou also slowly opened his eyes, and within his eyes, unconcealed excitement was flashing. At the beginning he had use kamui of right eye to create space fluctuation to begin, then slowly grasping the rhythm of this space fluctuation, in the sea of knowledge, he finally unceasingly calculated space nature, fluctuation and rhythm. And after two weeks of without sleeping and resting effort, he was finally able to imitate a space of whole room inside his sea of knowledge. So the matter of just now had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, first stage of training finally complete. Now next is second objective, i.e. final phase, launching Hiraishin.\u201d Feeling the different word around him, Ren Tianyou slowly thought. Because of the mistake in the beginning, it took full one month of time to finally completing the first phage.</p><br/><p>But just then, his stomach nevertheless protested. With no other choice, Ren Tianyou stood up and walked out, planning to search something to eat. In this two week training without stopping to eat or sleep, if not for the support of Forever Green inside his body, then he would have already starved to death.</p><br/><p>Opening the door, Ren Tianyou discovered there was no one outside. So he had to get something to eat himself, still fortunately he had spent a savage life for nearly two years in the Magical Beasts Forest, so this small matter didn\u2019t pose any problem for him.</p><br/><p>Just when Ren Tianyou was roasting Fire Cloud Rabbit, the voice of White Tiger came from his side, \u201cYo, Zero, you came out. What is this so sweet smelling, give me some.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Tiger with three huge sword in his back walked out from the woods. Hearing him, Ren Tianyou tore out a thigh of Fire Cloud Rabbit and tossed towards him. \u201cHere rabbit leg for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, thanks a lot.\u201d Catching the rabbit leg thrown towards him by Ren Tianyou, White Tiger sat down by the side of Ren Tianyou and directly began to chew.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, Zero, why did you think of this seclusion?\u201d White Tiger asked while eating.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually I had this idea for a long time, but after getting information from the mother of Vermilion Bird in Flame Phoenix Villa, I became even more resolute for this idea.\u201d Ren Tianyou answered while eating the meat of rabbit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter 5 years, ancient 100 clan will come into the world and Demon clan will invade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Demon clan will invade?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger was so surprised that he shouted and also forget to eat meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, at the time when I obtained this information, I was also equally shocked. So this cultivation is of absolute necessity. When the Demon clan invades, all ancient 100 clans will come into the world, and your current Peak-God ranked strength is definitely insufficient. Even for your ancient 100 clans, it would be very difficult to defend themselves from Demon clan, let alone you. So I only ask you all to seize the moment to cultivate in order to deal with upcoming big disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurned out to be so.\u201d White Tiger solemnly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201c5 years later, at that time\u2019s continent wide turmoil, even I will be finding great difficulty to defend myself, let along you all with your current strength.\u201d While chewing the rabbit meat, Ren Tianyou said to White Tiger. \u201cBut in that time of turmoil, we can also develop our Akatsuki, moreover I also want to see the strength of those experts of Demon clan.\u201d Saying this, Ren Tianyou again recalled that finger inside Tower of Babel which had sent him flying merely with a poke. Ren Tianyou had firmly decided that, when his strength reached sufficient level, he would absolutely return back to Tower of Babel again, then drag that demon out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t think too much, I\u2019ll be there when that moment comes, even if we are face Demon clan invasion.\u201d Finished eating, Ren Tianyou patted the shoulder of White Tiger, then directly walked inside his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cNg.\u201d White Tiger nodded his head, but just then, he suddenly felt an oily feeling from his shoulder. Upon closer look, he found two oily hand print on his just washed clean Akatsuki robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard Zero, my just washed cloth ah.\u201d White Tiger sorrowfully roared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

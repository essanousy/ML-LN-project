After that huge amount of energy of Susanoo steadily flowed into bijudamas, increasing the might of these bijudamas.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, both Amike and Bathing Beast Devouring Heave Beast saw Ren Tianyou using Susanoo as an armor for tailed-beasts. Seeing this, Amike suddenly frowned.</p><br/><p>He was very clear regarding the defensive strength of that strange energy armor. Three years ago, the strength of Ren Tianyou was merely comparable to an ant for him, but at that time, using this move, Ren Tianyou was able to block his one move. And now with Ren Tianyou becoming stronger, so the defensive power of this armor was a lot stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevouring Heaven, get ready, the energy within those four energy balls is too strong, so use your innate magic to deal with them.\u201d Sensing the energy contained within those four bijudamas, even Amike felt alarmed.</p><br/><p>No kidding, bijudama of tailed-beasts were the agglomeration of tailed-beasts\u2019 huge chakra, whose power was strong enough to level a big mountain. Now coupled with the strength of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, its might was far stronger than before.</p><br/><p>And Amike himself was not skilled in defending, as he only had attacks in his eyes, otherwise why would he directly use a drop of refined blood to use Demon God\u2019s Defend to protect himself from Ren Tianyou\u2019s Gale Thunderstorm of just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast answered, then looking at four huge bijudamas in front of the mouth of tailed-beasts with rapt attention, it also opened its mouth, and gathered magical power within its body in its mouth. After that the space in front of its mouth gradually cracked, forming a huge space black hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cBijudama!\u201d And on the other side, tailed-beasts and Ren Tianyou also completed storing the energy. After that along with the voices of tailed-beasts, these four bijudamas suddenly shot towards Amike as if arrow leaving from bowstring. And in front, all along the path where these bijudamas passed, a long deep gully suddenly appeared on the already cracked ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevouring Heaven\u2019s Domain!\u201d</p><br/><p>And on this side, the preparation of the magic of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast was also completed. After that in the midair in front of its huge mouth, unexpectedly a space black hole appeared, and this black hole was emitting a powerful suction force. Unexpectedly this Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast was a rare space element magical beast.</p><br/><p>Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, just as its name suggest, if it was let to grow to its peak, then it can swallow even the Heaven itself. And the whole body of this beast was surrounded by black colored magic flame throughout the year. Furthermore this magic flame was more powerful compared to ordinary flame, giving it immunity to a number of ordinary flame attack.</p><br/><p>And space magic was the innate skill of Bathing flame Devouring Heaven Beast, so they naturally possessed the ability to manipulate the space. Furthermore when they become powerful, they could show disdain for those similar level people and magical beasts, due to this space magic.</p><br/><p>And although Amike could also use a number of simple space magic after entering into God Lord realm, but how could his space magic be comparable to Bathing Fire Devouring Heaven Beast who was specialize in space magic? As a result, Amike let Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast to resist the attack of bijudamas.</p><br/><p>But could this space black hole really have the ability to stop these bijudamas which also contain the power of Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo?</p><br/><p>The bijudama of Ichibi Shukaku was the first one to reach. After it directly entered into this space black hole with destroying void momentum, indistinct sound of explosion came out from inside the black hole, and this black hole swayed violently. After that the area of black hole rapidly shrunk, while Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast couldn\u2019t help but fell back few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing the area of black hole was rapidly shrinking, Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast quickly stabilized its body and send out additional magical power to quickly stabilize the black hole.</p><br/><p>But at that moment the bijudamas of Nibi and Sanbi simultaneously arrived and directly entered the black hole. This directly caused the black hole to explode and began to disappear rapidly. And at the same time, Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast also continuously retreated rapidly, while black colored magic blood flowed out from its mouth.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Amike immediately understood that he had truly looked down upon the attack power of these four bijudamas. He had never though that even the innate magic skill \u2018Devouring Heaven\u2019s Domain\u2019 of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast would be unable to stop these attacks.</p><br/><p>No kidding, even the kamui of Ren Tianyou\u2019s left eye would not be able to continuously stop four bijudamas. And even if one changed into Ultraman, he/she would not be able to resist all four bijudamas, let alone this Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>And this moment, final bijudama of Son arrived there, directly moving towards soon vanishing black hole.</p><br/><p>With \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, the black hole was immediately cracked open, and the explosion engulfed both Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo!\u201d A loud blood-curdling sound resounded from within the explosion, but very quickly this sound disappeared within the storm.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, a towering huge blade slash from inside the storm directly cut open the storm and advanced towards Ren Tianyou and tailed-beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Shukaku no Tate! (Shukaku\u2019s Shield!)\u201d Seeing this huge blade slash advancing towards them, Shukaku roared loudly, then controlling the boundless sand on the ground, created a huge mini Shukaku appearance shield.</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018hong\u2019 loud explosion sound, this blade slash landed on the Shukaku\u2019s shield. Suddenly numerous cracks appeared on this huge sand shield, but this shield successfully withstood this blade slash.</p><br/><p>And on the other side, after Amike had cut the storm into pieces, the circumstance inside became visible.</p><br/><p>Right now the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast had cuts and bruises all over, and there was also a huge bloody hole on its body. And right now large amount of black blood were slowly flowing out from those wounds. But Amike however had not received any big injury under the protection of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>Under the power of bijudama coupled with Ren Tianyou\u2019s Susanoo, even Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast was also seriously injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile he is injured, take his life, let\u2019s move!\u201d Seeing that terrifying injury on the body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, Ren Tianyou immediately shouted excitedly, urging tailed-beast to make a move.</p><br/><p>Immediately agile Nibi and Yonbi simultaneously jumped up, and attacked towards Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast. Nibi and Yonbi simultaneously open their mouth, and continuously send out small-sized bijudama chakra ball towards both Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>And as for Ichibi and Sanbi, they simultaneously ran towards Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis power, should have no problem!\u201d Seeing those small-sized bijudamas in the sky, Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast estimated, then opening its mouth, he emitted a huge space fluctuation all around.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace Mirror Reflection!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, the space around suddenly seemed to solidify, giving people a kind of strange feeling.</p><br/><p>And Ren Tianyou in the head of jumped tailed-beasts immediately knew this was bad, because his eyes were able to see through space. Now his eyes were seeing countless invisible space shield in the space in front. And when the small-sized bijudamas collided against those shields, they were suddenly reflected back towards Nibi and Yonbi in greater speed.</p><br/><p>Along with \u2018hong\u2019, \u2018hong\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026..continuous explosion sound, Matatabi and Son were immediately bombed back.</p><br/><p>And underneath, Amike flew towards Ichibi and Sanbi from the head of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast. Now his right hand was firmly holding his Baleful Heaven Demon Blade which was glimmering with a light which made people to have their heart palpitate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After suffering from such severe injury, coupled with him still being sealed within the ninth floor of Tower of Babel, even if he wanted to flee, there was no place to flee.</p><br/><p>As a result, in this final moment, he thought of perishing together. Since he was already certain to die, then he would bring down everyone together with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Self-Detonation!\u201d Along with the voice of Amike, his body rapidly swelled, and extremely powerful energy rapidly undulated within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Seeing Amike\u2019s body was rapidly gathering energy, the pupils of Ren Tianyou shrunk, and he immediately felt chill in his heart. Furthermore the two words \u2018Self-Detonation\u201d resounded in his mind.</p><br/><p>How terrifying it would be if a God Lord realm expert exploded? Honestly speaking, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know, but he was absolutely certain that that explosion would at least be comparable to the bijudama\u2019s explosion of just now which was created by the joint effort of four tailed beasts and Ren Tianyou. So why wouldn\u2019t Ren Tianyou feel apprehensive towards this kind of attack?</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had no time to think. He no longer bother about the violently shaking space around him, and prepared to forcibly open the space using Hiraishin.</p><br/><p>But there was someone else who was faster than Ren Tianyou in taking action. That someone was that dying Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace magic spell\u2014-Space Solidification!\u201d</p><br/><p>The body of Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast suddenly emitted a space fluctuation, which caused the surrounding space to solidify immediately.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, Ren Tianyou also feel the space around was forcibly sealed off, and his Hiraishin no Jutsu also suddenly failed. Now he was basically powerless to fly out from this place.</p><br/><p>And after the surrounding space was forcibly solidified, Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast who was unyieldingly bracing itself waiting for this opportunity finally had its last hint of vitality disappear, and its life came to an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, already dying but still caused trouble for I, your father.\u201d Looking at already dead Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, Ren Tianyou\u2019s two eyes seemed to want to spout fire, but he didn\u2019t have any means.</p><br/><p>Now since his space ninjutsu had lose effectiveness for the time being, he could only retreat temporarily.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Ren Tianyou immediately changed into lightning and ran towards to outside areas with all his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, run away, run away as much as possible, and meet death shrouded by despair.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou was running away, Amike mockingly laughed loudly. Now he had nearly gathered all the energy within his body, and the Blood Core within his body had already cracked open, and a huge blood mark had appeared on his body.</p><br/><p>And as for Ren Tianyou, his mental perception was firmly lock on to the body of Amike, and feeling all the energy within the body of Amike was almost gathered up, Ren Tianyou quickly descended on the ground from the sky. Now running away was already useless, so he could only use strongest defense to block this terrifying attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoujutsu\u2014-Forever Solidify, time accelerate by 5 second!\u201d The pattern of his left eye spun rapidly, and huge amount of eye power gushed out from his left eye. And unlike before, Ren Tianyou had use this doujutsu on himself rather than on other people.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Ren Tianyou felt a huge difference between the surrounding world and his world.</p><br/><p>In outside world, time was moving very slow as if it seemed to have stopped, and the time in his area was passing quickly. This was mysteriousness of time.</p><br/><p>Since this was his own doujutsu, Ren Tianyou naturally know this result, so without wasting any time, he bit the thumb of both hand, and quickly made a series of hand seals, then slammed his hands on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuchiyose\u2014-Goju Rashomon! (Summoning\u2014-Five-Layer Rashomon!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, the ground in front suddenly shook rapidly, then five huge seemingly gates of hell grew out from the ground in front of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cFull Body Susanoo!\u201d The pattern of both eyes spun rapidly, and a huge amount of eye power gushed out from both of his eyes. After that a huge demon god quickly formed around his body.</p><br/><p>And after finishing everything, the effect of time accelerate also disappeared. He had spent only five seconds to carry out all of these defensive measures, so in reality only one second had passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, let us disappear together.\u201d And this moment, the preparation of Amike\u2019s Demonic Self-Detonation was already complete, so along with his frenzied laugh, an ear-deafening explosion sound once again resounded within the ninth floor. And a terrifying explosion wind and waves even more powerful than before rapidly swept away everything around, including five Rashomon as well as Ren Tianyou with Full Body Susanoo.</p><br/><p>The explosion of this time nearly engulfed half the area of entire ninth floor, and the lands within ninth floor were nearly blown half.</p><br/><p>The explosion wind and waves didn\u2019t dissipate for a long time, and everything within ninth floor were engulfed by this explosion.</p><br/><p>Even the space within ninth floor was cracked open, creating a terrifying space black hole in the sky.</p><br/><p>After about ten minutes, the explosion gradually stopped, and everything within explosion became visible.</p><br/><p>Now there was a deep crater whose bottom couldn\u2019t be seen in that place, and a smoke was rising from inside the crater. And as for Amike and Bathing Flame Devouring Heaven Beast, both of them had already change into powder and dissipated in the sky.</p><br/><p>And in the sky, there was still that huge space black hole with powerful suction force coming from inside it.</p><br/><p>But there was not even a trace of Ren Tianyou in this entire ninth floor. Did he really perish together Amike within this huge explosion? Or was he still alive! No one know about it. Right now only this almost destroyed land was left behind in this ninth floor.</p><br/><p>And at this time, a golden radiance suddenly flew down from the sky, which slowly formed into a golden silhouette.</p><br/><p>This golden silhouette had seen this destruction of this land as well as the disappearing figure of Ren Tianyou, so he couldn\u2019t help but sigh, then looking that space black hole, this silhouette said, \u201cHuman, I\u2019m sorry, I have no way to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I am Universe Boundary Divine Artifact, but right now majority of my strength is being used for withstanding the attack of Demon clan and theirs that Universe Boundary Divine Artifact. And I want to win over time as much as possible for 100 clans of the continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this time I was powerless to help you in your battle. Now I can only pray for your good luck, and be able to pass through this calamity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are able to survive this, after two years when the passage is opened and 100 clans have returned, I hope you will reemerge here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, this golden silhouette gradually become dim, and leaving behind a sentence in a low voice, it disappeared, \u201cBecause you might become my\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Final few words couldn\u2019t be heard because the voice was too small and dissipated in the air.</p><br/><p>As for Ren Tianyou, did he really die? If alive then where did he go\u2026\u2026.?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Followed by the series of loud sound of explosion, as if the ground was being crushed, and was being disintegrated. In a flash the shock wave of this huge explosion surrounded the bone dragon who was still chanting magic and also Yan Xinluo who was rushing over.</p><br/><p>The range of this explosion continuously spread for about 30 meters in circumference, a huge dusts rose, and covered the entire arena. After the sound of explosion stopped, the clouds of dusts slowly dissipated, and when everyone could see the circumstance in the arena, the audiences who were watching the match couldn\u2019t help but become dumbfounded with their mouth wide open.</p><br/><p>They saw that within the circumference of 30 meter, there was not a single intact surface of ground. Disintegrated pieces of floor were scattered everywhere, and at the center of explosion, Ren Tianyou was standing there, and he was slowly withdrawing his violent lightning system chakra within his body. Then the hairs of his head also reverted back to original state, no longer resemble the appearance of Super Saiyan. After continuously using big moves, even Ren Tianyou was also a little exhausted. The amount of Chakra was also reduced to less than 1/3, so it was insufficient to sustain the continuous use of Lightning system chakra mode for long period of time. As for those 2 spectre knights, at an earlier time under the taijutsu Liger bomb of Ren Tianyou, they had changed into a bits and pieces of bones and scattered in the air.</p><br/><p>And at 10 meter away from Ren Tinyou, the bone dragon was lying on the ground and was struggling with great difficulty to stand up and its aura also had become extremely weak. Due to the interruption of magic from Ren Tinyou, bone dragon had received a backlash of magic interruption, and coupled with receiving the impact of Liger bomb at such close range, even for the Saint ranked bone dragon, it was a bit overwhelming.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the rock which was 20 meter away from him flipped over, revealing the figure of Yan Xinluuo. \u201cCough chough.\u201d Yan Xinluo was violently coughing, and a stream of blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth. It seemed Yan Xinluo also was not able to completely evade the impact of Liger bomb.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ren Tinyou who was standing at the center of the explosion, the eyes of Yan Xinluo unintentionally showed a complex expression. He was born at Si Shen clan, and he took a great pride for being part of this clan, and he would always dared to step forward to fight with anyone. Since the gathering of his clan, he had already passed through no less that 300 battles, nevertheless he had never met any opponent who was capable enough to make him feel a deep sense of frustration like Ren Tianyou. Even if he was unwilling to admit, nevertheless at the bottom of his heart he clearly knew, Ren Tianyou was stronger than him. If he was in the place of Ren Tianyou, then it was impossible for him to destroy the blockade of a Saint ranked warrior and a Saint ranked bone dragon, then dispose off the 5 spectre knights whose strength was equal to Great swordmaster, in such a short period of time. And in addition, it was even more impossible to give injuries to 2 Saint ranked warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I will not admit defeat. I\u2019m going to fight till the last moment, and until I no longer have the power to fight.\u201d Yan Xinluo firmly decided inside his heart. Then gradually the undead battle qi emerged from his body, and his body released an imposing momentum.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Yan Xinluo who was gradually recovering his momentum, Ren Tinyou made a wry smile. He clearly knew his own matter, now he had already consumed serious amount of the chakra in his body, originally he had considered to use Liger bomb to Yan Xinluo too, but instantly he eliminated this idea. Because this Liger bomb move was one of the one hit certain kill jutsu, and he was unsure whether Yan Xinluo was capable enough to withstand this attack with his current strength.</p><br/><p>Also according to the rules of the competition, one couldn\u2019t inflict the injuries which was life threatening or kill the opponent. And also he and Yan Xinluo didn\u2019t have any resentment or they were enemies. On the contrary Ren Tinyou admired him for his current level of strength. And after he go for experience and training in the continent, and decided to build his own group, Yan Xinluo could be extremely good candidate to become the member of his group. So considering the both public and private opinion, he decided to not give life threatening injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I should not give him life threating injuries, then I will use another big move to quickly finish the match.\u201d Ren Tinyou took a firm stand, look towards the sky, and a dark green chakra was released from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHachimon Tonkou\u2014\u2014\u2014-Dai roku mon\u2014\u2014 Keimon, open!\u201d (The 8 Inner Gates\u2014-6th gate\u2014\u2014Gate of joy, open!)</p><br/><p>After using lightning system chakra mode for a long period of time, the body of Ren Tianyou was already prepared to open The 8 Inner Gate at any time.</p><br/><p>Along with the yell of Ren Tianyou, a huge amount of dark green colored aura surrounded Ren Tinyou, and the nerves on his forehead stick out, it looked frightening. Under this overwhelming pressure from Ren Tianyou, the slab stones around him started to disintegrated in succession and changed into a powder.</p><br/><p>From the opposite side, looking at the move of Ren Tianyou, Yan Xinluo sensed grave danger inside his heart, and at that time the struggling bone dragon managed to fly in front of Yan Xinluo to defend against the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting.\u201d After completely opening the 6th gate, Gate of joy, an innumerable chakra was surrounding his body, and waving his hand, he slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish\u201d \u201chong!\u201d</p><br/><p>One could only hear the sound of breaking through the void produced by Ren Tianyou, and due to the impact, all around the place where Ren Tianyou was standing just a moment ago started to disintegrate in succession. In less than a second, Ren Tianyou appeared at the side of Yan Xinluo and bone dragon, and he punched the bone dragon with his right hand. With a \u201chong\u201d sound, the body of bone dragon was directly sent flying.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards Ren Tianyou lifted his right leg, and kicked towards Yan Xinluo. But due to the short time he had got, Yan Xinluo used Karma Transmigration which he was holding on his right hand to block the attack of Ren Tianyou. But even if he tried to block the attack of Ren Tianyou, was it even possible? Even after he blocked the direct attack of Ren Tianyou, the huge power behind the leg nevertheless directly sent him flying in the sky without even giving any chance to refute.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough.\u201d In the sky, Yan Xinluo ceaselessly coughed, and blood started to overflow from his mouth. Just now the attack of Ren Tianyou, made him felt like he was rammed by a huge fierce beast. All the internal organs of his body were shaking and screaming in pain. At this time, Yan Xinluo suddenly felt blurred in front of his eyes, and the figure of Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared in front of him, then he felt a strong pain from his abdomen, and he dropped towards the arena in a high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were only this powerful? Yan Xinluo, you greatly disappoint me, and here I was looking forward for a fight with you for a long period of time. Since it is already like this, I will end this match.\u201d Looking at Yan Xinluo who was falling towards the arena, a hint of disappoint flashed in the eyes of Ren Tianyou. Then he again released a strong lightning light, and the violent lightning light started to gather in his right leg. Then his body changing into a huge lightning axe, he chopped downwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014 Girochin Doroppu!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014Guillotine Drop!)</p><br/><p>When the attack of Ren Tinyou was about to hit the body of Yan Xinluo, suddenly he head a sound, after that he felt that he hit something extremely hard. When Ren Tianyou looked at the thing which he had hit, the pupil of Ren Tianyou shrunk, and a surprise flashed in his eyes\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/>\n</div>"}

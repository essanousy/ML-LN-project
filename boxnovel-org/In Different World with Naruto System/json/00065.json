However the blue colored light continue to chase after Wang Yanli in a high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing that the blue colored light was still advancing towards him, he snorted coldly. Now he already had enough time to prepare his magic, but the most unexpected thing was, she actually forced him to use his sealed power within his body which was for safe keeping himself in dangerous situation. But since he was already forced to lift up his seal, he will use it without restrain.</p><br/><p>\u201cLava Domain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Wang Yanli, an intense heat spread all around the surroundings from his body. Even the air around him seemed to have evaporated, then a fiery colored lava spread all around the ground from the body of Wang Yanli. Immediately the arena changed into a lava.</p><br/><p>\u201cTide of lava!\u201d Wang Yanli waved the magic wand in his hand, suddenly the wave after the wave of lava all around rolled up and rose, and with an overwhelmingly advanced towards the blue colored light saber.</p><br/><p>Immediately the soft water light saber attack of Sun Chuqian was blocked by this boundless wave of lava, and this extremely hot lava evaporated the battle qi of that attack.</p><br/><p>Seeing she was powerless to break through this waves of lava of Wang Yanli, and also if this continue on like this she would sunk into this lava, the light saber of Sun Chuqian immediately burst out. Then she stopped her this warrior skill, and revealed her figure as she landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Looking at the lava underneath her feet, even after her 2 legs were covered with her soft water battle qi, she could still feel a strong heat coming through from the sole of her feet.</p><br/><p>Not caring about the dangerous surrounding round her, she stared at the changed Wang Yanli, then she sneered and said, \u201cHumph, finally willing to release the seal and use your lava blood lineage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought you actually become this powerful. You even force me to use my power of blood lineage. Qianqian, you are a lot stronger now.\u201d Staring at the cold expression of Sun Chuqian, Wang Yanli said with a complex expression. Although he was a bit careless at that time, nevertheless he was forced to use this power, this clearly shows that the strength of Sun Chuqian had increased by many time compared to last time.</p><br/><p>Lava blood lineage, a high-rank 1 special blood lineage, and in some kind of situation, this blood lineage is comparable to saint ranked blood lineage. Because this blood lineage gave Wang Yanli the ability to control magma, and in addition can allow him to transform his fire system magic into this special system magic, i.e. lava magic.</p><br/><p>At Divine wind continent, there are only few people who had the ability to control different elements which are not within the 7 major elements, for example lava, space, ice, steel and so on. And those people who can use these peculiar elements are almost invincible among the peoples of same class, and they can even put up a good fight against the people having a step higher strength.</p><br/><p>But the peoples having this abilities are extremely rare, it is said that the person having this ability is only one person among 10,000. And Wang Yanli was among them, he had the ability to control lava, so he was special system magician. And because of this inborn talent, he was able to enter core location of Magic domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, do you think just because you possess this lava blood lineage you are able to easily win this match?\u201d Staring at Wang Yanli, she coldly snorted. Shortly afterwards that blue colored battle qi radiance above her body suddenly changed, and become a little gloomy white in color. And a piercing to the bones icy chill came out from the body of Sun Chuqian. Even the temperature of the magma below her feet decreased.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this?\u201d Suddenly Wang Yanli, Ren Tianyou and others in the audiences were startled, because they could clearly feel icy chill from that battle qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have sealed your lava blood lineage, and just like you I have also sealed my own power too. This is my ice and frost battle qi. Manifest!\u201d Along with the charming shout of Sun Chuqian, immediately the original blue colored soft water battle qi completely changed into icy cold ice and frost battle qi. This was the concealed power of Sun Chuqian.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am been waiting for this day for a long period of time. At the last match, in a moment of carelessness, I directly lose my consciousness with your attack. This time you must pay the price.\u201d Staring at the starlet face of Wang Yanli, Sun Chuqian coldly said. Shortly afterwards she waved her rapier and stabbed it on the ground in front of her. Then the icy cold battle qi flowed to her rapier and then it flowed to the magma on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmiable water cold current.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly the floor of the arena originally covered with the lava domain of Wang Yanli started to release an ice cold air, and shortly afterwards the originally burning hot magma rapidly cooled down. And then the gloomy white ice cubes covered the original burning hot magma, and quickly spread in all direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWings of the heaven!\u201d Seeing the quickly spreading ice, Wang Yanli was completely powerless, and without losing any time he used wings of heaven and spread the 2 huge wings made up of energies to fly in the sky.</p><br/><p>The original lava domain made by Wang Yanli was gone, and was completely changed into the world of ice and snow. Looking at Wang Yanli who was floating in the air, Sun Chuqian wrinkled her brows and immediately waved her rapier. Suddenly 3 huge icy cold sword light slash advanced towards Wang Yanli the sky.</p><br/><p>But Wang Yanli skillfully dodged all of them in succession, and those hit the barrier in the sky. Seeing that Wang Yanli was just dodging her attack with no intention to land on the ground, Sun Chuqian wrinkled her brows, because if he decided to hide himself in the air, then she won\u2019t be able to do anything and she would only become live target for him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Sun Chuqian on the arena, Wang Yanli was feeling quite complex within his heart. Because, in the last match, after all he had injured her, and also resorted to trickery to avoid the difficulty and made her lose consciousness in an instant using magic shock. But he had never thought that he would again encounter her in this match, and even more unexpected thing was the power of Sun Chuqian was actually far stronger that what he had thought. Now if he didn\u2019t use high level magic then it was almost impossible to win this match. But if he use high level magic, and unable to perfectly control it, then he might really heavily injure Sun Chuqian, which was something he was unwilling to see. Thinking for a while, Wang Yanli still decided to use high level magic to resolve this match, as long as he completely control it would be fine.</p><br/><p>After deciding, Wang Yanli relaxed his mind, and waved his magic wand in his hand and start to quickly chant the incantation.</p><br/><p>Listening to the incantation of Wang Yanli in the sky, Sun Chuqian immediately became serious. She knew that Wang Yanli was preparing to use large scale magic, but since he was in the sky, he was beyond the reach of her power, she could only be wait with caution.</p><br/><p>After chanting for almost half a minute, the magic was finally complete. The eyes of Wang Yanli flashed with a sharp light, and pointed towards Sun Chuqian with his magic wand, suddenly Sun Chuqian on the arena heard a round of vibration sound and then the arena started to violently shake. Sun Chuqian tried to stand stability on the shaking arena.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

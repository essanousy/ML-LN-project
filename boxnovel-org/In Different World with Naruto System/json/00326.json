After that the coffin lid closed firmly, and slowly sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust train harder to strengthen myself, as now there is not much time left. Moreover before the arrival of Demon clan, must master this jutsu, then awaken Rinnegan, accomplish the promise of Tower of Babel and obtain Universe Boundary Divine Artifact\u2014-Tower of Babel!\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly thought. He wanted to complete so many things that this \u2018a year and half\u2019 time limit was very tight.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Ren Tianyou engrossed himself in training Edo Tensei, as well as training a number of secret skills to strengthen his strength.</p><br/><p>Roughly after half a year, when there was only less than a year time left for the invasion of Demon clan, yesterday, a shocking matter happened in the Divine Wind Continent, which was the 100 clans came into the world.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, the clan head of 100 clans came out in open with their powerful momentum one after another, and declared their return to the Divine Wind Continent. Holy Sword clan, Elven clan, Death clan, Heavenly wind clan, Feather-men clan, beast-men clan, Bone Spirit clan\u2026\u2026each and every clan formally broke their seal and declare their return; and the people of 100 clans formally stepped into Divine Wind Continent starting yesterday. One might well say now Divine Wind Continent was very lively.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou however understood that the declaration of 100 clans about their return was equivalent to confirming the matter of Demon clan\u2019s invasion a year later. And this was done to prepare themselves for the invasion of Demon clan of a year later. And regardless of hatred between them, for the sake of their homeland, every one of them would go to fight this bloody battle together, as all of them after all were similarly living in this same Divine Wind Continent. Just like the war of 30,000 years ago.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, after unceasingly training for a half a year, Ren Tianyou had already mastered Edo Tensei jutsu. And with Edo Tensei jutsu thoroughly mastered, all those corpses of experts he had collected before had already changed into his pawns.</p><br/><p>Moreover in this period of this time, Ren Tianyou used 7.44 million system points to exchange few things. This time, one might well say that Ren Tianyou was betting all his hard-earned savings, everything was for the sake of that Eternal Dark Night on the body of that Thousand Eyes Evil Beast of Demon World.</p><br/><p>If he could obtain this Eternal Dark Night and gave it to System, then he would definitely obtain enough system points to exchange Rinnegan.</p><br/><p>Yes, currently the primary goal of Ren Tianyou was not that Universe Boundary Divine Artifact\u2014-Tower of Babel, rather that Eternal Dark Night on the body of that Thousand Eyes Evil Beast. That was because currently he was uncertain with regarding to the true might of Tower of Babel, moreover it was still unknown whether he could make it recognize him as its master or not? So Ren Tianyou made Eternal Dark Night as his first target.</p><br/><p>But he was also clueless with regarding to Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, and he also didn\u2019t know whether he could deal with it or not, but this time Ren Tianyou\u2019s goal was not to kill it, rather just seizing the Eternal Dark Night. But he however has to be careful of this person Yaorao, as her strength would be the real threat this time around.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou however couldn\u2019t consider everything. Now he can only put his all into the fight.</p><br/><p>Furthermore till now, White Tiger and others still hadn\u2019t returned, but even if they had returned, he\u2019d not have let them follow him to Demon World. This person Yaorao was truly too dangerous, even he might not necessarily hold up against her, let alone White Tiger and others.</p><br/><p>Today Ren Tianyou stood on the top of a mountain peak, and just at this moment, information from his clone he had dispatched earlier came to his mind. Then he slowly opened his eyes, revealing a pair of unceasingly spinning Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan. \u201cAll the preparation is complete, it\u2019s time to take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with his voice, his body changed into a blur and disappeared from there.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>At the same time, in the Demon Emperor\u2019 City of Demon World. Yaorao suddenly felt the barrier of Demon World was broken again, which meant someone sneaked into her Demon World.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever thought that after I let you leave last time, you still dare to come here again. Do you really think that my Demon World is a place where you can come and go as you please?\u201d Finished speaking, Yaorao slowly changed into a purple colored mist and disappeared from that place.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>And in the sky above Endless Abyss, the figure of Ren Tianyou suddenly appeared. Using the space coordinate of Hiraishin, he had directly broken through the space barrier and appeared right outside the seal of Endless Abyss.</p><br/><p>Standing in the mid-air, Ren Tianyou looked at that huge seal ahead. Then along with the appearance of spiral shaped space ripple, he disappeared from there.</p><br/><p>And inside the seal of Endless Abyss, along with the space ripple, Ren Tianyou appeared. After that he indifferently looked down at that underneath abyss that looked as if it could swallow everything.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a terrifying roar came from inside the underneath abyss, and huge sound waves reverberated through entire Endless Abyss. Shortly afterwards, huge silhouette flew out from inside the abyss, and the huge figure of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast appeared before Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, didn\u2019t expect you brat to return here again, this time I will definitely catch you alive.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast roared excitedly. It had never thought that Ren Tianyou would unexpectedly come here once again, this made it see hope of getting out from this seal, so this time he would definitely not give Ren Tianyou an opportunity to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cThousand Eyes Evil Beast, you should have already realized that if I want to run then you are powerless to stop me. So if you just give me that Eternal Dark Night, then I can help you to get out of this seal.\u201d Looking at Thousand Eyes Evil Beast before him, Ren Tianyou slightly frowned and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, this Eternal Dark Night is hard to come by dark element treasure even within all these 3000 realms, so do you think that I will hand it over to you this easily?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou mentioning about Eternal Dark Night, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast loudly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want something, then you must pay relevant price. Although you are very powerful, and this Eternal Dark Night is also a rare heavenly treasure, but you however are sealed here forever, never being able to take a single step outside this Endless Abyss.\u201d Ren Tianyou fearlessly confronted Thousand Eyes Evil Beast. If he really want to leave then it basically couldn\u2019t prevent him from leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo if you want me to help you get out from this seal, then you must give me that Eternal Dark Night first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ren Tianyou, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast became silent, indeed, although this Eternal Dark Night was rarely seen treasure, but he however was sealed here for all day long. This seal was set up by Yaorao using the Universe Boundary Divine Artifact of Demon World as well as the power of this entire Demon World realm, so it was basically unable to break it.</p><br/><p>But Thousand Eyes Evil Beast however thought of another point, which was, first he would give this Eternal Dark Night to Ren Tianyou, then after using him to get out of this seal, instantly kill him with an sudden attack. Afterwards, Eternal Dark Night would still be its.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I can give you Eternal Dark Night, but how can you make me believe you that after you get Eternal Dark Night, you will help me to get out.\u201d After thinking the countermove, Thousand Eyes Evil Beast said to Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no assurance, now I can only say that you have no choice but trust me in this matter, because only I have the ability to take you out of this seal, moreover I do not need to deceive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, I will give you Eternal Dark Night first, I hope you will keep your promise and take me out of this seal.\u201d Thousand Eyes Evil Beast thought for a moment and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s given.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly said with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>But just at that time, a voice which both Ren Tianyou and Thousand Eyes Evil Beast had never expected resounded, \u201cNever thought your guts was this big, unexpectedly not only you return back to my Demon World once again, moreover you also want to release Thousand Eyes Evil Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with this voice, a purple colored radiance suddenly appeared in the sky, then a figure of a person appeared in midair.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

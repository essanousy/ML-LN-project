But seeing the continuous intense explosion in the sky which had engulfed his 3 brothers, he immediately became worried, and couldn\u2019t help but exclaimed, \u201cOld Four, Old Five, Old Seven.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Ximen Batian had just finished screaming, three silhouette were blasted out from the middle of this explosion, and landed on the ground. But this 3 silhouette were finally able to steady themselves only after sliding backwards for nearly 1 meter in distance. Carefully looking at these 3 silhouette, it was precisely those 3 god ranked experts of Ximen clan.</p><br/><p>Everywhere in the bodies of these god ranked experts were riddled with wounds due to the bombing of just a moment ago, and red bloods were continuously flowing out from those wounds. But although their appearance looked rather frightening, nevertheless they had not suffered any serious injury, only some superficial wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Seeing them dart out from the middle of explosion, Ximen Batian hastily rushed to them, and asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are fine, we merely looked down upon the method of this fellow.\u201d The person called Old Four shook his head and answered. After that golden colored saint dragon battle qi gradually surrounded his whole body, and all the wounds also slowly stopped bleeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be a bit more careful, because we don\u2019t know what fortuitous encounter this boy had obtained in these 3 years, to actually increase his strength this high. And also\u2026\u2026.\u201d Ximen Batian turned around and looked towards Ren Tianyou, his eyes flashed with complex emotion, and he continued, \u201cAnd also he was able to kill both Number One and Old Two together. Do you still remember the explanation of the circumstances of their battle from Yue\u2019er and others, after they returned to the clan at that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we remember.\u201d Old Five answered, then he added, \u201cI remember Yue\u2019er stating that, this person could use wind, lightning, water and sand, the energy of these 4 system, furthermore can also use a special unknown type of black colored flame. That flame had burned the arm of Old Two, and Number One was forced to cut off that arm because there was no any method to extinguish that flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition to these 5 system, this fellow could still use a kind of unknown secret technique to change himself into a terrifying giant, which is capable enough to block the strongest move of the 4 people. Precisely because of that, Number One, Old Two and furthermore saint dragon partner of Number one Adelaide, all fell there.\u201d Speaking up to this, Old Five couldn\u2019t help but tightly clenched his hands, and stared at Ren Tianyou with his eyes filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis precisely is what I wanted to say. Just now from the beginning he had only used fire system and wind system energy, he had not used any of the remaining 3 system energy, and that\u2019s without even mentioning that giant. So in this case, either he is not able to use, or\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Saying this, Ximen Batian couldn\u2019t help but paused for a moment, and said, \u201cOr, he is still hiding his strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Still hiding his strength? How is it possible for him to hide his strength when he is facing us 4 god ranked experts? I don\u2019t believe it, unless he had already stepped into the God domain just like our ancestors.\u201d Old Seven shook his head, and denied the guess of Ximen Batian.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t believe, there is no way for us to win, because the fact is our combined strength is only equal or only slightly better compared to the strength of number One and Old Two combined with their 2 dragon partners. So all we can do now is stall him as long as possible, and wait for our ancestors to arrive. At that time, he will forfeit his life.\u201d Ximen Batian solemnly said. Although he didn\u2019t believe that his old good-for-nothing son was now actually that powerful, nevertheless the death of Number One and Old Two, and everything that was happening before his eyes, convinced him about this fact. \u201cFrom now on, we will not try to kill him, we will just stall him, until the arrival of reinforcement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d After Ximen Batian said this, the 3 god ranked experts answered loudly. Then all 4 of them scattered and circled Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!? Planning to surround me?\u201d Seeing them scattering in all direction, Ren Tianyou was slightly surprised. Then his Mangekyo Sharingan rotated in high speed, and quickly followed these 4 experts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Swish\u2019, \u2018swish\u2019, \u2018swish\u2019\u2026\u2026\u2026along with the four movement sound, Ximen Batian and others changed into 4 gold colored light beam, and simultaneously appeared in 4 side of Ren Tianyou. And they also simultaneously swung their huge sword towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou unexpectedly didn\u2019t try to dodge their attack which surprised Ximen Batian and others, Ren Tianyou just stared at them with his blood red colored eyes. But even though they found this surprising and regardless of any crafty plots and machinations that Ren Tianyou may have, they didn\u2019t stop their attack. The attacks of the huge swords of all 4 of them directly penetrated through the body of Ren Tianyou and landed on the ground, giving out a loud explosion sound, which was accompanied by a big cloud of dusts.</p><br/><p>Although they had successfully hit Ren Tianyou, but they didn\u2019t have any excited expression in their face, because when their swords cut through the body of Ren Tianyou, they didn\u2019t feel any kind of resistance, they felt as if they were just cutting through empty air.</p><br/><p>When they were feeling uncertain, Ren Tianyou slowly walked out in front of them from the middle of the clouds of dusts. After that as if his body was transparent, Ren Tianyou directly passed through their body, and stood behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.what\u2019s going on?\u201d Seeing that Ren Tianyou had just passed through his body, Ximen Batian was thoroughly stupefied, and failed to understand what actually was happening. And the other 3 god ranked experts were also confused seeing what had just happened before their own eyes.</p><br/><p>But when they were in a trance, Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t wait for them, he quickly made a series of hand seals, \u201cKaton\u2014\u2013Ryuen Hoka no Jutsu! (Fire Style\u2014\u2013Dragon Flame Caterwaul!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou quickly turned back, and simultaneously spat out more than 10 miniature dragon shaped flame with blazing temperature towards them.</p><br/><p>Sensing a change behind them, Ximen Batian and others snapped out from their trance, then quickly turned around, and saw the attacks were flying towards them. Seeing this, they immediately fell back to dodge this attack, but the dragon shaped flame released by Ren Tianyou pursued them in a high speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, saint dragon heavenly cross.\u201d Seeing the flame were still flying towards them, Ximen Batian coldly snorted, and his body radiated a large amount of golden colored saint dragon battle qi, which took the form of faintly visible dragon wrapping around his body, then golden colored energy dragon scales started to appear above his skin all over the body, changing him into golden colored dragon person. After that looking at the incoming dragon shaped flames, under the surprised gaze of Ren Tianyou, Ximen Batian directly stretched his right hand, and destroyed all of the flames of Ryuen Hoka no Jutsu (Dragon Flame Caterwaul) with only his right hand. And there was not any injury to his right hand, only the golden light weaken a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k, is this only the strength of hand? So powerful, actually able to directly destroying my Ryuen Hoka no Jutsu (Dragon Flame Caterwaul) using his only one hand.\u201d Seeing that shocking attacking method of Ximen Batian, a cold sweat appeared on his forehead. He was not frightened rather he was amazed.</p><br/><p>Saint dragon heavenly cross, after one comprehend Saint dragon blood lineage of Ximen clan to a certain degree, one is able to learn a secret skill of blood lineage, this skill was Saint dragon heavenly cross. This secret skill was a method to move the power of Saint dragon blood lineage in a special way inside the body, so that the power of Saint dragon blood lineage would circulate in whole body. After the power is circulated to all parts of the body, one\u2019s body slowly change into dragon, and can also gradually use the power of ancient saint dragon. It is stated that, if one is able to reach the pinnacle of Saint dragon blood lineage, then they are able to obtain the complete power of Ancient saint dragon, and could even change their body into that incomparable powerful dragon body of Ancient saint dragon, and thoroughly become dragon itself.</p><br/><p>And the appearance of Ximen Batian could only be count as a half-dragon, no, even half-dragon couldn\u2019t be considered, but even like this, his power was increased by twofold, defensive ability was significantly enhanced, as that superficial layer of dragon scale possessed superior defensive ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint dragon heavenly cross?\u201d Seeing the current appearance of Ximen Batian, the 3 elders of Ximen clan were surprised, afterwards the also quickly condensed powerful Saint dragon battle qi above their body, and slowly golden colored dragon scale appeared all over their body. But their degree of change into dragon was slightly lower compared to Ximen Batian.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d Ximen Batian opened his mouth and roared loudly. From his roaring sound, Ren Tianyou faintly heard a vague dragon roar. \u201cLet\u2019s tear him into shreds.\u201d Just a moment ago, Ren Tianyou had dodged their attack in a strange fashion, which made their heart restless, so now they forgot their original plan of stalling for time or such, now they planned to directly start using their strongest power to kill Ren Tianyou. After Ximen Batian gave the command, all 4 half-dragon human directly rushed towards Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Now the real fight began\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

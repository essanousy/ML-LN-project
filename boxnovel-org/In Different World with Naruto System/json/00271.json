Perhaps what our forefathers had spoken was correct, gathering one more friend is better compared to one more enemy, but Ren Tianyou would always do things only by the virtue of his own heart. If you hesitate in doing anything you want, as well as consider whether you will offend someone or not while doing so, then you will lose the Heart of the Strong forever.</p><br/><p>The strong should march forward courageously, no matter what obstructs his path forward, as long as it was obstructing the path forward, he must sweep clean everything completely. Although in the process, he might encounter the resentment of many people as well as he might also offend many people, but with his current strength, why would he fear those things.</p><br/><p>Just like Uchiha Madara, for the sake of his Mugen Tsukuyomi (Infinite Tsukuyomi) plan, he alone faced entire ninja world, and showed disdain for entire ninja allied forces. This was the momentum of the strong. No matter whether the matter you were doing was right or wrong, and afterwards whether you become Buddha or Devil, you must not abandon the Heart of the Strong, because this was the most important thing of the strong.</p><br/><p>And now in Divine Wind Continent, other than his very few friends, Ren Tianyou feared remaining all others weren\u2019t fond of him, but he didn\u2019t care about those things. He only needs to persist in his own true intention throughout the journey. Even if the entire continent become his enemy one day, he will never hesitate to do what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had studied this strength in his body, and also didn\u2019t waste this good karma bestowed by heaven. But if he cower and become scared in everything he do, then how could he be worthy of this power within his body.</p><br/><p>First no need to talk about the characters of Naruto, in ancient Chinese Martial Arts mythology, who didn\u2019t persist on their Heart of the Strong to become strong heroic figure?</p><br/><p>[T.L: **Two paragraph below might be spoiler of \u2018Demigods and Semi-Devils\u2019 and \u2018Fanyun Fuyu\u2019 novels, so read it on your own discretion.]</p><br/><p>Qiao Feng of Demigods and Semi-Devils, for the sake of his loved person A\u2019Zhu, he alone proceed to JuXian Villa which could be called dragon\u2019s pool and a tiger\u2019s den. Then alone with his heroic spirit and powerful strength, he confronted all the martial arts experts there. Here did he became timid and shrunk back? [T.L: I haven\u2019t read this \u2018Demigods and Semi-Devils\u2019 novel, so I don\u2019t know whether this is correct or not.]</p><br/><p>Xieling (Evil Spirits) Li Rouhai of \u2018Fanyun Fuyu\u2019, for the sake of his disciple Feng Xinglie, in front of Yingfeng Gorge, by himself confronted at that time\u2019s foremost expert Pang Ban. At that time he used his remaining life force to fully use his strongest unique skill LiaoYuanBai attack to inflict serious damage on Pang Ban. Although he died and had his soul dissipated in the end, but at that time Li Rouhai was fully aware of him surely dying, but did he shrunk back? [T.L: I haven\u2019t read this \u2018Fanyun Fuyu\u2019 novel too, so I don\u2019t know whether this is correct or not.]</p><br/><p>The most important thing for the strong was not powerful strength, rather their Heart of the Strong. No matter how much difficulty lied ahead, one shouldn\u2019t lose Heart of the Strong, they must persist in their true intention and meet difficulty face to face without hesitation even if one had to die ten thousands death.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou took Bu Feng and Fang Qian and used Hiraishin to fly to far away mountain top which was several kilometers away from the city. After stabilizing their body, Ren Tianyou tossed antidote towards Bu Feng and said, \u201cFirst neutralize the poison within your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d Bu Feng took the antidote, and thanked him. But just at this moment, suddenly a strong holy light flashed from the body of Fang Qian, and along with a large amount of beads of sweats on her face, she gave out a groan of anguish.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Seeing the sudden change of Fang Qian, Ren Tianyou curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, the restriction within Qian\u2019er\u2019s body is flaring up!\u201d Seeing the reaction of Fang Qian, Bu Feng immediately said anxiously, then immediately took out that pearl emitting soft holy light and handed over to Fang Qian. \u201cQian\u2019er, this is Heavenly Holy Law Pearl, quickly use it to remove that restriction within your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Little Feng.\u201d Fang Qian resisted the severe pain she was feeling within her body with great difficulty, and took Heavenly Holy Law Pearl Bu Feng was giving, then immediately poured her magical power within her body to this Heavenly Holy Law Pearl. Suddenly this Pearl slowly rise up in the air and finally floated above the head of Fang Qian. And a pure white holy light emitted by this Law Pearl poured onto her, immediately after that her painful expression slowly reduced, finally reverting back to tranquil.</p><br/><p>Seeing Fang Qian was already becoming fine slowly, Bu Feng was slightly relieved, then taking in the antidote of God Shackling Water, he sat cross-legged, starting his breathing technique.</p><br/><p>And as for Ren Tianyou, he sat on a rock faraway, placed Uchiha Round Fan beside him, then took out a bottle of Sky Fragrant Alcohol from his space ring, and began to drink while waiting for the recovery of Bu Feng and Fang Qian.</p><br/><p>After nearly half an hour, Bu Feng slowly opened his eyes, and as for Fang Qian, right now she had already entered the final juncture to thoroughly suppress the restriction within her body with the help of Heavenly Holy Law Pearl\u2019s power.</p><br/><p>Bu Feng stood up and glanced at Fang Qian. After discovering there wasn\u2019t any problem with her, he walked over to Ren Tianyou, then said, \u201cMany thanks for your help of this time, if it was not for your help, I would have really died in regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me, you are also a member of my Akatsuki, so how can I watch you getting bullied?\u201d After drinking a mouthful of wine, Ren Tianyou slowly said to Bu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I become the member of your organization?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, the complexion of Bu Feng stagnated, and asked confusedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore in Light Temple, you personally admitted you were member of my organization, why, do you want to go back on your word and say you hadn\u2019t admitted in less than half hour?\u201d The corner of the mouth of Ren Tianyou slightly bend upward, flashing a smile of having his scheme succeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that was an expedient measure. I didn\u2019t agree to join your organization.\u201d Bu Feng roared towards Ren Tianyou with his face filled with black lines. \u201cI, Bu Feng yearn to be truly unrestraint. In this life of mine, I only want to pass a free life together with Fang Qian, as for everything else, I don\u2019t care. So I cannot join your organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not up to you to decide.\u201d Ren Tianyou ignored Bu Feng, merely drank alcohol minding his own business.</p><br/><p>At this time, Fang Qian already got rid of that restriction within her body. Henceforth her freedom was completely restored, no longer under the control of Light Temple. Furthermore to the surprise of Ren Tianyou, the strength of Fang Qian was unexpectedly Peak-Mid God realm, and soon she would be advancing to High-God realm. No wonder Light Temple was bent on controlling her, the power of her blood lineage was terrifyingly powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wind, what are you talking about?\u201d Fang Qian stood up and walked over to Bu Feng and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, Qian\u2019er. This time we were able to come off unscathed because of his selfless aid, so we must properly thank him.\u201d Bu Feng held Fang Qian, then pointing at Ren Tianyou sitting on the rock, he said, and especially placed particular weight on the word \u2018selfless\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time thanks to the help of this noble son, I and Little Feng come off unscathed, and I was also able to get back my freedom.\u201d Fang Qian slight bowed to Ren Tianyou, and sincerely thanked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, no need to thank me, I also didn\u2019t help you for free, so I want to receive a remuneration.\u201d Ren Tianyou looked at Bu Feng, as his eyes were flashing with smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemuneration? What remuneration?\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, Fang Qian confusedly asked.</p><br/><p>But at that time, before Ren Tianyou could answer Fang Qian, Bu Feng said, \u201cWe already thanked you, if you have any difficulties in the future, then I will definitely not look on with folded arm, but wanting me to join your organization is impossible. Now our talk is finished, Qing\u2019er hold onto me tightly, we are leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Bu Feng grabbed Fang Qian\u2019s right hand, and after saying her to hold him tightly, under the surprise gaze of hers, his body directly glimmered with dim starlight, which surrounded both of them, then they instantly disappeared.</p><br/><p>But Ren Tianyou still continued to sit on the rock while slowly drinking alcohol, as if he didn\u2019t care about Bu Feng leaving. After that with his Sharingan slowly spinning, he muttered, \u201cIn this world there is no free lunch, you Bu Feng is someone I kept thinking about for three years, and I had already given you a position in Akatsuki three years ago, so do you think I will let you go easily like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to join my organization? Then I will beat you until you join my organization. Let\u2019s see whether you can run away from me or not?\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly muttered, while quietly drinking alcohol. After nearly 10 minutes, he completely drank a bottle of alcohol, then he said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he immediately disappeared from that location, leaving behind empty bottle of alcohol.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

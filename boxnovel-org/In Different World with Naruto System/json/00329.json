Furthermore now it was also basically powerless to free itself under the binding of Universe Boundary Divine Artifact of Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ren Tianyou also already knew that his shadow clone had already succeed, so he don\u2019t need to waste any more of his time with Yaorao, now he just need to seize a moment to leave.</p><br/><p>Looking at Yaorao who was already in Demonic Wing State, Ren Tianyou rapidly made a series of hand seals, \u201cTaju Mokuton Bunshin no Jutsu! (Wood Style\u2014-Multi Wood Clone Jutsu!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, seven or eight wooden clone rapidly formed beside him. Then these seven or eight wooden clone dashed towards Yaorao in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Seeing clones were rushing towards her, Yaorao coldly snorted. Then waving her hands, majestic Purple Yuan Power flew out from her body. Shortly afterwards along with the incantation sound of Yaorao, that energy separated into four, and rapidly formed a huge barrier in the four corner of wooden clones.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy for me, Purple Ling Tranquil Moon!\u201d Seeing the barrier had formed, Yaorao coldly shouted, then rapidly made hand signs. And along with the hand sign of Yaorao, a huge purple colored energy handprint hit the barrier in front of her.</p><br/><p>And along with Yaorao\u2019s handprint hitting the barrier in front, the barrier suddenly changed. A huge purple colored crescent moon slowly rose inside the barrier, and large amount of purple colored energy light, from this purple moon illuminated the entire space within this barrier.</p><br/><p>And when this purple colored radiance illuminated the entire space within the barrier, those wooden clones in the process of moving suddenly stop all their motion in midair, then their body slowly changed into fine powder and disappeared in the air.</p><br/><p>And as for Ren Tianyou, after using Wood Clone Justu to stall Yaorao, he immediately used Hiraishin no Jutsu to fly away from Demon World to Divine Wind Continent.</p><br/><p>And after disposing all of those wooden clones, and catching the sight of disappearing figure of Ren Tianyou, she slightly smiled, \u201cYou are still very fast at running away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, those twelve pairs of wings behind her slowly withdrew inside her body and disappeared. And those magic lines of her body also slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreat that Eternal Dark Night of Thousand Eyes Evil Beast as my gift to you, I hope, when I see you again a year later, you have already obtained Tower of Babel, otherwise I don\u2019t mind personally destroying you, my pawn at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking this, Yaorao waved her right hand, and three lights flew out from inside her body, and remained in front of her. After this lights dissipated, long sword, silk sash, and mirror appeared in front of her. The light circulating above these things emitted a powerful energy fluctuation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn 100,000 years, never thought that I\u2019d only gather four including Purple Ling Dark Break, and I\u2019ve also wasted 30,000 years in Divine Wind Continent, but this time no matter who stands in my way, it\u2019s impossible to stop my step.\u201d Finished speaking, Yaorao waved her hand, and those three treasures again entered into her body and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the estimated time, Mo Yun that fellow ought to have already succeeded in Divine Wind Continent. But before that, I have to consider the use of a pawn.\u201d Finished speaking, Yaorao looked towards not distant seal of Endless Abyss, and her body slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>And what Ren Tianyou who had already left didn\u2019t know was, his every action was already under the plan of Yaorao.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In Divine Wind Continent\u2019s isolated island of endless ocean, right now Ren Tianyou was sitting cross-legged while passionately looking at that Eternal Dark Night in his hand which was emitting powerful dark element fluctuation. After a while, he said to the System within his body, \u201cSystem, how many system points is this Eternal Dark Night worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause a portion of energy of this Eternal Dark Night was already absorbed by Thousand Eyes Evil Beast, now it can be exchanged with only 70 million system points.\u201d The voice of System resounded in the brain of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I will give this Eternal Dark Night to you to absorb, help me exchange it into system points.\u201d Hearing he could exchange it for 70 million system points, Ren Tianyou impatiently said to the System within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d After hearing Ren Tianyou, the System within his body replied. Then large amount of golden light came out from within his body, which covered that Eternal Dark Night in the right hand of Ren Tianyou. Instantly that Eternal Dark Night changed into a black colored radiance and was devoured by that golden light. After that the golden light also disappeared from the surface of Ren Tianyou\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Roughly after five minutes, System voice resounded within his body, \u201cAbsorption of Eternal Dark Night complete, congratulation to host, you obtain 70 million system points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice of System, Ren Tianyou relaxed slightly. Only after this Eternal Dark Night really changed into his system points did he finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>Shortly afterwards, Ren Tianyou opened the exchange interference of the System within his mind, and looked at exchanging Rinnegan option.</p><br/><p>Rinnegan, it is the ultimate form of Sharingan, originated from Six Path\u2019s doujutsu, possessing remarkable ability of controlling Yin-Yang, and controlling Six Paths. The owner of Rinnegan could either possess the ability of creation of Creation God, or possess the ability of exterminating life of Destruction God.</p><br/><p>The owner of Rinnegan would simultaneously possess six kind of chakra nature, learn super strong abilities, and became proficient in all mainstream ninjutsu, just like Nagato of that time, under the guidance of Jiraiya, he quickly grasped the nature change of six chakra nature. Summing up, all-encompassing was one of the embodiment of Rinnegan\u2019s divine ability. [Raw has six nature written on it. I think, its five main element and yin-yang making it six. Only my guess though.]</p><br/><p>Furthermore Rinnegan had super strong memorizing ability: Rinnegan could memorize everything including ninjutsu, incident, person\u2019s characteristics, and so on. And as long as Rinnegan come into contact with any person, Rinnegan would memorize his strength and weakness, and apply them in future battles.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Rinnegan still had ability of Seven Paths, the owner of Rinnegan could use all jutsu, and also use chakra to control corpse to use the ability of one path.</p><br/><p>Tendo (Deva Path), Shurado (Asura Path), Ningendo (Human Path), Chikushodo (Animal Path), Gakido (Preta Path), Jigokudo (Naraka Path) and Gedo (Outer Path), these Seven Paths ability were most probably seen by all the people who had watched Naruto, but these were merely Seven Paths most basic ability.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

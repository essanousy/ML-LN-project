Then her body also emitted a white colored illusory power, after that, her body suddenly flashed with a strong white colored radiances. Due to this shining, everyone had no choice but to temporarily close their eyes. After that strong light had disappeared, when everyone opened their eyes and looked at the arena, all of them couldn\u2019t help but became greatly surprised.</p><br/><p>They saw that the whole body of Li Xinyun was already covered by a layer of pure white armor, and at her back there were two pure white wings. Then the wings slightly flapped and she immediately flew in the air. And her illusion energy ball suddenly divided into 3, and still smoothly but in high speed revolve around her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Seeing the big changes in the appearance of Li Xinyun, the pupil of Ren Tianyou firmly shrunk. Originally he didn\u2019t understand the reason behind this change in the illusionist Li Xinyun, but under his Mangekyo Sharingan, he could clearly determine what was real and what was illusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion skill\u2014numerous feather rise.\u201d At this time, Li Xinyun opened her jade like lips and spit out these words. Then the illusion power around her body spread to all direction and covered the whole arena. Suddenly all the lights on the arena gradually disappeared and became dark. At this time, a pure white feather appeared at this dark space, and bring out a light in this dark world. Shortly afterwards just like a bamboo shoots after a spring rain, many feather appeared, and each and every one released a light in this dark world, and dispelled the darkness.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the peoples who are watching from outside the arena, they only saw Li Xinyun suddenly releasing a white light, then with both of his eyes in daze, Ren Tianyou just stood there motionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, Tianyou fell in the illusion of Li Xinyun.\u201d Seeing the dazed Ren Tianyou, Wang Haiqing suddenly cried out in alarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? If it goes on like this, he will definitely lose. Let\u2019s shout to help him to sober up.\u201d Sun Chuqian was also extremely worried. Seeing Ren Tianyou standing at the arena motionlessly just like a hill, she thought to shout to help him sober up.</p><br/><p>But before she could open her mouth, Wang Jaifei stopped her, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t, that is violating the rule of competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Wang Haiqing was also extremely worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only have faith in Tianyou.\u201d Although Wang Jiafei herself was anxious in her heart, nevertheless she also didn\u2019t have any means to help him. \u2018Boy, you have promised to bring me the championship, so if you lose now, I will not forgive you.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the side, Yan Xinluo still didn\u2019t have any changes in his expression, and was just staring at Ren Tianyou, then he muttered, \u201cI hope you will not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Seeing Ren Tianyou was trapped inside her illusion, the corner of Li Xinyun\u2019s mouth slowly raised upward. But when she was about to advance towards Ren Tianyou and knocked him unconscious, she suddenly had a feeling within her mind. So she immediately stopped her steps, then the ring of her right hand flashed and a dagger appeared at her hand.</p><br/><p>Holding the dagger, she looked at motionless Ren Tianyou, then under the guidance of her illusionary power, the dagger of her right hand flew towards the shoulder of Ren Tianyou in a high speed.</p><br/><p>The dagger quickly advanced towards the shoulder of Ren Tianyou, the distance became shorter and shorter. Just when everyone had thought that the dagger would stab the shoulder of Ren Tianyou, suddenly the dagger stopped in the air, a hand had suddenly caught the blade of dagger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, you really didn\u2019t fall in my illusion.\u201d Seeing her dagger was stopped, Li Xinyun slowly said.</p><br/><p>Holding the dagger thrown by Li Xinyun with his right hand, and with a smiling expression he said, \u201cOh, I also didn\u2019t expected that you were actually this careful. Originally I believed you will come near me, but it\u2019s too bad.\u201d Ren Tianyou sighed.</p><br/><p>Ren Tianyou had already seen through the illusion of Li Xinyun with his Mangekyo Sharingan. But he still admired this illusion skill, because this illusion skill was very similar to the illusion skill he himself knew, that illusion skill was called Nehan Shoja no Jutsu (Feather Illusion Jutsu). But compared to the illusion skill of Li Xinyun, Nehan Sh\u014dja no Jutsu (Feather Illusion Jutsu) was higher level. But her illusion skill was similar in terms of both principle and form. Originally Ren Tianyou had thought to pretend that he had fallen in her illusion, then wait for her to come near him, and when she came near, capture her taking the advantage of the situation. But he didn\u2019t thought that she was actually this cautious, unexpectedly directly throwing her dagger at him. So with no other choice, he caught the dagger.</p><br/><p>Actually Ren Tianyou didn\u2019t know that Li Xinyun was quite scared within her heart. At that time, she originally wanted to go near him, knocked him unconscious, and thus ending the match, but suddenly she thought about the circumstances of previous match of Ren Tianyou, and coincidently decided to throw the dagger to probe. But she had never thought that her guess was actually true, the illusions really did not work on this guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at your appearance, it seems you possess the ability to fly. It is truly rare for an illusionist to have a rare ability to fly before reaching Saint Class. However, I don\u2019t know how good your control in flying is.\u201d Looking at the floating Li Xinyun, Ren Tainyou started to talk. Then he quickly made a series of hand seals, after that a lightning appeared on his right hand, and he compressed that lightning, then waved his right hand, suddenly countless thin lightning needles flew towards Li Xinyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaiton\u2014Chidori Senbon!\u201d (Lightning style\u2014One Thousand Birds Senbon!)</p><br/><p>Seeing thousands of lightning lights flying towards her, the color of Li Xinyun\u2019s face changed. Shortly afterwards she thought an idea, then she spread open her wings, and immediately flew higher in the air, successfully dodging the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Xinyun suddenly sensed a surge in the wind behind her, and immediately she turned around to see. The first sight scared her so much that her beautiful face suddenly became unsightly. She don\u2019t know when but Ren Tianyou had already appeared behind her. Ren Tianyou had a crooked smile in his face, then he quickly attacked her with his right fist.</p><br/><p>Just when the right fist was about to land on the body of Li Xinyun, the 3 illusion energy balls which was rotating the body of Li Xinyun suddenly flashed with a white light simultaneously, then a white colored energy barrier appeared before her and blocked the attack of Ren Tianyou.</p><br/><p>Even though the fist was blocked and didn\u2019t landed on her body, nevertheless there was no way for that barrier to block the impact of the fist. Everyone was surprised, and had an unbelievable expression on their eyes, due to the impact of the fist, Li Xinyun was sent flying then heavily crashed on the barrier of the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d A loud sound rang out, Li Xinyun had crashed against the barrier surrounding the arena and was bounced back by the barrier and like a bullet she fell on the floor of the arena. This caused a huge dust to rise up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I actually didn\u2019t want to use this much power.\u201d Looking at the huge dust before him, and also the inconceivable expression on the eyes of the audiences, Ren Tianyou suddenly felt awkward and touched his nose. Then he wondered whether this beautiful lady was too tender. The reason why the effect of a single fist was this powerful was naturally because just now, on a whim, he had used the strange fist skill of Tsunade which he had just learned. But seeing the current situation, he felt that he had heavily hit this great beautiful lady.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At that time, seeing many people were continuously existing the villa, Vermilion Bird asked Ren Tianyou with curiosity, \u201cZero, why were you so sure that they would definitely leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, that is very simple, basically all the people of these big power are the people who seek nothing but profit. And also they basically didn\u2019t have any big dealings with Ximen clan, as well as just a moment ago in the wedding site, I have stated that I had already killed 2 god ranked elders of Ximen clan, so there is no profit in opposing us by helping Ximen clan. I reckon even if some people stayed behind in Soaring dragon mountain villa to help Ximen clan, nevertheless it is absolutely unlikely be too much of them.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly explained. \u201cHowever there is also downside to this, I am absolutely sure that some of the people of Ximen clan have also sneaked out from this villa to make the report to the peoples of the house inside the city. So I reckon that very soon, many experts of Ximen clan will rush over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t all of them leaving this place? Since they already know we will be attack them here, why are they foolishly waiting for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally because they can\u2019t leave this place.\u201d White Tiger replied to the question of Vermilion Bird. \u201cLook carefully, all the peoples that have left this villa and descended the mountain, are actually still nearby and paying attention to this place. If Ximen clan left this place in this situation, then that would look like they are afraid of us. And for these kind of big power who extremely values their face, losing their face in this manner is something completely intolerable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Ren Tianyou slowly nodded his head, this was also one of the reason why he alone had directly entered the wedding site. As for another reason, it was naturally to lead out Wang Yuxin. Just at that time, sound of hurried footsteps came out from inside Soaring dragon mountain villa, it seems large number of people were rushing over this place, \u201cReady, here comes the 1st wave of enemies, you all block them for me, I will set up a barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d White Tiger and others replied, then they walked in front of Ren Tianyou, and firmly stared at the entrance door in front of them. Just then Ren Tianyou spoke from behind, \u201cBe sure to remember, do not enter the entrance door, otherwise you will be injured when my barrier rises.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Ren Tianyou took out the map of the region of Soaring dragon mountain villa which he had drawn yesterday from the sky, then spread it on the ground. After that he started to make a series of hand seals in a high speed. The hand seals required for this barrier jutsu was extremely tedious. Even with the extremely high speed of Ren Tianyou in making hand seals, he couldn\u2019t complete it within a short period of time.</p><br/><p>At this time, more than 10 guards of Ximen clan who were holding a huge sword and wearing a warrior armor rushed out from the entrance door of Soaring dragon mountain villa. And all of these experts of Great Swords Master, rushed towards White Tiger and others.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me do it.\u201d Seeing several guards advancing towards them, Void slowly said. After that the dagger karma transmigration on his waist send out a light chirping sound, automatically came out from its sheath and started to continuously revolve around his body. After that when Void stretched out his right hand, karma transmigration released gray colored qi and flew back to his hand.</p><br/><p>With karma transmigration in his hand, a powerful sword intent gradually appeared on the body of Void. Seeing that Void was about to make a move, Ren Tianyou who was in the process of making a series of hand seals behind them, thought inside his heart, \u201cLet me see your true strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShattered death!\u201d Looking at those several incoming guards, Void gloomily yelled. After that suddenly a huge amount of grey colored aura appeared from his whole body, then he changed into a huge overbearing sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d</p><br/><p>A world-shaking loud explosion sound rang out, Void who had completely changed into huge overbearing death sword which was filled with death intent, had directly slashed swiftly and fiercely, in the middle of the crowd of people in front of him. And these more than 10 Great Sword Master guards were completely unable to resist this attack, and were directly killed. They just gave out a blood-curdling scream when their bodies were cut into pieces, and large amount of blood spilled in front of the entrance door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong longlong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the loud explosion sound, Void with intermediate-god ranked aura who had changed into 3 or 4 meters long giant sword blade, even after killing all of those guards, this sword continued to grind forward, making several meters long mark to appear in the floor. Only after it chopped the entrance door of Soaring dragon mountain villa, this sword slowly disappeared, and the figure of Void slowly appeared at the place.</p><br/><p>Just after Void had completely finished off those guards, the preparation of ninjutsu of Ren Tianyou was complete, \u201cAll of you get behind me, I am going to raise the barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the voice of Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and others quickly fall back and stood behind Ren Tianyou. Seeing that White Tiger and others had already retreated, Ren Tianyou made a series of hand seals for another half a minute, and finally completed the preparation of his ninjutsu. After that Ren Tianyou squatted down, and directly slammed both of his hands above the scroll which he had already spread out on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKekkaimon Gofujutsu\u2014\u2014Hachimon Heijo! (Barrier Defense Seal Jutsu\u2014\u2014Eight Gate Lock-Up!)\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the voice of Ren Tianyou, suddenly a loud trembling sound resounded from the 4 corners of Soaring dragon mountain villa, and the ground around there started to continuously shook violently, as if something horrifying was about to break out from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the hall of Soaring dragon mountain villa, originally lively wedding site had now become extremely desolated. Everyone of Ximen clan and furthermore some of the people who were from the power close to Ximen clan were gathered in this place. The bridegroom Ximen Feng who originally had the expression of flushed with success on his face was now standing at one corner with blank expression, as if he still couldn\u2019t believe the fact before his own eyes.</p><br/><p>Just at that time, everyone clearly felt a series of violent trembling of the ground around them, which broke the original deathly stillness of the hall with the series of voices of muffled argument</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, just shut up.\u201d Hearing the voices of argument, Ximen Batian impatiently yelled loudly. Then he made eye contact with 4 middle-aged people who were wearing magnificent clothing next to him, then those 4 people immediately showed the expression of understanding. They clearly understood that Ximen Batian was already ready to take action.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out and look in the end what is happening?\u201d Ximen Batian ordered, and took everyone out from the hall, then looked all around. When the people inside were wondering about the trembling sound and moving outside, in the south corner location of the Soaring dragon mountain villa, a huge platform suddenly grew out from the ground, and slowly rose. Above this high platform, a huge tiger type magical beast\u2019s figure was standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone look quickly, in the north side too.\u201d Just when everyone were in the state of shock seeing the sudden appearance of this high platform, the people standing at the side suddenly roared loudly. Then everyone looked towards the north direction of the villa, sure enough, there was also a huge platform. The only difference between the huge platform of south and north was, on the top of the huge platform of north, there was Phoenix like magical beasts figure.</p><br/><p>Not only that, there was also similar huge platform in the east and west side of this villa, with the snake which was covered with dragon scale and huge tortoise with snake tail like magical beasts were on the top of these huge platform respectively. If any Chinese saw the figure of these 4 magical beasts, then they would absolutely exclaim in surprise, \u201cCrap, 4 holy beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>[T.L: actually south=Vermilion Bird, north=Black tortoise, east=Azure Dragon, and west=White Tiger. But here author is talking about the direction on the basis of the villa not actual direction. So I don\u2019t know if that is correct or not.]</p><br/><p>Correct, the figure of these 4 magical beasts were just like the figure of Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.</p><br/><p>When everyone of Ximen clan was in the state of surprise seeing these huge platform, Ren Tianyou very quickly made his move. Then all the people present there saw a sudden movement from the statue of 4 holy beasts on the top of these huge platform. And a powerful energy suddenly fluctuated from them, then then an energy barrier from these 4 holy beats immediately spread in all direction in a high speed, gradually surrounding this whole villa, and took the shape of huge hemispheroid energy barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.a barrier?\u201d Seeing the whole villa was completely surrounded by hemispheroid shaped barrier, Ximen Batian suddenly blanked out, immediately afterwards his face revealed extreme hatred, and he muttered, \u201cDamned Ximen Tianlong, does he really want to wipe us out? Specially setting up this barrier to prevent us from escaping. Bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ximen Yue\u2019er didn\u2019t dare to believe what was happening before her own eyes, she was continuously recalling the sudden appearance of Ren Tianyou at the wedding scene inside her mind. And she had also never though that the person who killed her great grandpa and 2nd grandpa at Supreme Feilu Empire, was actually her own brother whom she was searching for a long time. And at the time when she heard about the experiences of Ren Tianyou, in particular, about his mother starved to death, furthermore even after he was driven out from the clan, how Ximen Feng had dispatched peoples to chase and kill him, a kind of implication which even she herself didn\u2019t understand suddenly born inside her heart.</p><br/><p>Outside Soaring dragon mountain villa, Ren Tianyou looked at the barrier he had created with satisfaction. This was the barrier ninjutsu which was used by Furido\u2019s 4-man team when they were attacking Kohona (Hidden Leaf Village).</p><br/><p>After this ninjutsu was launched, from the 4 direction, Azure dragon, White tiger, Vermilion bird, and Black tortoise, these 4 gates would simultaneously rise, then they will create a hemispheroid barrier. After this barrier is made, no one could enter and exit from that place, but Furido\u2019s 4-man team could easily pass through this barrier as they please using a special ninjutsu. The hand seals required to use this ninjutsu was very complex, moreover it also required a scroll, to determine location of the 4 gates and the barrier. And the user of this ninjutsu is required to be alive to keep on maintaining this barrier. In the original Naruto world, after Sakura punched Fuen to death, the barrier also disappeared subsequently. The effect of this barrier could be said to be similar to the Shishienjin (Four Flames Formation) of 4 sound ninja. In the Naruto world, when Genma used his silver needle to attack this barrier, it was directly engulfed by flame. But this Shishienjin (Four Flames Formation) required 4 individuals to use, and the 4 users couldn\u2019t make a move, but even a single person could use this Hachimon Heijo (Eight Gate Lock-Up), and that person could also take action. So when he had decided to attack Ximen clan, Ren Tianyou had selected this ninjutsu to prevent intervention from other experts of Ximen clan of the city.</p><br/><p>From the distant place, all people of those powers who had come to attend the wedding were observing the activity in the villa, but when they saw the sudden appearance of this barrier, they were extremely terrified, and simultaneously also rejoiced that they had decided to leave at that time.</p><br/><p>Inside Tianlong city, many experts discovered the sudden appearance of barrier around Soaring dragon mountain villa with their mental perception, and all of them were extremely confused, and didn\u2019t know what was happening there, so all of them rushed over to investigate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Zero, you are too awesome.\u201d Seeing the huge barrier in front of them, White Tiger was extremely shocked, and looking at the Ren Tianyou he exclaimed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right that\u2019s right, Zero, how about you teach me this move, I really want to learn it, it\u2019s so awesome.\u201d Seeing the sudden appearance of this barrier in front of her, Vermilion bird also excitedly said to Ren Tianyou. Although Void didn\u2019t say anything, nevertheless from the expression on his eyes, one could clearly know that he was also extremely shocked inside his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put off this matter until sometime later. Also be sure to remember not to touch this barrier, otherwise your body will be immediately engulfed by flame.\u201d Ren Tianyou said with serious tone. He had set up this barrier to deal with the people of Ximen clan, so if this barrier was to accidently injure his own people, then that would be a tragedy.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse the scroll I have given you yesterday evening, and enter inside this barrier with me, then massacre all the people of Ximen clan.\u201d The eyes of Ren Tianyou exposed a formidable ominous glint, then his eyes changed into Mangekyo Sharingan, and took the initiative to enter the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201c\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201d\u201d Hearing Ren Tianyou, White Tiger and others immediately replied, then a scroll immediately appeared in their hand, where a large word \u2018enter\u2019 was written.</p><br/><p>Holding this scroll, all 3 of them followed behind Ren Tianyou and entered inside the barrier. When they made the contact with the barrier, the scroll in their hand emitted a white colored light which surrounded their whole body.</p><br/><p>After their body was surrounded by this white light, they slowly penetrated through the barrier. While passing through the barrier, they gave off a bright white light. Far-off in the hall, the attention of Ximen Batian and others were drawn by this bright white colored light. Then at the entrance door location of the hall, he arranged more than 70 battle ready guards, and these guards firmly started at this white colored light.</p><br/><p>When this white colored light faded, they saw 4 people who were wearing black robe with red clouds imprinted on them had appeared at the entrance door location through the barrier. Ren Tianyou and others had used special method to enter inside the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d Seeing several tens of guards standing in front of them, who were at Great Sword Master rank, and furthermore more than 10 Saint ranked guard commanding them, Ren Tianyou revealed a ruthless smile, then gave his order. After that he immediately pull out his sword of kusanagi, and dashed towards the crowd. After White Tiger and others saw that Ren Tianyou had already dashed out, they also immediately took out their weapons, and releasing their powerful battle qi, they changed into grey, white, and red colored energy light respectively and scattered in all direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, be sure to exterminate these people who dared to offed our Ximen clan.\u201d Seeing Ren Tianyou and others were rushing towards them, raising his huge sword in hand, one of the Saint ranked guard commander yelled at the guards around him. Hearing the command of their commander, these guards held their swords tightly, then releasing their battle qi, they rushed towards Ren Tianyou and others while roaring, \u201cKill.\u201d</p><br/><p>And inside the kamui dimension of Ren Tianyou, Jade Maiden had already fed the purple colored sky magnificent flower to Wang Yuxin. After that the pale face of Wang Yuxin started to return to normal, and her breathing also slowly restored to normal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

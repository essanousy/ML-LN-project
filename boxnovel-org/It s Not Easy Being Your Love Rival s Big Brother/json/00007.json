He also planned to persuade Curly Yellow Hair.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s first day of work was a bit ruined. Pei Yuyang felt embarrassed and invited him to a restaurant for dinner, and Wei Han naturally agreed.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang had been living alone since the age of 16, and had many houses on the outside. Currently, he was living in a two-storied small building with a courtyard in the city\u2019s upscale residential area.</p><br/><p>But no matter where he lived, there will always be a purebred Zang Xiang pig living in his home. That was his precious baby \u201cArchie\u201d.</p><br/><p></p><br/><p><i>Tibetan Fragrant (\u201cZang Xiang\u201d) Pig</i></p><br/><p>One day on a whim, Pei Yuyang called for takeout, and so Archie \u201cfell in love at first sight and jumped down\u201d with Curly Yellow Hair, like in a movie scene. Pei Yuyang also became entangled with Curly Yellow Hair from then on.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know ah, my family\u2019s Archie is very bad-tempered, and never gets close with outsiders. He\u2019s even hot and cold with me, the owner. After all these years, he finally met someone he liked, so I will use whatever means to make Curlie stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang said seriously, but Wei Han listened and pulled a face, \u201cCan you not call him \u201cCurlie\u201d? The other person also has a name. Although you don\u2019t know what it is, but \u201cCurlie\u201d sounds like calling a dog ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speechless Wei Han looked Pei Yuyang up and down again and turned his eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? A pig complex?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Little Han, can we have a pleasant conversation?\u201d Pei Yuyang arched his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have said that you shouldn\u2019t casually call others. You shouldn\u2019t call me \u2018Little Han\u2019. Call me by my name,\u201d Wei Han stressed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOK, Wei Han, anyway, you\u2019re Ah Fan\u2019s brother. I can\u2019t afford to offend the elder brother, you na.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of Qi Zhifan, why did you become friends with him? How did you two meet?\u201d Wei Han said while raising up the wine glass at hand.</p><br/><p>After all is said, Pei Yuyang was still the son of the section chief. Both the child of an official and a second generation, Qi Zhifan can actually have a good relationship with him? And Pei Yuyang looked like he was afraid of him?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, it\u2019s because I owe him money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026cough\u2026\u201d Wei Han almost sprayed out the wine in his mouth, \u201cWhat\u2026what actually happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sensible in my younger years, and was also in a rebellious period. I ate and drank and goofed off every day. When I met Ah Fan, he was still a high school student. This young master, where would I put him in my eyes? I played poker with him, and the result was that I lost all of my money\u2026 Fortunately, he didn\u2019t make things difficult for me, otherwise, my father would have skinned me and sent me off to some foreign island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking back on the past, saying it well was \u201cyoung and frivolous\u201d. Saying it ugly, in fact he was a fool. Pei Yuyang rather ruefully shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out to be like that. With your trembling M IQ, you certainly can\u2019t beat him,\u201d after listening, Wei Han nodded, \u201cIt seems like you becoming friends with him also went along with your intentions. The more you\u2019re abused, the happier you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cSo Qi Zhifan is so rich, most of it was the money you owed him?\u201d Wei Han asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. Ah Fan didn\u2019t really let me pay him back,\u201d Pei Yuyang denied it, and lazily said, \u201cThis person, he has never lacked money, but just likes to make money. Usually with nothing to do, he\u2019d speculate in stocks to make some pocket money, often in the millions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was paralyzed again.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a while to digest the information, Wei Han thoughts turned, and asked with expectations, \u201cThen do you know if he has any weaknesses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know too ah.\u201d Pei Yuyang spread his hands and sighed, \u201cAlas, for now, my understanding of Ah Fan can be summed up in one sentence, that is\u2026\u2026Obviously can rely on his face to make a living, but insist on relying on his brain to die arrogant and proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han suddenly felt a moment of \u201cwhat\u2019s the use\u201d depressing feeling.</p><br/><p>He chewed the mouthful of pasta and chatted some more with Pei Yuyang. Wei Han inadvertently looked up, and not far from their table, he saw Qi Zhifan. Sitting opposite to him was a very handsome little boy with deep dimples when he smiled.</p><br/><p>Was this Qi Zhifan\u2019s new boyfriend?</p><br/><p>Wei Han narrowed his eyes and began to observe\u2026\u2026Oh, it was still the cute and delicate type, but compared to the previous very \u201copen\u201d Little Ji, this one seemed more comfortable. In addition, the emotions in those eyes looking at Qi Zhifan were thick with inseparable love.</p><br/><p>He thought of that year, even his \u201cLittle Yao\u201d didn\u2019t seem to look at him like this. Now in the ranks of single dogs, Wei Han envied and hated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, what\u2019s up? What are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han from time to time, his facial expression a little rich, Pei Yuyang found out something was wrong. Looking back, he saw Qi Zhifan and his new boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang laughed and quipped, \u201cOh Wei Han, are you jealous? Brotherly love is also pretty meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this, glared and shouted, \u201cWhat \u2018brotherly love\u2019?! I\u2019m not jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, why don\u2019t we let little brother be jealous too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not jea\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han retorted, but his words hadn\u2019t finished yet, when Pei Yuyang came over and grabbed his neck. He also adjusted the phone to selfie mode, \u201cCome, smile at the camera. Frowning doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was eating when he saw his phone screen flashed for a moment. He looked down and saw that it was Pei Yuyang who\u2019d sent something again. The pictures of his various selfies so far were displayed in his mind, with different expressions and different poses. His narcissism has never changed over the years.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhifan, what\u2019s wrong? Who sent it?\u201d Seeing Qi Zhifan pick up his phone, the little boyfriend sitting opposite to him couldn\u2019t help but curiously ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cA pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time, Qi Zhifan only spent three seconds to read and delete. Countless times, he\u2019d thought about \u201cending the friendship\u201d with Pei Yuyang.</p><br/><p>But this time, Qi Zhifan stared at it for ten seconds.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang sent him a photo of him and Wei Han. The two men in the picture had their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders, sharing a beautiful candlelight dinner in a very familiar surrounding\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan suddenly turned his head, his sharp, cold eyes extremely accurately locked on target.</p><br/><p>Just a second ago watching the drama nearby, Wei Han and Pei Yuyang this second silently shivered, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So the four people met and sat at the same table.</p><br/><p>Through a simple self-introduction, Wei Han learned that Qi Zhifan\u2019s newest boyfriend was called Lu Yan, in S City\u2019s Chengyu Film Academy, was currently a not very famous little model.</p><br/><p>Midway, taking advantage of Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang going to the restroom together, Lu Yan softly and gently called out, \u201cBrother Wei\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aiyo, hey! From head to toe, Wei Han felt a burst of numbness. Thinking that he had been Qi Zhifan\u2019s brother for so long, but he\u2019d never heard his little brother respectfully addressed him once, but his successive boyfriends trying to worm their way into his favor, actually each and every one of them tenderly murmured, called so sweetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Wei Han tried to squeeze out an amiable smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, just that you have a very kind face and also speak very well. I didn\u2019t think that the cold Qi Zhifan could have a brother like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad, but you shouldn\u2019t be tricked by my outward appearance.\u201d Wei Han wryly smiled. People said that kind people are often bullied. Did he look that easy to bully?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Brother Wei is so humorous.\u201d Lu Yan smiled, the feelings in his eyes suddenly dissipating a bit, \u201cTo tell the truth, it\u2019s still a little hard for me to believe.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hard to believe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Zhifan agreed to date me and let me be with him now ah. He\u2019s obviously so outstanding. There\u2019s so many people who like him and pursue him, but he actually chose me,\u201d Lu Yan said, a bit lost in thought, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dreaming. I\u2019m afraid that I would wake up one day to find that it\u2019s all fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han didn\u2019t speak for quite awhile, pursed his lips, and suddenly felt that this boy was a bit silly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to let you hear me say these mindless words,\u201d Lu Yan embarrassingly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have a little faith in yourself. Since he has chosen you, you have to seize the opportunity and keep him firmly by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sincerely encouraged him. Colliding with Lu Yan\u2019s infatuation, it made people really hard to hate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Yan faintly smiled.</p><br/><p>In short, Wei Han\u2019s impression of Lu Yan was good after this meal.</p><br/><p>On the way back home with Qi Zhifan, Wei Han thought about it and thought about something in his heart. If before Chu Chuanyao appeared, Qi Zhifan can always be well and together with Lu Yan, then wouldn\u2019t everyone be happy?</p><br/><p>Thinking like this, Wei Han collected his thought and decided to assist these two to develop their feelings to reach the \u201cno mountain, no heaven, no land, and no lord dares to terminate\u201d stage. In short, indestructible and impossible for a third party to step in between.</p><br/><p>However, Wei Han slanted his head and looked at Qi Zhifan. Ai, even this man\u2019s face looked so cold and heartless. It\u2019s really hard to imagine that he\u2019d wholeheartedly fall in love with someone and be madly in love with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Zhifan, do you really like Lu Yan? Will you treat him well later on?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wei Han finished asking, Qi Zhifan\u2019s step became sluggish and he slightly frowned. \u201cThis is my personal matter. You\u2019re being a bit too nosy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s anger suddenly radiated out. Was this the attitude a little brother should use to speak to an older brother!</p><br/><p>Enduring, Wei Han tried to be as calm as possible, \u201cI\u2019m just asking casually. After all, I haven\u2019t fully grasped what your sexual orientation is yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of the forum where he\u2019d previously seen others also discussing \u201cMale god can be straight can be bent\u201d this topic.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was silent for moment. Not saying, but then once said, astonishing people, \u201cI like men, and also appreciate smart women. But I\u2019ll definitely marry a woman to leave behind my superior genes and considerably clever offspring. If later, that woman and I divorce, then I\u2019ll pick a man who\u2019s pleasing to the eye to live with. And when I\u2019m tired of looking at him, then I\u2019d change to another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han stared blankly for a long time, and then broke the silence, \u201cOdd Trouble, you slag gong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just finished scolding, Wei Han ran away, and left behind a gloomy-faced Qi Zhifan to be pointed at by a crowd of unknown strangers.</p><hr/><br/><p>The weekend, Dad Qi and Mother Wei, after consulting with their sons, decided to go on a family outing. The family would drive to a resort on the outskirts of the suburbs to stay for two days and a night to relieve the stress and relax.</p><br/><p>To this end, Mother Wei also specially prepared family uniforms with parent-child outfits.</p><br/><p>When he wore a T-shirt with the Big Red Wolf on his chest, Wei Han\u2019s entire body felt unwell ah.</p><br/><p>Cartoon pattern can be tolerated, but what\u2019s the meaning of giving him the Big Red Wolf to wear? He\u2019s a blue paper boy ah!</p><br/><p>Also, why did the Big Red Wolf not hold the frying pan in her hand, but fastened it to the top of her head? Ah, hey! This wasn\u2019t a flat-bottomed hat, hehe.</p><br/><p>Although always knowing that his mother\u2019s outlandish taste had caused him to go through a pile of people who\u2019d laughed their heads off at his \u201cbizarre dress\u201d since young, but this time he\u2019d been reborn after all, and also entered into a new family. These parent-child outfits were still so bad, was it really good?</p><br/><p>Stepping out of the room, Wei Han pleaded, \u201cMom, can you change mine to Doraemon? I still like Blue Fatty better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, Wei Han raised his eyes to look. The words he hadn\u2019t finished saying suddenly became stuck in his throat.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei wore a smirking Big Bad Wolf. Dad Qi\u2019s was the naive and innocent Pleasant Sheep. And Qi Zhifan, his was\u2026\u2026the pink and delicate Beautiful Sheep.</p><br/><p>What the hell was this? Wei Han felt a burst of ball-aching\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Han-han, did you have a question?\u201d Mother Wei blinked her pure and innocent eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026nothing. As long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>The cartoon characters are from \u201cPleasant Sheep and the Big Bad Wolf\u201d ()</li></ul><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

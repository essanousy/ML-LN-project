He had also caused other people\u2019s families to become destitute and homeless, and the assaulter surnamed Zhou was the youngest son of one of the surviving families.</p><br/><p>As soon as the scandal broke out, Qi\u2019ao Enterprise suddenly ushered in a series of problems such as falling stock prices, stagnant sales and insufficient working capital. President Zong, who was still lying in the hospital, had picked up his life but suddenly owed a large amount of debt.</p><br/><p>Regarding this case, although the dust had basically settled, it was still necessary to do some subsequent processing. This day, Wei Han came to the Leng Group office building to request Leng Yan to cooperate with him and make some statements.</p><br/><p>\u201cSix\u2026oh, no, Mr. Leng, what\u2019s your opinion on Qi\u2019ao\u2019s matters this time?\u201d Wei Han asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeserved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not even lifting his eyes from reviewing the files, Leng Yan only coldly threw down these two words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han slightly blanked and couldn\u2019t help but silently curse in his heart: Leng Yan? His outer appearance, cold words and cold speech really deserved his name. <sup> [1]</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Leng, you\u2019ve been reluctant to cooperate with Qi\u2019ao Enterprise before. Was it because you\u2019ve long seen that they had problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Little Wen beside the door asked in a respectful tone. Little Wen was the male secretary who was approximately thirty-something, wore glasses, looked elegant, and based on his tone, seemed to be quite worshipful of his boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are wise and brilliant.\u201d Little Wen smiled, but suddenly had something he was unable to figure out. \u201cBut why did you go the masquerade that night? It was so dangerous. What if you\u2019d accidentally hurt yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan disagreed, \u201cIt was just going to watch the liveliness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Leng Yan gave Wei Han a profound glance and temporarily cancelled the morning meeting, but also changed the appointment with the other bosses. Little Wen hadn\u2019t had a chance to respond yet when he coldly commanded Little Wen to do some new tasks.</p><br/><p>During the process, Leng Yan\u2019s face was expressionless and his words were astonishing, making Wei Han foolish when he saw this. This seemed like that mental case \u201cSix Hot\u201d. Could it be that Leng Yan had dual personality?</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han,\u201d Leng Yan called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Deeply-awed, Wei Han\u2019s spirit returned and he shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wei Han awkwardly smiled. \u201cGiving someone a gift without rhyme or reason, it\u2019s rather embarrassing to accept. Money is mere worldly possessions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGifting books.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh, this seemed to be acceptable. They could increase knowledge and cultivate one\u2019s mind. And, he was also looking forward to what kind of books Leng Yan would gift him.</p><br/><p>However, he never thought that President Leng wouldn\u2019t go to a normal bookstore, but drove all the way to a 2D store that sold all kinds of comics, games and anime.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, something must have gone wrong somewhere?</p><br/><p>Leng Yan took him over to the Danmei District, and then unselfconsciously browsed through the manhua. The first time coming to this kind of store, Wei Han was in a daze, mouth gaping open for a long time without closing.</p><br/><p>At this time not far away, a long-haired younger sister blew her top, \u201cAh ah ah, this book was clearly 90% sweet in front. Why did it finally turn around like this? Suddenly a big abuse ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to her, a short-haired younger sister covered her heart, \u201cAi, it\u2019s another <strong>BE</strong>.<sup> [2]</sup> I\u2019m not going to love anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The long-haired younger sister kept nodding and said, \u201cYes ah, fancy that I still thought this book would be Great Hot\u2019s \u2018leaving his trade and marrying off\u2019 work. And then it went on like this, I awfully want to turn from a devoted fan and blacken into an anti-fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove falling into the abyss is naturally black. Great Hot has never lacked anti-fans. Anyway, as soon as he releases a new book, there would be a flock of people stepping into the breach to replace the fallen comrades to read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long-haired younger sister wiped the corner of her eyes. \u201cYing-ying baby, Great Hot abused me thousands of times, but I still love Great Hot as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, people still want to have dreams. What if it\u2019s realized? I believe that one day, Great Hot would produce a HE<sup> [2]</sup> book,\u201d the short-haired younger sister comforted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that those two sisters were very miserable. Ai, the author is really hard-hearted. Don\u2019t know what book they\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han muttered in a low voice, but unexpectedly, Leng Yan heard it. He took a book and handed it to Wei Han. \u201cThis book. I wrote it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s hand that was holding the book couldn\u2019t help but shake: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, what was this situation?</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked down and saw the literary and classy book name, \u201cRaucous\u201d, then the author\u2019s name\u2026a \u201cHot\u201d word.</p><br/><p>In a flash, he thought of \u201cHot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u201d, this ID. It seemed that it was really a book written by \u201cSix Hot\u201d.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cGive to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dang! It turned out that what Leng Yan wanted to gift him was unexpectedly this kind of book!</p><br/><p>In one day, Wei Han\u2019s three views had been attacked countless times.</p><br/><p>How would he know that Leng Yan was this kind of weirdo? Not only the yellow-storm mental case in the same-sex dating forum, but also the reticent and grim president, but also a great god danmei writer.</p><br/><p>Wei Han went on the internet and searched for \u201cHot\u201d works, and then clicked into a certain literature network. He found that his books were ranked among the best gold list, and there was a rather stupid \u201cEmperor of Abuse\u201d title, hehe.</p><br/><p>Browsing through the comments in the comment area under each book, regardless of whether the readers praised him, scolded him, or gave him a several thousands words lengthy criticism and tearful complaints, but at the end without exception, every single one of Leng Yan\u2019s replies were all <i>\u201cmwah mwah\u201d </i><sup> [3]</sup></p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice came from behind him, truly making Wei Han jump in fright.</p><br/><p><i>Bam</i>! Wei Han immediately closed the computer and pretended to be the same as a person with nothing the matter, \u201cNot\u2026not doing anything. Just checking information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked at him incredulously and looked down at the book Wei Han had placed on the table. On the cover were two embracing men. He was thinking of reaching out and taking it, but the next second, Wei Han suddenly took it and hid it behind his back.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly frowned. \u201cTch, why are you trying to hide it? There\u2019s nothing strange about reading this kind of books. I also read them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? You actually also\u2026\u201d Wei Han was shocked.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s fanfiction written about the two of us. What, do you want me to recommend you a few to read?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their fanfiction? In Wei Han\u2019s mind, those terrible titles emerged: \u201cOverbearing Younger Brother Fell in Love with Me,\u201d \u201cOutrageous Younger Brother Don\u2019t Provoke Me,\u201d and \u201cHigh Society Young Master\u2019s Private Pet Brother,\u201d \u201cLoving Older Brother Excessively,\u201d \u201cBlack-Bellied Younger Brother\u2019s Pit the Brother Plan\u201d \u2026</p><br/><p>Fuck me ah, Wei Han almost spat out a mouthful of old blood!</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two days later, Jiang Chengrui was discharged from the hospital and because Pei Yuyang was always there to take care of him, Wei Han didn\u2019t feel like being a light bulb and hurriedly beat it.</p><br/><p>At night, he would be on duty while Qi Zhifan was still in school. After seeing that he had a little idle time for the rest of the afternoon, Wei Han invited Leng Yan out to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s hesitant appearance obviously with something to say, Leng Yan didn\u2019t beat around the bush and directly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that, Leng Yan, I wanted to tell you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Leng Yan interrupted him. He quickly tapped a few times on the phone with his fingers and typed out a sentence\u3010I\u2019d still like you to call me \u201cSix Hot\u201d\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s brain was stupid for a moment before he nodded. \u201cOkay, Six Hot. Can you write a good ending in the next book?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan\u2019s books, Wei Han had stayed up late to read in recent days. Every time he read them, his eyes moistened and his heart tangled: too fucking abusive! But it happened to make people unable to stop oneself and was absolutely the rhythm of the revenge society.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan was slightly startled, and quickly put two lines of words on his phone\u3010Stomach Hot, my inspirations are from life, my novels are based on reality\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like this ah. Six Hot, it turns out that so many miserable things happened around you.\u201d Wei Han suddenly was a little sympathetic towards Leng Yan. He really couldn\u2019t tell that this kind of tall, rich and handsome guy\u2019s love history would be so bumpy.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han had obviously misunderstood, Leng Yan shook his head.\u3010In reality, the protagonists are all together. Contrary to the novel\u2019s endings, the cannon fodder is always me.\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han literally swallowed back the tears of sympathy. Six Hot really was Six Hot, the mental case that he knew ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour novels really can\u2019t be HE once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan\u3010When I find true love\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han suddenly was somewhat speechless. \u201cRight, Six Hot, you\u2026do you have the legendary speech impediment? This illness must be treated ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan didn\u2019t speak very much. Every time he wanted to express a complete idea, he could only use written words. So he could write novels, also play a large number of words in the forum, and from time to time, use emoticons to sell <i>meng</i>, but in life, he\u2019s reticent with little words.</p><br/><p>Wei Han could be said to have understood now. This absolutely wasn\u2019t a light illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be cured.\u201d Leng Yan shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are so rich, you can\u2019t give up treatment,\u201d Wei Han continued to persuade patiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless.\u201d Leng Yan suddenly looked more frustrated, and he tapped out a few words on his mobile phone\u3010Need to meet true love to be save\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Leng Yan\u2019s weirdo logic, Wei Han couldn\u2019t express his sincere understanding.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wei Han didn\u2019t know that outside the glass wall of the shop, Qi Zhifan was staring at them from afar. His eyes were burning; his stare was as if he wanted to burn a hole into Leng Yan\u2019s back.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>This afternoon, Qi Zhifan left school early and was preparing to go home to accompany Wei Han. Who knew that it would let him see Wei Han eating together with another man.</p><br/><p>From his angle, he couldn\u2019t see Leng Yan\u2019s face because Leng Yan\u2019s back was to him. Qi Zhifan temporarily didn\u2019t want to beat the grass and scare the snake. His intuition told him that Pei Yuyang should know a bit about this situation, so he immediately gave him a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Ah Fan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from Jiang Chengrui, which man was Wei Han in most contact with these days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was able to sense that since Wei Han came back from the masquerade, his behavior was strange. In addition to the reason that Jiang Chengrui was injured, it should be related to the man he was eating with now.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was a bit at a loss. \u201cYou, eh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeside me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me think\u2026\u201d Pei Yuyang thought for a moment. \u201cRight, Leng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Yan?\u201d Qi Zhifan ground these two words between his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Group\u2019s current president. I remember that when he first saw Wei Han, tsk tsk, he suddenly raised Wei Han up high above his head. Very\u2026magnificent and powerful! Didn\u2019t Wei Han mention it to you? He\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>His words hadn\u2019t yet finished when Qi Zhifan had already hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought I heard Silly Han\u2019s name. Who called?\u201d Jiang Chengrui, lying in bed, looked up and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ah Fan. Alas, I seemed to have said something I shouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s estimated that Wei Han\u2019s chrysanthemum is going to suffer tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han pushed the door to the villa\u2019s rear court and saw Qi Zhifan sitting alone on the sofa, surrounded by a layer of low pressure. His face was covered with dense, black clouds that seemed like it could thunder and lightning at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble?\u201d Wei Han was a little stunned, still not knowing that a great catastrophe would soon befall on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Qi Zhifan coldly spat out the two words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded and obediently walked over. When Qi Zhifan was in a bad mood, going along with his intentions was the best way to avoid suffering more torment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake off your pants,\u201d Qi Zhifan coldly gave another order.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Wei Han was scared, tightening his belt instead. \u201cNo, Odd Trouble, calm down. Be mindful of moral principles.\u201d</p><br/><p>The forehead veins jumped. Qi Zhifan said impatiently, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three seconds. If you don\u2019t take it off, I will help you take it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wei Han bit the bullet and undid his belt, and bit by bit, took off the outside pants and exposed the blue boxer shorts inside.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved and he dragged him over and made him lie down on his lap. His big hand faced his butt and gave a heavy pinch.</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately hurt till the corners of his mouth pulled, and he panicked, \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2026what the hell is up with you? Why are you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you did wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? Ai, I didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t wrongly accuse me.\u201d Wei Han immediately shook his head.</p><br/><p>Fooling around with another man behind his back, this fool actually didn\u2019t realize it at all! Qi Zhifan was even angrier. He immediately pulled down the boxer shorts, and with a \u201c<i>pa</i>\u201c, slapped his naked butt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Wei Han immediately felt the pain and shouted out, expressing that he was really innocent ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever do anything wrong? I\u2019ll ask you a few questions and it\u2019ll become very clear.\u201d Qi Zhifan slightly narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn recent days, beside me and Jiang Chengrui, who did you spend the most time with?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was said, Wei Han subconsciously thought of Leng Yan and stammered, \u201cThis\u2026even if I said it, you\u2026you wouldn\u2019t know ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled. \u201cAhh? Odd Trouble, how did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Qi Zhifan pressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Han weakly said.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>pa</i>!\u201d Qi Zhifan smacked down again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you chat with every night before going to bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Leng\u2026Leng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>pa pa</i>!\u201d Two more slaps followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe novels you read until you tear up, who wrote those?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>pa pa pa</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han entire red, upturned butt that was completely covered in his palm prints, the look in Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils became quieter with something pulsing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Odd Trouble, what kind of vinegar are you eating ah? Wei Han a little wanting to weep without tears explained, \u201cOdd Trouble, listen to me. There\u2019s really nothing between me and him. We\u2019re just bosom buddies\u2026<i>nn ah</i>!</p><br/><p>Who knew that, when he\u2019d only said half his words, there would be a sense of discomfort from having a foreign object invade his body: Qi Zhifan had inserted a finger into his behind.</p><br/><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li>1. \u2018Leng\u2019 literally means \u2018cold\u2019.</li><li>2. <strong>BE </strong>stands for \u2018bad ending\u2019. <strong>HE </strong>stands for \u2018happy ending\u2019.

His countenance showed cleverness, and the black and white of his eyes were clearly distinct and also had a natural purity. Wei Han was clear that this was nurtured from an easy and comfortable environment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao\u2026\u201d Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but call out.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was obviously taken aback and pointed to himself: \u201cYou\u2026are you calling me? Do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was instantly startled still, had to restrain his emotions, and wryly smiled, \u201cYou were going to report to S Uni today? I\u2019m from the Student Organization Department, and I\u2019ve seen your name and photo in the new student profiles, so I had a little impression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how it is. I\u2019m really sorry! At the time, I was dragging my suitcase and hurried across the street. I wasn\u2019t looking at the cars. Fortunately, the brother inside appeared in time and saved me, but he himself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao\u2019s face was full of guilt and couldn\u2019t help but clench his hands, quite apprehensive.</p><br/><p>Wei Han opened his mouth, just wanting to comfort him, but Dad Qi, who had been silent all along, opened his mouth at this time: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, child, we don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the voice just fell, the door to the operating room opened, and Qi Zhifan was pushed out by several nurses. The doctor took off his mask and smiled at them. \u201cYou can rest assured that he\u2019s out of danger and should be able to wake up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, the crowd\u2019s hanging hearts finally fell down.</p><br/><p>The first thing Qi Zhifan did when he woke up was actually to see Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>On the bed, Qi Zhifan had several bandages wrapped around his head. He stretched his hand out from the quilt and clutched at Chu Chuanyao tightly, voice still hoarse: \u201cYou\u2026what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was a bit scared, but still honestly replied, \u201cChu\u2026Chu Chuanyao. Chu State\u2019s \u2018Chu\u2019, Chuan Mountain\u2019s \u2018Chuan\u2019, and Yao Shun Yu\u2019s \u2018Yao\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han to the side stared blankly, recalling that the first time he saw Chu Chuanyao, he also introduced himself like this.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Qi Zhifan silently released his hand. The strange light in his pupils that had flashed before also instantly disappeared. He closed his eyes and his expression suddenly showed a kind of unspeakable exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heart was also exhausted. Sometimes, God really loved to tease people. Wei Han wanted to stop the two people from meeting each other. The result was Qi Zhifan took the first step and it was even \u201chero saves the beauty\u201d. Ai, \u2018man proposes but God disposes\u2019.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Qi Zhifan still needed to rest well alone. Because Dad Qi had to take care of some important things at the police department, so Mother Wei took the initiative to stay and care for him, while the others also left first.</p><br/><p>Wei Han originally also wanted Chu Chuanyao to stay in the hospital for two days, but Chu Chuanyao insisted that he only had minor injuries and didn\u2019t want to stay in the hospital. He still wanted to go report to S Uni. Wei Han was helpless, and had to send him back to the school dormitory.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Wei, you\u2019re really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han always holding his luggage for him, but also kindly sending him to the dormitory, Chu Chuanyao bought a drink and handed it to him gratefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We hit it off, and you\u2019re still injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>After picking up the drink specially bought by Chu Chuanyao, there\u2019s no need to mention how happy Wei Han\u2019s heart was, he also couldn\u2019t hide the smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, if you really want to thank me, then I\u2019ll call you \u201cLittle Yao\u201d from now on, and you\u2019ll call me \u201cBig Brother Wei\u201d, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao nodded. \u201cMhm, of course. Big Brother Wei, you sent me over, and even more, Senior Qi saved my life. Your family are all good people! When I have the time, I\u2019ll definitely go visit Senior Qi more.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han forced out two laughs. It seemed that Qi Zhifan, this savior, had more weight in his heart.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han went to the hospital again. He brought some change of clothes from home, but also carefully simmered some rib soup.</p><br/><p>Because Mother Wei had been keeping watch all afternoon, Wei Had had her go eat dinner and rest while he took care of Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>When Wei Han walked into the ward, Qi Zhifan was breathing very evenly, still asleep. His fine lashes, like two small brushes, covered the closed eyes. Below the handsome, straight nose were two thin lips full of temptation.</p><br/><p>Looking at the quietly sleeping face, Wei Han somehow thought of \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d. He also admitted that Qi Zhifan was a little less sharp and cold than usual when he was asleep, a little bit gentler and at ease, looking at him also wasn\u2019t so dislikable.</p><br/><p>Stretching out his hand, he pulled Qi Zhifan\u2019s cheek. Skin was good ah, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but sigh, ai, how could this person look so beautiful? It was really like he walked out from a manhua.</p><br/><p>A tiny bit envious, Wei Han pulled again. The elasticity was also very good.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s nose moved slightly and his eyelids slowly lifted. The pupils of the just-opened eyes frightened Wei Han to take several steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan asked. Also, not knowing if it was an illusion or not, but he always felt a slight pain in his right cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t do anything ah.\u201d Wei Han felt a little guilty, and catching a glimpse of the rib soup he\u2019d brought on the table, he hurriedly said in dead earnest, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a big brother coming to see his little brother? I was kind enough to simmer some soup for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Wei Han supported Qi Zhifan up and held a bowl of hot and steaming soup for him.</p><br/><p>It was quite tempting just from smelling the fragrance, but Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand didn\u2019t move and didn\u2019t accept it. He only looked at Wei Han and raised his chin. The gaze clearly wanted Wei Han to personally feed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so old and not young anymore. Also, your hand wasn\u2019t injured. You can hold and drink it yourself,\u201d Wei Han said, unwilling.</p><br/><p>A few months ago when they were at the resort, Qi Zhifan fainted because of his low blood sugar. He was somewhat guilt-ridden, so he\u2019d hand-fed him the sweet-stewed snow pear. But this time, the scandal crisis had gone on for so long, Qi Zhifan unexpected had an indifferent attitude, and also looked on as he was mocked at for so long. Furthermore, now that Chu Chuanyao has appeared again, Qi Zhifan would become his love rival and made Wei Han feel a sense of crisis.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan knitted his brows. Some time ago, he\u2019d read a lot of his and Wei Han\u2019s fanfiction novels.</p><br/><p>According to the plots of those fanfictions, no matter in which novel, Wei Han should personally and very considerately feed his own soup to him. But in reality\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan lowered his brows still thinking about something, and delayed taking the hot soup in his hands, Wei Han\u2019s hands grew sour, heart also gradually softening.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, seeing as you\u2019re still a patient, I will reluctantly feed you.\u201d Words finished, Wei Han held the spoon and blew on it with his mouth, in the end, still hand-feeding Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s tightly knitted brows suddenly smoothed out.</p><hr/><br/><p>In S Uni\u2019s first year of school, Wei Han attended a number of general courses, but also learned the basic knowledge about the criminal investigation profession. This semester, faced with choosing their courses, Wei Han and Little Jiang both clearly favored criminal police type of courses: learning theoretical knowledge, while training in catch and grapple, live ammunition shooting class, and police body training.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s goal was, between his studies and his love life, to not neglect either. Therefore, while Qi Zhifan was still recuperating his body in the hospital, he must use his proximity to obtain favor, and also strive once again to pursue Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was an international business major student in the Economics and Management Faculty. So, Wei Han frequently ran over to the Economics and Management Faculty\u2019s lecture building. Several times after Chu Chuanyao\u2019s class, he could see Wei Han waiting for him with a smiling face. Of course, Wei Han\u2019s wandering figure could also often be seen downstairs from his dormitory.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In general, Wei Han would prepare a love lunchbox for him. Chu Chuanyao was embarrassed, and at first, he refused. Then, once he ate a mouthful, he deeply fell in an inextricable love, and also accepted Wei Han\u2019s kindness. Of course, he would also remember to buy some small gifts for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Once, Chu Chuanyao was supposed to send Wei Han a men\u2019s wallet. The result was that he accidentally mixed it up with the gift for his cousin, and it became a pair of Spongebob Squarepants socks.</p><br/><p>Looking at the bright yellow in the bag, Chu Chuanyao\u2019s lips trembled and stammered, \u201cUh, Big Brother Wei, these\u2026these pair of socks\u2026if you dislike that they\u2019re childish, you could\u2026refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han took it and said, \u201cWant! Why would I refuse, I think they\u2019re super cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care what was sent. As long as it was sent by Chu Chuanyao, he\u2019d totally like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, where did you buy them? I\u2019d buy a pair of Patrick Star another day,\u201d Wei Han smiled again. Heh heh, wait until he buys it, then he\u2019d give it to Little Yao. Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick Star were very close friends.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did Big Brother Wei prefer pink things? The taste was really a bit\u2026</p><hr/><br/><p>Today was just the day when Qi Zhifan was discharged. Wei Han changed into the new socks Chu Chuanyao had sent, and then followed Dad Qi and Mother Wei together to take Qi Zhifan back home. Along the way, Dad Qi and Mother Wei didn\u2019t pay attention to the changes on Wei Han\u2019s feet, but Qi Zhifan could see the two bright yellow smears on Wei Han\u2019s feet with a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was what he gave you?\u201d Back home, Qi Zhifan went straight to the point.</p><br/><p>During the time he was in the hospital, Wei Han also accompanied Chu Chuanyao to see Qi Zhifan several times. As long as there was Chu Chuanyao around, Wei Han was especially happy. Sometimes, he\u2019d look at little things like his wristwatch, and happily look at it, lost in thought. Anyways, his face couldn\u2019t suppress his smiling expression.</p><br/><p>When Mother Wei often saw this, she couldn\u2019t help but tease him and asked if he was in love. Wei Han immediately lowered his head, or changed the subject, apparently shy.</p><br/><p>All of his performances, even a fool would know what was the matter, let alone the incomparably shrewd Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, caught off guard, shrunk back his feet, thinking to himself that Qi Zhifan really had discerning eyes. His lips twitched. \u201cYes\u2026yes, it\u2019s like that. It\u2019s my personal matter, and none of your business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan crossed his arms and disapprovingly hooked his lips. \u201cMaybe later, it\u2019d be my business. I\u2019m going to chase Chu Chuanyao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Wei Han\u2019s complexion changed and shouted, \u201cNo\u2026you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? He\u2019s still single. You can chase him, so I certainly can. We can compete fairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fair your sister ah! Just look at the face and you know it\u2019s not fair ah. This was terrible. Wei Han\u2019s heart sounded the level-ten alarm.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s complexion was now white, now green, and he secretly squeezed his palm. \u201cQi Zhifan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The light in Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils flashed. Wei Han\u2019s taut face and rare solemn expression made him pay attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious about Chu Chuanyao. He\u2019s the one I\u2019ve been waiting for. Anyway, even if I die, I won\u2019t let go. So, if you\u2019re not sincere to him and just playing, then don\u2019t tease him. Or I\u2026I\u2019ll never let you off!\u201d Wei Han shouted the last words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was stunned. Silent for a long while, he lightly said, \u201cI\u2019m not playing this time. If I look at his face, then it would also be fine to spend the rest of my life with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was light, but no traces of joking could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han completely froze in place, and his spirit didn\u2019t return for a long time.</p><br/><p><b>The author has something to say:</b></p><br/><p>Silly Han (bristling): <em>WTF</em>! What\u2019s this situation? Why is Odd Trouble\u2019s reaction towards Little Yao so strange?</p><br/><p>Odd Trouble (evil, charming smile) \u2026</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

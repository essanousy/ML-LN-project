Little Jiang, you hurry up and go see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded and rushed to the hospital where his sister Jiang Chengrui was staying.</p><br/><p>Early next morning, Wei Han finished his work shift and rushed over with some well-simmered porridge. When he arrived, Jiang Chengrui was guarding his sleeping sister. In order not to disturb her rest, they both left the ward first.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, what did the doctor say? Is your sister alright?\u201d Wei Han asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doctor said that my sister should have stomach bleeding caused by stomach ulcers coupled with her recent fatigue. So they started with some traditional Chinese medicine with hemostatic properties and reminded us to pay attention to my sister\u2019s eating habits and eat more liquid or semi-liquid food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, so it\u2019s like this. Then we really have to pay attention.\u201d Wei Han nodded after listening. \u201cI don\u2019t see your sister going to work for the time being. First, let\u2019s get her body well again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I also think so. Anyway, the doctor also made my sister stay in the hospital for a period of time. They\u2019ll give her a full-body examination, and depending on the circumstances, also look at the specific conditions of my sister\u2019s body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s good. Some time ago, you always ran home twice every three days. Was it because of your sister\u2019s matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui reluctantly sighed, \u201cAi, my sister was feeling unwell before, and she vomited blood two or three times. The doctor said that she was tired and told her to stay up late less and rest more. She seemed to listen on the surface, but she didn\u2019t reduce her workload. She\u2019s always been working hard, and although she\u2019d been promoted to department manager, but her body\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Jiang family had no parents and it was indeed quite difficult for Jiang Chenghui, who wanted to raise her two younger brothers and let them attend school. Jiang Chengrui used to work while studying in school. Now that he had a job, the burden on the family was also a bit less, but with how special the police occupation was, he was also rarely home.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know your family situation, but your sister is really risking her life too much. After all, the body is the capital of the revolution. You should persuade her more when you have the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded and suddenly lowered his voice, muttering an aside, \u201cShe rarely listens to me. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to see me at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t really hear clearly. \u201cAh? Little Jiang, what are you muttering about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui patted his disappointed face and once again, a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. \u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn short, your sister should be fine for the time being. You should also eat something and raise up your spirit. Right, what about Little Yi? Didn\u2019t you say before that he stayed overnight in the hospital?\u201d Wei Han looked around and felt that it was a bit strange not to see the naughty little devil.</p><br/><p>\u201cI let Pei Yuyang send him home early this morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I was wondering why that Foolish Man-Sheep wasn\u2019t here. Usually when there\u2019s something the matter with you, he\u2019s not far away; every time, he\u2019s the first one to come, haha,\u201d seeing Jiang Chengrui smiling somewhat reluctantly, Wei Han teased.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was slightly embarrassed. \u201cLet\u2019s not bring up that pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a moment, Jiang Chenghui awoke and Jiang Chengrui quickly took care of her again. At this time, he was sitting at the bedside and personally fed his sister the rice porridge that Wei Han had specially brought over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui tasted two mouthfuls and gave Wei Han a profound, long look. \u201cMr. Wei\u2019s craft is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone was light, but this was obviously praise. Wei Han was a little flattered, not expecting to be praised by the iceberg sister. He immediately scratched his head and <em>hehe</em> laughed, \u201cThank\u2026thank you, but this is really nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui also couldn\u2019t help but look distracted. Previously, Wei Han had some things he needed to find him for and came to his home several times. Jiang Chenghui had a cold expression and expressed an attitude of not welcoming outsiders. But now, it had eased a little.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered that when their parents were still there, his cheerful sister was also a foodie. His heart delighted, and he smiled and said, \u201cSis, I also followed Silly Han to learn to make a few dishes, and I can make them for you to eat. If you like this rice porridge, I will go learn to make it immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Jiang Chenghui coldly spat out two words, making the radiance in Jiang Chengrui\u2019s eyes suddenly diminish, and he discreetly hung his head down.</p><br/><p>The more Wei Han looked from the side, the more wrong he felt. Before, he\u2019d always thought that Jiang Chenghui was very strict with this brother, but now he found that it was a kind of indescribable indifference.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie, I\u2019m back. Little Yi is already obediently resting at home,\u201d the laughing voice drifted in. Soon, Pei Yuyang came in carrying a pile of fruits and milk tonics.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cI just specially asked the doctor and he said that Sis Hui must pay attention to her diet, and she must eat more liquid food, like rice soup and glutinous rice. These are all relatively good. Drinking milk also must be moderated, and she can\u2019t touch food that are too sour or too sweet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, I already know,\u201d Jiang Chengrui immediately welcomed him and took the things from his hands, \u201cPei Yuyang, thank\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui wanted to thank, but Jiang Chenghui suddenly cut off his words, \u201cThank you very much, Mr. Pei. But later, please don\u2019t get involved with our family matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was also in a daze. He didn\u2019t expect Jiang Chenghui to disregard the situation and coldly say this. For a moment, it made all three of them a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui\u2019s brows still didn\u2019t crease and her pale, cold face made it difficult for people to get close to. \u201cThank you for taking of Chengrui when he was at your house before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, you\u2026you even know of this?!\u201d Jiang Chengrui\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d Jiang Chenghui said coldly, staring at her younger brother\u2019s eyes more and more sharply, her tone also becoming more and more mocking, \u201cYou are with a man all day, doing those\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not having the heart to let Jiang Chenghui continue to taunt her younger brother, Pei Yuyang blocked in front of Jiang Chengrui, \u201cSis Hui, it\u2019s all my fault. Don\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Mr. Pei, we can\u2019t afford to climb up your social ladder. Chengrui doesn\u2019t need a kind of friend like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, Pei\u2026Pei Yuyang, you should leave first today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui said dispiritedly, his heart suddenly very heavy. He knew that what his sister had said was already very awful. If they continued to dwell on it, it\u2019s estimated that she would say even more unpleasant things.</p><br/><p>Seeing Jiang Chengrui\u2019s desolate expression, Wei Han and Pei Yuyang glanced at each other and could only reluctantly nod their heads and take their leave first.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui stayed in the hospital with his sister for two days. But because of his identity as a police officer, he had to return to work. On that evening, Pei Yuyang drove near the police station, preparing to pick up Jiang Chengrui and return home.</p><br/><p>And Wei Han who was walking behind happened to bump into their conversation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui refused Pei Yuyang, his face betraying a difficult expression and hesitantly said, \u201cPei Yuyang, there\u2019s something I\u2026I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui clenched his palm and hesitated for a moment before he opened his mouth, \u201cWhen\u2026when my parents got into a car accident, it was also caused by me. I was a high school student and I was out drinking and playing late with my classmates. I clearly remember that there was heavy rain that night, and because I kept calling and pushing them to come pick me up, they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Jiang Chengrui finished talking, Pei Yuyang hugged him, also reaching out to stroke his back. Feeling relieved, he smiled. \u201cIt turns out Curlie used to be so disobedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI simply hate myself!\u201d Jiang Chengrui yelled, \u201cAfter that, I also understood that my sister always had an opinion of me, that can also be called\u2026hate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang held the person in his arms even tighter. \u201cDon\u2019t take all the responsibility on yourself.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie, if I made you choose between your sister and me, who would you choose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Among his thoughts, he\u2019d thought of this question, and now their love was now facing such a reality.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was silent for a moment. He didn\u2019t answer upfront, but pushed him away. \u201cPei Yuyang, I think it\u2019s better if we separate for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie, does it have to be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded, his eyes dodging a little. \u201cMy sister\u2019s health is poor and I don\u2019t want to upset her for the time being. Also when we meet later, you should call me by my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Okay,\u201d Pei Yuyang said this word with difficulty, his voice filled with reluctance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Jiang Chengrui waved and left first.</p><br/><p>Once Jiang Chengrui walked away, Wei Han showed himself and weakly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I heard everything you just said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang blanked for a moment and then laughed, \u201cLet you see a joke, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head and said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out why Little Jiang\u2019s sister would have such a poor attitude towards him before. Now\u2026ai, I didn\u2019t think that Little Jiang would be hiding this kind of secret in his heart. It\u2019s no wonder that sometimes he would seem depressed. Pei Yuyang, you absolutely can\u2019t give up! Don\u2019t just let it go like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Wei Han\u2019s encouragement, Pei Yuyang\u2019s mood was much better. He smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this young master won\u2019t easily give up. No matter what he thinks, anyway, I still consider him as my wife. Archie and I simply couldn\u2019t survive without him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, seems like you\u2019re such a thick-skinned shaking M that as long as you keep being shameless, you can definitely do it.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Pei Yuyang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he really couldn\u2019t understand whether Wei Han was praising him or deriding him.</p><br/><p>Recently, Wei Han and them had a case on hand related to a criminal gang. They\u2019d arrested several people in S City, but a lot of them had also fled. Having identified several suspicious locations, Sergeant Lu divided Wei Han and them into three or four groups to go to these separate places and track the fugitives.</p><br/><p>Because Jiang Chengrui\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t good these days, Sergeant Lu let him stay behind in S City. Wei Han and Shao Yi were assigned to a group and they prepared to go on the field for a few days, though how many days was still uncertain for the time being.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan learned of this news, his face immediately sank. \u201cNot allowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guessing that Qi Zhifan would have this response, Wei Han had already prepared a table of his favorite food and then pasted on a smile, \u201cRelax, I\u2019m just going to the field to explore the situation. There shouldn\u2019t be any danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cStill not allowed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The important point was clearly not this, but that Wei Han would be together with Shao Yi again!</p><br/><p>And they wouldn\u2019t be under his own eyes, but actually be out in the field without knowing how long it would take!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if you don\u2019t allow this. It\u2019s a mission that Leader Lu assigned to me, so I have to complete it anyway,\u201d Wei Han directly made clear his attitude. In this respect, he rarely conceded.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan rubbed the space between his brows. He also knew that he couldn\u2019t change this stubborn Wei Han, so he simply said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll take leave and accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Didn\u2019t you recently receive a troublesome case?\u201d Wei Han said in surprise. He leaned over and kneaded Qi Zhifan\u2019s shoulders and lightly pounded his back. \u201cGood Trouble, don\u2019t be willful. Obediently wait at home for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Qi who was being served was very comfortable, but still a bit worried, \u201cShao Yi, that guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han reacted once he heard this, \u201cOh, turns out you\u2019re jealous again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Could this fool\u2019s reflection arc be a bit longer?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, I swear that I only love you alone. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I have the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me everyday.\u201d Qi Zhifan found that he was increasingly unable to resist him, especially every time Wei Han laughed foolishly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026I\u2019ll try my best, but every day is a little difficult. You also know that I\u2019m a police officer and the mission is important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded, expressing his understanding. \u201cYeah, in addition, you have to say something to me every time you call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBring your ear closer.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han obediently leaned his ear closer. Qi Zhifan hooked his lips into an evil smile and then whispered a few words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No way!\u201d Wei Han shook his head again and again, his ears reddening a little. \u201cThis\u2026I can\u2019t say this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Qi Zhifan brows creased.</p><br/><p>Wei Han quivered and immediately nodded. \u201cSay\u2026I\u2019ll say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This day, Wei Han had already left S City ahead of schedule. After Qi Zhifan returned home, Butler Sun approached him and greeted, \u201cYoung Master Qi, you\u2019ve returned. Young Master Wei, he\u2026he left you a present.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan sized up Butler Sun a little and found that his slightly hanging head was a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Butler Sun was asked and his face turned red, his head lowering down even more. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s better if you go see it for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Zhifan was a little happy. He didn\u2019t expect that the fool would leave him a surprise.</p><br/><p>Looking forward to it, Qi Zhifan rushed to the second floor of the villa\u2019s back court. Then, he pushed Wei Han\u2019s door open and heard\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u201cHubby, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a birdcage on the windowsill, and the sound came from the green parrot in the cage.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHubby Trouble, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble Hubby, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the fucking hell was this? It was alarming and not delightful, okay?</p><br/><p>And the key was, obviously they\u2019d agreed that Wei Han would call him everyday and say this to him! How come it was now replaced by a green parrot?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was annoyed and ground his teeth, immediately calling up Wei Han. However, his phone was turned off. It might be a long time before Wei Han responded\u2026</p><br/><p>One night passed with the parrot saying these few lines over and over again, making Qi Zhifan have a burst of depression. It seemed like he\u2019d become this green guy\u2019s hubby, but also as if it really felt that he was troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! You wouldn\u2019t say anything else except for these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! You wouldn\u2019t say anything else except for these,\u201d the witty parrot gentleman immediately repeated loudly.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

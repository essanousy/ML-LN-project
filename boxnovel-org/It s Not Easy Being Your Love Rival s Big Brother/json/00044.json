Last week, he had just finished writing a will for a boss\u2019s transfer of property, and this week, he was preparing to defend the defendant in a criminal case.</p><br/><p>At six o\u2019clock, looking at the mess of information on the table, Qi Zhifan pinched the area between his brows. He was trying to call Wei Han to tell him that he might have to work overtime tonight. Who knew that in the next second, Jiang Chengrui would call over.</p><br/><p>At seven o\u2019clock in the evening, Qi Zhifan drove to the hospital. On hearing the news of Wei Han\u2019s injury, Qi Zhifan immediately set aside his work and rushed over from the law firm.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Chengrui outside of the ward saw Qi Zhifan, he pointed inside. \u201cYou came at just the right time. Wei Han just woke up inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded at him, pushed the door and entered.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan came in, Shao Yi, who\u2019d originally been taking care of Wei Han, gave him a cold look, but still tactfully stood up and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, although nothing big happened to you, but you also should force yourself too much,\u201d Shao Yi said before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thank you. Shao Yi, you should go back first with Little Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, with a calm and collected face, slowly walked to Wei Han\u2019s bedside. He reached out and lifted Wei Han\u2019s bangs slightly to check the injury on his forehead. He also wanted to touch it, but he withdrew for fear of hurting Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Listening to what Jiang Chengrui had said, they had an emergency operation this afternoon, and Wei Han had fought with several gangsters. In addition to his skin and body injuries, his head was also struck by a few sticks. Finally subduing the gangsters, Wei Han directly fainted with a heavily bleeding forehead.</p><br/><p>Now, Wei Han\u2019s forehead was sewn with several stitches and wrapped with a layer of gauze. Qi Zhifan was clear that if it was handled poorly, it\u2019d be easy to leave behind a scar later.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Qi Zhifan was not saying a word and was staring at the wound on his head for a long time, Wei Han said weakly, \u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a minor injury and I can be discharged tomorrow. Actually, you didn\u2019t need to come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I want to come over? I hate hospitals, this kind of ghost place! Before, my dad also frequently had accidents. I don\u2019t know how many times my mom had brought me! Wei Han, you\u2019re already ugly enough, now do you want to be disfigured!\u201d Qi Zhifan suddenly and extremely angrily scolded, scolding Wei Han until he was in a daze.</p><br/><p>The sentence Wei Han had said before was only because he hadn\u2019t wanted to make Qi Zhifan worry too much. Who knew that it would aggravate him instead.</p><br/><p>Looking at Qi Zhifan\u2019s strained face, Wei Han thought that no matter formidable he was, he was also only twenty-two years old. When he was in a bad mood, of course he\u2019d say some angry words. So he stretched out his hand from the quilt and covered Qi Zhifan\u2019s tightly clenched fist with his palm.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly startled, and also realized that he was too fierce just now. He was just about to open his mouth, \u201cWei Han, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t take care of myself.\u201d Wei Han\u2019s face was filled with sincerity. His wan lips still held a trace of a smile, a smile that made Qi Zhifan suddenly lose all of his anger.</p><br/><p>He grasped Wei Han\u2019s hand and leaned over to gently kiss Wei Han\u2019s lips with the utmost, silent tenderness\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, it\u2019s okay if I\u2019m a bit uglier. A man with a few scars is cooler! After all, I\u2019m not like you, relying on your face to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows creased. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no, I didn\u2019t mean anything. What I meant to say is: Odd Trouble, you\u2019re this good-looking that you can completely rely on your face to eat. This is definitely praising you ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s better if you stop talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wei Han was discharged from the hospital, Qi Zhifan began to pay special attention to his body, especially the scar on his forehead. On one hand, he paid attention to cleansing Wei Han\u2019s skin, and on the other, he watched his diet strictly and didn\u2019t allow Wei Han to have even a bit of spicy, stimulating, or greasy food. Alcohol and tobacco were even more out of the question.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Qi Zhifan also applied the scar removal ointment for Wei Han to help lessen the scar. For this reason, he also studied how to improved the blood circulation by means of health massages to reduce the scars, so Qi Zhifan also tried to give Wei Han a press knead.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Although temporarily being unable to eat a lot of delicious food, Wei Han suffered a little, but everyday with a \u201cbeauty\u201d by his side who was specially dedicated to giving him massages, Wei Han, Lord Wei, enjoyed being served by Qi Zhifan and it could be said that his mood was still very comfortable, haha.</p><br/><p>Finally, with Qi Zhifan\u2019s meticulous care, Wei Han\u2019s forehead scar was actually a lot lighter. If he didn\u2019t lift his bangs and look closely, it couldn\u2019t be seen at all.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t long before Wei Han\u2019s leg was injured. Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t broken any bones, or else he\u2019d have to lie in the hospitals for several months and couldn\u2019t easily move around.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan saw that Wei Han\u2019s injury clearly hadn\u2019t been completely healed yet before he excitedly ran over to the bureau to work, and his brows tightly locked. Instead, he would rather that Wei Han had broken his bone this time. This way, he could take a good rest for a few months without going to torment his own body again.</p><br/><p>Recently, he\u2019d admired his own mother and Mother Wei even more. What kind of mentality must they have to face their lover being hurt from time to time?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really take good care of yourself?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked angrily.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded and explained, \u201cEvery time, I protect the key parts: my head, neck, and heart. I try not to let myself suffer too serious an injury that it\u2019d endanger my life. But small injuries\u2026ai, Odd Trouble, injuries are the police\u2019s potluck. Our belief in the police is that even if we break our hands or feet, we must continue to punish evil and promote good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you fucking break your hands, break your feet, what do you want me to do?\u201d Qi Zhifan mercilessly stared at Wei Han and then said, \u201cThe bureau should have other work. Later on, it\u2019d be better if you take less outside missions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heart knew very well that his skills were far less than Little Jiang and Shao Yi. But they were also police officers of the same period and still young. Since they both can go out on missions, Wei Han also didn\u2019t want to be too timid and always visit what neighborhood committee to deal with some trivial matters such as whose motorcycle got stolen, residents complaining that the noise was too loud, and couples in the district fighting late at night\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Seeing Wei Han a little dazed, Qi Zhifan asked.</p><br/><p>Wei Han actually wanted to shake his head, but he was afraid that Qi Zhifan would get angry and worried, so he nodded. \u201cOh, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han had just arrived at the bureau, but his butt hadn\u2019t warmed the seat yet when he was taken out by the ashen-faced Sergeant Lu. They got into the police car and drove all the way to the door of the Traffic Police Brigade.</p><br/><p>The two got out of the car and there was immediately someone who came out on this side. The male traffic police officer looked Wei Han up and down and asked, \u201cHe\u2019s Wei Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Leader Lu answered, heavily patting Wei Han and sneered, \u201cLittle Wei, you remember to direct traffic well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished talking, Sergeant Lu turned around and wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cW\u2026wait! Leader Lu, what\u2019s this about?\u201d Wei Han was stupefied and quite unclear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, aren\u2019t you asking a question when you already know? Aren\u2019t you just relying on the fact that you have someone above?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergeant Lu laughed at him mockingly. To think that he\u2019d already forgiven Wei Han for going AWOL last year, and his impression of Wei Han had improved a lot. He hadn\u2019t expected that now, Wei Han had only suffered a few small injuries, couldn\u2019t take the hardship, and used the power at the top again.</p><br/><p>Wei Han straightforwardly shook his head and expressed his innocence, \u201cNo\u2026no, I really don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been transferred to the traffic police team for a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, Leader Lu no longer bothered to turn back and directly drove away, leaving Wei Han stunned in place.</p><br/><p>Putting on the traffic police clothes, Wei Han directed traffic for a day. Towards the evening, who knew, Shao Yi suddenly came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Qi Zhifan\u2019s doing?\u201d Shao Yi coldly taunted.</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t speak, face expressionless. This could also be considered as tacitly agreeing.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi crossed his arm and even more confidently said, \u201cSee, I\u2019ve already said it: you\u2019re not suitable. Like him, this kind of sky-proud son, he simply won\u2019t be able to understand us. I see that in the future, you\u2019d be sitting in the office everyday. That\u2019s more comfortable and more enjoyable ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Stop talking,\u201d Wei Han shouted. His original bad mood became even more unbearable by Shao Yi\u2019s reminder.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shao Yi was stunned and somewhat regretful. Just now, he hadn\u2019t really considered Wei Han\u2019s state of mind.</p><br/><p>After Wei Han returned home at night, he casually cooked some dishes. He didn\u2019t wait for Qi Zhifan to return, simply ate two bites, and then let Butler Sun keep the rest of the meal warm for Qi Zhifan to eat when he comes home. He went to wash up and sleep first.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Wei, what happened to you tonight?\u201d Butler Sun obviously sensed an anomaly.</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head weakly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just a little tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Qi Zhifan came back from work. On seeing that Wei Han hadn\u2019t waited for him as usual, and hearing Butler Sun say that Wei Han\u2019s face wasn\u2019t very good, an anxiety rose in his heart and, without saying anything further, he went upstairs.</p><br/><p>In Wei Han\u2019s room, Wei Han had been lying down since earlier but hadn\u2019t been able to fall asleep. Tossing and turning, he\u2019d thought about too many things. The more he thought, the more his head hurts, becoming more and more irritable.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone opened the door and came in. Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t turn on the lights nor did he say anything. Instead, he directly embraced Wei Han from behind and buried his head in Wei Han\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>A familiar atmosphere enveloping him, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help twisting his body and trying to push him away. \u201cYou\u2019re stinking with sweat. Hurry up and go take a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t asleep,\u201d Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and whispered in his ear, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s all kinds of abnormal performance tonight was definitely due to the fact that he was transferred to the traffic police force to direct traffic. Qi Zhifan had expected Wei Han to be a little angry and to be in a huff with him. The result was that when he\u2019d returned, he\u2019d discovered that Wei Han was seething with rage.</p><br/><p>He recalled that more than three years ago, Wei Han had followed Mother Wei and just arrived at the house, and had opposed him with a face always filled with arrogance. Every time they\u2019d quarreled, Wei Han always had a mouthful of preposterous arguments. Moreover, Both of them had still gotten greatly out of hand and attacked each other. Unexpectedly after a few years, Wei Han actually became a lot more docile. Qi Zhifan also found it quite interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han retorted. He knew that Qi Zhifan should be trying to keep him safe, but he was still a little bothered by him making decisions on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot angry? Then why did you eat so little tonight?\u201d Qi Zhifan said, sucking on Wei Han\u2019s ear while his big hand touched Wei Han\u2019s butt.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust had no appetite.\u201d Wei Han shrank his neck, hurriedly evading the harassment of his \u201cpervert little brother\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s being angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan wouldn\u2019t let Wei Han dodge. Instead, he stuck closer and then kissed Wei Han, also biting his lip. He thought that Wei Han could sometimes keep such a stiff upper lip, but it was actually so soft when bitten.</p><br/><p><i>\u201c\u2026uhh\u2026ohh\u201d</i> Wei Han couldn\u2019t take the embarrassment. Pushing Qi Zhifan aside, he suddenly thought of something. \u201cOdd Trouble, about our matter, when are you prepared to tell to my mom and Uncle Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly asked this question, Qi Zhifan stared blankly. \u201cAre you mentally prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot\u2026not yet.\u201d Wei Han honestly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it. Actually, I don\u2019t care. I could tell them at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, r\u2026really?\u201dWei Han\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, because the crux of the problem isn\u2019t them, but my grandfather.\u201d When he brought up Old Master Qi, Qi Zhifan suddenly became serious.</p><br/><p>The Qi family\u2019s Old Master? He was the elder with the highest position in the Qi family, and it was said that he had always been very fond of Qi Zhifan, this grandson.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026then how are you preparing to explain it to your grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not at home now. He went abroad on vacation. Let\u2019s talk about it again when he comes back.\u201d Qi Zhifan was a bit tired and didn\u2019t seem to want to directly answer this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han also wanted to open his mouth and ask something, but Qi Zhifan cut him off short. He got up and tucked Wei Han in with the quilt. \u201cWell, just go to sleep. Don\u2019t think about it more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han agreed on the surface, but in fact, there was still somewhat of a barrier in his heart.</p><hr/>Previous Chapter <br/><p></p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

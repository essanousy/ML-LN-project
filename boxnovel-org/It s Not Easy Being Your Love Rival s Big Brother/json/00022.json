He said he was a bit uncomfortable and would like to rest at home for a few days. Originally, I wanted to take time to see him, but he kept shouting no, so I also have no way to help him.\u201d Song Bohao helplessly smiled, his smile full of a pampering flavor.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, when did you and Little Jiang meet? It seems like you often go to his house.\u201d Song Bohao always spoiled Jiang Chengrui like his own brother, which made Wei Han a little curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was from early on. Our parents were good friends when they were young, so we both often come and go,\u201d Song Bohao said, his thoughts drifting away. \u201cI remember that when Uncle Jiang and Aunt Liu were still there, Sister Chenghui wasn\u2019t as cold as she is now, and her mouth always had a smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the topic became heavy, Wei Han gave a faint \u201coh\u201d sound. He also didn\u2019t want to talk about the Jiang family\u2019s irreversible sadness.</p><br/><p>In a flash, it was Monday. Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t even come to class, so in the catch and grapple class, Wei Han had no partner for the two-person sparring exercise. He could only press his legs to the side alone, and prepare for sprint training.</p><br/><p>Their martial arts teacher surnamed Huang was originally from the armed police, and had always been very optimistic about Jiang Chengrui as a student. Jiang Chengrui also performed very well in class. Not seeing him today, he also felt strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, Jiang Chengrui asked for leave?\u201d Teacher Huang asked, coming to Wei Han\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. \u201cYeah, Little Jiang seems to be sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange, that kid usually has a good body, how can he get sick? I think you\u2019re very familiar with him. Later, go and look at him for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, Teacher Huang patted Wei Han heavily on the shoulder. Not knowing whether it was intentional or not, Wei Han grimaced, his smile turning stiff. His amazing strength was not something that the average person could bear.</p><br/><p>After class, Wei Han gave Jiang Chengrui a call.</p><br/><p>To be honest, Wei Han was also very puzzled. Little Jiang seemed to be from a martial household. Even if he was sick, it wouldn\u2019t be a serious illness, and his body should be able to recover soon. Don\u2019t tell him that something had happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Little Jiang, this is Wei Han. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026nothing, just a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unlike the frank and straightforward Jiang Chengrui in the past, the voice on the phone was clearly concealing something. Wei Han heard that something was wrong. \u201cLittle Jiang, you can deceive other people, but you can\u2019t deceive me. Is it a problem at home? Or is it your sister, she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui hurriedly interrupted Wei Han\u2019s guesses. \u201cIt has nothing to do with my sister. She has been busy, and the home is also good. It\u2019s my own matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, I was forcibly kissed by a man, and it was my first kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was instantly petrified: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>In the afternoon, knowing that Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t have any classes, Pei Yuyang was too lazy to stay in the jewelry company Dad Pei had arranged for him. He drove Qi Zhifan to go out and play, and went to the fencing hall that Pei Yuyang frequented.</p><br/><p>On the fourteen meters long and two meters wide fencing strip, Pei Yuyang had lost the previous foil, and now the two were beginning to fence again.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes were like torches and he changed from his former elegant movements. He aimed at the opponent\u2019s valid parts, and his fencing movements were very quick. It was so quick that Pei Yuyang had no time to attack, only blocking one after the other, but his arms were still jabbed a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, Ah Fan, you have been very angry recently. Your moves are all so ruthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t answer, but when his thoughts turned to Wei Han, his chest felt a burst of smothered anger.</p><br/><p>That fool, must he hang himself on the tree? Clearly knowing that Chu Chuanyao liked a female teacher, he actually helped him to chase the woman, too ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me guess ah, it\u2019s related to Chu Chuanyao?\u201d Even after being hit three times, Pei Yuyang still casually smiled.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan deeply knitted his brows. A dark tip flashed in his eyes, and he began to ruthlessly hit again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Sheep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a tender voice was heard outside of the field.</p><br/><p>Not knowing when, Little Yi had appeared, really giving Pei Yuyang a small fright. In a moment of inattention, Qi Zhifan suddenly knocked the sword out of his hand.</p><br/><p>Seeing Pei Yuyang standing foolishly in place, Qi Zhifan took off his helmet, shot Little Yi a glance, and looked back at Pei Yuyang. \u201cYour son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I have such a big son? I live clean and honestly ah!\u201d Pei Yuyang immediately retorted, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not like you. I only like men.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cPurple Sheep, you have to take responsibility!\u201d Little Yi shouted again.</p><br/><p>The light in Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils changed. \u201cTake responsibility? It turns out you\u2019re a pedophile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re accusing me wrongly ah!\u201d Pei Yuyang shouted, face filled with resentment, \u201cAh Fan, what kind of person do you really think I am ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA pervert, nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, Qi Zhifan waved his hand and went straight to Little Yi. Little Yi, who had just left school, was carrying a schoolbag and his mouth was open and huffing.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the three people went to a nearby restaurant.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang specially asked the waiter to prepare milk for Little Yi. But Little Yi shouted that he wanted Coke, hitting and biting at Pei Yuyang. Pei Yuyang was not afraid of him. His face was smiling as he continued to coax Little Yi.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan swept across the twittering adult and child across from him, and spat out the words \u201cCoke kills sperm\u201d. Suddenly, the ears were a lot more peaceful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yi, you really have ability. How did you find me?\u201d Pei Yuyang reached out and wanted to touch Little Yi\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Little Yi seemed to be mad at him and avoided it. \u201cI went to your house first. Uncle Chen told me, and then he had people brought me over. But when I got out of the car, I let those strange uncles in black go back because I wanted to make a surprise attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u201cUncle Chen\u201d Little Yi mentioned was Pei Yuyang\u2019s personal butler. Because Little Yi hid from Jiang Chengrui and had secretly gone to Pei Yuyang\u2019s mansion several times, the butler also recognized him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you\u2019re really a child prodigy, totally different from your brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Purple Sheep, you rogue, you bullied my honest brother.\u201d Little Yi face changed and pulled on Pei Yuyang\u2019s mouth. \u201cSay it! What shameful thing did you do to my brother four days ago? Honest can be lenient, defiant will be strict ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurt\u2026it hurts!\u201d In an instant, Pei Yuyang couldn\u2019t smile anymore, and quickly caught Little Yi\u2019s mischievous little hand,\u201d Little Yi, be good. Later, I still have to rely on this mouth to kiss Curlie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare kiss my brother?!\u201d Little Yi stared with round eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was unperturbed, raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cYou kissed, then did you sleep with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again struck a blow, Little Yi was frightened and stammered, \u201cYou still\u2026still dare to sleep\u2026sleep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Pei Yuyang repeatedly waved his hand. It seemed as though he got a huge bargain, but his appearance was one of nursing grievances. \u201cCurlie\u2019s lethality is too great. That day, I just kissed him a little bit on the mouth, and the result was that he pushed me into the river. Fortunately, I can swim, or I must\u2019ve drowned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan suddenly didn\u2019t want to know this person a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you deserved it!\u201d Little Yi laughed and asked, \u201cBut later, why didn\u2019t you come find him even once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang softly sighed and shook his head slightly. \u201cBefore, I went to the dessert shop to find him once. At that time, Wei Han wasn\u2019t there, and that long-faced Manager Song said that Curlie wasn\u2019t there and quickly drove me out. I thought that Curlie was really angry and didn\u2019t want to see me at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Pei Yuyang\u2019s helpless and desolate appearance, Little Yi suddenly wasn\u2019t even a little mad at him anymore. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t want to see you, but he also didn\u2019t see anyone else ah. He kept himself in the house for three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was vastly surprised. \u201cWhat! What\u2019s wrong with Curlie? Is he sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yi raised his chin. \u201cDo you really want to know? Then you can come back with me and see. You must take responsibility for my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Pei Yuyang immediately got up and hurriedly put on his coat. \u201cAh Fan, I\u2026I have something urgent and have to leave first, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan waved his hand, lips hooking into a smile, and continued to leisurely drink tea. It seems that there were some things that needed to be solved in a \u201crough\u201d way. He also wanted to try after going home tonight.</p><br/><p>The next day, Jiang Chengrui finally came to class. At first, Wei Han was still worried about him, but Jiang Chengrui\u2019s entire being seemed to be suddenly enlightened, and looked very spirited.</p><br/><p>Wei Han felt a little strange and asked, \u201cLittle Jiang, Pei Yuyang, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t shy away from the name, and straightforwardly said, \u201cHe ah, he came to find me last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I beat him up and got over it.\u201d Jiang Chengrui smiled and was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han suddenly felt distressed for that Foolish Man-Sheep, but then thought that since he was a shaking M, he should be very happy.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han had just entered the door and hadn\u2019t taken off his shoes yet, when Qi Zhifan suddenly appeared. His arms stretched out and his hand braced against the wall. He used his powerful aura to force Wei Han against the wall.</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately felt a sense of oppression, and staring stupidly, he looked up. \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2026what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s gaze was deep, and indifferently said, \u201cPei Yuyang kissed Jiang Chengrui\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, and?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qi Zhifan\u2019s words had not finished when the mobile phone ring floated out from his pant pocket.</p><br/><p>QI Zhifan frowned, chose to ignore it, continued to look into Wei Han\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cAnd, I also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s mobile phone also rang\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>This week, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui\u2019s criminal investigation class came to C City on a trip that was organized by the school.</p><br/><p>According to S Uni\u2019s arrangement in previous years, Wei Han, who was in the second half of the semester, had to go through a period of training for the criminal investigation class. In particular, students who chose criminal police type of courses would have three months of training which was always conducted as closed training in C City.</p><br/><p>In order to familiarize themselves with the training environment in advance, Wei Han also chose to come first.</p><br/><p>In the training base, there were not only the students from Wei Han\u2019s school, but also other students from the Public Security Police Academy. In order to increase their competitiveness, they and the students in the C Uni\u2019s Public Security Academy were randomly assigned into teams by the various coaches.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui, still brought together by fate, were assigned to the same team. However, there were several dislikable guys from C Uni on the same team, especially one named Shao Yi. He was ranked among the best in skills, and was very egotistical and arrogant.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, when practicing long-range shooting, Shao Yi wanted to compete against Jiang Chengrui and insisted on asking the coach for a match with Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>For ordinary students like Wei Han, the best result was 7 points at most, but the level of Jiang Chengrui and Shao Yi were much higher. Basically, if it wasn\u2019t 9 points then it was 10 points. Jiang Chengrui\u2019s highest score was 10.7 points.</p><br/><p>Several times, the two were equally matched. Shao Yi smiled coldly and felt that it was boring, and said that he would change to a moving target. Once this kind of shooting began, it was necessary to continuously fire a specific number of rounds and must not be interrupted. This was a test of the shooter\u2019s thinking agility. They must respond quickly, have accurate judgment, but also have good psychological self-control ability.</p><br/><p>They chose the 50-meter standard speed course. The pig target ran slowly for thirty seconds, then ran fast for thirty seconds. The shooter had to shoot sixty rounds.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jiang Chengrui still beat Shao Yi with 580 points, and turned his thumb down at Shao Yi.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also took the opportunity to stick out his tongue. \u201cPeople should be a bit more humble, don\u2019t you know? Arrogant Shao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Shao Yi, face calm and collected, unhappily said.</p><br/><p>Used to seeing Qi Zhifan\u2019s angry expression, Wei Han\u2019s courage had also been trained. He didn\u2019t retreat and stepped forward. \u201cArrogant Shao, I am kind enough to advise you to be \u2018less arrogant\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After this, Shao Yi, who had only had a weak chicken impression of Wei Han in the beginning, began to take a little interest in Wei Han.</p><br/><p>The week soon passed. On the last day in C City, Wei Han went to the local specialty small commodity street, ready to buy some souvenirs to take back, and then see if there was any suitable gift for Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, Brother Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>When passing a boutique, Wei Han was caught off guard when someone called out to him. He looked back and unexpectedly, it was Lu Yan, whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. Lu Yan was standing next to tall, handsome guy.</p><br/><p><b>The author has something to say:</b></p><br/><p>Odd Trouble: The heart is so tired, playing with kabedon is so hard [manual goodbye]</p><br/><p>Author (Pomelo): Not tired, not tired, come, we\u2019ll play pick up soap~</p><br/><p>========================</p><br/><p>Little <i>Shou </i>Wei (wash, wash, washing in the shower) ( \u2299 o \u2299 ) Ahh, the soap fell down (bends to pick up)</p><br/><p>Little <i>Gong </i>Qi (suddenly opens the door and rushes in, evil charming smile)</p><br/><p>Little <i>Shou </i>Wei: ( \u00b0 \u25b3 \u00b0|||) Odd Trouble?!

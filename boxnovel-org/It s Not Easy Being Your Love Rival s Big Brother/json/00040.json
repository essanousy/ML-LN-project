After entering into autumn, it soon reached the end of October. Today was Halloween, and Qi Zhifan and Wei Han were just shopping when they saw that some shops were decorated with jack-o\u2019-lanterns outside. Qi Zhifan\u2019s complexion was a bit poor.</p><br/><p>Knowing that he was afraid of ghosts, Wei Han secretly smiled and looked down at his watch again. \u201cOdd Trouble, I have a mission tonight. It\u2019s starting at six o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan brows wrinkled unhappily. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust being a security guard for the rich. It\u2019s nothing, don\u2019t worry. Heheh, instead, big brother is a bit worried about you.\u201d Wei Han laughed. \u201cIn a moment, you should go home first. Without me to accompany you at night and being alone, you should obediently hide in bed, and definitely must not come out, haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of the luxury yacht tonight, Mr. Wang, the boss of Qi\u2019ao Enterprise, was hosting a masquerade for his baby daughter.</p><br/><p>Qi\u2019ao Enterprise had been developing smoothly in recent years. It was said that this year\u2019s profits had hit a record high of 80 percent. Miss Wang was in her early twenties and, as a celebrity in the business world, she naturally attracted a lot of gentleman brothers who\u2019d come here. There were also some young and promising company presidents who\u2019d brought along their richly-attired female companions to attend.</p><br/><p>All of them were influential business representatives or descendants of entrepreneurs who had a certain influence in S City and even in the country. Therefore, they also attracted some reporters. When they were on the yacht, the rush of reporters kept pressing the camera in their hands, afraid of missing some wonderful moment.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as the ball started, the reporters were locked out.</p><br/><p>In the past week, President Wang had often received threatening letters. His appearance was very calm, but in fact, it would be impossible to say that he was not panicking at all. Not wanting the outside world to know, President Wang had secretly contacted the police in private and asked them to investigate the matter.</p><br/><p>So tonight, in addition to the rich and powerful President Zong\u2019s personal bodyguards, there were also Wei Han and the other police officers to serve as security.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui stood in the doorway, maintaining order while checking for suspicious elements. But everyone wore masks and many bizarre dresses, such as witches fully-garbed in black, beautiful Snow Whites, vampire dukes revealing two fangs and so on.</p><br/><p>The entire dance hall was filled with a strange atmosphere. No matter who Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui looked at, they were all very suspicious. Looking again, they all looked normal.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Jiang Chengrui beside Wei Han coldly snorted, \u201cHmph, that damned pervert really also came.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wei Han heard this, his immediate reaction was that it was Pei Yuyang. \u201cWhere? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui pointed his finger forward to the left and spat out, \u201cIt\u2019s that one over there wearing a vampire mask, the guy who\u2019s laughing with a wretched face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s gaze followed it over. His figure was indeed similar. \u201cLittle Jiang, are you sure it\u2019s him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d recognize him even if he turned to ash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but deeply sigh. \u201cWorthy to be called Young Master Pei. I see that he\u2019s been talking with that man all along. Is it one of his older brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded. \u201cShould be. Following his older brother to join in the fun and conveniently fool around with other women.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and was immediately surprised. \u201cLittle Jiang, don\u2019t think this way ah. Maybe Pei Yuyang was forced by his father to come here. His father seems very fierce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sister is also very fierce ah. I haven\u2019t dared to go home recently.\u201d Once his sister Jiang Chenghui was brought up, Jiang Chengrui\u2019s look changed. \u201cSilly Han, Pei Yuyang and I simply aren\u2019t of the same world. Perhaps, we shouldn\u2019t have from the start\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han hurriedly gave him a pat and interrupted his words, \u201cHey hey, why are you saying such demoralizing things! This isn\u2019t like you, Little Jiang. Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui feebly shook his head. \u201cNo\u2026nothing. Only, sometimes I feel too happy, but my heart becomes anxious instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Han considered: he seemed to have the same kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Bang</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a gunshot echoed!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Beside his daughter, President Wang let out an extremely painful, smothered groan. Clutching his bullet-pierced shoulder, his body tottered. And the bodyguard that had been in front of him the second before, had already been shot and fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Miss Wang screamed. In an instant her face lost all color. She quickly supported President Wang, the expensive dress also staining with blood.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the bodyguards quickly protected the miss. Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui immediately rushed forward. There were a lot of police blocking off all the exits. Shouting loudly, they tried their utmost to control the roar and confusion of the crowd, telling them to get down and not to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui\u2019s sharp eyes and clear judgment was even more precise and accurate in the critical moment. His finger pointed at the black-clothed man who was rapidly escaping out from among the crowd, and he rushed over with several other police officers.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was also preparing to follow him. He knew that the gun-carrying man in black had seen Jiang Chengrui and them chasing over. They looked at each other, and then the man quickly turned his gun and fired a burst of shots in multiple directions. The frightened people scattered in all four directions, screams rising and falling in succession.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly get down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing a tall man still standing upright beside him, Wei Han anxiously threw himself at him and pushed him to the ground.</p><br/><p>On the other side, in the face of the incoming burst of bullets, Jiang Chengrui dodged and evaded, always advancing on the man in black. The man in black panicked and simply threw caution to the wind. He gritted his teeth and mercilessly opened fire. \u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang!\u201d Wei Han shouted nervously.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t easily dodge. He slanted his body, but his right arm was still shot. Quicker than words could tell, Jiang Chengrui took advantage of the moment when the man in black was gloating and complacent, and his eyes turned cold. Lifting his foot, he sent the gun in the man\u2019s hand flying with a kick. Then, he kicked again and mercilessly kicked into the man\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>The man in black fell to the ground and was immediately suppressed by the other police officers.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie! Are\u2026are you alright? Does it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang immediately ran over and embraced the wounded Jiang Chengrui. Looking at Jiang Chengrui\u2019s right arm with blood dyeing the black uniform in red, he was incomparably distressed.</p><br/><p>The scene just now was really too thrilling. He was still wondering which police officer was so heroic when he looked up, and incredibly, it was his own sweetheart, his Curlie ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, a little injury.\u201d Jiang Chengrui shook his head and bit his lower lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, you\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han said, getting ready to go over. Who knew that the tall man beside him would pull him.</p><br/><p>After the two of them stood up, Wei Han discovered that the man was really tall. He was definitely 1.9-something meters tall, and his stature was also good: wide shoulders, narrow waist and long legs, giving an intangible sense of security.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cSir, is there anything else?\u201d Seeing himself be pulled, Wei Han asked.</p><br/><p>Who knew that in the next second, the man grabbed Wei Han\u2019s other arm and then he lifted him horizontally off the ground, but also high above his head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face turned white with a \u201cswish\u201d. Fuck! What kind of ghost skill was this ah? Both hands holding a person over your head?</p><br/><p>The other people on the side all gaped: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han deeply knitted his brows and was about to get angry when the man suddenly said, \u201cStomach Hot, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, several ambulances came over. The doctors and nurses hurriedly put the seriously injured President Wang on the stretcher. The other injured policemen, including Jiang Chengrui, were also sent off in the ambulances.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little worried about Jiang Chengrui, so he didn\u2019t rush back to deal with this incident and took the police car to go to the hospital. Mr. \u201cSix Hot\u201d didn\u2019t say a word, but insisted on going together with Wei Han.</p><br/><p>After confirming that Jiang Chengrui wasn\u2019t seriously injured and that Pei Yuyang was guarding him, Wei Han breathed a sigh of relief. Only then did he go out of the hospital with \u201cSix Hot\u201d.</p><br/><p>After taking off the mask, Mr. \u201cSix Hot\u201d had a grave and stern face, and the most eye-catching detail were his eyes: deep, black, profound and unfathomable, like a deep water whirlpool that made people unconsciously be drawn in with a glance and unable to move their eyes away.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026wait a minute, this grim handsome guy was really Six Hot?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party finally spoke, stretching out his hand and giving his real name.</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared blankly and then shook hands with him. \u201cH\u2026Hello, I\u2019m Wei Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Leng Yan softly responded, cherishing his words like gold.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s brain took a turn. He suddenly recalled something, and astonished, said, \u201cSurnamed Leng? And also appearing in that kind of ball. Could\u2026could it be that you\u2019re the president of that Leng Group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Leng Group was a strong group that had been in business for many years and hadn\u2019t fallen. The Leng family had a long history, and almost every member in the family had emerged as an elite. With broad vision and bold judgment, they had seized business opportunities, kept pace with the times, and continued to expand their own companies and gradually moved toward the international arena.</p><br/><p>The Leng Group had achieved success in hotel, food, information media and other industries, but it was still mainly an architectural design company. It was said that the current president, less than thirty years old, was young but wise, with great design talent and business acumen. He also brought great benefits to the company.</p><br/><p>The books on business studies that Wei Han had read before had listed several successful domestic stories, including the Leng Group.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re really Six Hot? You\u2019re not trying to con me?\u201d The more Wei Han thought, the more he was unable to connect the Leng Yan in front of him with that yellow-storm, mental case in the forum.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan suddenly opened his leg and pointed his crotch out to Wei Han. That familiar hugeness immediately reminded Wei Han of \u201cSix Hot\u201d picture at the very beginning.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was foolish, staring at Leng Yan for a good while. Seeing that his expression still hadn\u2019t changed, he decisively nodded, \u201cWell, you really are Six Hot. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Voice not yet fallen, Wei Han turned and ran away.</p><br/><p>Internet and reality were really very different from each other ah! The one he\u2019d thought of as an \u201cintimate male confidante\u201d became the grim and reticent president at this moment, hehe.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

There were several dishes that had to be repeatedly saut\u00e9ed many times. As for Wei Han\u2019s favorite desserts and the like, he also pondered for a long time. Only after baking a pile of failed products did he finally make a few decent ones.</p><br/><p>Past 10 o\u2019clock the next morning, Qi Zhifan changed his suit and dressed up a little. He carried the lunch box and went to the police station.</p><br/><p>Bringing the love lunch box he\u2019d personally made, he believed that Wei Han would certainly be so moved that he\u2019d be a total mess. At that time, without needing him to explain anything more, Wei Han would certainly obediently go home with him.</p><br/><p>When such an eye-catching handsome guy suddenly came, everyone in the bureau immediately felt as if they were before a light. But once they heard that this handsome guy came to find Wei Han and claimed to be Wei Han\u2019s younger brother, they were all shocked. One after the other, they sighed emotionally: Wei Han, this fool had a fool\u2019s luck. They hadn\u2019t thought there would be such a remarkable brother at home.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had picked up Wei Han several times outside the police station, but as a family member, it was the first time he\u2019d come into the building to look for Wei Han. To tell the truth, he was a little surprised by himself. Presumably when Wei Han saw him, he\u2019d absolutely be amazed and delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Shao Yi, stop fidgeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yesterday, Shao Yi caught a thief in the street and he\u2019d received a superficial wound. Taking advantage of the break time now, Wei Han was carefully rubbing the medicine on his bruised left cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit itchy.\u201d Shao Yi leaned his head away.</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure it. You were also hurt a few times before. Since you can bear the pain, what does this little bit of itching count for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the most afraid of itching. Blow it again for me.\u201d Shao Yi grinned with a thick face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han slightly frowned and glared at him. \u201cBlow your big-headed ghost! Don\u2019t push your luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>And Wei Han being close next to Shao Yi and seriously helping him clean the wound, this scene was completely seen by Qi Zhifan. His heart seemed to be suddenly seized. He tightened his lips and directly turned around and left.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan walked and stopped by a trash can next to the hallway. He lowered his eyes, his hair covering the sense of loss and pain in his eyes, and he squeezed the lunch box firmly. At this moment, Qi Zhifan had a band-aid on his right index finger that he\u2019d accidentally injured while cooking.</p><br/><p>The strength in his hand gradually increased until the blue veins showed on the back of his hand. Qi Zhifan suddenly released his hand, and then, the carefully prepared love lunch box was thrown into the trash can\u2026</p><br/><p>At the other end, in the office.</p><br/><p>After Wei Han helped Shao Yi to rub the medicine, Shao Yi smiled at him. \u201cWei Han, I found that you\u2019re more and more concerned about me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little speechless and reminded, \u201cThis is the concern between colleagues. You shouldn\u2019t try to make it romantic.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Chengrui rushed over and patted Wei Han. \u201cHey, Silly Han, I just saw Qi Zhifan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han jumped in fright. \u201cR\u2026Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he doesn\u2019t seem to have walked far yet. Quickly, go after him.\u201d Jiang Chengrui nodded and hurriedly pushed Wei Han out.</p><br/><p>Before going to work today, Jiang Chengrui had deleted the two messages and, pretending that nothing was the matter, he\u2019d returned the phone to Wei Han. When he saw Qi Zhifan today, Jiang Chengrui immediately thought that it should be the text messages that he and Pei Yuyang sent yesterday had played a role. Heheh, it seemed that the effect was pretty good.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han rushed out, but didn\u2019t find Qi Zhifan\u2019s presence. When he was looking around, his colleague Sister Yao came over and kindly asked, \u201cLittle Wei, are you looking for your brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. \u201cMhm. Sister Yao, how did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe came before to find you and I pointed out the way! But only a moment later, he came out and his face was very bad. Also, he took the originally specially-brought lunch box and threw it away. Little Wei, exactly what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The amount of information from Sister Yao\u2019s mouth was a bit large, and Wei Han couldn\u2019t digest it in a moment. Startled, he said, \u201cWait\u2026wait, Sister Yao, did you say that he specially brought a lunch box and also threw it away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I saw him threw it into the trash can over there and felt it was a pity,\u201d said Sister Yao, pointing in the direction of the trash can on the right-hand side.</p><br/><p>Wei Han ran over and there was indeed a lunch box inside. He was extremely shocked, and there was a hint of yearning and cherish that poured into his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Yao, please help me get leave with Leader Lu and say that there was a family emergency.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Wei Han rushed out again and took a taxi back to Qi Zhifan\u2019s villa.</p><br/><p>At the villa, Qi Zhifan hadn\u2019t returned. Wei Han only saw the mess in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the morning when Young Master Qi left, he didn\u2019t let us tidy up, saying to first leave it like this, and in a while, he\u2019d be sure to bring you back and then take care of it,\u201d Butler Sun explained at the side.</p><br/><p>It turned out that the lunch box Qi Zhifan had throw away was actually personally made by him! Upon learning this fact, Wei Han\u2019s heart trembled. \u201cUncle Sun, how long was Qi Zhifan busy for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Qi worked from last night to this morning; he didn\u2019t sleep all night. Numerous times, he felt that it was too difficult to eat and made it again. He refused to let us help on the way, so he didn\u2019t even close his eyes this morning, when he hurried off to go find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I know.\u201d Wei Han\u2019s mood was very heavy. Suddenly, all the resentment he\u2019d felt towards Qi Zhifan disappeared.</p><br/><p>In the kitchen, seeing that there were still some bits of potatoes and pork in the pot, Wei Han poured them all onto the plate and tasted it. Although it was already cold, but it tasted good. It\u2019s hard to imagine that this was made by the pampered Qi Zhifan, Young Master Qi\u2019s first time cooking.</p><br/><p>In addition to the dishes Wei Han usually liked to eat, there was also a cake with Doraemon on it. It seemed to be Qi Zhifan\u2019s previous failed attempt.</p><br/><p>Wei Han cut a piece and was about to bite down when Butler Sun hurriedly blocked him and said, \u201cAiya, Young Master Wei, if you\u2019re hungry, don\u2019t eat this. I\u2019ll go prepare another one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I like to eat this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Biting down on the salty and hard cake in his mouth, Wei Han inexplicably recalled his past life where he had been bullied from school to work later, and had suffered all kinds of grievances. His heart ached, and his eyes were a little wet. Living for so long, except for his mother and grandmother, Qi Zhifan was the first person to be so good to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t eat, it\u2019s unpalatable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar cold voice came, and the cake in Wei Han\u2019s hands was instantly taken away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, you\u2019re not allowed to cry: simply ugly to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting the salty and hard cake to the side, Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth clearly said exceptionally disdainful words, but his hands were extremely gentle. He gently wiped Wei Han\u2019s tears away from his eyes.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In a split second, Wei Han threw himself into Qi Zhifan\u2019s arms, hugging him tightly and sobbing, \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was obviously startled for a moment, and then he reached out and rubbed Wei Han\u2019s head. Feeling the softness of his hair, the originally icy cold bottom of his eyes also gradually softened. \u201cWei Han, I was also wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t speak, only holding Qi Zhifan more tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to let your imagination run wild, so sometimes, I also conceal some things from you. When I went to the blind date that day, I clearly rejected the other and told my grandfather that I already have someone I liked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2026made it clear?\u201d Hearing this, Wei Han raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. When you\u2019re ready, I will take you to meet him.\u201d Qi Zhifan pinched Wei Han\u2019s earlobe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, Odd Trouble, when you have something later, can you not hide it from me? I also want to share some burden with you.\u201d Wei Han looked sincerely, and the light in his eyes was bright and sparkling, making people content when they see it.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded. \u201cOkay, I promise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At night, the reconciled husbands were lying in bed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, tomorrow is the weekend, and you and I just happen to be free. It would be better if I teach you how to cook,\u201d Wei Han suddenly suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Remember to put on the apron and also that underwear.\u201d Closely sticking to Wei Han\u2019s body, Qi Zhifan began to \u2018conspire to defraud\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, the apron is the one with Blue Fatty, but which one is the underwear ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pink one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the weekend, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t go out, but stayed in their kitchen instead.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s upper body was wrapped by an apron with a pair of sexy pink thongs underneath. Apart from these, he wasn\u2019t wearing any other clothes. At this moment, Wei Han\u2019s smooth skin was exposed to the outside, and the tight and round butt was also revealed: the appearance was quite shameful.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s drew Wei Han\u2019s waist towards him from behind, and the entire person was affixed on him. He even repeatedly dropped small kisses on Wei Han\u2019s neck, shoulders and back, and a big hand was also exploring Wei Han\u2019s front, playing with that young and inexperienced little thing from all kinds of angle.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not hurrying up and cutting up the vegetables? Didn\u2019t you say that you wanted to teach me how to cook?\u201d Clearly knowing that Wei Han had completely lost his mind at this moment, Qi Zhifan still deliberately said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2026let go\u2026\u201d Wei Han gasped slightly, his legs quickly becoming unsteady.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan chuckled lowly and smirked. At the same time, he took out his hot and hard weapon and slowly rubbed it on Wei Han\u2019s rear.</p><br/><p>While being mercilessly played with in the front, the back side also had an unbearable itch. Wei Han felt like he was on fire all over. He unconsciously twisted his waist, and his cheeks were also red and especially erotic.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan had mischievously teased him on the outside all along but hadn\u2019t entered yet, Wei Han was unable to endure and could only open his mouth, \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, quickly\u2026quickly come in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice hadn\u2019t fallen when his tender inner wall was instantly filled. The heat and compactness beyond imagination also gave Qi Zhifan great stimulation. His uncontrollable collisions were fast and powerful, accurately penetrating deeply.</p><br/><p>This unbearably sweet taste left Wei Han deeply occupied, as if he\u2019d fallen into the enemy\u2019s hands. He only felt that his blood was flowing backwards, and even his breath had ceased. He immediately issued out a whimpering sort of sound.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

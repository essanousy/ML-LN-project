He let the tall, handsome guy beside him go first, and also wanted to invite Wei Han to eat. Then, he pulled Wei Han into a noodle shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is very delicious. You should try,\u201d Lu Yan smiled and said very enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded, and then sucked in a few mouthfuls of noodles. The taste was really good, and then he also had a little interest in this noodle master, really an expert among people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wei, didn\u2019t you say that you need to train later? Will you be coming back here? At that time, don\u2019t hesitate to come find me. I will always welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han embarrassingly smiled and thought that he really hadn\u2019t misjudged this person. In fact, they hadn\u2019t seen each other many times, but also because of Qi Zhifan, he was driven out of S City. But didn\u2019t expect, Lu Yan wasn\u2019t a bit bothered by it and was so kind.</p><br/><p>Ai, such a good man, was so let down by Qi Zhifan, that slag <i>gong</i>.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Yan, the one who was just beside you was\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wei Han asked, Lu Yan immediately became shy. \u201cOh, he\u2019s Brother Yuan Peng. He\u2019s three years older than me and has been taking care of me since I first came to C City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it seems like you\u2019re doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han laughed in satisfaction. This was also good. Instead of choosing a man who didn\u2019t have a heart like Qi Zhifan, it would be better to find an honest man who really cared for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wei, is Zhifan still well?\u201d Lu Yan casually asked with an at-ease appearance.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stunned and waved his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s still the same: just likes to make money. This kind of slag <i>gong</i>, he\u2019s not worth a bit of your concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about my cousin\u2019s matter. And, I feel that Zhifan has always been hiding a person in his heart. I\u2019m probably the same as his former boyfriends, and were just that person\u2019s substitute.\u201d Finished talking, Lu Yan\u2019s eyes were downcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Then he\u2019s really a slag.\u201d Wei Han knitted his brows.</p><br/><p>Lu Yan shook his head. \u201cIn fact, he was very tolerant of me. In the beginning, I chased him, and finally, I was also the one who proposed that we break up. Listening to you that day, after watching that horror movie, I really felt tired and didn\u2019t want to force this affection.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was taken aback and the noodles slipped from this chopsticks. \u201cSo you dumped him? I always thought that it was him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, my cousin also thought so. Brother Wei, you should try to learn more about Zhifan. You may find that there are many misunderstandings about him.\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Tormented for a week, Wei Han with sore waist and aching back, finally returned to S City.</p><br/><p>At the station, Wei Han dragged his luggage. Since neither Dad Qi nor Mother Wei had time, he didn\u2019t expect anybody to pick him up. Who knew that Qi Zhifan had been waiting for him long ago.</p><br/><p>Somehow, seeing him from far away, a certain soft spot in Wei Han\u2019s heart was touched, and he couldn\u2019t help but foolishly blank.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan came over and helped to take his big backpack. Looking Wei Han up and down, he indifferently summed up: \u201cDarkened a lot, but didn\u2019t thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han clenched his teeth. This person, would he die if he said something a little nice? The mouth was always so poisonous.</p><br/><p>For the next three days, Wei Han and the criminal investigation majors were all on break.</p><br/><p>This day, Wei Han slept until noon. There was no one else at home, and after he finished his lunch, he felt that he had nothing to do, so he occupied himself with cleaning the house.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019s free, he\u2019d do some housework. Although that made him, this grownup man, be labelled as \u2018virtuous\u2019, but Wei Han had developed this habit from a young age, and couldn\u2019t be changed in a short while.</p><br/><p>Sweeping, Wei Han found a small blue U drive in the living room. He didn\u2019t recognize whose it was at the moment, and also wasn\u2019t sure whether it could be used. He simply plugged it into his own laptop.</p><br/><p>Once inserted in, he knew that this was definitely Qi Zhifan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Supposedly, Wei Han should not casually look since this involved personal privacy issues. But thinking that its owner was Qi Zhifan, Wei Han couldn\u2019t restrain his curiosity, the words Lu Yan said that day echoing in his ears. He repeatedly said to himself: this was for a big brother to better understand his little brother, and to promote the family\u2019s harmonious development.</p><br/><p>After opening the U drive, there were all kinds of information, studies, and financial data that gave Wei Han a headache with just a look. There was also a <i>chy </i>file that caught his attention.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han took a look, and your mom, inside was all the personal information about Chu Chuanyao. His face suddenly sank down: this bastard, he must have intentionally investigated Little Yao before! He must have planned long ago to approach Little Yao. What was his purpose in the end?</p><br/><p>The next second when he clicked open a picture, Wei Han was completely frozen in front of the computer screen.</p><br/><p>The two junior high school boys in the photo, one was Qi Zhifan, and the other looked delicate and pretty. How come he looked so much like Chu Chuanyao?!</p><br/><p>Could this person be the one in Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart, his first love?</p><br/><p>In order to understand the entire development, Wei Han thought for a moment and had to call Pei Yuyang.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was obviously frightened. \u201cYou\u2026how did you know about this matter? Ah Fan couldn\u2019t have told other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to care about how I know. Now I want to know what exactly happened with Qi Zhifan\u2019s first love?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Sorry</i>, I can\u2019t say this. The consequences of Ah Fan\u2019s anger are very severe, unless\u2026\u201d Pei Yuyang changed the topic, and profoundly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d Wei Han suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou help me ask Curlie out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ask him yourself?\u201d Wei Han cried. He\u2019d guessed that this cliff was related to Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie has always been very shy. Everything I think of is useless; he\u2019d definitely be unwilling to come out on his own initiative. I went to his house, and his sister didn\u2019t really welcome me. Went to the dessert shop, the Manager Song looked at me with a very unfriendly look. Ai, I\u2019m so distressed.\u201d Pei Yuyang lightly sighed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought for a moment, and still couldn\u2019t sell out his teammate. \u201cNo, don\u2019t always think about eating Little Jiang\u2019s tofu! <b><sup> [1]</sup></b> If you\u2019re really distressed, you can hug your family\u2019s pig and eat two mouthfuls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang gradually found out that Wei Han, living together with Qi Zhifan for a long time, also learned a bit of his poisonous tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a few days, it\u2019ll be my birthday. You can come together, my dear little Han Han. You should take pity on the pitiful me. Regarding Ah Fan and that Ou Yizhe, I won\u2019t hide anything and tell you all that I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Called \u201clittle Han Han\u201d, he was so nauseated that goosebumps covered his body. Wei Han shouted, \u201cGet along with your \u2018little Han Han\u2019! Speak with human words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei Han, please, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s eyes looked straight and he tried to figure it out in his heart for a while. On the one hand, he thought that recently, Little Jiang also didn\u2019t resist this Foolish Man-Sheep too much. On the other hand, he also wanted to know Qi Zhifan\u2019s first love situation, and so finally compromised.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe, precisely speaking, this man couldn\u2019t be regarded as Qi Zhifan\u2019s \u201cfirst love\u201d, but the object of his first crush. They both met in primary school and also went to the same junior high and high school. But in the middle of high school, Ou Yizhe suddenly went abroad and Qi Zhifan continued to stay in the country.</p><br/><p>As for the reason, it could also be regarded as Qi Zhifan\u2019s bitter history. When he intended to confess to Ou Yizhe, Ou Yizhe said he\u2019d already had someone in his heart, and then he went abroad with another person, an older brother who was older than him by several years. Ou Yizhe walked away very decisively. Regardless of how Qi Zhifan urged him to stay, he still left without even turning his head back.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan became seriously ill and later, became cold-hearted and grim, placing money above all else.</p><br/><p>After learning that Qi Zhifan once had such a bitter time, not only did Wei Han not ridicule, but instead, it produced a feeling of \u201csympathizing with those who have the same misfortunes\u201d. He stared blankly at the two people in the photo, remained silent for a long time, and secretly copied this photo to his computer.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan returned home in the evening, Wei Han took the initiative to hand over the U drive to him, and obediently \u201csurrendered\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know everything about Ou Yizhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han hung his head and frankly reported even this matter. Anyway, the shrewd Qi Zhifan would sooner or later suspect; it\u2019d be better to say it now.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s expression was somewhat complicated, and lowly cursed, \u201cPei Yuyang, that blabbermouth.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame him. I forced him. I shouldn\u2019t have done this, and I\u2019ll take full responsibility. You can hit me or scold me, go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han braced himself and said. Because he couldn\u2019t completely guess what the temperamental Qi Zhifan\u2019s punishment would be, actually, he was still somewhat fearful in his heart.</p><br/><p>Whenever he saw Wei Han apprehensive and shrunk into a ball in front of him, Qi Zhifan\u2019s mood became particularly happy. He sat on the sofa, tilted his legs and faintly said a sentence, \u201cThink of a way to amuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? So simple? Is it real or fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Wei Han would never guess Qi Zhifan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan touched the corner of his eye and nodded.</p><br/><p>Not saying anything further, Wei Han rushed into the kitchen. As Qi Zhifan\u2019s older brother for so long, other things he may not understand, but he\u2019s very clear on his little brother\u2019s picky taste, and also knew that he really liked to eat what he makes.</p><br/><p>After washing his hands, Wei Han sharpened the knife, but Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice cut him short, \u201cWei Han, come out. Food doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han put down the knife. If it wasn\u2019t cooking, then it\u2019s a bit difficult ah. He looked at Qi Zhifan\u2019s face a few times, and found that, no matter how he looked, Qi Zhifan\u2019s face remained expressionless. He also suddenly thought that until now, he\u2019d really never seen him happily laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Cough\u2026cough</i>,\u201d Wei Han cleared his throat and mulling it over, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll sing for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, it was mercilessly dismissed by Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, you\u2019re asking for a lot, I can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDance,\u201d Qi Zhifan lightly spat out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was distressed. \u201cHow can I ah? What Latin dance, ballet, folk dance, ballroom dance, and what hip-hop, belly dance, pole dance, I can\u2019t do at all. Even Yangge folk dance, I haven\u2019t danced before. Good little brother, if you really want to see, we can go downstairs and watch the aunties do the fitness square dance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The veins on Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead jumped and he coldly looked at Wei Han. \u201cI just want to see you dance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just listening to this tone, he wasn\u2019t allowed to refuse. Wei Han simply wanted to cry but had no tears. Odd Trouble, which muscles joined up wrong today? Why do you want to see this grownup man dance ah?</p><br/><p>If this was as usual, he definitely would have rebelled. But who told him to do something wrong. Ai, he was in the wrong. He also thought of Qi Zhifan, who also had a period of history where his feelings were hurt. So, he reluctantly twisted his waist.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan eyes suddenly brightened, his gloomy face obviously improved.</p><br/><p>Left three laps, right three laps, neck and butt twisting, Wei Han could only sway his body this stiffly and awkwardly. He felt really shameful, wishing he could find a hole to crawl into. But who knew, Qi Zhifan was staring intently, not even knitting his brows.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan never told anyone that, because of Wei Han\u2019s appearance, he seemed to have gradually come out: come out from those years when Ou Yizhe had brought him such grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you \u2018top hip\u2019?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked.<sup> [2]</sup></p><br/><p>Wei Han thought of those Korean stars on TV. He leaned back slightly and bent his knees. He move back and forth and tried to \u2018top\u2019. The clumsy actions suddenly made Qi Zhifan \u201cpfft\u201d laughed out loud, truly amusing.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Wei Han looked and became silly: wow, he didn\u2019t expect that when Odd Trouble laughed, he\u2019d be super handsome ah!</p><br/><p>To win the beauty\u2019s laugh, Wei Han decided to redouble his efforts, twisting and twisting hard. As a result, accompanied by an \u201c<i>ow</i>\u201d scream, he miserably sprained his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Qi Zhifan immediately stepped forward and supported Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy waist hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did your waist get hurt again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was injured during the training, and probably hasn\u2019t healed yet.\u201d After Wei Han finished talking, he hadn\u2019t had time react before he saw Qi Zhifan bowed his head and used his hand to rub his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan! You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Mother Wei and a little girl about ten years old stared blankly from the doorway.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><b>1.

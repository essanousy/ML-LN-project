Then\u2026then Wei Han\u2019s hat had fallen off.</p><br/><p>Oh god, Wei Han shook his head. Really can\u2019t bear to look back ah!</p><br/><p>The mishap that he\u2019d caused, Wei Han had already explained to Chu Chuanyao. Chu Chuanyao didn\u2019t think much about it. His understanding of \u201clike\u201d was very simple. He thought that Wei Han had taken care of him so much before was just liking him as a little brother.</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He shook his head and simply confessed, \u201cLittle Yao, your way of thinking is really pure. Actually\u2026actually, I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was silent. He needed to properly digest this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I\u2019d always thought I liked you. But after returning from the training, I discovered that I didn\u2019t like you like this. Little Yao, if you don\u2019t mind, we can still be friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yeah, okay.\u201d Chu Chuanyao smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Wei Han was silly. Unexpectedly, he accepted so quickly? He thought Chu Chuanyao would take a few days. After all, in this life, he was a little straight guy and had been so attached to women before.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh. Even though I still can\u2019t understand this kind of feeling, but Big Brother Wei, you\u2019re an honest person, the things you make are delicious, and you\u2019ve helped me so much. I don\u2019t want to lose you as a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han also laughed. \u201cLittle Yao, you can\u2019t give up hope on love. What if you meet someone you like one day? At that time, tell me. I\u2019d definitely help you as much as possible to pursue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, let\u2019s talk about this later.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the call with Chu Chuanyao, Wei Han was already thoroughly clear on his feelings toward Little Yao. However, toward his own family\u2019s \u201clittle brother\u201d Qi Zhifan, Wei Han couldn\u2019t sort it out at all.</p><br/><p>Flipping through the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d at night, Wei Han recalled the little details and was unaware that he was always laughing foolishly.</p><br/><p>But once he remembered that day when he took the initiative to go visit him, and Qi Zhifan\u2019s light and indifferent, completely emotionless \u201cbrother\u201d suddenly reverberated in his ears, Wei Han\u2019s heart was seized.</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but tightly clench his palm, but still didn\u2019t think of giving up.</p><br/><p>After the three-month training, Wei Han and the others took a two-week break before facing the final exam. It included a written exam, interview, physical fitness and psychological quality assessment, and so on. The qualified trainees who met the above standards were ranked from high to low according to their comprehensive score, and then the final review was conducted.</p><br/><p>Although the process was very difficult, and Wei Han was far inferior to Jiang Chengrui in terms of physical fitness performance, but he still barely passed.</p><br/><p>After Qi Zhifan obtained his master\u2019s degree in law, he was currently studying business. And Chu Chuanyao, who was studying financial management, still had two years to graduate. Unlike them, Wei Han entered the police force and started the entry-level internship.</p><br/><p>From Wei Han\u2019s class, some went to the criminal police team to learn how to handle cases and some went to the patrol team. These patrol teams would do car patrols whenever there\u2019s nothing else. When they receive a 110 instruction, they would rush to the scene. If they\u2019re unable to mediate it after three minutes, they would bring them back to the local police station and hand them over. Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui together settled a lot of miscellaneous disputes at the local police station.</p><br/><p>For this reason, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui talked it over, and in order to more conveniently facilitate actions later, the two would rent an apartment in the vicinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, Fan-fan had already moved out before. I didn\u2019t expect that now you would also want to go live outside. Ai, afterwards, your Uncle Qi and I would really become empty nesters.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Mother Wei helped pack his clothes in the evening, she was a bit reluctant to part with her son. It seemed like, in the blink of an eye, Wei Han had truly grown up.</p><br/><p>Wei Han helped Mother Wei to sit down, massaging her shoulders and smiling. \u201cMom, rest assured. I promise that when I have the time, I will come back to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei shook her head and disagreed, \u201cYou\u2019d be frequently on duty. When would you have the time to come home? It\u2019s a bit more reliable if I go see you. Han-han, when you suddenly said you wanted to be a police officer, you made me jump in fright. But now\u2026ai, can you not be on the police patrol? That way, it\u2019d be a little easier on you ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a young man.\u201d Wei Han hadn\u2019t said anything yet when Qi Hao to the side said with a smile. Then, he took hold of Mother Wei and comforted, \u201cYing-ying, this is also very good. It allows Little Han to learn some more things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, anyways, I also can\u2019t outtalk you guys. Han-han, you need to take good care of yourself when you\u2019re alone outside,\u201d Mother Wei urged again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I will. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, you\u2019re so virtuous, I also know that I don\u2019t need to worry. Ai, I\u2019m a bit distressed about the housework afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom, have you always treated me as free labor ah?</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Downstairs in the neighborhood district, Qi Zhifan had been standing for a while, his eyes staring up at his own family\u2019s window. He kept thinking about Wei Han in his mind. That fool really became a police officer. Such dangerous work, what if something bad happened? What then?</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui served as probationary police officers. Although they had police badges, but during the first year of the internship, the badges worn on their shoulders were not one bar and one pip, but two chevrons. Police officer certificates would also temporarily not be issued, and of course, they were not allowed to carry guns.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wei, why do you always wear a hat? Now that we\u2019re inside, hurry and take it off,\u201d Lu Pengda found it strange and said. This was the official police officer looking after Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>Everyone who knew him all knew that Sergeant Lu had always been no-nonsense and was specially very stern and tough on the new recruits.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Lu, I, this\u2026\u201d Wei Han stammered, a little hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it off!\u201d Sergeant Lu shouted.</p><br/><p>This cold shout frightened Wei Han and he immediately took off the police cap. That bald forehead was laid bare like that. Sergeant Lu saw this and his face instantly darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han! You\u2019re too unorganized and undisciplined. There are grooming regulations prohibiting bald heads!\u201d Sergeant Lu berated.</p><br/><p>Wei Han simply wanted to cry without tears, and immediately shook his head. \u201cLeader Lu, I\u2019m not bald ah. You touch it. There\u2019s still a bit of black stubble. They\u2019re trying hard to grow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBald heads must wear wigs, to avoid affecting the appearance of the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sent a text message to Qi Zhifan, but he never replied. He summoned up the courage to call him, but it was always the phrase: \u201cHello. The phone you\u2019ve dialed was temporarily unanswered. Please call again later.\u201d \u2026Even QQ and WeChat also failed to make contact Qi Zhifan, and this situation continued for a week.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to cry ah. Odd Trouble wouldn\u2019t have added him to the blacklist, right?</p><br/><p>Also, what had he done wrong? Wasn\u2019t it just not letting Qi Zhifan kiss him? At worst, just let him kiss again and come back.</p><br/><p>No! Wei Han felt that he couldn\u2019t sit idly by and had to go visit him again.</p><br/><p>In Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui\u2019s shared apartment the next day, the day had just dawned when Wei Han was already up and busy.</p><br/><p>He made a proper breakfast, but also specially packed rice porridge in the insulated lunch boxes to bring to Qi Zhifan. Later, Wei Han found the two bags loaded with small cakes and biscuits that Song Bohao had just sent yesterday.</p><br/><p>Because Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui were now probationary police officers with heavy workloads, they had long since quit their job at the dessert shop. Jiang Chengrui also didn\u2019t have so many part-time jobs.</p><br/><p>When he had free time on the weekend, store manager Song Bohao would come to see them and bring a lot of desserts from the shop.</p><br/><p>Hearing the noise from the kitchen, the still in bed Jiang Chengrui yawned several times. \u201cSilly\u2026Silly Han, what time is it now? Why did you get up so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to make a trip in a moment. Sorry for waking you up, Little Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui waved his hand. \u201cHey, it\u2019s nothing. Where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han blanked for a moment. \u201cUh, going home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d I remember that you just went back a few days ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy\u2026my mom missed me and told me to go back again,\u201d Wei Han explained dryly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui narrowed his eyes and thought something was odd. But seeing Wei Han unwilling to say more, he also didn\u2019t feel like asking more. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would be on duty at noon, so Wei Han simply wore his uniform and went over to Qi Zhifan\u2019s place. Butler Sun smiled and came out to greet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cApologies, Young Master Wei. Young Master Qi isn\u2019t in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s mouth twitched and didn\u2019t say anything. Wasn\u2019t this clearly trying to dupe him? This early in the morning, if he said that Qi Zhifan hadn\u2019t woken up yet, then he\u2019s more likely to believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Sun, is Qi Zhifan determined not to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Butler Sun was a little startled, almost being unable to maintain the smiling expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019m also not quite sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han also didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Butler Sun. Realizing that Qi Zhifan was deliberately hiding himself, he put down the things he\u2019d brought and then left in disappointment.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan watched Wei Han\u2019s every move through the monitoring system, especially looking at the body clad in a police uniform, the inside of his eyes pulsed with a thread of desire. He really wanted to overwhelm this little police officer and mercilessly fuck him!</p><br/><p>Wei Han had made a help post on the same-sex dating website the last time. When Wei Han logged in again, in addition to the concerned messages and follow up comments, there were also a lot of private messages.</p><br/><p>Wei Han clicked to look, and it turned out to be from the same person. In line with picking up soap expressions, the content was similar\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u3010I want to know you\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010I really want to know you\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010I really, really want to know you\u3011</p><br/><p>\u3010I definitely want to know you\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han felt a burst of speechlessness when he saw this. This really was a weirdo.</p><br/><p>And the guy with this ID, \u201cHot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u201d, his picture was actually a close-up of his crotch, that terrible, big bulge that made Wei Han feel a burst of numbness when he saw it. Too fucking pornographic ah!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Dude, before trying to hook up with me, can you change your picture to be a bit cleaner?\u3011</p><br/><p>Not long after Wei Han sent this out, who knew, the other person actually responded back seconds later.</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot \u3010Okay, changed.\u3011</p><br/><p>After Wei Han refreshed, he took a look. He\u2019d changed it to a big cucumber.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010. . . . . . Uh, dude, I don\u2019t think we can communicate properly. Goodbye.\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Wait, it\u2019s hard for us to be brought together by fate. I only want to make friends with you\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Sorry, I think you found the wrong person. Bro\u2019s not interested in you. Besides, I\u2019m completely unable to make sense of why you\u2019d think we\u2019re brought together by fate?\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Our IDs are very similar. The number of words are the same. It seems like we\u2019re all people hit with the lack of \u201chot\u201d\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the hell ah? This person had a problem with his head! Fuck, he wouldn\u2019t have run into a mental case, right?</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Uh, this Mr. \u201cSix Hot\u201d, let\u2019s say bye-bye\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Stomach Hot, the next time you meet your brother, you must forcibly kiss him!\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, what was this situation? Wei Han stared at the screen before him and didn\u2019t reply. He only thought that today he\u2019d definitely become tangled up with a mental case.</p><br/><p>In S City\u2019s Northern District, recently, there were frequent reports that once it was evening, there\u2019d inevitably be perverts and thieves mixed in the streets near the Northern District, often targeting single women in their twenties.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wei, Little Jiang, get ready for an operation tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few days of investigation, Sergeant Lu decided to take Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui on an operation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui said in unison.</p><br/><p>Sergeant Lu nodded. Suddenly, he looked at Wei Han with some other deep meaning. \u201cLittle Wei, you\u2019ll be wearing a wig tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han temporarily didn\u2019t understand. When he understood it, he\u2019d already been forced to change into women\u2019s clothing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui looked up and down at the dolled up, head with enchanting curls Wei Han, and couldn\u2019t help but give a thumbs up. \u201cNot bad. Silly Han, you really can be married off.\u201d</p><br/><p>The praise made Wei Han almost want to spit out a mouthful of blood!</p><br/><p>So on the street, a long-haired, fluttering beauty appeared in the bustling crowd. The beauty stepped in high heels and was wearing a conspicuous red skirt. But the beauty seemed a little shy. She kept her head down, not knowing what she was thinking about.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wei Han was so embarrassed and ashamed, he almost wanted to drop dead. However, he also encouraged and consoled himself: this was the first time he\u2019s catching a thief. He must not mess up! And \u2018a leader can submit or can stand tall as required\u2019. He was also a newcomer, so it\u2019s unavoidable that he\u2019d suffer some small grievances and have to sacrifice himself a little. No matter how uncomfortable it was, he also must act as the \u201cbait\u201d and lead the snake out of its hole.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han\u2019s face changed. He felt that behind him, there was a person continuously staring at him.</p><br/><p>Heheh, didn\u2019t expect the pervert would take the bait so quickly.</p><br/><p>Separated by a distance from Wei Han, the \u201cpervert\u201d following him was\u2026Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>From Pei Yuyang\u2019s mouth, he\u2019d learned that Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui\u2019s first task was to catch a thief. He feared that something would happen to Wei Han, that fool. Somewhat worried, Qi Zhifan came and followed him.</p><br/><p>The crux was, reportedly, Wei Han was disguised in women\u2019s clothes\u2026</p><br/><p>In order to not let Wei Han discover him, Qi Zhifan changed his clothes and also wore a hat and sunglasses. As he walked, he also noticed the strangeness of the surroundings. Obviously, there were plainclothes policemen lurking around. Also, not far from him, a genuine pervert was furtively catching up to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>After a while, Wei Han walked to a relatively remote place and felt something was a little wrong. There seemed to be more than one person behind him. Could it be that the pervert had an accomplice?</p><br/><p>Secretly squeezing his palm, Wei Han considered that it would be impossible to catch two at once, so he should at least suppress one first, and the remaining person could be handled by Leader Lu and Little Jiang.</p><br/><p>Quicker than words could tell, Wei Han suddenly turned around and rushed toward the figure in the rear. He sent a few flying kicks, but unexpectedly, the other side blocked them with his arm, and he didn\u2019t hit any vital parts.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was slightly surprised. Strange, this pervert seemed to very capable in fighting, but also his figure inexplicably seemed a bit familiar? But he didn\u2019t have time to think more. He gritted his teeth and used his head to fiercely butt the other\u2019s stomach. Taking advantage of the other person\u2019s short moment of absentmindedness, he threw himself on him and they both fell down. With a \u201c<i>click,</i>\u201d Wei Han handcuffed this man.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and sneered. He took off his sunglasses and looked straight at Wei Han sitting on his body.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wig fallen, the skirt-wearing \u201cbald head\u201d Wei Han was thoroughly petrified.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

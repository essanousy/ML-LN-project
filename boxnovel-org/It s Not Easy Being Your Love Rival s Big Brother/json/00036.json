His whole body was badly battered. Apparently because of resistance, they\u2019d mercilessly beaten him.</p><br/><p>After completing the record at the bureau and receiving Sergeant Lu\u2019s permission, Wei Han sent Qi Zhifan all the way home.</p><br/><p>At 11 o\u2019clock in the evening, the two people kept silent until they got off the taxi. After a few steps, Wei Han suddenly pulled Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stared blankly, stopping in his tracks. Previously, he hadn\u2019t been thinking that this fool wouldn\u2019t make such a statement, ignore him and go back, right?</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han finally reached out to pull him, Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth slightly hooked up.</p><br/><p>Before he\u2019d followed Wei Han tonight, he\u2019d thought well, even if he was caught, it didn\u2019t matter, so he also didn\u2019t deliberately conceal it. Two weeks had passed. He felt that he\u2019d almost teased Wei Han enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you think I followed you?\u201d Qi Zhifan looked at Wei Han, the light in his eyes becoming profound.</p><br/><p>Vaguely being able to guess some things, Wei Han squeezed his palm and secretly pumped himself up. \u201cYou\u2026you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly raised his eyebrow: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t like me, why would you kiss me before and follow me tonight? But if you like me, why did you ignore me for the previous two weeks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan remained silent. Compared to Wei Han\u2019s usual simple and honest appearance, and his occasional mischievous and smug little expression, he was more fond of seeing his apprehensive look.</p><br/><p>At the moment under the streetlights, the light in Wei Han\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened and suddenly darkened, somewhat bewildered and helpless, and was obviously distressed and anxious about something, but also hiding a very small expectation. This appearance was really interesting.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan not uttering a sound for half a day, Wei Han was anxious. He thought for a moment, and simply threw caution to the wind: \u201cNo matter what you really think, Qi Zhifan, listen well: bro likes you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Wei Han stood up on his tiptoes, pulled Qi Zhifan\u2019s neck toward him, and suddenly, in this way \u201cdomineeringly\u201d kissed him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes flashed with a hint of unrestrained surprise.</p><br/><p>On Qi Zhifan\u2019s lips, he licked and sucked, biting softly. Wei Han\u2019s movements were gentle and cautious, and very clumsy. But against all reason, this kind of inexperienced, without technique kiss unexpectedly raised Qi Zhifan\u2019s desire, making him gradually lose control.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was ready to hold Wei Han and mercilessly kiss him back. But who knew, Wei Han suddenly left his lips, and then the whole body pulled back and retreated.</p><br/><p>Slightly blushing, Wei Han kept retreating, and then turned around and ran.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan gritted his teeth, really wanting to catch him back and directly throw him on the bed. Unfortunately, Wei Han ran until even his shadow couldn\u2019t be seen. Fuck, this fool slipped away so fast every time.</p><br/><p>After Wei Han slept and woke up, he realized that he could be considered as having \u201cforcibly kissed\u201d Qi Zhifan last night. After his heart jumped in surprise, he immediately logged into the dating forum.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Six Hot, I really forcibly kissed my brother\u3011</p><br/><p>Although the other party was probably a mental case, but what he said last time actually made Wei Han really pay attention to it and was also very accurate. Like the last time, he\u2019d told him to forcibly kiss Qi Zhifan when he meet him, and the result, mysteriously and inexorably, he\u2019d really done it.</p><br/><p>After a few minutes, Six Hot gave a reply\u30fc</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010And then?\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010After I kissed him, I ran away\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Beautifully done!\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010I\u2019ve already laid my cards on the table. I\u2019m not sure what I should do next\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Stomach Hot, if you don\u2019t mind, can you tell me more about your brother. I can definitely help you out\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought for a moment that this person was really a bit weird. Suddenly he came to hook up with him, and was also so concerned about his and Qi Zhifan\u2019s matter.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Six Hot, you\u2019re not attempting something, right?\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Yes, want to make friends with you\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010If you help me to get my brother, then we\u2019re friends\u3011</p><br/><p>So, Wei Han told him some of the good things Qi Zhifan did for him before, and his present cold attitude toward him.</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Well, I get the general idea. I need to teach you a move: \u201ccounter-playing hard to get\u201d\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, this \u201cSix Hot\u201d in the end, where was he divine ah!</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be someone he knew, right? However, among the people he knew, there wasn\u2019t this kind of mental case who didn\u2019t take his medicine.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Six Hot, are you sure you\u2019re not pitting me?\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Trust me\u3011</p><br/><p>With two simple and clear words, it could be seen that the other party was quite confident. Wei Han was startled and thought to try it first and see.</p><br/><p>For several consecutive days, Wei Han started to ignore Qi Zhifan\u2026</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>He didn\u2019t take the initiative to visit him, didn\u2019t make things and bring them to him, and also no longer tried to contact him. When the two went home to visit their parents, Wei Han only simply greeted him with two sentences. Qi Zhifan specially went to police station to see him, but he was too busy to come out and told him to come again another day; but when Qi Zhifan came back another day, he hadn\u2019t finish a sentence yet when Wei Han was busy again.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan went to his apartment to look for him, but somehow, the one he saw every time was Jiang Chengrui. Wei Han was always on duty, and often slept at the bureau.</p><br/><p>After chasing his own family\u2019s fool brother for so long, things were originally in Qi Zhifan\u2019s control. Now, the rhythm was obviously wrong. Qi Zhifan became a little restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, what\u2019s the matter with you? These days, you\u30fc\u201d This day, Qi Zhifan called again. A complete sentence hadn\u2019t finished, when he was interrupted by Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, little brother, I\u2019m busy now. There are so many things to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan knitted his brows. \u201cWei Han, didn\u2019t you say you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I used to like before, but it stops at this point. I don\u2019t feel like pestering you again. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>This call ended, and Qi Zhifan was severely shocked.</p><br/><p>Later, when Pei Yuyang came to find Qi Zhifan, the rather depressed Qi Zhifan was looking at the sexy pink undies and missing its owner.</p><br/><p>When Pei Yuyang saw this dazzling hot pink, he was immediately shocked. \u201cThis\u2026this this this wouldn\u2019t be the one that Wei Han forgot in the car when we came back from the gay bar that year, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t lift his head, and lightly \u201cMm\u201d a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust be, really awesome! Ah Fan, could it be that you never gave it back to him?\u201d Pei Yuyang\u2019s face was full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan continued to \u201cMm\u201d a sound.</p><br/><p>This time, Pei Yuyang was happy and, pointing to Qi Zhifan, smirked, \u201cHeh, Ah Fan, knowing you for so many years, I didn\u2019t expect you also have this kind of hobby! I really envy you ah. I also really want Curlie\u2019s underwear. If I had it, I\u2019d have no regrets in this life ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan coldly jeered, \u201cTch, you have such little ambition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmbition can\u2019t be eaten. I really want to eat Curlie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You haven\u2019t eaten him yet?\u201d Qi Zhifan finally raised his eyes, inexplicably a little happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, I\u2019m teasing you. This young master has already enjoyed it once. Poor Ah Fan, you haven\u2019t tasted your brother yet? Hahaha, I really feel bad for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to play \u201chard to get\u201d before? Now, it\u2019s fallen flat on its face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can scram!\u201d</p><br/><p>During this time of deliberately snubbing Qi Zhifan, according to \u201cSix Hot\u201d guidance, Wei Han temporarily put his emotional issues aside and made a lot of effort on himself. In addition to the morning run and physical exercises he did every morning, Wei Han also often read books. Not only did he read books that he\u2019s interested in, but he also began to touch on aspects of business studies that he\u2019d never been involved in before. When he had nothing to do, he\u2019d also listen to classical piano music.</p><br/><p>In terms of work, Wei Han had always been diligent, taking turns to be on duty almost every day: helping to sort out cases, going out to resolve disputes, doing nighttime patrols, and so on. Even if Sergeant Lu sometimes scolded him very fiercely, but he\u2019s never annoyed. While living in the apartment with Jiang Chengrui, he also taught him how to make simple home-cooked meals.</p><br/><p>Because of this pit father\u2019s hair and the numerous jokes about it, Wei Han also used a lot of ways to make it grow faster.</p><br/><p>In addition to adding supplemental proteins and vitamins to the things he ate, he also applied ginger water to his hair. He tried various folk remedies such as mixing orange juice and beer to wash his hair. Everyday, morning and evening, he massaged his scalp, and also persisted in frequently washing his hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, it\u2019s really not easy ah, your hair has finally grown out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui still remembered that when his little brother, Little Yi, followed Pei Yuyang and came to the apartment for the first time, the naughty kid kept circling around Wei Han, incessantly teasing. He\u2019d joked about how Wei Han had \u201calready seen through the world of mortals and left home to become a monk\u201d. Who knew that now, after Wei Han was tormented all day long, he\u2019d finally achieve some results.</p><br/><p>Although his hair hadn\u2019t grown much yet, but at least at first glance, it didn\u2019t look like a bald head.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Jiang Chengrui also discovered that Wei Han\u2019s facial contours became clearer, the black and bright eyes seemed to have a special spirit, his taste in clothes was better, and his entire temperament was elevated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Han nodded. \u201cRight, Pei Yuyang always come over. Since you\u2019ve already done that\u2026<i>cough, </i>and he asks you every time to come back to live with him, why are you unwilling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I go with him, then what about you?\u201d Jiang Chengrui asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019d be fine even alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui shook his head and immediately looked miserable. \u201cAi, Silly Han, you don\u2019t understand. If my sister knew that I lived with a man, she\u2019d definitely beat me to death!\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, then that matter\u2026how long are you planning to hide it from your sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I also don\u2019t know. Thinking about it now, at that time, my brain must have been momentarily heated up, so I accepted that pervert.\u201d When he finished, he patted his own forehead.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be that it wasn\u2019t because of love? If Foolish Man-Sheep heard this, it\u2019s estimated that he\u2019d cry to death ah.</p><br/><p>This day, Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao had a meal together.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, is it real or fake? Little Yao, are you okay?\u201d Wei Han asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao said that the day before yesterday, he\u2019d followed one of the marketing major seniors to talk about a business. He was thinking about studying and accumulating work experience, but was fancied by a pervert boss, and was also deceived into going to a hotel, almost losing his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and the heart that was raised to his throat just fell down. To be honest, Little Yao\u2019s delicate appearance was really dangerous. He hoped that Chu Chuanyao could be enlightened a bit earlier and find a reliable man to take care of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I was really scared to death at the time. Fortunately, I was rescued by a tall gentleman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTall? How tall?\u201d Wei Han was curious.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao slightly closed his eyes and recalled, \u201cWell, he looked very calm and cool-headed. His height was absolutely almost 1.9-meter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDang, really tall enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, has a man slept with you?\u201d Suddenly, Chu Chuanyao changed the topic. Recently, seeing Wei Han seemed to be trying to change himself, he figured it must be for someone he likes.</p><br/><p>Slept with him? These words made Wei Han shake when he heard them. He forced a smile and said, \u201cUh, for the time being, not yet. But Little Yao, you\u2019ve got it wrong. I\u2019m on top, so you should ask if I had slept with someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao blanked for a moment, \u201c\u2026Oh, then Big Brother Wei, have you slept with someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the time being, not yet\u2026\u201d Wei Han told it as it was, a little embarrassed. But suddenly, he confidently said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll soon sleep with someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>That night, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui received orders from their superiors for another important task. They had to go with Sergeant Lu to arrest several local officials suspected of embezzlement and bribery.</p><br/><p>In the bustling Southern District, there was a street filled with bars, as well as many night clubs and private clubs. In this indulgent place, wealthy big bosses and some celebrities often came to amuse themselves.</p><br/><p>The private rooms had a dark atmosphere that couldn\u2019t be disturbed by people. On the sofa, several men and women were intertwined, the ambiguous and decadent flavor assaulting the senses.</p><br/><p>After Jiang Chengrui and Sergeant Lu rushed in, Wei Han originally also wanted to follow them and rush in, but the phone inopportunely rang out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled. He\u2019d been too negligent before and actually forgotten to turn it off. When he was about to turn it off, he found out that the call was from \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d.</p><br/><p>This was the middle of the night. Why would Qi Zhifan call? Could there be something urgent?</p><br/><p>Wei Han hesitated for a few seconds, then still answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei\u2026Wei Han, I\u2026I feel so uncomfortable\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice was disjointed, quite powerless, and really scared Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Odd Trouble, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a coincidence! Odd Trouble was in a hotel nearby. Why did he come to this nightclub? It wouldn\u2019t be because he\u2019d been ignoring him lately, so he came here to seek pleasure, right?</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little angry, but was still more worried. He rushed to the hotel where Qi Zhifan was located.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble! Open up the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shouted and anxiously while pounding <i>\u201cthud thud thud</i>\u201d on the door. As soon as the door opened, his whole body powerless, Qi Zhifan fell on Wei Han\u2019s body. Wei Han hurried to support him, only then realizing that Qi Zhifan\u2019s body was unusually hot.</p><br/><p>Supporting Qi Zhifan to the bed, Wei Han touched his face blurred with sweat and strands of hair. \u201cThis reaction\u2026isn\u2019t like being drunk ah? Odd Trouble, you\u2026you wouldn\u2019t have been drugged by someone, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly squinted his eyes and only held Wei Han\u2019s hand tightly: \u201cWei\u2026Wei Han\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the soft and intoxicating lamplight, Wei Han stared blankly at the face in front of him. Qi Zhifan was completely absent of his usual icy and severe indifference, becoming truly \u201cbeautiful\u201d ah, a beauty that could invite crime.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved. If he could endure, then he definitely wasn\u2019t a man!</p><br/><p>Wei Han pressed on Qi Zhifan\u2019s body, slowly undoing his shirt and gently consoled, \u201cOdd Trouble, the first\u2026first time, it may hurt a bit, but I\u2019ll be gentler.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice hadn\u2019t fallen when in a flash, Qi Zhifan suddenly opened a pair of incomparably deep eyes.</p><hr/><br/><p><strong>T/N:</strong><span>So I have a confession to make\u2026remember Chapter 26?

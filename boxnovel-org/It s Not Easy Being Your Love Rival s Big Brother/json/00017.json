His heart was quite tangled, wondering whether to help Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Still better not to wade in the muddy waters. Wei Han silently went in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>First of all, Qi Zhifan was his love rival in his past life. Even if he was his little brother now, but he also fiercely threatened him all day long. Secondly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s skills were also not bad and he\u2019d be difficult to deal with in a fight. He won\u2019t be easily bullied.</p><br/><p>However, the group was more than a few people, and it seemed like there were two groups of people, in the front and the rear. Moreover, it would definitely be a battle of attrition. This was unfair for him; he still has low blood sugar, right? What if he was fighting and passed out? What then?</p><br/><p>No matter what, he was still his brother after all, and Wei Han will also be a police officer in the future. He must punish the vicious and rid the evil.</p><br/><p>Thinking like this, Wei Han immediately changed his mind. He called 110 and contacted the police. Then, he rushed to save the person.</p><br/><p>In the alley, the men on the ground had been beaten black and blue, painfully covering their stomachs and crying out, hurt until they couldn\u2019t even crawl.</p><br/><p>The previous batch of ten hooligans had all been taken down by Qi Zhifan. Several of them were tough and stocky and especially capable of taking a beating, actually making him waste a lot of kung fu.</p><br/><p>Wiping the overflowing, fine sweat from his forehead, Qi Zhifan slightly panted a few breaths, when in front him came out several tall and thick, burly guys.</p><br/><p>The brawny man in the lead and the younger brothers saw this scene and knew that Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t be underestimated. One after the other, they took out their sticks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are also people under Qin Tao\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Kid surnamed Qi, you deserve your bad luck, provoking the wrath of our Elder Brother Tao,\u201d the leading brawny man shouted.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan actually snorted disdainfully, \u201cHeh, it seems that for Lu Yan, he did find a lot of people. I advise you to stop wasting your energy. Go back and tell him that if he wants to continue surviving on the streets, don\u2019t ever appear before me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha? Big Brother, this\u2026this kid is too crazy, haha,\u201d the fat younger brother couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s no need to waste words on this pretty boy. Let\u2019s directly take action!\u201d another younger brother said, rushing at Qi Zhifan and aiming at his face with the stick.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Qi Zhifan narrowed his slender eyes. Once he saw the other person\u2019s movement, he kicked at the other with an electric-like movement, and all of a sudden, sent the stick in the younger brother\u2019s hand flying. The scared younger brother\u2019s face was deathly pale, his swollen hand trembling.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the leading brawny man\u2019s face grew livid: \u201cHis mother! Follow me. We\u2019ll go together!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s difficult for two fists to resist four hands. Qi Zhifan had already consumed a lot of physical strength before, and also knew that his situation now was unfavorable. It would indeed be a little difficult for him to deal with several big, stick-bearing men with only his bare hands alone.</p><br/><p>In a moment of inattention, Qi Zhifan\u2019s right leg was suddenly hit. He stumbled, half-kneeling on the ground, sweat dripping down his cheek. The situation was far from good. His keen, bitingly cold pupils swept around to find a breakthrough and suddenly caught sight of a figure.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and stop! I called the police. The police are coming soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gangsters were shocked and continuously cursed. They seemed to hear the sirens of the police cars in the distance, so they dragged their fallen brethren on the ground and fled in a flurry. Before leaving, the leading brawny man fiercely glared at Wei Han, showing that he\u2019d already deeply remembered him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but rush up to lift Qi Zhifan. Seeing him sweating so much, Wei Han felt in his pocket and pulled out a lollipop. \u201cFortunately I have this. Do you want to eat it?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s face immediately darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it seems like you don\u2019t need it for the time being,\u201d Wei Han stuck out his tongue and silently took it back.</p><br/><p>Later, the police came, and the two went to the police station to give some statements.</p><br/><p>Wei Han roughly knew that this matter was related to Lu Yan. It was estimated that after Lu Yan was dumped, his cousin couldn\u2019t stand by and watch, so came to take revenge on Qi Zhifan. Only, he hadn\u2019t expect that the docile-tempered Lu Yan would have a cousin who was part of the underworld.</p><br/><p>Out of the police station, Wei Han was still thinking about this matter and wasn\u2019t looking at the road. There were steps in front of him, but as a result of not paying attention, he put his foot down and almost fell headfirst down the steps. Luckily, Qi Zhifan held him in time, and the two people rolled down the steps.</p><br/><p>Because Wei Han was completely protected by Qi Zhifan, nothing big happened from the fall. But Qi Zhifan, who directly acted as the meat shield, not mentioning his back was hit by the chrome, but his leg that was hit before was also injured again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry ah, you\u2026are you okay? Seeing Qi Zhifan\u2019s knitted brows and bitten lips, Wei Han panicked again. \u201cQi Zhifan, can you walk? Do you want me to carry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard these words and saw Wei Han\u2019s tense expression, a thread of delight suddenly rose up from the bottom of Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart. He nodded, \u201cGood, you carry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han blanked for three seconds. Thinking of Qi Zhifan\u2019s 1.8-meter height, he inexplicably felt at a loss.</p><br/><p>After carrying Qi Zhifan for a while, Wei Han began to pant. Unfortunately at this time, dark clouds covered the sky and raindrops fell, soon becoming a torrential downpour.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Wei Han had to put Qi Zhifan down first. Qi Zhifan, who hadn\u2019t enjoyed enough, was a bit unhappy. \u201cYou\u2019re putting me down and not caring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as heartless as you are,\u201d Wei Han said, taking off his coat and walking over to cover Qi Zhifan\u2019s head, \u201cGreat young master, without an umbrella, just use my clothes to cover on top for awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, he didn\u2019t pay attention to the surprised look on Qi Zhifan\u2019s face and proceeded to resign himself to squatting down, ready to carry Qi Zhifan on his back again.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Silent for a moment, Qi Zhifan restrained his complex emotions and instead, returned the coat to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stupefied and hadn\u2019t responded yet when Qi Zhifan caught him in his arms. He also took off his coat and draped it over both of their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, hey, what about the most basic trust between people!</p><br/><p>The rain came down more and more, and people hurried on the road. Hit by the wind that were mixed with cold raindrops, their faces were chilled to the bone. Qi Zhifan has never liked the rainy weather, but today was an exception. He unknowingly embraced Wei Han in his arms, and inexplicably thought to stick closer to him.</p><br/><p>And the surrounded Wei Han never thought that he would run in the rain with Qi Zhifan. The peculiar feeling in his heart grew. Sometimes, Odd Trouble also wasn\u2019t that troublesome.</p><br/><p>The two returned home. Because the tall Qi Zhifan had protected Wei Han all the way, so the shirt on his body was almost soaked through. Without saying anything further, he directly took off his wet shirt and took a towel to wipe his face and hair.</p><br/><p>Everyone has a love of beauty in their hearts. The naked upper body of Qi Zhifan was a beautiful scenery that people couldn\u2019t ignore. Wei Han\u2019s sight involuntary moved past. The muscles on Qi Zhifan\u2019s body were just perfect: typically wearing clothes were prominently lean, and undressed were well-defined. The pants below were also soaked by the rain. They were particularly close-fitting, sketching out his long legs and fine buttocks, as well as\u2026a certain, most conspicuously protruding part.</p><br/><p>Wei Han swallowed his saliva, and seeing it, had a bit of envy and hate.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, seeing Wei Han staring blankly without moving all along, threw a clean towel over his head. \u201cWhat are you stupidly blanking out for? Take a shower first, otherwise, I won\u2019t care if you catch a cold or a fever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han simply rubbed his hair twice. \u201cNo, this afternoon wasted too much time. I can\u2019t compare with you, this study god. Tomorrow morning is the exams, so I\u2019ll read the books first and then wash up at night.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Words finished, Wei Han went into his room.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, whose good intentions were unappreciated, looked distracted for a moment, a bit upset in his heart. Then, he turned around and went into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>The next morning, in S Uni\u2019s main campus school building, Wei Han was busy writing in the exam room.</p><br/><p>However, when the test paper was only half-written, he began to feel dizzy and saw that the words on the paper appeared to be overlapping. He tightly bit his lower lip, the pain causing him to wake up slightly. Wei Han continued to persist in answering the questions.</p><br/><p>In fact, when he just woke up that morning, he felt weak all over. When he brushed his teeth and washed his face, he even sneezed several times. Really, Qi Zhifan\u2019s words had hit the mark: he\u2019d unfortunately caught a cold.</p><br/><p>Out of the exam room, Wei Han\u2019s entire face was already pale, so he just walked a few steps and then fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my mother! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone fainted here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this Wei Han?\u201d \u2026</p><br/><p>The boys and girls around Wei Han were so frightened that they screamed. Hearing the frightened sounds up ahead, Jiang Chengrui immediately pushed to the front. When he saw Wei Han fainted on the ground, he was really taken by surprise: \u201cSilly Han?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crouching down, Jiang Chengrui was prepared to carry Wei Han on his back, but was cut off by a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive him to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know when, Qi Zhifan suddenly appeared. He picked up Wei Han as soon as he came and went towards the hospital. Jiang Chengrui followed.</p><br/><p>Girl A: \u201cFuck, how does Male God Qi know Wei Han in our class?\u201d</p><br/><p>Girl B: \u201cGod\u2026Oh my God! Just now\u2026that was the princess carry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boy A: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Those two unexpectedly have a relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boy B: \u201cYeah, and the friendship doesn\u2019t seem shallow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Girl C: \u201cJust now, Qi Zhifan seemed to have a very tense appearance, then isn\u2019t this love!\u201d</p><br/><p>Girl D: \u201cYes, yes, filled with gay love ah, the grave and stern, handsomest boy <i>gong </i>and the pure and good, ordinary <i>shou</i>, <i>meng </i>to death ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The three people who\u2019d already left, including Qi Zhifan, completely had no idea that at this moment, the other students had exploded and blew up the sky.</p><br/><p>Afternoon, at the school hospital, Wei Han had loss consciousness due to the high fever. Finally, the fever was brought down, and he slowly opening his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, you\u2019re awake ah, you\u2019ve been asleep for a while. Do you feel better now?\u201d Jiang Chengrui was the first to come over. Seeing that Wei Han wanted to get up, he helped him to lean against the headboard.</p><br/><p>Wei Han rubbed his temples, and his mind was finally more clear-headed. \u201cMm, that\u2019s\u2026my head is still a little dizzy. Little Jiang, thank you for sending me over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Jiang Chengrui shook his head and pointed to Qi Zhifan who was standing against the wall. \u201cThe great hero who really carried you here is that one over there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only then that he noticed Qi Zhifan was also in the room. Wei Han was stunned, and somewhat awkwardly said, \u201cQi Zhifan, thank\u2026thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recently, Wei Han found that he always wanted to say \u201cthank you\u201d to Qi Zhifan. Saying it too many times made him a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he walked up and placed a palm on Wei Han\u2019s forehead to measure his temperature. Confirming that there was really not much of a problem, he dropped it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a good rest. I\u2019ll be going first.\u201d Before leaving, Qi Zhifan also poured a glass of water for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui became foolish and stared blankly for a long time. Afterwards, Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t help but sigh feelingly, \u201cSilly Han ah, unexpectedly, Qi Zhifan is quite filial to you, his older brother, unlike my family\u2019s Little Yi, who\u2019s always mischievous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Odd Trouble actually being filial to him? Could it be that, plying him with good food everyday, he had moved his slag brother and finally achieved success?</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d Shao Yi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just transferring back to my original place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han still felt something was wrong. His brain turned at lightning speed and immediately guessed, \u201cIs it because of the last criminal gang case? Although you made a mistake when we were tracking down the fugitives, but it wasn\u2019t all your fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, why don\u2019t Little Jiang and I go together to plead with Leader Lu and let you stay first before discussing it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Shao Yi immediately refused, frankly admitting, \u201cI want to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han was suddenly stunned. Expecting that he would have this reaction, Shao Yi\u2019s tone was solemn as he continued to say, \u201cWei Han, if you never woke up, I probably would have blamed myself for a lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han patted Shao Yi and smiling, said, \u201cAren\u2019t I okay now? Shao Yi, don\u2019t keep blaming yourself. It\u2019s not like you at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I also find that I\u2019ve become stranger and stranger,\u201d Shao Yi couldn\u2019t help laughing at himself. Talking and talking, his mood slowly got out of control. \u201cWei Han, maybe it was because the one hurt was you, you who fell down right before my eyes! Heh, to think that I said I liked you all day long, but in the end, not only did I fail to protect you, but I also dragged you down, making you suffer such a serious injury!\u201d</p><br/><p>The unexpectedly stirred up Shao Yi stood up all of a sudden, really startling Wei Han and the other guests around them. Wei Han stared blankly for a moment and quickly helped Shao Yi to sit down, slowly saying, \u201cSo\u2026Shao Yi, you\u2019ve really thought it through and really want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi\u2019s face had recovered its calmness. \u201cYeah. You don\u2019t have to send me off tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said so much and seeing that Shao Yi\u2019s mind was already made up, Wei Han also no longer tried to force it. He nodded. \u201cWell then, after a while, I\u2019ll find the opportunity to come see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi also nodded. He really needed to go back to C City to calm down his current fluctuating and indefinite feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, during your stay in the hospital, I could see that Qi Zhifan was good to you,\u201d Shao Yi suddenly mentioned Qi Zhifan, \u201cBut if he\u2019s bad to you later on, remember well that there\u2019s still me waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Wei Han heard this, he slightly bowed his head and felt somewhat embarrassed. At that time, Shao Yi suddenly ran to S City and became his colleague and had also said that he was bent by him. Now it seemed like he had the rhythm of being irretrievably bent ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, you will definitely meet someone better later,\u201d Wei Han advised.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shao Yi forced out two laughs and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>After the meal ended, Shao Yi left S City.</p><br/><p>Recently, in the vicinity of Binjiang District in S City, six theft cases occurred within fifteen days. On this day, Sergeant Lu sent Wei Han and two other police officers to investigate yesterday\u2019s burglary and gather some information. They were returning from the victim\u2019s, Madam Zhao, home when they passed a tea house along the way.</p><br/><p>At this time, it was just the time to have afternoon tea. The two police officers blurted out that they were hungry and then pulled Wei Han and went in.</p><br/><p>After ordering the meal, Wei Han was halfway out of the toilet when his eyes inadvertently saw Ou Yizhe washing his hands.</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared blankly. Somehow, he didn\u2019t come forward to greet him, but subconsciously hid behind him, so Ou Yizhe also didn\u2019t discover Wei Han. After tidying up his collar and hair, Ou Yizhe slightly raised the corner of his lips and went over to his seat.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han squeezed the flesh on his cheek and looked at the mirror again. He couldn\u2019t help sighing in heart: ai, compared to Ou Yizhe, this face simply couldn\u2019t be seen: too harmful to the eyes.</p><br/><p>He wondered who Ou Yizhe was eating with. Curious in his heart, Wei Han secretly followed him. Thinking he couldn\u2019t bother the other person, he\u2019d just look at them from a distance. Who knew that with a glance, he\u2019d recognize the man in a light blue shirt sitting opposite to Ou Yizhe!</p><br/><p>He\u2026he was clearly Qi Zhifan!</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s eyes suddenly widened, and for fear of being discovered by the two, he quickly ran out of the tea house.</p><br/><p>Wei Han really wanted to slap himself. How come it\u2019d been so long, but in the critical moment, his frightened shortcoming would come up again ah! He should have walked over and asked him clearly in person, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but recall his conversation with Qi Zhifan in the morning\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, I see that you\u2019ve recently always had a stiff face and also don\u2019t have much appetite. Did you run across some trouble at work?\u201d Wei Han asked, pouring a glass of milk and handing it to Qi Zhifan at the dining table.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan took the glass and lightly said, \u201cYeah, I have a troublesome client, so I\u2019m quite busy and may not be able to accompany you on the weekend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m busy too.\u201d Wei Han waved his hand and smiled, but then he remembered something. \u201cRight, Odd Trouble, my mom, she\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan\u2019s cell phone rang. He hurriedly took a look and his brows creased again. Wei Han immediately shut up, not wanting to disturb Qi Zhifan\u2019s work.</p><br/><p>After a while, Qi Zhifan hung up the phone and hurriedly picked up his coat. Just before he left, he remembered to ask, \u201cJust now, did you have something to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind, it wasn\u2019t something urgent. We can talk about it later when you have the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han felt a little sad now. Why did Qi Zhifan want to keep him in the dark? Was that troublesome client Ou Yizhe?</p><br/><p>Later, Wei Han called the two colleagues in the restaurant and said he\u2019d gone ahead to the bureau to report the case information to Sergeant Lu by himself.</p><br/><p>When it was time to get off work in the evening, Wei Han didn\u2019t really want to go home. Anyway, Qi Zhifan shouldn\u2019t have return yet at this point. The gloomy-hearted Wei Han took a glance and saw that Jiang Chengrui also didn\u2019t show any sign of leaving, silently looking over the information in his hands.</p><br/><p>Wei Han walked over and gently gave Jiang Chengrui a pat. \u201cLittle Jiang, you\u2019re not going home yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was slightly distracted and closed the information on hand, asking in reply, \u201cYou\u2019re also not going back, Silly Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han scratched his head. \u201cIn fact, my mood\u2019s a bit bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, even if Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t say it, Wei Han could also see it. Because Jiang Chengrui was always depressed, Wei Han squeezed out a smile. \u201cLittle Jiang, then why don\u2019t we go drink together, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d Jiang Chengrui readily agreed.</p><br/><p>At the bar, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui had unwittingly already drank more than ten bottles. At this moment, the two of them were softly lying on the counter of the bar, idly chatting.</p><br/><p>The two chatted and chatted. Jiang Chengrui suddenly foolishly laughed and brought up the sadness in his heart, \u201cSilly Han, two days ago, my sister forced me to go on a blind date.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh\u2026what?!\u201d Wei Han heard this and sobered up more than half. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d Jiang Chengrui feebly shook his head. \u201cThis was a matter of sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about you and Pei Yuyang?\u201d Wei Han urged, \u201cSpeaking of him, it seems like it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019d come to find you. Is your sister still so against you guys?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui lowly <em>mm</em> a sound, his eyes filled with dullness. \u201cHe came to our house several times before, but was driven away by my sister and she didn\u2019t let us meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sighed. This really was a headache, and he didn\u2019t know how to help them at the moment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui drank more wine and the things he usually kept shut in his heart all came pouring out. \u201cYesterday, Brother Bohao came to find me. Silly Han, can you guess what he said to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe store manager, him?\u201d Wei Han thought for a moment. Manager Song Bohao had always looked after them, especially Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be concerned about you because he saw you\u2019ve been in a bad state recently. But I couldn\u2019t guess what you specifically talked about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Bohao, he confessed to me that originally, he\u2019d liked me since a long time ago\u2026\u201d Words finished, Jiang Chengrui grabbed a wine bottle and directly poured it down.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter seemed to be beyond his expectations, but also within his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I rejected him. I think that in this life\u2026I should listen to my sister, find\u2026find a girl, marry\u2026marry her and have children\u2026\u201d Jiang Chengrui was dizzy, his cheeks already burned thoroughly red by the wine, but his eyes were still desolate.</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head. \u201cLittle Jiang, you can\u2019t yield like this! It\u2019s up to you to fight for your own happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really\u2026really can fight for it?\u201d Jiang Chengrui foolishly stared at Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han gravely nodded, but he reflected in his heart: he had always encouraged Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang, but he himself sometimes also needed courage to face a lot.</p><br/><p>Soon after, when Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui had already become dead drunk, Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang found them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you fool, actually ran over here to drink again!\u201d Qi Zhifan shouted with an overcast face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han laughed foolishly, \u201cHeheh, Odd Trouble, you came to pick me up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows furrowed deeper. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come find you, were you going to drink yourself to death here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh\u2026\u201d Wei Han giggled and, cupping Qi Zhifan\u2019s face, pursed his lips and kissed him with a s<em>mack</em>.</p><br/><p>In the next second, Qi Zhifan\u2019s temper cooled.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Pei Yuyang supported the boneless Jiang Chengrui. \u201cCurlie, are you awake? Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui slowly opened his eyes and vaguely saw Pei Yuyang. Both hands subconsciously pushed him away. \u201cYou\u2026you go away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d Pei Yuyang embraced Jiang Chengrui instead, burying his head in the hollow of his neck. \u201cCurlie, I\u2019ve decided that in this life, there\u2019s only you. I don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Pei Yuyang drove away with the dizzy Jiang Chengrui. Wei Han vomited on the side of the road, and Qi Zhifan stroked his back for him and then prepared to help him into the car.</p><br/><p>But Wei Han refused to go in, shaking his head. \u201cOdd Trouble, I\u2026I don\u2019t want to take the car. I want you\u2026to carry me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, how could Qi Zhifan agree with this kind of request? He thought to himself that Wei Han was really drunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet in the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a hug!\u201d Wei Han foolishly raised his head and spread his arms wide to Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan blanked, suddenly thinking that the drunk and acting crazy Wei Han was unexpectedly cute.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan was delaying and hadn\u2019t come over to carry him, Wei Han frowned and became a little angry. \u201cYou\u2026you definitely don\u2019t like that I\u2019m fat, don\u2019t like that I\u2019m naive and simply am not worthy of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan wanted to laugh and helplessly, picked up Wei Han in the next second, all of a sudden staging a standard \u2018princess carry\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, listen to me well: even if you\u2019re thirty pounds heavier, I can still carry you!\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

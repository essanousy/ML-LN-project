You know\u2026you know he\u2019d be furious if he knows. Then Wei Han and grandpa: who are you going to choose?\u201d Wu Yunqi asked cautiously, her eyes full of worry.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked distracted for a moment and faintly said, \u201cYou\u2019re still young. You don\u2019t understand this kind of thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t understand!\u201d Wu Yunqi immediately retorted, \u201cI overheard my parents say more than once that uncle didn\u2019t listen to him, so grandpa doesn\u2019t want to see uncle now. If it wasn\u2019t for aunt giving birth to you, then he might not even have any relations with your family even until he dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han outside the door heard this and his face turned pale.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the status of the Qi family\u2019s Old Master Qi in the entire family was high. In the prime of his youth, Qi Hao repeatedly rebelled against his father and didn\u2019t want to inherit his family business, instead choosing to be a police officer. He even insisted on marrying Mother Qi, who had no background. Both father and son were of a stubborn character, so they broke off their relations like this.</p><br/><p>But later, because of the appearance of Qi Zhifan this grandson, the father and son relationship eased slightly, and the other family members dared to come into contact with their family.</p><br/><p>But what about him and Qi Zhifan? He was not only the older brother in name of Qi Zhifan, but they were also two grownup men. He also couldn\u2019t give birth to a great-grandson to invite the Old Master\u2019s fondness.</p><br/><p>With the mention of the Qi family\u2019s Old Master, the topic became increasingly heavy. Qi Zhifan rubbed the space between his brows and then covered the little cousin with the quilt. \u201cWell, Yunqi, it\u2019s already late, you should sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan\u2026\u201d Wu Yunqi whispered. Also seeing Qi Zhifan\u2019s difficulties, she didn\u2019t go on. \u201cWell, good night.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the little cousin left, another three days passed.</p><br/><p>This morning, Qi Zhifan drove Wei Han to the Qi family grand mansion. After retiring, Old Master Qi wanted to live quietly and moved out from the bustling downtown and bought a house in the southwestern scenic area.</p><br/><p>Separated by a black fence, Wei Han kept thinking that once they laid their cards on the table, wouldn\u2019t the elderly Old Master burst into rage ah? And the consequences were a little hard to imagine.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han grabbed the corner of Qi Zhifan\u2019s clothing. \u201cOdd Trouble, my\u2026my head\u2019s a little dizzy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDizzy?\u201d Qi Zhifan was a little speechless. \u201cThen are your eyes also blurred?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately nodded, rubbing his temples and half-squinting his eyes. \u201cMhm, that\u2019s it. I can see overlapping images! So I want to go back and rest. We\u2019ll come back another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, Wei Han wanted to turn his head and body around, but the next second, Qi Zhifan caught him. \u201cHey, to this side. I can take you inside to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo!\u201d Wei Han cried out, hurriedly squatting down with his eyebrows and eyes all scrunching together. \u201cOdd Trouble, my\u2026my stomach hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows shook and he pulled him up again. \u201cRest assured, my grandfather has a doctor. Even if you have more illnesses, he can cure them for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han was silly, his eyes turning around. \u201cOdd Trouble, I\u2019ve gained weight recently. Wait\u2026wait until I\u2019m thinner before we come back ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Wei Han broke free of Qi Zhifan and suddenly ran away.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han\u2019s back, Qi Zhifan who was left behind had a face filled with black lines: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han, this frightened disease must be treated!</p><br/><p>So back home, Qi Zhifan did what he\u2019d said and gave Wei Han proper \u2018treatment\u2019.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Wei Han was overpowered by Qi Zhifan on the sofa. His hands were tied tightly together with his tie and raised high over his head.</p><br/><p>From the hem of his clothes, Qi Zhifan\u2019s big hand lingered on Wei Han\u2019s chest and then he unerringly grabbed the little red dot on his left side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but moan out, blinking his eyes pitifully. \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, hurts\u2026it hurts ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also know it hurts? I think you ran pretty fast this morning.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Han whispered. He also knew he was in the wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you can just say something and that\u2019d do?\u201d Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and sneered. Then once again, he mercilessly pinched that little red dot, the pain causing Wei Han to tremble.</p><br/><p>Then, Qi Zhifan leaned over and slowly bit Wei Han\u2019s earlobe, his neck and collarbone, and at the same time, his hand didn\u2019t stop torturing Wei Han\u2019s left bead while continuing to play with the right one.</p><br/><p>With his hands tied, Wei Han couldn\u2019t push away Qi Zhifan at all. His eyes slowly became red and wet, and he could only twist his body with difficulty.</p><br/><p>In broad daylight, Qi Zhifan had only wanted to punish Wei Han a little bit, but Wei Han\u2019s writhing was too fierce, rubbing here and grinding there, gradually raising Qi Zhifan\u2019s desire.</p><br/><p>Finally letting go of the two little red dots on Wei Han\u2019s chest, Qi Zhifan\u2019s took off Wei Han\u2019s pants.</p><br/><p>The firmly shackled Wei Han couldn\u2019t resist. He could only allow Qi Zhifan to separate his legs, but also let him put his bare legs on his shoulders. At this time, Wei Han\u2019s shameful place below was completely exposed to Qi Zhifan\u2019s fiery sight.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan could clearly see that the little thing in front of Wei Han was also docilely dangling its head, while the hole in the back was slightly open, but also had a hint of luster.</p><br/><p>Actually so wet? Qi Zhifan smiled darkly and reached in with a finger with bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s body immediately arched, and he nervously said, \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2026what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he clearly asking when he already knew? QI Zhifan didn\u2019t bother answering this fool and added another finger, slowly stirring inside. His slender, nimble fingers swiveled, hooked, rubbed and squeezed inside and suddenly, pressed on Wei Han\u2019s most sensitive point.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Nn ahh</i>!\u201d Along with Wei Han\u2019s groan, the essence remaining from last night also slowly spilled out. Qi Zhifan\u2019s fingers drew out, also pulling out the sticky white thread.</p><br/><p>Wei Han ashamed immediately closed his eyes. Who knew, Qi Zhifan put his fingers into his mouth, wanting him to taste this unique flavor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice interrupted the two\u2019s movements. When Mother Wei came in, she happened to see Wei Han and Qi Zhifan on the sofa.</p><br/><p>The air was drawn out and congealed, the three people equally dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Moments later, face full of consternation, Mother Wei immediately turned away to go. But she didn\u2019t walk two steps before her legs suddenly went soft, and she couldn\u2019t even move one step.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Soon, Wei Han hastily dressed and caught up.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei couldn\u2019t help but tightly grasp Wei Han\u2019s arm, voice shaking: \u201cHan\u2026Han-han, it\u2019s me\u2026I saw wrong, right? You\u2026you\u2019re obviously\u2026Fan-fan\u2019s big brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart <i>badump </i>a sound. Wei Han\u2019s palm was seeping with cold sweat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAunt Wei, I like Wei Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan also came over. His earnest and solemn tone didn\u2019t hold the slightest falsehood.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei kept silent for a moment, bit her lower lip and looked at the two with a very complicated gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing-ying, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Dad Qi also appeared at the door. This afternoon, he and Mother Wei had something to do and went out. When they were coming back, they drove through here and on a whim, intended to visit their two sons.</p><br/><p>As soon as she saw the startled Qi Hao, Mother Wei released her lip. There was a fine line of tooth marks on her lip. \u201cBrother Qi, it\u2019s my\u2026my fault. I didn\u2019t teach Han-han, let him and Fan-fan\u2026I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Speech finished, the incomparably ashamed Mother Wei wanted to leave, but Wei Han pulled her and shook his head. \u201cMom, you don\u2019t go. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Mother Wei could react, Wei Han had already lowered his head and ran out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shouted, but Wei Han still didn\u2019t stop, then disappeared.</p><br/><p>Requesting his annual leave, Wei Han bought a ticket and took the train all the way back to his hometown in N City\u2019s countryside.</p><br/><p>Unlike the bustling urban areas, the peaceful little village had beautiful blue skies and white clouds, fresh air, and completely didn\u2019t have the severe air and noise pollution of the city. The year before last, the village committee had paid to have a new road built in the village and it was now completed. The traffic was much more convenient than before.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>There were February orchids in full bloom by the roadside. The first household at the entrance of the village was Wei Han grandmother\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear grandson ah, how come you\u2019re free to come see me?\u201d The old silver-haired woman smiled slightly, the wrinkles on her face curving in a loving arc.</p><br/><p>When Mother Wei married Qi Hao, she also wanted to bring Wei Han\u2019s grandmother to the city. However, the elderly people weren\u2019t used to living in the city. They preferred to enjoy the sun in the country and to chat with the nearby villagers. Previously on the holidays, Qi Zhifan usually went to see his grandfather, and Wei Han would follow Dad Qi and Mother Wei to visit his grandmother in the countryside.</p><br/><p>Wei Han rubbed Grandma Wei\u2019s shoulders and laughed, \u201cGrandma, isn\u2019t it because I miss you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ah\u2026\u201d Grandma Wei looked back and gently flicked Wei Han\u2019s nose. \u201cIs it because you suffered some grievances outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she already had some senile dementia and sometimes her speech would be incoherent, but she was surprisingly sensitive when it came to her grandson Wei Han\u2019s matters.</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head and sighed, \u201cI gave mom more trouble and I\u2019m too ashamed to see her for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Grandma Wei laughed and said, \u201cIt turns out you came to grandma to hide. Han-han, you can hide for a while, but you can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted some quiet for a few days to think over these headaches, but also to build up the courage to face his and Qi Zhifan\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>Two days later, Qi Zhifan came chasing him from afar.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the adults were bent over working in the fields. Occasionally, there were a few older uncles pulling along a cow while blowing on a bamboo flute with their mouths. The melodious tunes flowed uninterrupted from the bamboo flute, making the people who heard it unable to resist smiling.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wei Han had rolled up his trousers and was holding a long bamboo pole to drive the ducks in the field. The ducks were very cooperative, wiggling their butts and waddling forward. Occasionally, there would be a few naughty ones who would stop and look around, but soon, they would be driven back to the flock by Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a fierce voice sounded.</p><br/><p>The ducks suddenly looked like they\u2019d seen a ghost and madly cried <i>quack quack</i>, flying, running, and scuttling away. Anyway, they flew into chaos and completely didn\u2019t listen to Wei Han\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>Momentarily without the time to worry about Qi Zhifan who\u2019d suddenly come out, Wei Han hurriedly shouted, \u201cAh! The ducks are running ah! Odd Trouble, help me catch them quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not seeing each other for one day was like being separated by three autumns, not to mention Qi Zhifan, who hadn\u2019t seen his sweetheart for several days. Now, finally he met Wei Han but this fool\u2026the first thing that he did was asked him to help catch ducks.</p><br/><p>As a result, by the time the ducks were all back in their straw shed, Qi Zhifan was splashed by mud, and his expensive clothes were stained with muck and his body stank with odors. It was quite embarrassing.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had a dark face and was a little depressed. What made him even angrier was that Wei Han was enjoying his misery on the side. \u201cHaha, Young Master Qi really hasn\u2019t done this kind of thing before. You don\u2019t even have a bit of experience. Go, let\u2019s go back and bro will help you wipe it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, he immediately took Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand. Qi Zhifan was startled for a moment, and then also tightly held it back.</p><br/><p>The two went hand-in-hand and walked back to the door of the house. Grandma Wei was resting on a bamboo chair, and she squinted her eyes and cheerfully said, \u201cHan-han, is this your daughter-in-law? Aiyo, this little face looks really beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Qi Zhifan\u2019s face became darker.</p><br/><p>Wei Han <i>pfft</i> laughed out loud. He also knew that his grandma had senile dementia. At this moment, it was estimated that she saw Qi Zhifan\u2019s face and ignored his gender.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, grandma, he\u2019s my beautiful wife.\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

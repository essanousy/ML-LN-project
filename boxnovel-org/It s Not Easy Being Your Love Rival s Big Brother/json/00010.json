No one dared to play on their mobile phones and sleep, let alone skipping class. Basically, everyone was focused on taking notes.</p><br/><p>Almost every major had students who shouted and scolded him behind his back, but when they were before him, three seconds and they were terrified of this abnormal professor. The serious and fierce Professor Ding turned out to be like this. Besides, he was in the same office as the dean. If he wanted to make things difficult for the students, there were really many ways.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a loud sound. Everyone was stunned and raised their heads toward the sound to see Professor Ding had fiercely slammed the textbook over at the third row seat.</p><br/><p>The boy who had been sleeping on the table slowly sat up, his naturally curly, yellow hair very eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately reacted: Eh? This curly, yellow hair, wasn\u2019t he\u2026No wonder he\u2019d looked familiar before. It turned out that he was his classmate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis classmate, if you want to sleep, then just go home and sleep!\u201d Professor Ding, face taut, fiercely ordered.</p><br/><p>Curly Yellow Hair woke up drowsily, casually grabbed his sleep-tousled hair, lazily \u201coh\u201d a sound, and then, he actually grabbed his books and left without turning his head.</p><br/><p>Professor Ding: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Silent for a moment, Professor Ding\u2019s face turned completely overcast. \u201cWhere is the class monitor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d A tall boy stood up in the back row.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me his contact information, and before leaving school tonight, you must make sure he comes to my office. If he doesn\u2019t show up, tell him that he shouldn\u2019t think about coming to my class in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having finished, Professor Ding also left in a rage. Those in high positions were headstrong like this.</p><br/><p>Girl A: \u201cHas personality, I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Girl B: \u201cThat was Jiang Chengrui? He\u2019s too domineering: just said go, and he really went.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boy A: \u201cTch, acting cool for a moment. If he\u2019s really remembered by Ding Baldy, then he\u2019d suffer later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Ding\u2019s head was a bit bald, and everyone called him \u201cDing Baldy\u201d in private.</p><br/><p>Boy B: \u201cYeah, and he sleeps in class everyday. He doesn\u2019t say much to other people, and usually, he\u2019s rarely seen in any school activities. God knows what he does everyday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Girl C: \u201cI feel he\u2019s very busy. Maybe he\u2019s working?\u201d</p><br/><p>Boy C: \u201cJust look at his non-mainstream yellow hair. Can he still do serious things? I can\u2019t say for certain, but I think he\u2019s a hooligan who fights with people everyday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone had something to say, all revolving around the Curly Yellow Hair, Wei Han somewhat couldn\u2019t bear to listen on. \u201cExcuse me, I would like to say something. Classmate Jiang is currently working in the same dessert shop as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t have classes in the afternoon and went to work at the dessert shop.</p><br/><p>After the little matter with Pei Yuyang, although Curly Yellow Hair shouted out his resignation, but in the end, he was persuaded by the gentle male manager to return to the shop. The male manager, Song Bohao, and the Curly Yellow Hair\u2019s relationship didn\u2019t seem to be only just shop manager and shop assistant, but also as if they had a deep friendship from before.</p><br/><p>At four o\u2019clock, the number of guests in the shop was relatively small, and Wei Han was not too busy. At the front desk, he casually flipped through a magazine. Just then, Curly Yellow Hair pushed the door open. His expression was very tired, and he quickly picked a seat, his whole body lying tired on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate Jiang, have you gone to see Professor Ding?\u201d Wei Han walked over and asked concernedly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly there was a big living person in front of him, and Curly Yellow Hair was a bit stupefied. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce myself.\u201d Wei Han embarrassingly smiled, \u201cMy name is Wei Han. I don\u2019t know if you have any impression? I\u2019m in the same class as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? What a coincidence.\u201d Curly Yellow Hair was a little surprised. Seeing Wei Han had a good-natured face, he also raised the corners of his mouth, \u201cMy name is Jiang Chengrui, you can call me \u2018Little Jiang\u2019.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, Professor Ding didn\u2019t make things too difficult for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui somewhat fidgety, grabbed his head and groaned, \u201cIt really was nothing, just scolded by him, then tidied a week\u2019s worth of city criminal cases for him, and went back and forth to move a set of books that were just sent to the department. In short, I heard enough of his mouth cannon and gave him free labor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, I\u2019m obviously busy enough to die. At noon, I would have been here to help take delivery. At 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, I was planning to pick up my brother from school, but all of these are now dashed. Right, I\u2019ll have to talk to you later. I have to go home to cook for my brother. In the evening, I still have to go to the night market to set up a stall, and still have to do two days of express delivery on the weekend\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui used his fingers to list out a series of things to do. Wei Han listened and stared blankly. After half a day, he finally forced out two laughs, \u201cHaha, it seems that Little Jiang, you are really busy. It\u2019s no wonder that you don\u2019t sleep enough every day, and always sleep in class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. Forced by life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to ask further details, when the male manager, Song Bohao appeared. He came up and rubbed Jiang Chengrui\u2019s head, very concernedly asked, \u201cAh Rui, I think you look tired recently. Why don\u2019t I help you to do the express deliveries this weekend, and you rest at home for two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Bohao, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m still in good health. It\u2019s just that I ran into that pervert and got annoyed to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han instantly seized on the word \u201cpervert\u201d, and no need to mention, it was definitely Pei Yuyang with his abnormal mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that man still clinging to you?\u201d Song Bohao\u2019s expression changed, somewhat worried.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was unconcerned and waved his hand. \u201cSince my family\u2019s dog bit his butt last time, after getting several stitches, it\u2019s been quiet for a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That picture was too beautiful, that Wei Han somewhat didn\u2019t dare to imagine.</p><hr/><br/><p>In the evening, because Qi Hao was still working at the police station and Mother Wei went to deliver a dinner of love to Dad Qi, only Wei Han and Qi Zhifan were left at home.</p><br/><p>In the living room, Wei Han was excitedly watching a Hong Kong cop-and-robber show, from time to time waving his fist in excitement. In stark contrast, Qi Zhifan was quietly browsing through the finance magazine.</p><br/><p>Reading for awhile, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyebrows locked deeply. \u201cWei Han, can you be quiet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and was secretly pleased, instead, turning the volume higher: \u201cI\u2019m sorry ah, I get easily excited. Odd Trouble, if you don\u2019t like the noise, you can go alone to your own room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, Qi Zhifan very angrily smiled. This was his home. Of course, where he wanted to stay, he\u2019d stayed, going in and out freely. When would there be restrictions?</p><br/><p>Also, Wei Han had called him \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d more than once. What kind of thing was this?</p><br/><p>During the advertisements, Wei Han went to the toilet. Qi Zhifan also took the opportunity to call Wei Han\u2019s phone. He had to determine one thing.</p><br/><p>The cell phone rang, and Wei Han still in the toilet, shouted loudly, forbidding Qi Zhifan from picking it up. If this was as usual, Qi Zhifan certainly wouldn\u2019t be the least bit interested, but this time was different.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan walked over and picked up Wei Han\u2019s cell phone, seeing three big characters on the screen\u30fcOdd Trouble.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan frowned again. He\u2019d guessed it would be like this. In his newly-bought mobile phone, his fingers pressed quickly and he also gave his older brother a note.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t you know how to respect other people\u2019s privacy?\u201d At this time, Wei Han, who had hurriedly pulled up his pants and came out from the toilet, took his cell phone back in his own hand.</p><br/><p>Then he looked down: Eh? Why was it Odd Trouble calling?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clearly all in the same room, I say, why\u2019d you\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s words didn\u2019t finish because Qi Zhifan raised the phone to his eyes, and he saw the note above his own name\u30fcStomach Cold (<b>wei hanhan</b>). <sup> [1]</sup></p><br/><p>Dang, what the hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople with stomach cold and spleen deficiency often suffer from a series of stomach aches, diarrhea, pale tongue, loss of appetite, fatigue, lack of strength, and other symptoms. What, do I need to explain it in detail?\u201d</p><br/><p>For Qi Zhifan to suddenly show off his knowledge, Wei Han didn\u2019t quite understand, so he became angry. \u201cQi Zhifan, I\u2019m not like you with an ailing body. I\u2019m clearly perfectly all right. Are you cursing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong, I\u2019m kindly reminding you,\u201d Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou overeat when you\u2019re in a mood, and you never mind your diet, too cold or too hot, too sour or too spicy over-stimulating food, all year round ravage your gastrointestinal membrane; and, you always wolf down your food, constantly increasing the burden on your stomach. This way, if you don\u2019t become a dead fatty, sooner or later you would have stomach problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Wei Han became angrier the more he heard, \u201cYou\u2019re cursing me. This person, you\u2019re really odd and godly troublesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally understanding the deep meaning of \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d, Qi Zhifan was very unhappy.</p><br/><p>Coldly looking at Wei Han, Qi Zhifan forcibly held his wrist and pulled him in front. Four eyes connected. Wei Han\u2019s confused little eyes came into contact with these pair of eyes brimming with cold intention, and an unexpected shiver ran from head to foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go! You\u2019re really sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han resisted, trying hard to pry open Qi Zhifan\u2019s big hand, but found that instead, more and more force was applied, and his wrist was gripped until it was red and almost dislocated.</p><br/><p>In a moment of desperation, Wei Han opened his mouth and ruthlessly bit down on Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, suffering pain, let Wei Han escape from his imprisonment. Wei Han took a few steps back and just wanted to hide in his room, but he was caught by Qi Zhifan in the next moment.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan clutched Wei Han\u2019s clothes from behind and dragged him back to the middle of the living room. Wei Han was dragged and stumbled a few steps, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. The anger in his heart burned, and he turned his hand and threw a few punches at Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>The war between the two brothers was imminent.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan reacted very quickly. One after another, he leaned his head and dodged. Face calm and collected, he lifted a foot and kicked, kicking Wei Han to the ground. Then, he didn\u2019t give him any chance to fight back; his whole person sat on Wei Han\u2019s body, firmly suppressing him.</p><br/><p>Sitting on Wei Han\u2019s body, Qi Zhifan condescendingly looked down at him and sneered, \u201cYou still want to be a police officer like this? Heh, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han gritted his teeth, still unwilling in his heart, desperately twisted his body. But after all, Qi Zhifan had the upper hand. His upper body directly pressed down, both hands holding down Wei Han\u2019s arms separately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to have a bit of a misconception of me before. Isn\u2019t it now time to change your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Qi Zhifan\u2019s icicle-like eyes, the already defeated Wei Han a little wanted to cry without tears: fucking unscientific ah, was this the so-called \u201csickly beauty, younger brother\u201d?</p><br/><p>It seemed that he\u2019d thought too much. Although the person didn\u2019t like sports and couldn\u2019t exercise strenuously, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t strong and couldn\u2019t fight people. Thinking about it, Uncle Qi was also a police officer. Qi Zhifan would also be influenced when growing up, and learned a stroke or two.</p><br/><p>Ai, this time was a miscalculation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? Han-han, Fan-fan, what are you playing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Mother Wei who\u2019d just returned home, looked at the weird posture of her two sons on the floor, and became a bit silly.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>1. <b>Stomach Cold: </b> (W\u00e8i h\u00e1n h\u00e1n) has the same intonation as  (W\u00e8i h\u00e1n) but uses different characters. \u2018Stomach cold\u2019 is from traditional Chinese medicine, and what Professor Qi was lecturing on.</li></ul><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Out of curiosity, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui also walked to the window and looked down from the third floor.</p><br/><p>A dark blue Audi was parked by the curb. Pei Yuyang stepped out of the car with his shiny leather shoes. He was dressed in a purple suit, shirt collar freely opened, and the purple earrings on his ears were eye-catching as always.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw that Pei Yuyang came after carefully dressing up, and this new car probably came from his garage. When he opened the trunk, there were actually all kinds of hats inside.</p><br/><p>What the hell was this?</p><br/><p>The hair in front of his forehead moved with the wind. Pei Yuyang\u2019s just perfect features suited his fair face, born handsome, elegant and outstanding. At this moment, hand holding roses, he faced the third floor window and continuously blew kisses.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dang, really one flirtatious, weirdo of a man.</p><br/><p>Little Yi\u2019s face was filled with excitement. \u201cWow, Purple Sheep came to throw his life away again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui saw this and had a burst of goosebumps, angrily cursed, \u201cFuck! This man actually came again, really is \u2018wounds healed, pain forgotten\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, Jiang Chengrui intended to go downstairs to drive Pei Yuyang off again. He silently vowed that this time, he must not be soft-hearted and lenient with his feet again: best would be to kick him flying.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw through Jiang Chengrui\u2019s heart and hurriedly pulled him. \u201cLittle Jiang, calm down. Since Pei Yuyang has been pestering you for so long, it\u2019s reckoned that if you rely on force, you\u2019d only settle it temporarily. In my opinion, it\u2019s better to let him come up, and you sit down and have a proper discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly, I agree! Big brother, you see, Purple Sheep also specially bought you so many hats,\u201d Little Yi also smiled and persuaded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui immediately gave his little brother a cold stare. \u201cI see you\u2019re thinking about the snacks and toys, right? Thinking of letting him come in and give them you? Clearly, I\u2019ve told you: don\u2019t accept anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yi a bit angry: \u201cHmph! Big brother, you\u2019re always like this. The snacks and toys from before, Purple Sheep clearly gave them to me. I accepted them willingly, so they\u2019re my stuff. But you took everything and insisted on returning them to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, although you kept it hidden and didn\u2019t tell me, but I know: you also paid Purple Sheep for the money spent on his hospitalization and shots. Obviously, the person has an awful lot of money and this little bit of money isn\u2019t rare at all, but you\u2019re so stubborn! Everyday you\u2019re busy working, making yourself work to death, but also hurting your body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui shouted, suddenly interrupting his brother\u2019s words, his brows tightly knitted together.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation on the brink of domestic warfare, Wei Han hurriedly blocked in front of Little Yi, protecting him, and amiably placated Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, Little Yi sometimes isn\u2019t sensible, and some things you need to slowly teach him. Don\u2019t be bothered too much by it. Listen to me: let Pei Yuyang come up first. If your and his affairs can be resolved peacefully, wouldn\u2019t it be to everyone\u2019s satisfaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, Pei Yuyang entered the house, face flushed with success. He didn\u2019t know that because of him, he\u2019d almost provoked a fight between the two brothers of the Jiang family.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out that Wei Han, you\u2019re also here. I also thought it strange that Curlie agreed to let me come up today, haha, it seems to be your credit. Thank you so much,\u201d Pei Yuyang leaned closer to Wei Han, patted him and whispered softly in his ear, lightly laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, can you stay a little further away from me? It\u2019s too dangerous to stand together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han forced a smile. Pei Yuyang, this guy coming in was a complete thorn in the sides of the five Chihuahuas. Eager to protect their owner, they seemed ready to attack at any time.</p><br/><p>But Pei Yuyang, even after being bitten once, was still indifferent as before. After saying a few courteous words to Wei Han, he went to stick to Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie, did you see just now? I bought so many hats for you, aren\u2019t you happy?\u2019 Pei Yuyang asked with a huge ripple of laughter.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui\u2019s complexion was obviously very bad: \u201cMr. Pei, I don\u2019t need them. Please take them away.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Pei Yuyang shrugged his shoulders. For Jiang Chengrui to not appreciate his kindness, he\u2019d long been accustomed to it. \u201cAlas, then I can only put it in my family home first, together with your clothes, cars, flowers, and so on. I\u2019ll give them all to you when you come to my house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! You damned pervert, I\u2019m not going back,\u201d Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t help but shout.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang automatically filtered it out. Attracted by the fragrance, he came to the dining table. \u201cEh, are you still eating? It looks very delicious. Do you mind if I join you for lunch?\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner, Jiang Chengrui, was about to oppose, when the peeved Little Yi deliberately expressed a different view from his big brother, \u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind, I warmly welcome you with both hands and feet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uh, it\u2019s not good to be hungry, and the food is getting cold. Let\u2019s finish eating before we start talking again,\u201d Wei Han finally inserted a sentence. Dragged on for so long, his stomach was already starved flat.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t help but hold his forehead. How could things have developed to this?</p><br/><p>At the dining table, Pei Yuyang barely moved his chopsticks, staring at Jiang Chengrui opposite to him the entire time. Wei Han, sitting next to him, was unable to stand the burning eyes and quickly changed positions with Pei Yuyang.</p><br/><p>Once again, Pei Yuyang\u2019s whole body stuck to Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat so close to me,\u201d Jiang Chengrui glanced at Pei Yuyang.</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>OK</em>, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, don\u2019t talk so close to me,\u201d Jiang Chengrui stepped on his foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick food for me,\u201d Jiang Chengrui hit his hand with the chopsticks.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop staring at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<b>This servant<sup> [1]</sup></b> can\u2019t do it,\u201d Pei Yuyang wailed. He took out his cell phone and pleaded, \u201cCurlie, please let me take a photo, okay? This way, I can still look at you when I go back. I want to look at you when I go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Little Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the meal, Wei Han was dazzled blind by these two men, and was very certain now that Pei Yuyang wasn\u2019t just here for his family\u2019s baby pig, but actually liked Jiang Chengrui, okay? And it\u2019s already to the abnormal, idiotic fool stage, this Foolish Man-Sheep, tch tch\u2026</p><br/><p>After clearing up the dishes, Pei Yuyang very attentively helped to wash the dishes with a smiling expression lingering in a pair of eyes. However, because all of his attention was on Jiang Chengrui, Pei Yuyang accidentally broke two bowls, and inevitably ate two of Jiang Chengrui\u2019s fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow in the world will you let me go? I really don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>NO</em>, Curlie, these words aren\u2019t true oh. You\u2019re friends with Wei Han, right? I\u2019m also, so that\u2019s how we\u2019re also friends. How can there not be any association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I become friends with you!\u201d Jiang Chengrui was speechless. Rich people\u2019s brains were different from ordinary people.</p><br/><p>To the side, Wei Han felt a little awkward, always feeling like a big light bulb. In fact, he really wanted to pull Jiang Chengrui aside and tell him that Pei Yuyang fancied him and was obviously pursuing him.</p><br/><p>But Jiang Chengrui looked like a straight man. Wei Han was afraid of provoking him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, it\u2019s been so long, can\u2019t you see that Purple Sheep likes you ah?\u201d Little Yi straightforwardly said.</p><br/><p>The other three people: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d The sound of the door opening broke the awkward atmosphere. The five bouncing and vivacious dogs also immediately shrunk into the corner. Standing at the entrance was a tall, long-haired woman, approximately twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. It was Jiang Chenghui.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis\u2026sister! Why are you suddenly back? You didn\u2019t tell us in advance.\u201d Jiang Chengrui\u2019s face changed, immediately greeted her and hurriedly took the bag from her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Chenghui didn\u2019t speak, but her face was taut. Unlike her two younger brothers, she had a totally indifferent atmosphere, a repelling people from a thousand miles distance look, and seemed difficult to approach.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was completely unable to associate her with the smiling girl in the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Silly Han, can I bother you to leave first? My sister prefers it quiet, so she\u2019s not\u2026too fond of having other outsiders in the house.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Brother Wei Wei, Purple Sheep, you\u2026you guys should go home first today.\u201d Little Yi\u2019s face also showed some difficulties.</p><br/><p>So soon after, Wei Han and <b>Pei Yuyang<sup> [2]</sup></b>, the two outsiders, were \u201cinvited\u201d out of the Jiang home.</p><br/><p>Downstairs, Wei Han looked up at the third floor and was a bit worried. \u201cHey, Pei Yuyang, I feel that their sister seemed very upset. I don\u2019t know whether something would happen to Little Jiang and Little Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang didn\u2019t reply. With a rare serious and solemn expression, he was turning something over in his mind. After a while, he said, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anything. Wei Han, I\u2019ll send you back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After two days, Wei Han called Jiang Chengrui to ask about his situation. About that day\u2019s events, he smiled and said nothing, and just complained that the two days of cramming for the exams were exhausting. Wei Han encouraged him with a few words, telling him that anyway, after the exam tomorrow, he\u2019d be liberated.</p><br/><p>Because of the remarriage, Mother Wei came to the new city, so she quit her original job and planned to be a housewife at home.</p><br/><p>But the big son Wei Han, didn\u2019t know how much more virtuous he was than her, usually not mentioning cooking, but basically all of the housework were done by him. Qi Hao was often not home, and she was even more idle. Fortunately, she recently found a job and helped in a friend\u2019s flower shop.</p><br/><p>This afternoon, it just happened that the lady boss wasn\u2019t in the shop. There weren\u2019t enough staff, and Mother Wei called the two sons of her family over to help sort out the fresh bouquets that had just been delivered.</p><br/><p>Approximately busy for three hours and knowing that they had exams tomorrow, Mother Wei also let them go home first. But Qi Zhifan seemed to have other things to do. He went with Wei Han a way and then changed directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, where are you going? In that direction, I remember that taking the side streets and passing through two, three alleys would be near Chengyu Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded. \u201cI just want to go there to deal with something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard and his eyes lighted. \u201cCan it be, you slag <em>gong</em>, you suddenly repented and plan to get Lu Yan back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I have nothing to do with him.\u201d Qi Zhifan had an indignant expression between his brows. His brother seemed to really care about Lu Yan. Was he really interested in him?</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, just pretend I didn\u2019t say anything. Then godspeed; I won\u2019t send you.\u201d Wei Han waved his hand, actually turning around and walking away first. He was going to buy some food on the way and then take the bus home.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stared at his back for a while and thought about going together. He was planning to buy some egg tarts and cream puffs to bring back and give to his foodie older brother.</p><br/><p>When he came to the corner, Wei Han was suddenly slammed into by a brawny man and couldn\u2019t help but step back a few steps. With an aching shoulder, Wei Han glared around, raising his head to see which guy was walking around without eyes. The result was that with one glance, he was frightened.</p><br/><p>The brawny man was born with a fierce look, and there were also terrible tattoos on his arms. He was followed by five or six rogue hooligans behind him. The group of people, no matter how one looked at it, didn\u2019t look like they came from a good crop. Wei Han naturally shrunk his neck and obediently gave way.</p><br/><p>These people didn\u2019t care about Wei Han at all, discussing matters while walking.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, Brother Tao asked around and this afternoon, that pretty boy will definitely go to Chengyu to handle some affairs. He\u2019d already sent a group of people to wait in the alley long ago,\u201d a tall and thin younger brother said to the brawny man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll immediately block the back. Attacking from front and back, for sure that kid can\u2019t escape,\u201d another fat man gave a sinister laugh.</p><br/><p>The leading brawny man listened and showed a cruel sneer, \u201cHmph, we must give that kid surnamed Qi a small lesson today, dared to bully our Brother Tao\u2019s little cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Surnamed Qi! Wei Han was instantly stupefied in place.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><b>1.

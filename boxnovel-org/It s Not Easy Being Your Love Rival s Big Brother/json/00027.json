Why had he slept together with Odd Trouble again ah?</p><br/><p>Wei Han hurriedly touched his body, fortunately, it wasn\u2019t bare. He turned his waist, it also didn\u2019t hurt. Hurriedly, he ran to the toilet to check his front and back, and also didn\u2019t find anything wrong. Finally, he was relieved.</p><br/><p>Just out of the bathroom, Wei Han lifted his head and saw Qi Zhifan\u2019s silent face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, good morning.\u201d<b></b></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan said coldly. God knows how hard it was for him to endure and hold Wei Han for a night. Although he hadn\u2019t touch Wei Han below, but he\u2019d very happily nibbled above.</p><br/><p>In fact, Wei Han hadn\u2019t escaped unscathed: the slightly swollen lips were Qi Zhifan\u2019s masterpiece.</p><br/><p>While washing his face and brushing his teeth, Wei Han looked in the mirror for a while and said to himself, \u201cAhh? My mouth\u2026strange, did I eat something exciting yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan laughed but didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Every time the final exams came around, the university library practically filled up with students. In addition to the always-studying top students, there were also a pile of cramming learning dregs.</p><br/><p>Wei Han specially went to the Finance Faculty Department of Management Library, originally thinking of running into Chu Chuanyao there. But unexpectedly, he ran into Jiang Chengrui, who was sneaking around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Little Jiang, what are you looking at?\u201d Wei Han was a little puzzled. Jiang Chengrui was obviously not looking at a criminal investigation book.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui tried to cover it up, hiding the two books in his hand behind his back. \u201cNot\u2026not looking at anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him cover it up, perhaps it was something too embarrassing to say. Wei Han also wasn\u2019t interested in prying into other people\u2019s privacy and didn\u2019t continue to pursue.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, I\u2019m sorry about the matter yesterday! I just went to the toilet, when who knew, Qi Zhifan suddenly came out and just took me away. Right, after that, I called you, but you didn\u2019t answer. Then, I sent you a text. Did you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded and pulled Wei Han into the corner, then whispered, \u201cSilly Han, yesterday I\u2026actually didn\u2019t come home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui\u2019s face showed a difficult expression, and hesitatingly said, \u201cI\u2026with that pervert\u2026slept all night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately stared wide-eyed. Shocked, he said, \u201cSlept all night? Sharing the same bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, lower your voice.\u201d Jiang Chengrui hurriedly covered Wei Han\u2019s mouth and nodded helplessly, \u201cYeah, I guess so. Yesterday, that group of people kept pouring drinks for me. I couldn\u2019t drink too much and ended up getting drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck! Could it be so fucking coincidental? Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but think of himself and Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you two\u2026did you do \u2018that\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also not sure. I was drunk, so I wanted to check some books.\u201d Jiang Chengrui scratched his head, and then brought out the books he\u2019d hidden behind his back to show Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared at him. Unexpectedly, they were actually books on homosexuality. Suddenly, his cheeks couldn\u2019t help from drawing out.</p><br/><p>It turned out that Jiang Chengrui, this straight guy, was researching the male-male aspect of knowledge ah. This was definitely the rhythm of getting bent.</p><br/><p>Wei Han patted Jiang Chengrui\u2019s shoulder and earnestly said, \u201cLittle Jiang, if you don\u2019t understand anything in this area, you can directly ask me because I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui frightened, took a step back and interrupted him, \u201cSilly Han! So you like men too? Looking at your appearance, you definitely must be pressed underneath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face pulled once again, \u201c\u2026Little Jiang, I\u2019m a <i>gong</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like it at all. Have you pressed anyone down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was suddenly a little speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t discuss this. Little Jiang, is your waist sore? What about your legs? Behind your butt\u2026uh, does it hurt?\u201d Wei Han asked, deeply concerned.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui shook his head. \u201cWhen I woke up, except for my head being a little dizzy, everything else was normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. It seemed that although Pei Yuyang was quite a perverted, silly man, but he wasn\u2019t really a beast.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, tell me honestly: do you have a man that you like now?\u201d His problem temporarily solved, Jiang Chengrui began to wonder about Wei Han again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Han answered without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, there\u2019s a true love quiz at the back of this book. Let me quiz you on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Han nodded and agreed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui first asked a few common questions about what color the love interest likes, what style of music he listens to, and then what kind of reaction he has when he receives messages, gifts, and so on from the person he liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas he ever acted as \u201chero saves the beauty\u201d for you?\u201d Jiang Chengrui asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wei Han turned his eyes and tried to figure it out for a while. In his past life, he\u2019d done this several times for Chu Chuanyao, but Chu Chuanyao had never done it for him\u2026 In comparison, Qi Zhifan seemed to have \u2018saved\u2019 him many times.</p><br/><p>The first time was when he went to watch an animation movie with Jiang Chengrui and Little Yi, and at that time, Qi Zhifan and Lu Yan hadn\u2019t broken up yet. In the theater toilet, he\u2019d caused a big misunderstanding and was kicked by Jiang Chengrui, who\u2019d thought he was a bad person. In the end, Qi Zhifan carried him to the hospital for the first time.</p><br/><p>And, after the fighting incident near Chengyu College, when he came out of the police station, he almost fell down the steps. At that time, Qi Zhifan acted as his meat shield, and protected him all along.</p><br/><p>Then at the exams, he fainted from a fever, and it was still Qi Zhifan who carried him to the school\u2019s hospital\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018he\u2019 who actually helped me several times,\u201d Wei Han truthfully replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then did you ever experience running home together in the rain?\u201d Jiang Chengrui continued to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han blanked once again. Wasn\u2019t this also together with Qi Zhifan! Because he was drenched in rain the day before, he\u2019d caught a cold and became fevered the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, in the end, was there ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Yes,\u201d Wei Han weakly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever had a romantic candle light dinner together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night, just ate with Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you were drunk, was he the one who sent you home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever quarreled before? To the point of getting physical?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you slept in the same bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>No longer struggling, Wei Han resigned himself to nodding once again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was scared. \u201cAh? Silly Han, then is your innocence still there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it was just simply sleeping,\u201d Wei Han explained in a loud voice, lest Jiang Chengrui misunderstood something.</p><br/><p>He also seemed to have slept with Qi Zhifan twice, but really, nothing happened ah. After all, they were both brothers.</p><br/><p>Also, why did these quiz questions always made him think of Odd Trouble? Shouldn\u2019t it be his Little Yao?</p><br/><p>This rhythm was obviously wrong!</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui touched his chin and revealed an \u2018understood it all\u2019 expression. Finally, he summed it up, \u201cSilly Han, when you find such a good man, congratulations, you can marry him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then one week later, S Uni\u2019s students forged ahead into exam week. After the end of exam week, each major began to let out for vacation.</p><br/><p>With Wei Han\u2019s help, Jiang Chengrui was able to narrowly survive the theoretical exam for the first half of the semester and didn\u2019t flunk. Because of his family\u2019s economic situation and not wanting to let sister Jiang Chenghui work too hard, Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t stay idle. His vacation was lined up with work, with occasional days of rest in between.</p><br/><p>Seeing his favorite person working so hard, Pei Yuyang was so anxious his heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys all hurt thoroughly. Also, he worried till he had a white hair, and wished he could immediately carry Jiang Chengrui home and love him dearly in bed!</p><br/><p>But Jiang Chengrui\u2019s temperament was very stubborn, and the two people didn\u2019t have a true and definitive relationship. Pei Yuyang naturally couldn\u2019t make him change his mind, and was forced to secretly use money to bribe all the people and relations. He called the many bosses Jiang Chengrui worked for, and had them only give Jiang Chengrui easy work with better pay. Also, out of the seven days in the week, he should have four days off.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>On this day, it happened that Jiang Chengrui was free, and then Pei Yuyang invited him to come out. When Jiang Chengrui agreed, Pei Yuyang excitedly hugged his family\u2019s Archie and twirled him around several times until the pig became dizzy before he stopped.</p><br/><p>However, when Pei Yuyang drove to meet Jiang Chengrui, his brows trembled. Jiang Chengrui stood with three other people\u30fcWei Han, Qi Zhifan, and Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Pa-ta</i>! He seemed to hear the sound of his own broken heart, farewell \u201cenjoying the world of only two people\u201d!</p><br/><p>In fact, Jiang Chengrui had a hunch that, as a single man, staying alone with Pei Yuyang was far from good, so he\u2019d pulled Wei Han along. With Young Master Pei inviting them to eat, drink and be merry for free, Wei Han was also very happy, and he called up Chu Chuanyao to play together. It happened that Chu Chuanyao also agreed.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t sit still. Thinking about how he couldn\u2019t stand for Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao to be bound by deep emotions, he also naturally followed.</p><br/><p>A group of five people first climbed the mountain. On the very steep slope, there was slippery moss on the stone. Pei Yuyang originally wanted to pull Jiang Chengrui up, but Jiang Chengrui behind him was lithe as a swallow, and his hands and feet were also agile, so he climbed up in one go. He also forcibly pulled Pei Yuyang up.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stretched out his hand, also wanting to pull up Wei Han who was behind him. However, his hand remained empty for half a day, and he never saw Wei Han move to hold it. Looking back, he realized that Wei Han had ignored him and was entirely focused on Chu Chuanyao, helping Chu Chuanyao to carefully climb up.</p><br/><p>At noon, the five people sat down for a picnic. Most of the food was prepared by Chef Wei Han. There were sandwiches, sushi, salads, ham, smoked fish, salted duck, and so on. Among them were marinated beancurd and homemade kimchi, both of which Chu Chuanyao loved to eat, and were also specially prepared by Wei Han for him alone.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han always close next to Chu Chuanyao with a smile, Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang suddenly understood some things.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stared coldly at Wei Han\u2019s face that was looking at Chu Chuanyao with what resembled first love, and the pent-up frustrations in his chest continued to linger, not scattering.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the open-air hot springs was filled with steam hanging in the air. Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang were together and soaking in the hot springs. It was clearly a moment to enjoy and relax, but Pei Yuyang saw that Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows were deeply locked with a displeased appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Ah Fan, are you unhappy ah? I\u2019m also a bit unhappy. You say, everyone is a man, how good would it be to soak together. But Curlie had to reject me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was somewhat resentful. Next door to them were Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui. Because Chu Chuanyao was a little tired, so he went to the hotel room first to take a nap and didn\u2019t come with them.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shot him a disdainful look. Wasn\u2019t this pervert just thinking of looking at the other person\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>But then he thought of Wei Han\u2019s naked appearance, and he\u2026he really wanted to see it too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Fan, I think Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao walked very close. The two of them\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Pei Yuyang thought of this and intended to ask Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Who knew, the next moment, Qi Zhifan took a towel and with a steady face, stood up and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I haven\u2019t finished yet,\u201d Pei Yuyang said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan waved his hand. \u201cThen you can slowly speak to the air.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side of the partition, Wei Han also came out of the pool. \u201cLittle Jiang, I\u2019ve soaked well. I\u2019m getting out first and going to drink something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui replied, \u201cMm, go ahead. I\u2019ll come out right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wei Han went outside, Qi Zhifan also just directly walked in. His bare upper body made Wei Han simply unable to move his eyes. No matter how many times he saw it, his brother\u2019s figure really made people envious.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked up, and seeing Wei Han, his gloomy mood also somewhat eased. He moved his lips, but hadn\u2019t had time to speak when unexpectedly, Wei Han\u2019s feet suddenly slipped and he rushed straight towards him.</p><br/><p>Fearing Wei Han would fall, Qi Zhifan stepped forward to hold him, but he was still a step late. With a \u201c<i>boom</i>\u201c, Wei Han laid flat on the floor, and the white bath towel that had been around Qi Zhifan\u2019s waist\u2026was also accidentally pulled down by him.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Both of them were enveloped in a terrible and overcast aura.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Wei Han, standing next to Qi Zhifan, tightened his lips and didn\u2019t dare open his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhifan, you\u2019ve made up your mind? You\u2019re choosing him and not wanting this grandfather?\u201d After a long time, Old Master Qi said in a heavy voice, a sharp tip of light flashing through his narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can, I want to ask for grandpa\u2019s consent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! I won\u2019t accept this sort of thing,\u201d Old Master Qi, eyes cold, unhesitatingly said.</p><br/><p>He also knew that as he got older, his ears gradually softened. Maybe if he spent a long time with Wei Han, he could slowly accept this \u2018grandson\u2019. But this absolute didn\u2019t include calmly accepting Wei Han and his most loved Qi Zhifan being together.</p><br/><p>This was simply too preposterous and ridiculous!</p><br/><p>Although his grandpa was already angry, Qi Zhifan was still calm and composed. As if saying something ordinary: \u201cWhether you agree or not, I will marry Wei Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Old Master Qi smiled with extreme anger. \u201cHeh, you and Qi Hao, that reckless youngster, are really worthy of being father and son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi a little regretted that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have loved Qi Zhifan so much at the beginning. He\u2019d always thought that the child was very clever and calm, not like his confused father. Obviously their temperament were completely different, but in their marriages, this major event in their lives, they would be so disobedient to him, insisting on angering him to death!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was silent for a while. As a child, he couldn\u2019t understand his father Qi Hao\u2019s behavior. When his mother had died, he\u2019d even hated Qi Hao for some time. But now, he could deeply understand this kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to be with my beloved.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Old Master Qi saw this, his chest was so smothered it hurt. \u201cZhifan, I will wait for you to regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the voice just fell, Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cSorry, grandpa, you may never see this day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Old Master Qi took a step back and waved them away. Maybe he really was old, but he didn\u2019t say anything like breaking off their relationship in a fit of fury. But he also clearly expressed that if Qi Zhifan had some matters later, he shouldn\u2019t look to anyone from the Qi family for help.</p><br/><p>Without the support of the Qi family, those who\u2019d approached Qi Zhifan because of his identity also gradually came up with various excuses to distance themselves from him and no longer contacted him. It was inevitable that he\u2019d lose more than half of his connections and money, but the present Qi Zhifan was different: he didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>The two people turned and walked to the door. Wei Han suddenly looked back and saw that Old Master Qi was leaning on the sofa without strength, and it\u2019d be a long time before he could be his usual self. He only felt that he seemed to have aged a year, and couldn\u2019t help but feel distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, grandpa.\u201d With too much to apologize for, Wei Han deeply bowed to him.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan pulled Wei Han. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the two people\u2019s ten fingers were tightly clasped, and they slowly moved out of Old Master Qi\u2019s sight, away from the Qi family grand mansion.</p><br/><p>This day, Jiang Chenghui was discharged.</p><br/><p>Not only the Jiang family\u2019s two younger brothers, but Pei Yuyang and Pan Xin, who\u2019d been running over to take care of her for half a month, also came. At the same time, Wei Han also came to help. Qi Zhifan just happened to be free, so he also accompanied him.</p><br/><p>Little Yi watched the three pairs of adults show their blossoming displays of love in front of him, and his entire body felt unwell.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui and the others finished handling the relevant procedures and took her luggage of clothes downstairs. In the ward at this time, only Jiang Chenghui and Pan Xin were left.</p><br/><p>Pan Xin reached out and wanted to help Jiang Chenghui, but she faintly refused, \u201cPan Xin, my body is already well. You don\u2019t need to keep following me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pan Xin shook his head, pondered for a moment, and suddenly said something astonishing, \u201cLittle Hui, I came back this time to marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Chenghui was instantly stunned, her face also couldn\u2019t help but blush, \u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t joke around!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Little Hui, will you marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, there was no hint of a joke in Pan Xin\u2019s black eyes, and his face was filled with sincerity.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui was silly for a bit. Her brain was unable to think for a moment, so she became flustered and escaped from Pan Xin. She rushed to open the door, wanting to run out from this ambiguous and awkward atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door was suddenly opened, and Little Yi, who was stuck to the door eavesdropping, was caught off guard and cried out. He fell into the arms of his brother Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenhui looked up and seeing this, her face turned even redder.</p><br/><p>Outside the ward, in addition to her two younger brothers, Wei Han and the other three were all there. What Pan Xin said inside, they wouldn\u2019t have heard it all?</p><br/><p>Looking at the few people\u2019s startled expression, she didn\u2019t dare continue to think about it and lowered her head and ran out. Soon, Pan Xin also followed and chased after her.</p><br/><p>Two days after Jiang Chenghui left the hospital, Pei Yuyang accompanied Jiang Chengrui to go home and see her.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Chengrui, do as you like. From now on, I don\u2019t want to manage your affairs, and also can\u2019t manage it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui directly indicated her attitude. After so many days of torment\u2014they\u2019d quarreled over it, and she herself had also entered the hospital several times\u2014but still seeing her brother so insistent, she was also tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui interrupted him, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything more. You should take care of your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, she walked into her own room and shut the door firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, I will definitely come visit you and Little Yi often. And, I wish you and Brother Pan Xin happiness!\u201d Jiang Chengrui shouted at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Chenghui in the room didn\u2019t say a word to reject this.</p><br/><p>Letting Jiang Chengrui talk to his sister, Pei Yuyang on the other side was teasing Little Yi and the family\u2019s five dogs, but both didn\u2019t want to provoke the owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Sheep, if my brother runs back home crying later, I won\u2019t spare you ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yi said this and rubbed his fists. The five Chihuahuas around his feet were also staring badly at Pei Yuyang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes. Except in bed, I would hate to let Curlie cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Yi heard this, digested the meaning behind the words, and then wheeled his little fists and shouted in the next second, \u201cSure enough, I still can\u2019t give my brother to you, this kind of unscrupulous person!\u201d</p><br/><p>The small fists beat on his body without hurting, and Pei Yuyang picked up Little Yi, smiled and placated, \u201cBe good. I\u2019ll buy you a lot of snacks and toys. I\u2019ll buy whatever you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Little Yi beamed, \u201cBrother Yuyang, please enjoy my brother as much as you like in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! What are you two talking about? Looking for death!\u201d Jiang Chengrui, who\u2019d just come out from the back room, just happened to hear this and fumed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. We were praising you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Playing innocent, the adult and child said in unison, showing a tacit understanding that they usually didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With nothing left to do in the country, Ou Yizhe booked a ticket back to the United States. The day before leaving, he called Qi Zhifan out and said he had something he wanted to say in person.</p><br/><p>At the door of their home, Wei Han straightened the tie for Qi Zhifan and handed the coat to him.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan paused and suddenly said, \u201cWei Han, if you don\u2019t trust me to see him alone, you can go with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han waved his hand and smiled. \u201cBro\u2019s a busy man. Where would I have so much free time? You just go and come back quickly. I\u2019ll wait for you to come back for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Qi Zhifan responded, and kissed Wei Han before he left. In the days to come, they would certainly trust each other more.</p><br/><p>After arriving at the appointed place, when Ou Yizhe saw Qi Zhifan, the vigor in his face dimmed. The first sentence he said was: \u201cZhifan, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly surprised and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s too late now and you also don\u2019t care, but I still owe you an apology,\u201d eyes lowered, Ou Yizhe continued to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you wanted to say?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked. His voice was tranquil and undisturbed, but the sound held a faint estrangement.</p><br/><p>Sensing this estrangement, Ou Yizhe forced a smile and nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over. Maybe I should thank you instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, perhaps Qi Zhifan should also thank Ou Yizhe. Because he\u2019d missed out on Ou Yizhe, he could meet Wei Han later.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? Zhifan, I hope you and Wei Han can be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, we\u2019ve always been very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Leng Yan sent Ou Yizhe to the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael, I don\u2019t know when I would come back after leaving this time. You\u2019re always welcome to come to America to see me.\u201d Taking the luggage from Leng Yan\u2019s hand, Ou Yizhe patted Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan gently nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe shrugged helplessly at his unfathomable response. The Leng Yan that he knew was still the same as usual. Indeed, this person clearly said surprisingly few words, but he could use words to describe so many moving stories was quite strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Michael, the benefactor you\u2019ve been looking for, did you find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan shook his head with a sense of loss.</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe lightly sighed. Laughing helplessly, he changed the subject. \u201cAi, speaking of that Chu Chuanyao, I can see he\u2019s quite interested in you. Although he looks like me, but he\u2019s a lot purer and simpler than me. You can try to think about it.\u201d Saying this, he hit Leng Yan with his elbow.</p><br/><p>The 1.9-meter Leng Yan remained motionless, still standing stiffly without saying anything in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not young anymore, almost twenty-eight years old. Heheh, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know that you still haven\u2019t even talked about love\u2026\u201d blinking his two eyes, Ou Yizhe whispered these few words into his ear.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a light flashed in Leng Yan\u2019s dark eyes. They became darker, and the thin lips drew tighter: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, even your shy reaction is different from normal people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I should go.\u201d Finally, Ou Yizhe embraced Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, Cyril.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having sent off Ou Yizhe, Leng Yan drove back to the company and involuntarily thought about this issue on the way.</p><br/><p>Actually, when he was reminded by Ou Yizhe, he felt that he really could consider Chu Chuanyao. Anyway, he didn\u2019t hate seeing Chu Chuanyao. Since he\u2019d never met a \u2018love at first sight\u2019 romance, then \u2018familiarity breeds fondness, the thin stream flows long\u2019 was also good.</p><br/><p>Back at the company, after finishing some business, Leng Yan went on his own penguin writer account. A few moments later, a lot of news and alerts jumped out. Ignoring the pile of news from the author group, Leng Yan directly clicked on his editor, Plum Big Ball.</p><br/><p>Plum Big Ball, Ball Brother sitting won\u2019t change his surname, walking won\u2019t change his name, was called such a name. About two years younger than Leng Yan, he used to be a fan and now was his editor.</p><br/><p>Three years ago when Ball Brother had just switched to be an editor and taken over Leng Yan from the lead editor\u2019s hands, his heart was quite excited and he couldn\u2019t sleep all night long. The result was that he found out later that he, this newcomer, was pitted on a road of no return.</p><br/><p>And Ball Brother didn\u2019t know that the note Leng Yan gave him had always been \u2018Stupid Ball\u2019.</p><br/><p>Plum Big Ball\u3010Great Hot, your \u201cLove Rival\u201d is almost over, right? I\u2019ve seen your outline. That, can the ending be\u2026\u3011</p><br/><p>Although he knew that the possibility was minimal, Plum Big Ball still had a glimmer of hope. During these three years, almost every time the end approached, he would come to persuade Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan, who always ignored these requests, suddenly thought of the clever Chu Chuanyao, and quickly replied.</p><br/><p>Hot\u3010will change a bit\u3011</p><br/><p>Plum Big Ball\u3010\u03a3( \u00b0 \u25b3 \u00b0|||)\ufe34I\u2026I didn\u2019t see wrong? No\u2026no way! I have to take screenshots. This is a lifetime event ah!\u3011</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Plum Big Ball, excited as if on drugs, repeatedly used a variety of crazy facial expression to cover the screen. Leng Yan in front of the screen didn\u2019t change his face and silently went offline.</p><br/><p>On the weekend mornings, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, these two husbands always had to stay in bed for a while. Precisely speaking, it was the warmth after the passion.</p><br/><p>From the night before \u2018battling\u2019 until the early hours of the morning, Qi Zhifan began to stir again. Two smooth, naked bodies sticking together, he pressed on Wei Han\u2019s body and licked Wei Han\u2019s sensitive earlobe and neck, while his big palm pinched the round, upturned butt, slender fingers occasionally lingering in the middle seam, teasing.</p><br/><p>Hearing Wei Han couldn\u2019t bear it and let out a groan, Qi Zhifan\u2019s fingers no longer wandered at the entrance and simply penetrated in and stirred. Wait until he\u2019d made Wei Han comfortable, then he\u2019d have to the chance to go in and enjoy this tight and fine ecstasy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han\u2019s phone rang out at this inopportune time.</p><br/><p>Wei Han jumped in fright. Fearing that it was an emergency, he quickly pushed Qi Zhifan away and stretched out his arm to grope for it. As for Qi Zhifan who had his happy occasion interrupted, his face instantly turned black.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw with a look that it was a call from \u2018Chu Chuanyao\u2019. Feeling somewhat strange, he wanted to lean over his body and pick it up. Qi Zhifan was dead-set on pressing against him, insisting on moving closer to listen together.</p><br/><p>Wei Han smiled helplessly. Without any other way, he answered the phone. \u201cHey, Little Yao. This early in the morning, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that end of the phone, Chu Chuanyao was extremely nervous and with a trembling voice: \u201cWei\u2026Big Brother Wei, I\u2026I accidentally slept with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Wei Han suddenly stared with rounded eyes. Still thinking he\u2019d heard wrong: \u201cYou\u2026you say that again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2026a man slept with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was stunned. Digesting the matter for a moment, his thoughts took a turn. \u201cCould it be\u2026Leng Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were Leng Yan, then wouldn\u2019t it be to everyone\u2019s satisfaction? Both of them were perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck! Wei Han was struck a blow again and couldn\u2019t help but rub his eyebrows. \u201cThen who is it ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy\u2026my classmate from university.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night, Chu Chuanyao went to his university class reunion. As a result, he drank too much, got drunk and accidentally rolled into bed with someone else.</p><br/><p>After a three-second silent tribute to Chu Chuanyao\u2019s accidentally lost virginity, Wei Han frowned and said, \u201cLittle Yao, then you don\u2019t like him. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, I actually did chat with him a lot when I was in school. After graduating, I still had some contact. But I didn\u2019t expect that this would happen now. He said that he would take responsibility and then he confessed to me and begged me to date him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han had a look of consternation. \u201cThen did you reject him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Chu Chuanyao weakly said.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So wasn\u2019t this you already deciding on being together already, then notifying me?</p><br/><p>After Wei Han hung up the phone, Qi Zhifan touched his chin and lightly said, \u201cThis is also good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Wei Han blinked his puzzled eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded. \u201cYeah. Anyway, Chu Chuanyao and Leng Yan aren\u2019t well-suited. It\u2019s estimated that he doesn\u2019t even understand anything about love before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, after Wei Han thought about it, Little Yao was really immature on emotional matters. In the beginning, he\u2019d bitterly pressed on with his unrequited love for his female teacher. Later, when he was rescued by Leng Yan once in the hotel, he suddenly told himself that he was moved by Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Wei Han also silently lit a candle for \u201cSix Hot\u201d in his heart.</p><br/><p>Leng Group corporate building, Leng Yan\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>As if having done something wrong, Chu Chuanyao\u2019s head hung down, and he handed Leng Yan his resignation with both hands. Seeing that he hadn\u2019t taken it, Chu Chuanyao gently placed it on the desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Leng, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve always been\u2026in short, I should have caused you so much trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before meeting the person who was genuine to them, the immature people will always have to take a winding road. Chu Chuanyao was also the same.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Since Leng Yan saved him once, he\u2019d been grateful. Later, after seeing Leng Yan, Chu Chuanyao may have developed a deep worship after he\u2019d learned of his identity as the president. But he\u2019d mistaken this feeling for love.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it back,\u201d the always silent Leng Yan finally opened his mouth. He took the resignation and returned it to Chu Chuanyao, faintly saying, \u201cLive well with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you! Mr. Leng, you\u2019re such a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After living for more than twenty years, the he who had always been sent the good person card, every time he was slightly moved a little bit in his mind, the result would be that he hadn\u2019t even held the little hand before he fell down as the cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>With an extremely depressed mood, Leng Yan returned home and then turned on his computer. After sitting for five or six hours, he wrote up the rather lengthy final chapter.</p><br/><p>After setting it to release at twelve midnight, Leng Yan went to sleep. When he woke up the next day, Leng Yan simply swept a glance and the message area under the book was really a mourning, covering several pages of posts. There was even someone who was so angry they posted a 10,000-word commentary entitled \u201cCommemorating Big Hot\u2019s Tenth BE Novel\u201d.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan was slightly stunned a bit. He\u2019d written for five years and unknowingly, had he witnessed ten couples?</p><br/><p>Seeing the friends he knew around him were almost all paired up, and he was still alone, \u201cBig Hot\u201d inside\u2026</p><br/><p>The QQ <i>dididi</i> incessantly.

When are you going to open a new pit?\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot\u3010[auto reply] Hello, I have something at the moment. I will contact you again later\u3011</p><br/><p>After opening the auto reply, Leng Yan was too lazy to manage Plum Big Ball. When he went to the company, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to drive himself so he called his driver.</p><br/><p>Sitting in the car, Leng Yan\u2019s 1.9-meter imposing body was wrapped in a large black coat. Black and profound eyes under pitch-black, sword eyebrows slightly hung down, making people impossible to see through. Although the eyes looked very elegant at first glance, but they gave people a sense of oppression that they didn\u2019t dare to approach.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Leng Yan wore a famous watch on his left wrist, while a small green snake circled his right wrist. He touched the small triangular head with his fingertip, and as a result, the little snake opened its mouth and bit him.</p><br/><p>The driver Little Zhu looked in the rearview mirror and the smile on his lips turned rigid. \u201cBoss, it\u2019s just been a while, it\u2026it\u2019s already bitten you several times today. Aren\u2019t you worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan shook his head. \u201cNo harm. Little Jade seems to be excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcited? Could it be in heat? It shouldn\u2019t be at this time ah!\u201d Little Zhu puzzled.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan didn\u2019t say a word. He also couldn\u2019t figure out why.</p><br/><p>The light turned red and the car stopped. Suddenly, Little Jade jerked up, quickly slithering away from Leng Yan\u2019s wrist. It slightly flicked its tail and laid on the window of the car. It seemed like it was attracted by something outside, arousing the little snake to flicker out its tongue.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan couldn\u2019t help but cast a curious gaze out the window. Next to their car, there was a young man wearing a white T-shirt and riding a bicycle. He was just waiting at the red light.</p><br/><p>The young man had short, black hair and a white clean face with two black eyes. The corner of the eyes were slightly raised, the slight hook hard to resist.</p><br/><p>Soon, the light turned green, and the car slowly started moving. The youth also stepped on his bike. His white T-shirt was swept by the wind, and the smooth and firm lower abdomen was faintly discernible. His long, well-balanced thighs flexed repeatedly with the movements of a treadmill, and also outlined the tight and robust leg lines.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Leng Yan seemed to have received a blow!</p><br/><p>But when he looked again, the youth on the bike had already turned a corner and disappeared from his sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, boss?\u201d The driver Little Zhu suddenly realized Leng Yan\u2019s desolate appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, keep going,\u201d Leng Yan faintly said, touching the equally disappointed Little Jade.</p><br/><p>Life needed to wait. The misses and regrets of the moment were for a better meeting and reunion the next time.</p><br/><p>A week later, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, and Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang, the four of them met up and sat down together on a plane to the United Kingdom to register for marriage there.</p><br/><p>On the plane, also not knowing what \u2018naughty things\u2019 they\u2019d done the night before the departure, but the somewhat tired Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang were already nestled together and had fallen asleep. And behind them, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan\u2019s heads were together as they read the follow up to \u201cLove Rival\u201d on their cell phones.</p><br/><p>The readers hadn\u2019t seemed to guess what \u201cBig Hot\u201d thoughts were, and absolutely hadn\u2019t expected that a week after the sad and regretful ending, he\u2019d go over the other couple in the story in the extra. Reading the story\u2019s development, it seemed like they could look forward to a sweet ending.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, why did you say in that notebook that I was your love rival in your past life?\u201d Suddenly, Qi Zhifan thought of this point that he hadn\u2019t figured out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silly. The sentence he\u2019d written in the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d was a product of his brain fever at that time. He couldn\u2019t explain the matter of his rebirth.</p><br/><p>Wei Han smirked, \u201cHeheh, this is a secret. I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows creased and he immediately tickled Wei Han. \u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Wei Han laughed and twisted his body, trying to avoid Qi Zhifan. \u201cWon\u2019t\u2026won\u2019t say. I\u2026won\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t allow him to hide and immediately pulled Wei Han into his bosom. Sucking his earlobe, he whispered, \u201cNo hurry. Anyway, I have plenty of time to make you slowly say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, you calm down. Don\u2019t disturb other people ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan lips hooked up into a low smile and he blew on Wei Han\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat are you nervous about? I just want to hug you, you\u2019re thinking about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and his ears turned hot, hurriedly covering his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh~ lower your voices a bit. Curlie\u2019s sound asleep,\u201d at this time, Pei Yuyang in the seat in front of them turned around and whispered, \u201cAh Fan, I say, take it easy a bit. You need to take care of your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Pei Yuyang\u2019s excessively indulgent face, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but have a burst of speechlessness. Then, speaking in unison, \u201cTake care of yourself first.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>The author has something to say: </b></p><br/><p>\u2460 All the main text is completed.

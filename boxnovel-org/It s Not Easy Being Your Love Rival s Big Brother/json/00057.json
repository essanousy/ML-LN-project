Here, under the adornment of the moon and stars and accompanied by the cicadas\u2019 song, it was beautiful and tranquil.</p><br/><p>After dinner and a bath, Wei Han and his own \u2018beautiful wife\u2019 were lying in bed.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan had his back to him and seemed to be sulking, Wei Han could only embrace him from behind. \u201cQi Zhifan, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside when Wei Han first came to the family and called his proper name, after he gave him the nickname \u2018Odd Trouble\u2019, Wei Han almost never called Qi Zhifan\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was slightly surprised. On the rare occasion when Wei Han called him seriously, it showed that he\u2019d decided an important matter in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, what were you running from!\u201d Qi Zhifan turned around all of a sudden and pressed down on Wei Han\u2019s body. A profound and penetrating light shot out from his eyes, staring at the man below him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be my brother anymore, so you can only be my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was foolish for a moment and then nodded. \u201cYeah, I swear this is the last time. I will never run away again. I\u2019ve thought it over thoroughly these two days: Qi Zhifan, you are my courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In a split second, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes softened. He didn\u2019t want to admit to Wei Han\u2019s stupid face how touched he was just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, my mom and Uncle Qi, they\u2026they\u2019re alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. After you ran away that day, they also followed and left. Afterwards, they were unwilling to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen does your grandfather know?\u201d Wei Han added.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no movement on my grandpa\u2019s side. I think my dad shouldn\u2019t have told him yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Odd Trouble, then we\u2019ll go back tomorrow.\u201d Finished saying this, Wei Han reached out and touched Qi Zhifan\u2019s two cheeks and slightly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Qi Zhifan rubbed Wei Han\u2019s chin back and forth with his thumb, his eyes flashing with a predatory light. \u201cBut tonight, you must satisfy me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan kissed Wei Han. Smelling the cheap soap on his body, he found that he didn\u2019t hate it. Qi Zhifan\u2019s wet tongue swept over his gums and scraped his sensitive palate. Wei Han felt himself slowly become numb, sweet and comfortable, and let out a low and light moan.</p><br/><p>And their bodies below, the two were incredibly well-fitted together. After Wei Han felt the depths of his body rubbed with friction, the pain and tension retreated and the indescribable fulfillment and happiness slowly rose, gradually becoming accustomed to it.</p><br/><p>The scorching, fierce thing had already burned Wei Han\u2019s body into a sea of fire, and the intense pleasure of the membrane also constantly stimulated his nerves. Wei Han was half-intoxicated, half in pain, looking at Qi Zhifan rushing headlong into his own body.</p><br/><p>The bright moonlight spilled through the gap in the curtains and shone on Qi Zhifan\u2019s bare chest, his sexy abs and straight waistline beckoned the people\u2019s eyes to stare. The sweat slid along Qi Zhifan\u2019s cheeks, shimmering like shattered crystals, added a bit to his charm.</p><br/><p>In a trance, Wei Han sighed, \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, you\u2019re really good-looking ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s sincere praise from the bottom of his heart made the energetically plowing Qi Zhifan stare blankly for a moment. A burst of heat suddenly rushed to his cheeks, and his lips twitched. \u201cTch, you just know it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, you also look super cute when you blush ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Concentrate a bit for me.\u201d Voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Qi Zhifan very sharply increased the speed and strength of the collisions.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Mmh uh</i>!\u201d Wei Han couldn\u2019t help crying out.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t listen to him. His movements were violent, tightly holding Wei Han underneath and tyrannically riding him. Driving into him again and again, Wei Han\u2019s most unbearable place was heavily plundered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Light\u2026lighter ah!\u201d Wei Han pounded on Qi Zhifan, thinking that in his past life and this life, he really was forced under Qi Zhifan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, your grandma is still sleeping next door. You shout so loudly, be careful of being heard,\u201d Qi Zhifan smirked.</p><br/><p>After being reminded by him, Wei Han immediately bit his lower lip and could only use his little eyes to stare resentfully at Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>After that, Qi Zhifan repeatedly penetrated into Wei Han\u2019s interior, penetrating deeply and coming out shallowly, but also used some unbelievable tricky angles to provoke the inside. The sensitive depths were already limp and numb, moist sounds coming from the juncture. Sound after sound were all sweet moans.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, trembling all over, exposed the back of his neck. His feelings moved to the extreme, he couldn\u2019t stop a broken cry from escaping between his teeth. He could no longer suppress the disastrous heat that had amassed in his body.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the time had almost reached Wei Han\u2019s release, Qi Zhifan kissed Wei Han, and then fed him the hot seeds without stint.</p><br/><p>In the second half of the night, Wei Han had no strength at all and could only lie on Qi Zhifan\u2019s chest. The two people\u2019s foreheads were offset, quietly looking at each other for a good while.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han\u2019s eyes flitted a little. \u201cOdd Trouble, let me ask you: why do you like me?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was a little speechless. Sometimes, he really didn\u2019t understand why this fool always had so many stupid questions.</p><br/><p>In fact, he didn\u2019t know how to answer. Thinking back to his and Wei Han\u2019s interactions, Qi Zhifan pulled his lips and casually said, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen all the shameful things in my life. You think I\u2019d let you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t you say something a little romantic at this time? The mouth being too bad was also a kind of disease ah.</p><br/><p>Wei Han leaned over and rubbed the tip of his nose against Qi Zhifan\u2019s, and laughingly said, \u201cOdd Trouble, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Thank you for being willing to like this kind of frightened and foolish me. I will be more courageous for you later on.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking nonsense again. Go to sleep.\u201d Qi Zhifan rubbed Wei Han\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The next day, the two bid farewell to Grandma Wei and returned to S City. First, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan went to the home where they\u2019d originally lived with Dad Qi and Mother Wei, and took the initiative to visit and beg for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>At home, after so many days, Dad Qi and Mother Wei were already a lot calmer. Before when Wei Han had disappeared and gone back to his hometown in the countryside, they were still worried. Only after confirming that he was fine did they not say anything more.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan solemnly faced Dad Qi in the living room, while Wei Han walked into the back room. Mother Wei was in his former room, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>The light in Qi Hao\u2019s eyes sank, and he went straight to the topic: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say more. It\u2019s enough to answer a few of my questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Zhifan nodded. He also had this idea. Anyway, both father and son didn\u2019t like to beat around the bush.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you like men?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, both men and women, but now, I only want Wei Han,\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t waver as he honestly replied.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qi Hao lowered his brows and thought for half a day. The light in his eyes fluctuated several times. At last, they returned to tranquility. \u201cSo no matter what, you want to be with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is indeed what you want, then good\u2026\u201d Qi Hao paused, then asked slowly and cautiously, \u201cI\u2019ll ask you one last question: will you treat Little Han well your entire life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, on Wei Han\u2019s side, he slowly approached Mother Wei who was sitting on the bedside. Mother Wei\u2019s head was lowered, folding Wei Han\u2019s former clothes in her hands and lingering in silence.</p><br/><p>Because Wei Han had moved out for a long time, so in addition to the basic furniture in the room, there weren\u2019t too many sundries. But the inside was still neat and tidy and not covered up with white cloths. It could be seen that Mother Wei would often come in to clean, hoping that her son would occasionally come home to stay, even if it was only for one hurried night.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Wei Han crouched at Mother Wei\u2019s feet and softly called.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei finally looked up at Wei Han. She pressed her lips into a weak smile. \u201cHan-han, it\u2019s already been a whole week. I\u2019ve thought of a lot of things from your childhood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han remained silent and listened to Mother Wei\u2019s narrative.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ah, since your father passed away, you\u2019ve had the habit of not saying anything when you\u2019ve suffered some wrong. Every time, I had to gently coax you before you\u2019d cry and say it, really silly. Now in the blink of an eye, you\u2019re so big, but there\u2019s more secrets hidden in your heart that you\u2019d never say anything to this mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom, I didn\u2019t want to hide it from you, just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei shook her head and didn\u2019t let her son continue. \u201cDon\u2019t say anymore, I understand. Han-han, I also recently thought of your father\u2019s last wish: he told me to respect your choice. So when you wanted to become a chef or a policeman before, I didn\u2019t stop it. Now I think, if you truly feel happy, I also would not\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Wei Han rushed over and tightly hugged her, sobbing, \u201cMom, thank\u2026thank you! Really\u2026really thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei patted Wei Han\u2019s back like she\u2019d coaxed him back when he was child. \u201cI\u2019m your mother, what\u2019s there to thank ah. Actually, thinking from a different angle, letting you and Fan-fan take care of each other, I\u2019m also very relieved. Just Han-han, even if Fan-fan likes men, but I really didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d fall for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After passing through their parents, there was still the Qi family\u2019s Old Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, you don\u2019t need to hurry to take me to meet your grandfather. I want to see him alone first,\u201d Back at their home, Wei Han took the initiative and said this to Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>The light in Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes changed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot afraid?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked again.</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head. His five fingers slowly closed together, and a kind of fervent luster appeared in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve said: you are my courage.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the Qi family grand mansion, Wei Han brought over some small cakes and biscuits that he\u2019d personally made. Standing in front of Old Master Qi, Wei Han was very nervous inside, but his face still maintained a smile.</p><br/><p>After Old Master Qi indifferently swept over Wei Han with a glance, he wasn\u2019t interested in sizing him up again. Although Mother Wei had already married Qi Hao and the two were lawfully husband and wife, but in Old Master Qi\u2019s eyes, except for Qi Zhifan, there simply wasn\u2019t this grandson Wei Han to speak of. He was still far from adequate.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The old steward surnamed Liang by the side seemed a lot more amiable. He poured a cup of tea for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, hello.\u201d Wei Han slightly bowed in courtesy.</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi\u2019s face was expressionless. \u201cWho told you to come? Qi Hao, or Zhifan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one. I wanted to meet you on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was somewhat awkward. Secretly pinching his palm, Wei Han felt that he couldn\u2019t be too dull, so he smiled and said, \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re really so handsome ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Traces of the years were left behind on Old Master Qi\u2019s weather-beaten face, but the silhouette still looked handsome and his voice was like a great bell. Qi Zhifan was more like his mother, but thinking of Uncle Qi\u2019s face, it should have been inherited from Old Master Qi.</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi coldly snorted, only thinking that Wei Han looked quite honest, but seemed like he could be very fawning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat matter do you have?\u201d the Old Master\u2019s attitude was extremely cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, actually\u2026it\u2019s not much. I just wanted to bring a little gift to come visit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Liang, see the visitor out.\u201d Words finished, Old Master Qi turned and left.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was a bit frustrated. Although he\u2019d been mentally prepared, but he didn\u2019t expect that they\u2019d only chatted a couple words when the Old Master no longer wished to speak with him.</p><br/><p>But fortunately, the Old Master didn\u2019t shut him out from the beginning when he\u2019d learned of his identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Wei, finish this cup of tea, then go,\u201d at this time, Butler Liang said slowly. His first impression of Wei Han was still quite good, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to urge him to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Can I call you \u2018Uncle Liang\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Old Master Qi left, Wei Han\u2019s tense nerves relaxed. He looked around the hall and his sight was drawn to a picture in the middle of the wall. The red sun shone on the morning clouds: this was a picture of a sunrise.</p><br/><p>Wei Han unconsciously walked over and praised, \u201cWow! Awesome shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Butler Liang said with a smile, \u201cThis photo was taken by the master when he was young. I\u2019ve been with the master for several decades, and I remember when he was at your age, he really liked photography. He traveled around the world and indeed, photographed a lot of beautiful scenery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young masters and young misses who came back and forth to the house were all arrogant. People like Wei Han who didn\u2019t put on airs were rare. Butler Liang couldn\u2019t help but talk more with him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and immediately nodded. \u201cOh, there was such a thing. Grandpa is so formidable. I didn\u2019t hear Uncle Qi mention it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Butler Liang just smiled and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>At 4 o\u2019clock the next morning, the elderly got up early as usual. It was just that recently, Old Master Qi suddenly had a premonition that something big would happen. He felt a bit uneasy so he slept even less. Thus, the day wasn\u2019t even bright yet when he\u2019d already started doing morning exercises in the yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, good morning!\u201d Suddenly, a voice came over. Old Master Qi thought that it was a bit familiar. When he looked up, he saw Wei Han\u2019s silly face again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi frowned and asked. Why did this kid come back? Can\u2019t he see that he wasn\u2019t welcomed? And how could Butler Liang just let him run to the backyard?</p><br/><p>Ignoring Old Master Qi\u2019s scowl, Wei Han smiled foolishly. \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ll take you up the mountain to see the sunrise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Old Master Qi was stunned. Only then did he notice that Wei Han was wearing a hat, sportswear, and had a camera hanging from his neck.</p><br/><p>The time conditions were limited and Wei Han couldn\u2019t take a tour of the majestic and magnificent famous mountains with his grandfather. However, in S City\u2019s southwestern scenic area, there was a small hill that wasn\u2019t too far by car. From the foot of the hill to the top, without asking for anyone\u2019s help, Wei Han carried Old Master Qi on his back all the way up. Lest they missed the time of sunrise, he didn\u2019t rest several times in the middle.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s frequent actions of panting and wiping away perspiration, Old Master Qi\u2019s profound eyes became more complicated, but he continued to purse his lips, too lazy to say anything.</p><br/><p>When the two reached the top of the hill, the sky gradually began to brighten. They looked at the scenery and the eastern horizon slightly revealed a touch of orange yellow. The sun slowly left the horizon, first exposing a small corner, then gradually, the brightness became more and more dazzling. The rising red sun leapt out, sending out ten thousands golden rays of light in an instant, dispelling the original clouds and gray mist.</p><br/><p>The world seemed to light up all at once. Old Master Qi looked at it in a daze. His old face now basked in a layer of golden light looked radiant and suddenly more youthful.</p><br/><p>As the sky glowed against the rising sun, Wei Han said with face full of sincerity, \u201cGrandpa, I love Qi Zhifan. Please give him to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, he followed with a deep bow.</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

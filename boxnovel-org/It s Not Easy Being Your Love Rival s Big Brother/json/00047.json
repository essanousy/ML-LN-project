Wei Han was pressed on the counter, and as Qi Zhifan entered in and went out, he felt the pain of having his body violently penetrated gradually leveling out, instead, replaced by a increasing pleasant feeling in his mind.</p><br/><p>He turned Wei Han around to face him. At this time, Qi Zhifan particularly liked to observe the exceptionally sexy Wei Han, liked to see his slightly flush red lips, his dazed and hazy little eyes, his forehead drenched in sweat, and the unbidden tears flowing down from the corner of his eyes\u2026Of course, he also liked to hear Wei Han groaning from time to time.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan always liked to withdraw a third out and then mercilessly drive in. During the collision, Wei Han seemed to feel that the world was shaking. He was trembling all the while and could only use his legs to tightly wrap around Qi Zhifan\u2019s waist. The sticky sounds of their bodies were constantly heard where they were joined. The liquid that flowed out slipped down Wei Han\u2019s thighs, and several drops landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan pulled himself completely out of Wei Han\u2019s body. The inside of his body suddenly empty, Wei Han moaned in a trance when he felt this unbearable emptiness. He blinked his eyes and stared at Qi Zhifan, his mouth open with a stupid look. Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and smiled, and the next second, he fully slammed in to the hilt. Buried to the root, it reached the deepest and most sensitive point inside Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d Like a high-voltage current fiercely coursing through his body, Wei Han uninhibited screams rang out, and the white fluid sprayed on Qi Zhifan\u2019s lower abdomen.</p><br/><p>Then, in a flash, something exploded in Wei Han\u2019s mind and it felt like he was floating in the clouds.</p><br/><p>Then, not only did Qi Zhifan\u2019s speed increase, but the intensity also increased unchecked. Every sensitive cell in Wei Han\u2019s body was ruthlessly \u2018taken care of\u2019 by him, and even the most unbearable little bump had been specially serviced. Every time Qi Zhifan pushed in, he targeted that place, hitting it and causing Wei Han to burst into a shaking tremor.</p><br/><p>Stimulated by the peculiar mixture of pain and pleasure, Wei Han sobbed and groaned, unable to restrain his writhing body covered in hickeys. Desperately leaning against his neck, he tremblingly catered to Qi Zhifan\u2019s wanton ride.</p><br/><p>Finally, Wei Han cried out again and was almost played to fainting. Qi Zhifan fiercely kissed him. He moved dozens of times before releasing it all at once in Wei Han\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Finished tossing in the kitchen, Qi Zhifan then held Wei Han and carried him to the bath, and then to the bed\u2026the whole Saturday, Qi Zhifan \u2018ate\u2019 to his satisfaction.</p><br/><p>When Wei Han woke up on Sunday morning, his entire body didn\u2019t have the strength to move. He didn\u2019t even feeling like moving his fingers and only felt soft, as if he\u2019d turned into a puddle. He couldn\u2019t get out of bed at all, and could only lie in bed and be waited on by the Great Beauty Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan held a bowl and scooped a spoonful of rice to Wei Han\u2019s mouth. Wei Han smiled, <em>ahh-hhm</em> and swallowed it. Eating while watching the Great Beauty Qi was really \u2018a feast for the eyes\u2019. His appetite also increased.</p><br/><p>As usual, every time Qi Zhifan this \u2018main culprit\u2019 tossed Wei Han, he would hand-feed him. However, there was a slight deviation today because the food was personally made by him.</p><br/><p>In order to raise a big stomach king, foodie wife, Qi Zhifan was already aware that Wei Han couldn\u2019t be the only who can cook. He himself would also ponder it over and slowly learn.</p><br/><p>A meal of fish and meat finished, Qi Zhifan carefully brought in a bowl of sweet-stewed snow pear in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was foolish for a moment. \u201cOdd Trouble, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill made by me. Try it and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the very beginning when he\u2019d met Wei Han, the first time Qi Zhifan had a little bit of goodwill towards Wei Han was because Wei Han had personally made this to apologize, but had also hand-fed him.</p><br/><p>This bowl of sweet-stewed snow pear reminded Wei Han of the \u2018stupid black history\u2019 that he didn\u2019t want to recall. Suddenly ashamed, he hid and burrowed himself in the blanket, shaking his head in embarrassment, \u201cOdd Trouble, it\u2019s better if you drink it yourself. You have low blood sugar. Drinking this is good for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I will drink it, but you also have to drink it for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan said this and then he took a sip in his mouth and caught Wei Han from the quilt, leaned over and kissed him.</p><br/><p>The two people\u2019s breaths mingled, lips and tongues intertwined, and the sweet taste of sugar swirled in their mouths, sweetness and happiness slowly seeping into their hearts\u2026</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han took advantage of Qi Zhifan going downstairs to cook dinner to lie on the bed and secretly take out the hidden \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d. Taking a pen, he recorded some trivial matters in the record.</p><br/><p>Why was it trivial? Because the original intention of this notebook had completely changed. The part where Wei Han was ready to abuse his love rival and slag brother in front basically wasn\u2019t written. But starting from the last page, it was used to record the \u2018good\u2019 Qi Zhifan had done for him, and he\u2019d already written more than half.</p><br/><p>Now, this was slowly becoming Wei Han\u2019s diary to record his cohabitation with Qi Zhifan: bit by bit, it recorded all of the warmth and sweetness that he\u2019d never dreamed of.</p><br/><p>Wei Han gradually realized that his impression of Qi Zhifan as a picky eater with a cold poisonous tongue, a fear of ghosts, and someone who put money above all else had morphed into a brave man willing to personally cook for him; sometimes a bit of a rogue in his lust and possessiveness; someone whose girlish heart would occasionally come out; and a childish, big vinegar king.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to keep this \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d hidden until one day, when they\u2019re all old and grey, he\u2019d turn it over to Qi Zhifan to read it together. Haha, it would certainly make him jump in fright.</p><br/><p>Time flew and in the blink of an eye, it was also time for Chu Chuanyao to graduate and find a job.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao decided to interview at the Leng Group. He had a professional background in financial management and his professional knowledge was solid. His achievements were excellent in all aspects. He had also interned at two or three companies for a period of time before, so he wanted to work in the sales department. He wasn\u2019t ambitious; at the beginning, he just wanted to be a small employee.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d already passed the first round of interviews previously. Today, it was said that the department manager of the sales department would come to conduct the second round of interviews. If he was successful, he could soon come to work here, so this interview was very important.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was a bit nervous. Thinking that Wei Han had visited the corporate building of the Leng Group several times and was more familiar with it, Chu Chuanyao called him to come over.</p><br/><p>Wei Han happened to have some free time and agreed. Even though he didn\u2019t like Chu Chuanyao with the same feeling of \u2018like\u2019 as in his previous life, but he still had brotherly love for him. Sometimes, he was used to caring for and taking care of Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wore casual clothes since he wasn\u2019t working today. When Chu Chuanyao was interviewing inside, he was waiting outside and silently praying for him.</p><br/><p>But at the same time, he was a bit mystified: why did Little Yao come to the Leng Group? The Leng Group was so awesome, had high wages, and its employee treatment was also excellent. Every year, there was a pile of people trying to squeeze their head in and the competitive pressure was quite large.</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought that Chu Chuanyao shouldn\u2019t be in it for the money, then could it be that\u2026</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>The second before, Wei Han just thought of Leng Yan. The second after, a pair of bright leather shoes appeared before his eyes. Wei Han looked up and saw, fuck incredibly, Leng Yan actually appeared.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han looking strange, Leng Yan slightly narrowed his eyes, looked him up and down, and then pulled out his cellphone and typed out on it\u3010Recently, have you been excessively indulgent?\u3011</p><br/><p>Dang, what was this ah!</p><br/><p>Wei Han face turned red and immediately tucked Leng Yan\u2019s cell phone in his clothes. Hiding it well inside, he wryly smiled and said, \u201cSix Hot, don\u2019t ask me this question when you just open your mouth, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Leng Yan nodded and handed Wei Han a business card. He said faintly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel well, go to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words completed, Leng Yan strode into the interview room.</p><br/><p>Not understanding Leng Yan\u2019s words, Wei Han looked down at the business card in his hand. Written on it\u30fcAnorectal Division, Dr. Li.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Leng Yan walked in, it caused a stir inside. Not only the men and women who came in to interview, but also the department manager of the sales department and the other three interviewers were also surprised. They obviously hadn\u2019t received a notice before that said the president would personally come to the interview.</p><br/><p>With a glance, Leng Yan picked out Chu Chuanyao from among the crowd and beckoned at him. Chu Chuaynyao was flattered and stupefied for a moment before he hurried to trot over and stammered, \u201cLeng\u2026Mr. Leng, you\u2026you\u2019re looking for me?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Leng Yan nodded and turned to the male manager of the sales department: \u201cYou continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, the unclear Chu Chuanyao was brought out by the expressionless Leng Yan, leaving behind the group of stunned other people to wonder what Chu Chuanyao\u2019s background was and if it was a very strong backing.</p><br/><p>Some people with sharp eyes recognized that Chu Chuanyao might have come to find their President Leng once previously.</p><br/><p>In a moment, they came into Leng Yan\u2019s office and he prepared to personally interview Chu Chuanyao while Wei Han and Little Wen stood on the sidelines.</p><br/><p>The secretary, Little Wen, placed Chu Chuanyao\u2019s personal resume and related materials on Leng Yan\u2019s desk. Leng Yan simply flipped through it twice and said casually, \u201cThe cat from last time is still okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao, who was waiting nervously for the first question, was instantly stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was also dumbfounded: Ah hey! Are you serious? This was an interview and not a casual chat.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked glumly at Little Wen and found that Little Wen next to him was calm, seemingly accustomed to their own president\u2019s doing things not according to common sense.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao smiled and nodded, suddenly not nervous at all. \u201cYeah, Little White is very well-behaved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan was expressionless, but there seemed to be a brightness in the depths of the dark eyes. Silent for a moment, he seriously asked the second question, \u201cWhat is your zodiac? Blood type?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d although the questions were strange, Chu Chuanyao still answered honestly, \u201cPisces, Type O.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of questions were these? It should be clearly written on the resume.</p><br/><p>This time, Leng Yan nodded with satisfaction. Seeing this, a hint of a ripple went through Chu Chuanyao\u2019s heart. He seemed to suddenly tense up and slightly squeezed his fingers.</p><br/><p>This little gesture didn\u2019t escape Wei Han\u2019s eyes. He knew that this was Chu Chuanyao\u2019s shy reaction. Combined with his previous speculation, Little Yao toward Leng Yan, was this\u2026the rhythm of his heart being moved?</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Leng, do you have any other questions?\u201d Little Wen reminded. Wei Han thought that this third question, President Leng Yan should ask a question related to sales, a proper question, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you straight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan\u2019s face was indifferent. Not knowing what he was cooking, the other three people completely couldn\u2019t calm down.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao clenched his hands, summoned up the courage and loudly said, \u201cMr. Leng, I\u2026I think I can bend for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Wen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face jerked a bit: fuck, actually just said it out loud like this! Little Yao, could you be more direct?</p><br/><p>So, Leng Yan just asked three bizarre questions and Chu Chuanyao successfully passed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was speechless the entire time. He really didn\u2019t understand what was in \u201cSix Hot\u201d mind. Anyway, it was impossible to understand his inner world with a human brain, haha.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, Mr. Leng and I, do we have some place where we\u2019re especially fitting?\u201d Chu Chuanyao suddenly asked when they got out on the streets.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wei Han thought carefully for a moment, \u201cYour height difference is very <i>meng</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Chuanyao slightly knitted his brows, a bit distressed. \u201cBig Brother Wei, if you want to say I\u2019m short, then just say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan was 1.9-something meters while Chu Chuanyao was 1.7-meter. Wei Han felt that what he said was still quite reasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, you said before that you\u2019d help me chase the person I like. Then can you help me chase Leng Yan now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d only now did Wei Han recall that before, he\u2019d comforted Chu Chuanyao and seemed to have said such words, hoping that a good man who really loved him would appear. Now, Little Yao obviously became bent because of Leng Yan, but how come he felt that it was strange somewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han remembered that Leng Yan once said that every time he fancied someone and had a little bit of goodwill and interest in the target, then that person he fancied would surely find true love a short time later and enter the marriage hall; the two people being happy for the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>And this time, don\u2019t know, maybe Little Yao\u2019s appearance could break Leng Yan\u2019s cannon fodder curse?</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

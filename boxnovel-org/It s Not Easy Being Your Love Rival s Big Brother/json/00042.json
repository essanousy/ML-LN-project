He quickly extended another finger in.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan added in a third one, an incredible numbing sensation suddenly spread inside Wei Han\u2019s narrow and fiery body, like an electric current sending a shock through his brain. \u201c<i>Nn ah</i>\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but cry out, the cry making Qi Zhifan\u2019s lower body immediately have a burst of restlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re this sensitive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan asked, suddenly picking up Wei Han and holding him from the back. Then, he opened his mouth and bit Wei Han\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan spoke, the hot air it brought always inadvertently swept over Wei Han\u2019s neck. Warm and itchy, it made Wei Han subconsciously shrink his neck, unknowingly trying to escape. \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han caught Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand and tried to stop him from continuing. Obviously, below he\u2019d already become incredibly itchy, but above also must suffer torment, he\u2026he really couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done wrong and still dare to bargain! No, this matter isn\u2019t up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished talking, Qi Zhifan licked the outer shell of Wei Han\u2019s ear while letting his finger enter even deeper. He used his fingertips to play with the membrane inside Wei Han. He felt the tightness and trembling and his eyes became stained with the rich colors of sensual desire, becoming dark and bottomless depths, and also becoming increasingly thirsty.</p><br/><p>The sensitive lining of his inner membrane was often hooked by the fingers and turned soft and hot. His heart itched intolerably, and Wei Han panted, cheeks appearing more and more flush. Suddenly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s fingertips poked to the deepest point, and that thing at Wei Han\u2019s front had an immediate reaction.</p><br/><p>Sensing Wei Han\u2019s body stretch taut in an instant, Qi Zhifan smiled. Three fingers clearly still stirring behind, he opened up a new territory and his other hand explored Wei Han\u2019s front, gently holding his slightly raised up little thing.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was caught off guard by a shiver that shook him from head to foot and was a little scared. \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComfortable? I will make you even more comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and smirked. His palm with slight calluses gently caressed and stroked the little thing, tormenting Wei Han with growing relish. Now, it was up and down, and now he used his fingertips to softly fondle the meat\u2019s tender tip. After playing for a good while, Qi Zhifan\u2019s slender fingers curled, heavily stroking the little thing.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>nn ah</i>!\u201d Immediately, Wei Han\u2019s shattered groan reached his ears. This poor little thing also dripped out several drops of fluid.</p><br/><p>In a daze, Wei Han suddenly thought of the meal he had with Leng Yan this afternoon. Before he left, Leng Yan\u2019s last words were:\u3010Stomach Hot, talk with me more and your life will become very sexual\u3011</p><br/><p>Dang, Six Hot really was a prophecy emperor ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, we\u2019ll take a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan bit Wei Han\u2019s ear and said in an extremely low-pitched and husky voice. After he finished speaking, he lifted him to his waist and walked toward the bathroom.</p><br/><p>The hot water rushed out and the dense steam rose, creating a charming and gentle atmosphere inside.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, the two men soaked together in the bathtub filled with warm water. When the two completely naked men sat inside, a large amount of water was suddenly displaced and spilled out. In the small space, their bodies were even more inseparable and closely fitted together.</p><br/><p>Breath intertwining, Qi Zhifan gathered up Wei Han and, with the tip of his tongue, he wantonly hooked and tangled with Wei Han\u2019s tongue. And Wei Han spread open wide both his legs and wrapped them around Qi Zhifan\u2019s waist, where Qi Zhifan fiercely slammed in and out of him. A burst of contractions caused a wave of trembling pleasure.</p><br/><p>At the innermost ecstasy, Qi Zhifan clearly felt Wei Han wrapped around him, taking him in and sending him out, but also stirring, he suddenly lost his self-control, and he even more rapidly and powerfully rammed in, one after the other, all aimed at that place. The sound of water overflowing unchecked and Wei Han\u2019s cries sounded out over and over again.</p><br/><p>When happiness finally crossed the bottom line, Wei Han strongly arched his back into Qi Zhifan and achieved his release. Soon after, Qi Zhifan also truly was unable to endure and buried himself in the deepest part, completely indulging himself to completion.</p><br/><p>Collapsing in Qi Zhifan\u2019s arms, Wei Han reached out and gently wiped the beads of sweat on Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead and weakly said, \u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t be angry, I\u2026I only like you.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly stunned. Clearly very happy in his heart, but he still pursed his lips and said, \u201cNext time, I won\u2019t let you off so easily. Also, can you change how you call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, Qi Zhifan was a bit depressed. Wei Han this fool kept saying \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d over and over all day. When other people heard this, they\u2019d think he\u2019s really troublesome.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silly. \u201cAi, do you think it\u2019s not intimate enough? Then \u2018Trouble\u2019 is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan immediately retorted. They were already in this kind of relationship. How could this fool be so slow!</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me \u2018hubby\u2019.\u201d (T/N:  l\u01ceog\u014dng)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Wei Han mouth hung open and he shook his head like a rattle. \u201cDon\u2019t want to. This\u2026this is so shameful. I can\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also called shameful? The ones that Wei Han shouted out in bed were several times more shameful than this one.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot willing to call?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han blinked his eyes and nodded.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes flashed with a fierce tip, and he turned him over and pressed down on Wei Han\u2019s body. Since Wei Han was unwilling, then he could only fuck Wei Han until he obediently called him.</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han had to take sick leave and laid in bed for a day.</p><br/><p>After a few days, Wei Han took off from the office and returned home to see Qi Zhifan sitting alone on the sofa with a sullen face and a pile of five or six <em>danmei</em> novels at hand. Glancing from afar, as soon as he saw that the author was the simple and domineering \u201cHot\u201d word, Wei Han\u2019s heart suddenly fell into an ice hole.</p><br/><p>Dang, this\u2026what\u2019s going on here?</p><br/><p>After Wei Han thought about it, he hadn\u2019t met Leng Yan alone in the past week. At most, he had sent QQ and WeChat messages and absolutely hadn\u2019t done anything.</p><br/><p>With a nervous mood, Wei Han walked over and put on a rather pure, good and harmless smile. \u201cOdd Trouble, what do you want to eat? I\u2019ll make it for you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to meet Leng Yan,\u201d Qi Zhifan directly and coldly said this sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Wait, Odd Trouble, I swear I really didn\u2019t see him again,\u201d Wei Han panicked.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan picked up a book and threw it to Wei Han. \u201cWhat the hell are these fucking endings? I\u2019ll have him write a new ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>By December, the weather was getting colder and colder. The snow fell all night yesterday, and in the morning when people woke up, they opened the curtains and it was a world adorned in silver and wrapped in white.</p><br/><p>Today, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan were free. It was inconvenient to travel in the snow, and the two of them simply walked hand-in-hand together to Pei Yuyang\u2019s home nearby to find Pei Yuyang and Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>In the season when most animals were hibernating, Pei Yuyang family\u2019s Archie also lost his vitality and became lazy. So the pig that was usually very clingy to Jiang Chengrui, would now only be willing to hide in the house, too lazy to move.</p><br/><p>There was a small square in the center of the villa\u2019s courtyard, which also has a thick layer of snow. The energetic Jiang Chengrui stooped down and packed a small snowball. Then he smashed it straight towards Pei Yuyang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Wei Han laughed \u201chaha\u201d loudly, and suddenly, his playful heart also came bounding up. \u201cLittle Jiang, I\u2019ll come help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui together pounded on Pei Yuyang. Pei Yuyang was messed with by the two men until he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. And then he struck back, and for a moment, three people suddenly started a snowball fight.</p><br/><p>Thinking they were very childish, Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t very active and just silently sat to one side, calmly observing Wei Han. He\u2019d increasingly discovered that despite Wei Han\u2019s laugh not being as cute as others, but it was a kind of silly and foolish laughter that made him feel comfortable and happy.</p><br/><p>After smashing back and forth, the three men had played until they were tired and started to pile up snowmen. Although Jiang Chengrui\u2019s temper was relatively forthright and violent, but he was still very attentive when doing things. The snowman that he built had form and shape. On the contrary, Pei Yuyang, who\u2019d only been focused on looking at his family\u2019s daughter-in-law the whole time, his snowman simply couldn\u2019t be seen in his pile of snow.</p><br/><p>Wei Han piled up a white Doraemon. Looking towards the not far away Qi Zhifan, he laughed and secretly wrote on its back \u201cDorae-fan\u201d, these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2019re really lazy ah. Aren\u2019t you cold sitting around like this?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>At this time, Wei Han trotted over. Playing around for a while, his whole body was warm and his hands also started to gradually become hot.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot cold.\u201d Qi Zhifan shook his head. Who knew, in the next second, Wei Han used his nice and warm palms to cup Qi Zhifan\u2019s icy cold cheeks and even the two freezing and slightly red ears were also enveloped together.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han who was foolishly laughing at him, Qi Zhifan was slightly startled, then he grabbed Wei Han\u2019s waist and pulled him over. In a split second, the two were stuck very close to each other: their foreheads leaning against each other, their four eyes making contact with each other, and their noses pressing against each other, maintaining a kind of extremely intimate posture.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>cough cough</i>,\u201d Wei Han coughed twice. Thinking that Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang were not far away, he was a bit embarrassed and wanted to push Qi Zhifan away.</p><br/><p>But Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t follow his intention. He held Wei Han tightly, as if he wouldn\u2019t let go in life or in death. He softly murmured in his ear, \u201cWei Han, I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few simple words. It was difficult to imagine that they came from that the mouth of that originally arrogant younger brother, but at this moment, they were incomparably real, and seemed to enter into the deepest and softest place at the bottom of Wei Han\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>In the following year, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui finally became official police officers. The no-nonsense Leader Lu nodded, squeezing out a trace of a rare, satisfied smile. Unlike some classmates who went to intern at the court, Qi Zhifan went to a law firm. Anyway, he also didn\u2019t lack financial resources and personal connections. Pei Yuyang curbed his lax nature, and slowly settled down in the jewelry company that his father had arranged for him.</p><br/><p>This day, Chu Chuanyao gave Wei Han a call. His speaking manner was very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, it\u2019s really great ah! I found that man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Wei Han was a bit foolish. He was frequently busy with handling all kinds of cases and momentarily wasn\u2019t able to recall.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was last year. I mentioned it to you once: that tall man who saved me at the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han remembered that he\u2019d also asked Little Yao how tall he was, and Little Yao had described that he was roughly around 1.9-meter.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026wait a minute, say, Leng Yan was also similar. Could it be\u2026fuck, it shouldn\u2019t be so coincidental, right?</p><br/><p>Wei Han was thinking about it when Chu Chuanyao interrupted him again, \u201cBig Brother Wei, I want to thank him in person. Can you take the time to teach me how to make some food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Han readily agreed, though somewhat unable to understand why Little Yao seemed to be so persistent this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe school isn\u2019t very convenient. Can I go to your house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy house?\u201d Wei Han thought about his cohabitation relationship with Qi Zhifan. \u201cNo no no, I\u2019ll just go to your house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen alright, it\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Chu Chuanyao hung up, Wei Han finally reacted. It seemed that this was also not right. If Qi Zhifan knew that he went to Chu Chuanyao\u2019s house, he\u2019d definitely be a little unhappy. It seemed like he\u2019d have to properly explain it and make more delicious food to coax him.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Leader Lu introduced Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui to a new colleague. Unexpectedly, it was Shao Yi from C City.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi\u2019s eyes swept through the crowd and suddenly locked on Wei Han. Sensing his unusually hot eyes, Wei Han had to give a hollow laugh and wave in greeting.</p><br/><p>At work, Wei Han took the newly-arrived Shao Yi to the archive room to get some information. Wei Han didn\u2019t quite understand, so he casually asked, \u201cShao Yi, wasn\u2019t it quite good when you were staying in C City? Why did you suddenly ask to be transferred to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d Shao Yi said seriously.</p><br/><p>But Wei Han was completely scared. \u201cWh\u2026what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I miss you too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cM\u2026miss me? You\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d Wei Han\u2019s face was a little distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest with you, when we were at the training base a year ago, I was a little bent by you. Afterwards, I also wanted to try finding a woman, but I discovered\u2026\u201d saying this, Shao Yi shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was foolish for half a day, and then, \u201cThis must be your fucking hallucination! Bye-bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Thirty-Six Stratagems \u2018if all else fails, retreat\u2019. Wei Han decided that it was still better to flee first then talk later.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

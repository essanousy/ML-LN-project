Of course, he\u2019d absolutely hide this matter from his big sister, Jiang Chenghui, and not dare to let her know for a while.</p><br/><p>In adversity to find gay love, maybe Pei Yuyang should be grateful to the snake that had bitten Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also gave his blessings. Although Pei Yuyang this person was a bit perverted, a bit of an idiot, and also a pig complex of a shaking M, but he was singlemindedly devoted to Jiang Chengrui. Anybody could see this point.</p><br/><p>After three months of training, Wei Han\u2019s hair grew a lot longer, especially the front bangs, which almost covered his eyes. There\u2019s nothing he could do: Wei Han understood that his hair grew faster than the average person.</p><br/><p>If this was as usual, he would do it himself. Even if he cut it like a dog chewed on it, it didn\u2019t matter. In any case, everyone trained together, and everyday they were so tired that they were more dead than alive, so they simply didn\u2019t care about the image.</p><br/><p>But tonight, Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao had an appointment. He didn\u2019t ask to be handsome, confident and easy, but he must have the basic neatness and tidiness.</p><br/><p>Speaking of getting a haircut, Wei Han was too lazy to run far. In the street behind the neighborhood, he casually found a barbershop.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the idle to agitation Uncle Li was dozing off. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and Uncle Li immediately woke up with a quiver. Seeing a rare guest, he immediately greeted him with a smile and asked Wei Han to sit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, what haircut do you want?\u201d Uncle Li said, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little simpler: showing the eyebrows, showing the ears, that kind. Anyway, just cut it short.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought that after he becomes a police officer, basically everyone would have short hair, and this hair would sooner or later need to be cut. A few days ago, Wei Han met Jiang Chengrui. His head of yellow curls was also forced to be dyed black, but his hair was always naturally curly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut short?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first part, Wei Han spoke a bit fast, and Uncle Li didn\u2019t hear clearly, only catching the last two words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han lightly responded and conveniently picked up the magazine on the table to look at it. Looking for a while, he felt a little sleepy and slowly closed his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Qi Zhifan was also having his hair styled in a hair salon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHandsome, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>A male guest with off the charts attractiveness index suddenly came, and the ladies in the shop became particularly enthusiastic. Who told Qi Zhifan to have a casual glancing motion that was full of charm, causing the mind of the people watching to fluctuate.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan touched his chin and thought about it. \u201cThe hairstyle of a man confessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that lady must be really blessed,\u201d the young lady smiled, a little jealous in her heart.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly hooked his lips and didn\u2019t explain more. Yes, with himself liking him, Wei Han that fool was clearly so blessed, but sometimes, he lived in blessing but didn\u2019t appreciate it.</p><br/><p>With a new hairstyle created for Qi Zhifan, it made his whole person a bit brighter and more handsome. Before Qi Zhifan left, the young lady gave another encouraging smile. \u201cFighting! I wish you a successful confession.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Wei Han faced the mirror foolishly for half a day. Only then did he touch the little bit of black stubble on his head, feeling a little prickly\u2026</p><br/><p>Fuck! He just took a nap for a while, why did he wake up with his head shaved? Your mom, this was only a little better than a bald head ah!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heart almost collapsed. Uncle, I\u2019m going to be a police officer afterwards, not a prisoner ah.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, you see, it\u2019s so simple and relaxed, more cool and more stylish! And it\u2019s easy to take care of, but also saves on shampoo. What\u2019s more, it\u2019d soon be summer, it\u2019s also very cool ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uncle, don\u2019t say anymore, I want some quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han supported his forehead. He\u2019d thought this shop was not very reliable and also hadn\u2019t expected the uncle to have good workmanship, but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be this unreliable ah!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Having no alternatives, Wei Han could only wear a hat to go meet Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, why are you wearing a hat?\u201d At first sight, Chu Chuanyao took note of Wei Han\u2019s hat and asked, baffled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ah, haha, looks fashionable,\u201d Wei Han said, lowering his voice a little in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Wei Han took Chu Chuanyao to a Doraemon theme restaurant. The shop not only had Doraemon on the wall, but also put a lot of dolls and figures on the table. There was a pile of Blue Fatty ornaments, and in the doorway, a staff member wearing a Blue Fatty costume was waving his <i>meng, meng</i> little round hands.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had always liked Blue Fatty from small to big, and the sweets in this shop were also quite delicious. Tonight, the second floor of the restaurant was reserved, but the first floor was still receiving guests.</p><br/><p>After ordering their meals, Wei Han received a text message from Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Odd Trouble\u3010Sure we\u2019ll meet at 9, can\u2019t be advanced a bit earlier?\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Cold\u3010I still have something to do now. See you there at 9!\u3011</p><br/><p>After replying to the text message, Wei Han grinned and ate with Chu Chuanyao. He ate while he introduced Chu Chuanyao to the ones that were especially delicious, and used his chopsticks to pick them for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, you called me out this time wasn\u2019t just to eat a simple meal, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao asked. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an illusion, but he\u2019d always felt that after Wei Han returned from the training, he\u2019d changed a bit. This wasn\u2019t that Wei Han\u2019s appearance had some kind of big change, but when he was alone with him previously, it seemed like he was hiding something in his heart. Now, he seemed to have solved that knot and became casual and natural.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he still remembered that three months ago, before Wei Han prepared to go to C City\u2019s training camp, Wei Han had clearly told him that he had something important to tell him when he returned.</p><br/><p>Wei Han forced out two laughs: \u201cHeheh, eat first. We can talk when we finish eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, okay.\u201d Chu Chuanyao nodded.</p><br/><p>In fact, Wei Han had two appointments tonight. His appointment with Chu Chuanyao was at 6pm and with Qi Zhifan was at 9pm.</p><br/><p>He felt that this didn\u2019t conflict. He looked for Chu Chuanyao and went out together was because he intended to eat a meal and say one thing. It should be able to end soon. When he\u2019s together with Qi Zhifan at 9pm, it\u2019d be like eating a late-night snack. Anyway, his stomach was big and quickly got hungry.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t expect, Qi Zhifan was already sitting on the second floor. The one who\u2019d reserved the second floor of the restaurant was Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan wanted to give Wei Han a surprise. He knew that Wei Han liked desserts and Doraemon, so he specially selected a Doraemon theme restaurant and reserved an entire floor, letting the waiters carefully decorate it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of music is needed, sir?\u201d A waiter came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessary.\u201d Qi Zhifan waved his hand. Wei Han simply didn\u2019t appreciate elegant music; they were purely lullabies to him. But he had second thoughts and changed his mind. He called for the waiter to stop, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, what else do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan casually grabbed a Doraemon doll and said with an unperturbed face, \u201cSince you are this guy\u2019s theme restaurant, then put on the animation theme song, the Chinese version is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the waiter looked at Qi Zhifan with strange eyes.</p><br/><p>So, the \u201ccheerful and melodious\u201d childish singing echoed in their ears. In sharp contrast, not a moment later, an English song suddenly floated out as Qi Zhifan\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Brother Chen, has the matter been settled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, don\u2019t you trust my work, Gavin? I\u2019ve sent someone over to the square. When you want to put on the fireworks is when they\u2019d be released. Guaranteed there won\u2019t even be a second\u2019s delay,\u201d the person on the phone, Brother Chen, laughed and guaranteed.</p><br/><p>Previously when Qi Zhifan brought up confessing to Wei Han, Pei Yuyang was happy and quickly gave him a lot of ideas. Among them, creating a romantic atmosphere with fireworks was essential.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>There was a small square opposite to this theme restaurant. Lovers often wandered through it in the evening, holding their small hands, watching the stars and moon, and then talking about their life ideals and advancing their emotional development.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, is the amount prepared sufficient?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not a problem to keep it up all night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen release them for half an hour now. I want to see the effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, they\u2019ll be released right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after Brother Chen hung up the phone, \u201c<i>boom</i>\u201d a sound, and the sky was lit up.</p><br/><p>Then, splendid and dazzling fireworks blossomed with brilliant lights and vibrant colors. There were a few pairs of small couples in the small square with their head raised, the colorful rays reflecting in their eyes, and they all smiled.</p><br/><p>After hearing the activity, several people emerged from the bottom floor of the restaurant. Qi Zhifan also looked out through the window at this moment, but in an instant, his eyes gave off an ominous glint.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Wei Han was downstairs! The man beside him was\u2026Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>Although Wei Han was wearing a hat and back was facing him, Qi Zhifan saw his back from the distance and was able to recognize him. That fool was absolutely Wei Han.</p><br/><p>With a gloomy face, Qi Zhifan hurried and ran out in the next second.</p><br/><p>Under the resplendent fireworks, Wei Han suddenly took Chu Chuanyao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was startled. \u201cWei\u2026Big Brother Wei, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to his reaction, Wei Han was very calm and collected. \u201cLittle Yao, I\u2019m sorry. I want to make sure of one thing. So, can you let me hold you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao stared blankly. \u201cThis\u2026is this related to what you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s sincere face, Chu Chuanyao nodded.</p><br/><p>So the next moment when Qi Zhifan ran out of the restaurant, he saw Wei Han holding Chu Chuanyao, this scene. In an instant, his look turned extremely unsightly.</p><br/><p>What was this fucking called! It turned out that his meticulously prepared fireworks actually helped these two people get together?</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, sure enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sighed and let go of Chu Chuanyao. Unlike in his past life, even if he hugged Little Yao now, his heartbeat was still very regular, smooth and stable. So indeed, he already liked\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei?\u201d Towards Wei Han\u2019s behavior, Chu Chuanyao was actually all at sea and a bit at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao actually, I\u2019ve always liked you before, but\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice came from behind him. Wei Han was so frightened that he shook from head to foot. His spirit hadn\u2019t returned yet when the next second, his arm was grabbed, and then his whole body was pulled over by Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Qi! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Completely ignoring the two people\u2019s surprise, Qi Zhifan held Wei Han\u2019s wrist and forcibly dragged him. As a result, Wei Han stumbled on his feet and his head fell down. The hat that was originally on his head also dropped.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan supported the almost fallen Wei Han, and then his eyes unerringly fell on Wei Han\u2019s \u201cbald head\u201d.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was completely stunned. Looking at Qi Zhifan\u2019s handsome hairstyle, and then looking again at the little bit of pitiful black stubble on Wei Han\u2019s head, it was simply a world of difference.</p><br/><p>Holy fuck! Wei Han felt that there were suddenly thousands of mud horses running in his heart.</p><br/><p>The next second, he immediately picked up his hat and then ran away. As though his feet were smeared with oil, he vanished in an instant, running till his shadow couldn\u2019t be seen, only leaving behind Qi Zhifan and Chu Chuanyao, who looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who lost face and lost his hair, fled all the way home. Shortly afterwards, Qi Zhifan followed on his heels and also returned.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face was pale, and his trembling lips were just about to explain something. Who knew, Qi Zhifan, didn\u2019t say anything further and just pushed Wei Han down on the sofa. Then, he used his body to press down on him.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Since moving out of the house, Qi Zhifan was also happily alone and carefree, living in a mansion and driving a sports car. The wealthy were very capricious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, can you take me to the station first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked him up and down, knitting his brows, \u201cWith your appearance as it is, you still want to go there and get tossed around? Aren\u2019t you afraid people would be able to discover something?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Wei Han\u2019s legs couldn\u2019t stop a tremble from running through. Somewhat awkwardly, he gave two dry coughs:<i> \u201ccough cough</i>. Don\u2019t worry, I usually exercise so it\u2019s not a problem. Since I ran away last night, I have to go back and give an account. Ai, I\u2019m considered as being absent without leave. I\u2019d definitely be given a demerit, and who knows if there will also be some disciplinary action. I just hope that I won\u2019t be dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han deeply worried and sick at heart, Qi Zhifan simply blurted out these three words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I be alright?\u201d Wei Han looked suspicious. Avoiding it wasn\u2019t a solution, so he still braced himself and gave Jiang Chengrui a call from his cell phone.</p><br/><p>As soon as it connected, Jiang Chengrui\u2019s complaining voice came over, \u201cFuck, Silly Han, you actually still know how to call me. Why don\u2019t you calculate how long you\u2019ve been missing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han weakly said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ah, Little Jiang, I also don\u2019t want this. But last night was an emergency. Qi Zhifan, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han a little hesitant, Jiang Chengrui also said in understanding, \u201cI knew that it was related to your brother Qi Zhifan. I\u2019ve said more than once before: every time you meet him, you\u2019d become a stupid person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, actually, I\u2019m not very angry now. I thought you were missing, but Qi Zhifan called and said that you were there. I was also a little relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wei Han looked up at Qi Zhifan beside him and asked again, \u201cIt turns out that he\u2019s already told you? When was this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarly this morning, when I was dozing off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh.\u201d Wei Han nodded and gave Qi Zhifan a profound glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, Leader Lu, he\u2026did he blow up?\u201d Speaking of the no-nonsense Sergeant Lu, Wei Han lowered his voice even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast night, he was quick to blow up. That look\u2026if you had dared to appear in front of him, it\u2019s estimated that you\u2019d really be ripped apart alive! But today, he suddenly received a notification from a superior, and I also don\u2019t know what it was, but in short, his face eased up a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen my matter, was there any disciplinary action that came down from above?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no action for the time being. I\u2019ve been worrying about your matter, but after waiting for a long time, there was still no reaction from those above. They just told you to come to the bureau on time tomorrow. Silly Han, do you have someone covering you from higher up?\u201d Jiang Chengrui was a little curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han looked at Qi Zhifan again and suddenly understood somewhat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m also not too sure.\u201d Wei Han hurriedly changed the topic, \u201cRight, Little Jiang, don\u2019t return to the apartment after work tonight; just go directly to Pei Yuyang\u2019s house. I think he should come to pick you up at night too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I moved out to live with Qi Zhifan. Pei Yuyang also brought all your clothes back to his house. The landlady returned our rent, and when I see you, I\u2019ll give it to you\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through Wei Han\u2019s words, Jiang Chengrui was already bristling, \u201cFuck! That damned pervert ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hanging up the phone, Wei Han was finally a little relieved, though he looked a little gloomily at Qi Zhifan. Qi Zhifan raised his eyebrows, that expression seeming to say \u201csee, I said it\u2019s alright\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, you don\u2019t have to step in and fix things according to your way next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han grimly said. The person who covered him, if nothing else, was someone related to Qi Zhifan. Unlike him, no matter what, Qi Zhifan was still part of the Qi family. Old Master Qi was a former bureau chief of the Tax Bureau, and his uncle was also in the Finance Bureau. He had a bunch of behind-the scene supporter aunts too. Moreover, he also seemed to know a lot of capable people.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stared blankly. At first, he\u2019d hated when Wei Han kept calling him \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d again and again. Now that he had kept hearing it and was accustomed to it, if Wei Han suddenly decided to change it, contrarily, he\u2019s rather unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving my support isn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head and squeezed his palm. \u201cThe police is the road I chose myself. I want to rely on my own efforts and walk down it step by step, and not because of something else. Have you heard this sentence? Fairness and justice is more glorious than the sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Qi Zhifan seemed to see the shadow of Qi Hao on Wei Han\u2019s body. Really stubborn. It\u2019s no wonder that this fool wanted to be the same as his dad and chose to become a police officer.</p><br/><p>Also, seeing Wei Han\u2019s resolute little eyes made Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart itch. He couldn\u2019t help but reach out and rub a hand over Wei Han\u2019s head. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Qi Zhifan\u2019s place, Butler Sun had long since been at the door to greet them.</p><br/><p>The several times Wei Han had come before, he\u2019d mostly just visited the front courtyard, so he passed through the front yard and ran to the backyard, turning around with a smile always on his face. This was a beautiful environment with many flower beds and also an oversized, open-air swimming pool. Haha, he could finally enjoy the life of a rich man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, where\u2019s my room ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han expectantly asked. There were so many rooms here. He really didn\u2019t know if Qi Zhifan, living alone in such a big place, would feel insecure or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy room,\u201d Qi Zhifan casually said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? That\u2019s not going to work.\u201d Wei Han jumped in fright and continuously waved his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Qi Zhifan crossed his arms in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you explain it to mom and Uncle Qi when they come to see us? And \u2018distance gives rise to beauty\u2019. We should give each other some breathing room. And I usually leave early and return late, sometimes I\u2019m also on the night duty shift, so I\u2019d inevitable disturb you with the noise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han forced a smile and counted out the explanations on his fingers. There was actually another reason that he didn\u2019t have the nerve to say. Recalling the experience of being pressed down last night, it was a really a bit tragic. Wei Han was a little scared, and his chrysanthemum still had some pain.</p><br/><p>After listening to Wei Han pull out a pile of reasons, Qi Zhifan felt a burst of speechlessness. \u201cWei Han, do you know what cohabitation means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. \u201cI know. Didn\u2019t we live under the same roof before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was even more speechless. \u201cYou really have no love experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this statement made Wei Han a bit upset, his look changing a bit. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s far less than you. That night, why did you go to the nightclub in the Southern District? And also got drugged?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only remember to ask this now? You\u2019ve clearly already slept with me\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Where would he let Qi Zhifan continue to talk about this? Wei Han hurriedly interrupted him, \u201cDon\u2019t pull it in a strange direction. Quick, what was going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because previously, Six Hot had given Wei Han the \u201ccounter-playing hard to get\u201d move and caused Wei Han to completely ignore him for a period of time, Qi Zhifan was always in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>That day, it happened that someone invited Qi Zhifan to come out for a drink. It was Little Chu, who was in the same faculty as Qi Zhifan. Little Chu\u2019s father opened a department store, so he could also be considered a young master. When they met up, Young Master Chu also brought a group of friends as well as his younger sister.</p><br/><p>Little Chu had investigated Qi Zhifan and knew that he ate both men and women, and also knew that the Qi family behind him was very strong. Little Chu always wanted to introduce his younger sister to him and to intentionally play matchmaker for them, but it was hopeless: Qi Zhifan\u2019s behavior was always cold and detached. As far as he knew, even if it was someone he\u2019d dated before, Qi Zhifan had hardly done anything particularly intimate and was difficult to handle.</p><br/><p>Under the heckling of the crowd, Qi Zhifan drank a lot of wine, and also drank a cup of drugged wine.</p><br/><p>Later, Little Chu and his younger sister brought him to the hotel. Little Chu gave a meaningful glance and told his younger sister to directly pounce on him. It\u2019d be best to have sex and directly get pregnant.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t expected that Qi Zhifan would wake up suddenly and, with an extremely ugly face, directly break off relations with Little Chu, angrily driving out the two brother and sister. But the drug effect was still there. Qi Zhifan kept enduring, and with his mind filled with Wei Han, he made that phone call\u2026</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for being vexed in his heart because of Wei Han then, Qi Zhifan wouldn\u2019t have fallen for such a hackneyed trick. However, also because of this, he\u2019d eaten Wei Han.</p><br/><p>After listening to Qi Zhifan\u2019s narrative, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally. \u201cWow, Odd Trouble, you\u2019re really capable of enduring ah. If it were me, I may not necessarily be able to control myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this fool focusing on?</p><br/><p>A bit angry, Qi Zhifan grasped Wei Han\u2019s wrist and pulled him all the way to his room. Wei Han was pulled by him and stumbled a few steps. \u201cHey, Odd Trouble, slow\u2026slow down. I\u2019m a disabled person now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan sneered and directly tossed this \u201cdisabled person\u201d on the bed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little panicked at this time and hurriedly smiled obsequiously, \u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t be mad. Actually, I was just kidding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just after he finished, Qi Zhifan had already pressed close to his body and raised up his T-shirt. His hand touched the waist and he lightly pinched it.</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately trembled and twisted his waist. \u201cAiyo, hurts! Good little brother, please be merciful. You\u2019ve already tossed me all night, last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018good little brother\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be the little brother of this fool.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, then good Trouble.\u201d Wei Han rolled his eyes, miserably blinking his eyes at him. \u201cGood Trouble, please let me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was startled. This fool was trying to use the \u201csell <em>meng</em> while pretending to be innocent\u201d trick. Also, what was this \u201cgood Trouble\u201d thing? It sounded as if he was very troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll help you rub your waist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s somewhat cool fingers wandered around his waist, stimulating Wei Han to shiver slightly, and then Qi Zhifan gently rubbed it a few times, making Wei Han both sore and tingly. Wei Han couldn\u2019t bear it and caught Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand. Shaking his head in discomfort, he said, \u201d I\u2026I will rub it myself. I know my own body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s fingers slipped down again, pinching twice on Wei Han\u2019s upturned ass and wandered close to the hole in the deep crack in between, his pupils darkening. \u201cIs it? Then did you managed to clean here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han face suddenly turned red, and embarrassingly nodded.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head and smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll check it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, he planned to take off Wei Han\u2019s pants. Wei Han was suddenly stunned out of his wits, and then quickly struggled. His right hand suddenly touched a soft little thing and immediately lifted his eyes to look.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Wei Han was flashed blind by the touch of hot pink. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This color, this feel, this shameful T-shape, this familiar ball-breaking feeling!</p><br/><p>Holy fucking hell, wasn\u2019t this the thong that the awful King Kong Barbie had stuffed into his hand when he\u2019d first first gone to the gay bar long, long ago!</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, where did you get this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why was it always on the bed? The latter half of the sentence, Wei Han wanted to ask, but simply was too ashamed to ask out loud.</p><br/><p>Suddenly having this pair of panties revealed, Qi Zhifan, who was calm and collected in all things, was also in a bit of a daze. He took it back, his face slanting to the side. \u201cDon\u2019t mind it. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter to Qi Zhifan if this thing was seen by others. But right now, it was unfortunately discovered by the owner, so he was somewhat a little unable to hang onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Odd Trouble, are you being shy now? Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan, who the second before, had been lying on his body acting like a \u201cperverted little brother\u201d, but this second, was acting a bit unnatural, Wei Han quickly played dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, when there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll give it to you again to wear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, I don\u2019t want to wear it! Your little brother suddenly became perverted, what do you do?</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

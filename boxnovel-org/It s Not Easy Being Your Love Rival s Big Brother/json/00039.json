From the master bedroom on the second floor, Qi Zhifan led Wei Han downstairs to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw with one look that the kitchen utensils were almost all new. Compared to the small apartment he used to live in, this place was particularly clean and tidy, but cold and unfriendly, lacking a home\u2019s atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan rarely cooked for himself, and Young Master Qi said that he wouldn\u2019t eat anything other than egg fried rice. It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t learn, but that he was too lazy to learn. Qi Zhifan, who placed money above all else, didn\u2019t want to waste time cooking.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was still very clear on this point.</p><br/><p>After rummaging through the meat and vegetables in the plastic bags, Wei Han smiled and nodded. \u201cNot bad. Odd Trouble, you\u2019re quite filial: you\u2019ve bought a lot of the vegetables that mom and Uncle Qi likes to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wei Han rolled up his sleeves, washed his hands and prepared to cook when Qi Zhifan called him to stop, \u201cWei Han, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to give you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Qi Zhifan took out a lacy and <i>meng </i>apron with Doraemon printed on it.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gosh, Qi Zhifan seemed to be getting stranger and stranger, this girlish heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly hooked his lips. This could be considered as him giving a small surprise to Wei Han. From the time he\u2019d started living here, he\u2019d already planned on having Wei Han also live here later. This was the house he\u2019d bought for himself and Wei Han, their \u201chome\u201d.</p><br/><p>Now that the other owner, Wei Han, had finally come in, their two-person home was also complete. Starting from today, he\u2019d let Wei Han cook for him everyday, cook for him for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han still hadn\u2019t taken it yet, Qi Zhifan said, \u201cWhat are you blanking out for? Quickly put it on. Or do you want me to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026no need.\u201d Helpless, Wei Han could only obediently put it on.</p><br/><p>Although he would like to refuse, but the cartoon character on it was his favorite Blue Fatty. Plus, Qi Zhifan must have prepared it in advance, so Wei Han also didn\u2019t want to disappoint his intentions.</p><br/><p>While Wei Han was cooking, Qi Zhifan supported from the side, helping him to wash and cut up the vegetables, beat the eggs, and so on.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Odd Trouble, you really aren\u2019t going out?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the previous two years when they were still living together with Dad Qi and Mother Wei, Wei Han also cooked food for them almost everyday, but he had never seen Qi Zhifan take the initiative to enter the kitchen to help him because Qi Zhifan quite disliked the smoky smell and greasy feeling of the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Han faintly responded and lowered his head, beginning to cook. He was a little embarrassed, and a little more than a hint of sweetness seeped into his heart.</p><br/><p>During the process, Qi Zhifan quietly observed Wei Han\u2019s serious appearance when cooking, and also silently noted the steps he took to cook each dish, plotting something else in his mind.</p><br/><p>At 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, Dad Qi and Mother Wei came over. A family eating this dinner joyously and harmoniously was quite perfect and satisfying.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Dad Qi and Mother Wei talked with their two sons for a while. They didn\u2019t plan to spend the night and would drive back soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, I can tell that Fan-fan\u2019s mood is much better today than before. Since you\u2019re living here now, then you as the older brother need to take care of him well and must not bully him,\u201d before leaving, Mother Wei warned him again.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wryly smiled. \u201cMom, I\u2019ve said many times already that I really don\u2019t dare to bully him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, you two brothers must be kind and love each other,\u201d said Mother Wei with a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>Sending away Dad Qi and Mother Wei, Wei Han recalled Mother\u2019s Wei smile just now and couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit guilty. Wei Han was clear that his mom\u2019s way of thinking had always been simple and pure. If she knew that their relationship had changed, he didn\u2019t know what would happen.</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han, scared and on edge, went to the police station.</p><br/><p>Everyone didn\u2019t say anything on the surface. As usual, people laughed and called out to Wei Han, but inevitably, there would be some gossipers whispering and discussing behind his back. They hadn\u2019t expected that the seemingly dim-witted Wei Han would have a terrible backer hidden up above.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, I finally meet you in person.\u201d When he saw Wei Han, Jiang Chengrui smiled, his two small tiger teeth suddenly appearing.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. \u201cLittle Jiang, did you go to Pei Yuyang\u2019s place yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui waved his hand, his head beginning to hurt again. \u201cAi, don\u2019t mention that pervert. He was definitely premeditating a murder. I just came in the door when I was almost crushed to death by his family\u2019s black pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Silly Han, Leader Lu asked you to go see him when you come back. He\u2019s waiting in the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this remark came out, Wei Han\u2019s nerves immediately stretched taut and he asked in a low voice, \u201cLeader Lu, he\u2026how is he feeling today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was expressionless, so I can\u2019t tell what his mood was,\u201d Jiang Chengrui said, strongly patting Wei Han\u2019s shoulder, \u201cGo, Silly Han. Wishing you good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han took two deep breaths and then knocked on the door. After getting permission, he went in with his head hung down. He was a little afraid to look at Sergeant Lu directly.</p><br/><p>Putting aside the records of some theft cases collected by the police, Sergeant Lu looked up at Wei Han for a moment and casually asked, \u201cHearing what our Commissioner Liu said, you went to save someone that night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommissioner Liu? Save someone?\u201d Wei Han was stupefied and his eyes turned. \u201cS\u2026sort of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking of Qi Zhifan\u2019s uncomfortable appearance that night, if he hadn\u2019t shown up, he somewhat didn\u2019t dare to imagine the consequences.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd it was also to save the Financial Bureau Chief Qi\u2019s nephew?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sergeant Lu\u2019s slightly sarcastic tone made Wei Han tense up from head to foot when he heard it. He nodded helplessly and his head hung even lower.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wei, it looks like you really have a background.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Wei Han suddenly shouted, and he immediately made a ninety-degree deep bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Lu, I promise that this will absolute not happen again next time. Although I wasn\u2019t disciplined by those above, but I feel very apologetic in my heart. Please properly punish me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bottom of Sergeant Lu\u2019s pupils flickered with surprise and his fingers knocked on the table twice. \u201cGood, after everyone gets off work, you will stay to clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silly. \u201cClean? Aren\u2019t there special cleaning aunts who do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a moment, I\u2019ll inform them that they don\u2019t have to clean today. You are responsible for doing their work. Little Wei, you first need to mop clean the first floor office hall. Our office and the night duty room also need to be properly cleaned, and especially the toilet: it must be brushed clean!</p><br/><p>After you finish, you will run thirty laps around our building. You mustn\u2019t be lazy in the middle. You can go home after you\u2019ve finished running. What, pretty light, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Sergeant Lu\u2019s mouth pulled out into a cruel smile, Wei Han stayed for a few seconds and finally resigned himself to nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, one! One, two, one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Past 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, Wei Han was still running around the building.</p><br/><p>In fact, when he ran the first ten laps, Sergeant Lu was still supervising. But not a while later, his wife called and urged him to hurry home for dinner. Sergeant Lu agreed and then gave Wei Han a profound look.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han already drenched in sweat and his tired appearance, he also didn\u2019t want to deliberately make thing difficult for him anymore, so he quietly left.</p><br/><p>At this kind of time, a normal person would be lazy, pretend to run for two more laps and quickly sneak away, or else they\u2019d take a short rest and continue. But Wei Han didn\u2019t stop, even if he was breathing heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, what time is it? Do you want to starve me to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled when Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice suddenly came. He looked up and saw the gloomy-faced Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Wiping the sweat on his face and waving weakly at him, Wei Han squeezed out a smile. \u201cWait\u2026wait a while for me, wait\u2026wait until I finish running and then we\u2019ll go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan secretly cursed, walked over and pulled Wei Han. Wei Han\u2019s steps stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo home.\u201d Qi Zhifan glared at him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han weakly said, \u201cBut I haven\u2019t finished running yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn stubborn!\u201d The veins on Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead jumped. Why did he have to endure this kind of idiot?</p><br/><p>Wei Han scratched his head and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll run with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Odd Trouble, can you run with low blood sugar? What if you run and fainted again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck! It\u2019d been more than two years ago. Could it be that this fool\u2019s impression of him was still stuck on that evening when he was chased by the bull in the countryside?</p><br/><p>Pulling out a sneer, Qi Zhifan said, \u201cWei Han, are you going to run or not? Do you believe that if you say one more word of nonsense, tonight in bed, I\u2019ll let you see who faints first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han face reddened and promptly pressed shut his lips.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan accompanied Wei Han to finish the remaining ten laps and the two returned home. After opening the door to his room, Wei Han was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>When Wei Han went to the office to work during the day, Qi Zhifan found someone to re-decorate Wei Han\u2019s room. At this moment, it\u2019d completely become a robotic cat theme room.</p><br/><p>The whole room was blue and white, and there were several posters of Doraemon on the wall. The bed furnishings were all related to Doraemon, what mattress, quilt, pillows, and so on, but also a large doll on the bed, and an easy chair placed next to the table.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s mouth was gaping. Staring blankly for a long time, he suspected: was Qi Zhifan somehow stimulated?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Like it?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked. Adapting to his taste, this was also a surprise he\u2019d prepared for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cDang, Odd Trouble, are you sure this isn\u2019t a children\u2019s room? And, even if I like Blue Fatty, but this\u2026isn\u2019t this too dreamy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this your taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately shook his head. \u201cNo no no, now brother\u2019s taste has already become very good! This won\u2019t do, I have to sleep in a different room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can only sleep in my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Wei Han suddenly closed the door with a <i>bang</i>, hiding inside in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s face was a bit distorted.</p><br/><p>Evening in Wei Han\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Covered with a Doraemon quilt, Qi Zhifan and Wei Han were lying in bed together, the posture of the two men quite ambiguous.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s two hands were around Wei Han\u2019s waist, holding him tightly from behind, and his head was also buried in Wei Han\u2019s neck. Also, one of his legs was just stuffed between Wei Han\u2019s two thighs, always rubbing, intentionally or otherwise.</p><br/><p>Since Wei Han refused to sleep in his room, he could only be thick-skinned and stick to Wei Han like a leech, even though this room was a bit \u201cdreamy\u201d.</p><br/><p>He saw that Wei Han was nervously clutching the quilt and also hadn\u2019t turning his head to look at him. His face was buried in the pillow all along and his body was still shivering slightly. Qi Zhifan swatted his butt. \u201cDon\u2019t tremble. I won\u2019t eat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, you clearly and mercilessly ate! Wei Han didn\u2019t believe it. And whenever Qi Zhifan spoke, the exhaled heat always agitated Wei Han, making his ears turn redder and redder.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan kneaded his butt again. \u201cDo you still have a little pain here? That night, I saw you crying and screaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were really said without a bit of shame!</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who completely felt that he no longer had an elder brother\u2019s dignity and had completely lost his face at this moment, only nodded with a muffled voice.</p><br/><p>Although two days had passed, but that night was his first time after all. Affected by the drug, Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t lubricate him. He\u2019d used his fingers to flip and stir and expanded the opening for a while, but when he actually entered, it was still painful to death. Wei Han felt as though his lower half was rip apart. In addition, afterwards, Qi Zhifan had so rampantly and violently stormed in like seizing a city, but also went back and forth quite a few times.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Oh god, he had kind intentions to help him cope with it, but he hadn\u2019t really expected that he\u2019d be pressed down to become a <i>shou</i>.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you can rest assured that I won\u2019t make a move on you these few days.\u201d Words finished, Qi Zhifan slowly pulled open Wei Han\u2019s hand that had been tightly clutching the quilt in nervousness, and then gently held it.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heartstrings vibrated, and then he only felt that there was a thread of warmth that slowly seeped into the bottom of his heart. He also held Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand in return.</p><br/><p>This was the warmth that he\u2019d never felt before in his past life with Little Yao. It was no longer a unilateral effort, but a bilateral, sincere and honest warmth from both sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, do you know why I like Blue Fatty?\u201d Looking at the Doraemon poster on the wall, Wei Han suddenly smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you\u2019re stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The smile on his lips became a bit stiff. Wei Han bumped Qi Zhifan with his elbow. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heaved a sigh and his expression suddenly became heavy. \u201cAi, my dad died when I was twelve years old. At that time, only my mom took care of me and my grandmother. It was really a difficult time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While the other children had new clothes, new toys and so on, Wei Han didn\u2019t have them at all. He was both foolish and stupid, so was also often bullied. Wei Han didn\u2019t want Mother Wei and grandmother to worry, so what wrongs and what tears were all restrained in his heart, and it also slowly became a habit to keep the peace. Over time, this formed into this kind of frightened and foolish character that would also do a pile of stupid things.</p><br/><p>In fact, Wei Han still had some things that he didn\u2019t said: that is, if he hadn\u2019t been reborn, then he would also have to face Mother Wei\u2019s death. He\u2019d always remembered that when Mother Wei died of illness in the hospital, there weren\u2019t even comforting relatives by his side, and only the doctors and nurses had said a few words of comfort.</p><br/><p>Talking about it, Wei Han rather mockingly laughed at himself, \u201cHeh, when I was a little kid, I liked to watch Doraemon cartoons, and I also envied Daxiong.<b><sup> [1]</sup></b> He always had Blue Fatty by his side. Blue Fatty has a magical hundred treasures pocket that had everything you could ever want and could make all your wishes come true.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to Wei Han\u2019s long narrative, Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but hold him tightly and whispered in his ear, \u201cWei Han, although I don\u2019t have a magical hundred treasures pocket, but I\u2019ll try my best to help you realize your wishes in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was stunned and his heart was moved again. He turned to face Qi Zhifan. Then, he laughed and teased, \u201cHeheh, then from now on, you\u2019re my \u2018Dorae-fan\u2019.\u201d<b><sup> [2]</sup></b></p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan face was drawn out: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the hell was this name?</p><br/><p>\u201cDorae-fan, why are you unhappy?\u201d Wei Han smirked and poked Qi Zhifan\u2019s face with his finger, feeling that the face was practically burning hot.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan suddenly caught Wei Han\u2019s mischievous finger and reached out to turn off the lamp. \u201cShut up, so unpleasant to hear to death. Hurry up and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, haha, are you being shy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t sleep, I will fuck you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hoodlum!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han was in the dating forum and sent a private message to \u201cSix Hot\u201d.</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Six Hot, I\u2019m living together with my brother now, thank you!\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Congratulations\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010According to the previous agreement, we\u2019re friends\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Yeah, Stomach Hot, if you have any troubles later, you can always find me\u3011</p><br/><p>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah\u3010Six Hot, should we see each other once?\u3011</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010There\u2019s no need for now.

As a result, Qi Zhifan\u2019s topic produced more things like \u201cLow Blood Sugar Male God\u201d, \u201cSickly Vice President\u201d, \u201cMost Sugarless Slag Gong\u201d, a series of new titles dominated the BBS forum headlines every day.</p><br/><p>In the first few days, Wei Han was often seen laughing uproariously. But gradually, as soon as he returned home, he would be faced with Qi Zhifan\u2019s ice cube face. Being in the same room as this huge chunk of ice, the home didn\u2019t need air conditioning, hehe.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was increasingly uneasy. This was the fucking calm before the storm!</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>Hi</em>, dear Ah Fan, miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Pei Yuyang called, he hadn\u2019t harassed Qi Zhifan for a whole week. Qi Zhifan had a rare feeling that his ears were quiet, but unfortunately, what must come, would come.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram, or say it quickly,\u201d Qi Zhifan said coldly, neither having the spare time nor the good mood to accompany his nonsense.</p><br/><p>There was a sigh from the end of the phone. Pei Yuyang whined and cried, \u201cAi, you haven\u2019t heard my voice for a week. Not only do you not miss me, but you\u2019re also so fierce. I\u2019m really hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to his peculiar tone, Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows angled out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste time and energy missing a person who was bitten by a dog, but also went to the hospital to lie down for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang, embarrassed: \u201c\u2026Uh, it seems like you cared more about me than I\u2019d thought, good Ah Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn comparison, ai, please forgive my carelessness. I\u2019ve known you for more than three years, but incredibly didn\u2019t find out that you were sick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow thinking about it, it\u2019s no wonder that the number of times you play basketball, tennis and soccer is far less than playing cards and golf. Poor Ah Fan, I will remember to prepare many good candy for you afterwards. Everyday, you need to take your medicine on time, and obediently eat sweets ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, the more he heard, the more upset he was. \u201cYou really know so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, your school has circulated it like crazy; I just had to ask someone to find out. What is there that I don\u2019t know of?\u201d Pei Yuyang was immensely proud of himself. Thinking of something, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, \u201cHaha, you\u2019re actually the same as me and can\u2019t fish ah. I thought you were really omnipotent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei Yuyang, you have a lot of nonsense to say today. Are you in a good mood?\u201d Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t want to listen to him preach and directly interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just so-so. When my family\u2019s Archie is happy, then I\u2019d really be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, why don\u2019t you pay me back first?\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice abruptly sank.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d At that moment, without moving, Pei Yuyang\u2019s smile became stiff at the corners of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom three years ago to now, the money you owe me is a good penny. Do you want me to calculate it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Pei Yuyang practically wanted to cry ah, then changed his previous attitude. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I also didn\u2019t say anything. Good Ah Fan, just pretend I didn\u2019t make this call today, <em>bye</em>~\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Qi Zhifan regard it as nothing had happened; Pei Yuyang\u2019s phone call had finally thoroughly enraged him. He\u2019d endured for many days. A dark road passed through his eyes and he took action.</p><br/><p>In the new week, everyone logged into S Uni\u2019s BBS and were prepared to continue the gossip, but who knew, the top hotly discussed posts were all gone, leaving only the administrator\u2019s latest sticky post.</p><br/><p>Everyone was completely dumbfounded for three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>Then clicked the sticky post.</p><br/><p>In the sticky post, a number of new rules had been added to the original rules.</p><br/><p>The general idea was: to create a good atmosphere on campus, they were now cleaning up the campus network environment. The administrator will regularly delete all rumors that were inconsistent with reality, exaggerated or distorted the facts and caused heated debates. Once they were discovered, they will be deleted immediately.</p><br/><p>In fact,the real and fake materials, usually everyone would dispute for a period of time, and when the general mood had passed, they\u2019d stopped. The same was true with the topics about Qi Zhifan. Ordinarily, when there was no explosive news, no one would watch them attentively and research all day long.</p><br/><p>So many things previously pertained to Qi Zhifan\u2019s matters, but he was unmoved and continued to lead the life of a male god.</p><br/><p>But now\u2026It seemed that this time\u2019s black material really angered Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Soon afterwards, everyone began to continuously send out small tributes to mourn the Pastry Lord, giving the Pastry Lord \u2018light the candle\u2019 messages.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>At school, \u201cPastry Lord\u201d Wei Han trembled in fear for a day, and returning home, he was even more fidgety. This was an imminent disaster. At the time, he\u2019d posted it in a fit of anger. He also hadn\u2019t expect it to cause such a big impact.</p><br/><p>It happened to be that tonight, Dad Qi and Mother Wei had some business and weren\u2019t home and would only return tomorrow. It was simply the best opportunity for Odd Trouble to commit a violent crime.</p><br/><p>He obediently made dinner, three dishes and a soup that fully catered to Qi Zhifan\u2019s taste: more vegetables and less meat. After dinner, Wei Han also carefully cut the watermelon to serve, only asking that Qi Zhifan spared him this one time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, go for a walk with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, when Qi Zhifan spoke, it wasn\u2019t a question, but a statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to go. Can\u2019t I not?\u201d Wei Han had a sense of foreboding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qi Zhifan sneered.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s legs began to soften, but he repeatedly told himself he can\u2019t be frightened, still stiffened his neck and shouted, \u201cI won\u2019t go. Even if you beat me to death, I won\u2019t go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tomorrow, you don\u2019t have to get up early to go to school. You simply also won\u2019t go to S Uni.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of the power to control his life and death, at anytime able to get him kicked out from S Uni, destroyer of his dream, Qi Zhifan, Wei Han had no choice but to compromise ah.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s nod, Qi Zhifan\u2019s overcast complexion finally cleared. Mood rather good, he pulled his older brother to go out for a walk. And this spontaneous holding hands action, even he didn\u2019t realize.</p><br/><p>Dragged by the hand by Qi Zhifan to the neighborhood park, Wei Han only felt a tingling sensation and quickly pulled out his hand. \u201cOdd Trouble, I can walk by myself, no need for you to pull me. Also, you have hand sweat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speech finished, he still wiped at the hem of his shirt for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The veins on Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead jumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wrong. You really have hand sweat. People with low blood sugar are prone to sweating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s face darkened again, and his big hand, all of a sudden, tightly grasped Wei Han\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>Faced with such a familiar scene, Wei Han panicked, \u201cHey hey, we\u2019re all civilized people. We can speak nicely if we have something to say. Can we not come to blows?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan smiled mockingly and loosened his hand. \u201cSent out the black post about me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did it. Who told you to press me down to the ground last time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han interrupted him. The matter had already come this far, and \u2018different situations called for different actions\u2019, so Wei Han simply admitted it all.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly surprised, not anticipating that Wei Han would frankly and straightforwardly confess. Originally, he\u2019d thought that he\u2019d have to \u201ctorture out a confession\u201d. Daring to admit it in front of him could also be considered courageous.</p><br/><p>Slowly releasing his hold on Wei Han\u2019s wrist, Qi Zhifan glanced at him up and down. With such a body, he still wanted to train like Qi Hao to become a police officer. Qi Zhifan really wanted to laugh, but he still kept a calm and collected face, not showing anger or happiness.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Zhifan indifferently said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re willing to admit it. Then frog jumps, push ups, and squats, three hundred each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Can\u2026can you change the punishment?\u201d Wei Han suddenly wilted.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou still dare to bargain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I also dared to admit my mistakes. Can\u2019t you punish lightly? You might consider torturing me mentally, or you can just order a few things that you want to eat, and I must obediently make them for you to eat,\u201d Wei Han said with a thick face. Little life was important.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, that sounds good\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan stroked his chin, deliberately paused, and firmly vetoed it, \u201cBut that\u2019s letting you off too lightly, so no, can, do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble!\u201d Wei Han fiercely glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, from the first day you came to this home, I have warned you more than once: don\u2019t provoke me too much. But what did you do?\u201d Qi Zhifan said in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wei Han was a bit at a loss for words, and bowed his head to reflect on some things.</p><br/><p>He admitted that in the beginning at the gay bar, he had a taking revenge mentality and had deliberately followed Qi Zhifan. At that time, he still had the shadow of his past life\u2019s love rival. But later, he wanted to strive to get into S Uni, and Qi Zhifan had taken out his shareholder identity to threaten him. Afterwards, at the resort, although he was in the wrong, but it wasn\u2019t that he was deliberately picking a fault ah. Besides, afterwards he kindly made sweet-stewed snow pear, and also apologized to him.</p><br/><p>Also, they\u2019d fought because of the nicknames, but Qi Zhifan had also recently been angered by his exaggerated scoop. All of this\u2026oh god, it really was a messy account. Sometimes, it wasn\u2019t clear who was right and who was wrong.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cConsider myself unlucky to have met you,\u201d Wei Han whispered, clenched his teeth, and was forced to obediently give in.</p><br/><p>Ai, the one who had power and influence all along was the great lord, who specialized in bullying the pure and good little ordinary people like him.</p><br/><p>Also coincidentally, in his past life, he\u2019d carried out so many high-intensity weight loss exercises was because of Qi Zhifan\u2019s \u201ccuddly\u201d word. Now at this moment, it was Qi Zhifan making things hard on him again!</p><br/><p>So, Qi Zhifan idly sat on the bench, playing on the mobile phone while thoughtfully observing Wei Han.</p><br/><p>After Wei Han jumped back and forth three hundred frog jumps, the moon was already hung high in the sky.</p><br/><p>Halfway through, people passed by in twos and threes, but also an old man holding a dog passed by. He thought that they were toughening their bodies and wasn\u2019t paying much attention. At most, he ruefully thought that young people were energetic and vigorous.</p><br/><p>With great bitterness and deep hatred, Wei Han was so tired he didn\u2019t even swallow his saliva. He continued to lean down and lift up to do push ups. Just done with thirty, Qi Zhifan impatiently shook his leg. \u201cCan you hurry up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>Cough</em>!\u201d Wei Han almost got an internal injury from this heartless remark.</p><br/><p>At the bottom of his heart, he cursed Qi Zhifan thousands of times. Wei Han still had to continue, firmly biting his lower lip, sweat from his forehead constantly dripping down, back also drenched in sweat, his whole body\u2019s strength seemed to be almost drained, and the limbs began to feel numb\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly he unexpectedly shuddered, and he didn\u2019t know whether he was tired or angry. The whole person suddenly fell on the ground, and came in close contact with the earth.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a thread of difficult to perceive anguish flashed through Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes. He slowly walked to Wei Han. \u201cYou can choose to beg me, and I will consider letting you go for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han panting heavily, looked up at Qi Zhifan. Also, don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but he soon moved his body and grabbed Qi Zhifan\u2019s pant leg, and then slowly lifted his hands and hugged the thigh.</p><br/><p>\u2018The wise man knows better than to fight when the odds are against him\u2019, Wei Han begged for mercy, \u201cGood brother, please let me go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How did this man have such little prospect?</p><br/><p>But looking at Wei Han\u2019s raised head looking towards him, those big eyes blinking and looking a bit limpid and pitiful in the moonlight, Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart also instantly softened, but also happened to eat it up.</p><br/><p>At two in the morning, Wei Han gradually began to ache from head to foot. Stomach holding a bellyful of anger, Wei Han couldn\u2019t sleep all along. Suddenly, he quietly climbed out of bed, his brain muddled by anger, climbed next door from the balcony. He gently pushed the window, and successfully infiltrated Qi Zhifan\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to enter in the daytime. First of all, there was no key. Ordinarily, even Dad Qi and Mother Wei could rarely enter. Second, even if Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t at home, the door and window were locked.</p><br/><p>But now in the late spring and early summer season, Qi Zhifan would surely open the window to ventilate at night, and Wei Han could also climb in through the window.</p><br/><p>Not daring to open a flashlight, Wei Han only relied on the phone screen\u2019s faint light, and cautiously crawled on the floor. He bowed down to glance at the time, 2:15AM. Still having to go to school early in the morning, he didn\u2019t believe that Qi Zhifan hadn\u2019t slept yet.</p><br/><p>This time, Wei Han was risking death to infiltrate in order to find Qi Zhifan\u2019s handle. Even if he doesn\u2019t retaliate, he can at least restrain this slag brother, and avoid being frequently threatened by him afterwards.</p><br/><p>Maybe he can find a photo of his first love or something? Or maybe some shameful kind of thing? Or simply do it himself, and take a picture of the bed?</p><br/><p>Wei Han turned to look at Qi Zhifan, who was still asleep on the bed. He thought for a minute and shook his head, feeling that it was too lacking in moral integrity. But his eyes rested on the small cabinet by Qi Zhifan\u2019s bedside.</p><br/><p>Wei Han crept closer, his intuition telling him that there was something good inside.</p><br/><p>Just about to open it, unexpectedly, his waist was encircled by an arm, and then the other used force, and he was pulled onto the bed!</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled and was about to get up from the bed, but the other person\u2019s movement was extremely fast, and suddenly pressed him down under the body. Wei Han\u2019s struggling hands were also clamped firmly to keep him from moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei\u30fcHan\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s deep voice almost squeezed out from between his clenched teeth.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, Wei Han came into contact with Qi Zhifan\u2019s dark eyes, and couldn\u2019t help but cry, heart chilled.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

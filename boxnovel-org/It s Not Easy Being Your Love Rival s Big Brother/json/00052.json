After verifying that there was nothing wrong, he smiled at Wei Han and kindly poured him a cup of water.</p><br/><p>In a daze, Wei Han received it in his hands. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. In a few days, you\u2019ll be able to leave the hospital.\u201d After saying that, Ou Yizhe stretched his body and quite familiarly, sat on Wei Han\u2019s bedside and inspected him even more closely.</p><br/><p>Wei Han became a little nervous under his gaze and he slightly shrunk his neck. \u201cDr. Ou, you\u2026don\u2019t you still have something to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m quite idle right now, so I wanted to look at you, Wei Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026I\u2019m really not much to look at.\u201d Wei Han wryly smiled. He wasn\u2019t a giant panda at the zoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, you\u2019re very ordinary. But who told Michael and Zhifan to be so nervous about you, so it also made me very curious about you.\u201d Finished saying this, Ou Yizhe narrowed his eyes and drew even closer to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d Wei Han was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Leng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that Six Hot had already known him! Dang, what kind of fate was all of this?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was for you that Michael called me back to the country. I\u2019d thought that in this lifetime\u2026no, that I wouldn\u2019t come back to look until I was at least forty or fifty.\u201d Ou Yizhe shrugged helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to come back? Is it because\u2026\u201d Wei Han wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><br/><p>But Ou Yizhe instantly understood what he meant and the teasing smile on his face faded. He said softly, \u201cYeah, because of Zhifan. That year when I threw him away like that and left, I\u2019ve always felt that I owed Zhifan too much and didn\u2019t have the face to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a burst of rapping on the door, interrupting the conversation between the two. A crisp voice came from outside the door: \u201cBig Brother Wei, it\u2019s me, Little Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe hadn\u2019t left yet, but Chu Chuanyao came. Exactly what rhythm was this ah!</p><br/><p>Ou Yizhe got up and opened the door. When the door opened, Chu Chuanyao looked at this eye-catching face and was suddenly dumbstruck: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a split second, Ou Yizhe couldn\u2019t help but stare with a blank look. But he suddenly recalled something and slightly smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who Michael said really looked like me? Heh, really interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Ou Yizhe\u2019s hand had already raised up Chu Chuanyao\u2019s chin, looking at his left and at his right. Finally, he squeezed his face and lamented, \u201cReally tender. It reminds me of myself a few years ago. It seems like this trip back was still worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face shook: this man had just finished teasing him and now also seized the opportunity to take advantage of Little Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Cyril, or you can call me \u2018Dr. Ou\u2019. Right, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao\u2019s spirit slowly returned and stammered, \u201cChu\u2026Chu Chuanyao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his nervous little appearance, Ou Yizhe happily patted his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? I won\u2019t eat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying that, he beamed and went back to Wei Han\u2019s side, pulled his neck and immediately kissed the side of his face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han became rigid at once: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Wei Han, you guys talk. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Ou Yizhe waved his hand and left, completely ignoring the already dumbfounded Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Wei Han wiped his face a little resentfully. He thought that Ou Yizhe probably had been in the United States for a long time so his personality was open, so now, wouldn\u2019t he just meet people and then \u2018kiss goodbye\u2019? Then he and Odd Trouble, having met again after so long, wouldn\u2019t it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao interrupted Wei Han\u2019s irrepressible delusions in time. Somewhat at a loss, he lightly sighed, \u201cAi, Big Brother Wei, it turns out that he was the friend that Mr. Leng mentioned once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, yes, I also didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that Mr. Leng said that he had an eye for me.\u201d The luster in Chu Chuanyao\u2019s eyes gradually dimmed. \u201cMaybe he started to care about me and helped me so much was probably just because I look like Dr. Ou and nothing more. But Dr. Ou is obviously much better-looking than me, and stylish and self-confident. How can I compare?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han heard this and hurriedly advised, \u201cNo\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be. Little Yao, don\u2019t overthink it. Leng Yan should really just be friends with him. You still have a good chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chu Chuanyao\u2019s eyes shined with a glimmer of light again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan and Ou Yizhe wouldn\u2019t have anything, but what about Qi Zhifan and Ou Yizhe?</p><br/><p>In contrast to Ou Yizhe, Little Yao was inferior, then what about himself? He and Ou Yizhe were one heaven and one earth, simply unable to compare from the start.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan said that he would come back in half an hour, but this time, the work was a bit troublesome and the client\u2019s requests were many, so it couldn\u2019t be completely resolved in a short time. Qi Zhifan called Wei Han and explained the situation. Wei Han didn\u2019t mind and just said that he\u2019d have a proper lunch and then he\u2019d take a quiet and peaceful nap.</p><br/><p>After eating lunch, Wei Han\u2019s state of mind was somewhat uneasy. He closed his eyes but couldn\u2019t sleep. He rummaged through the clothes Qi Zhifan had brought him and suddenly found his own \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d. He froze on the spot: fuck me, could Odd Trouble have already seen this?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han heard gradually more distinct footsteps. Figuring out the time, it should be when Qi Zhifan would return. Without delay, he put the notebook in his hand back in place and hurriedly rolled up in the quilt.</p><br/><p>This \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d, he\u2019d originally intended to wait until he and Qi Zhifan were both old to read it. At that time, they would have been together for several decades. As old husbands, they certainly wouldn\u2019t feel that it was anything.</p><br/><p>But now, if Odd Trouble really read it all\u2026Uh, Wei Han just thought about it and was too ashamed to show his face. After all, his face hadn\u2019t been trained to be that thick yet.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan entered the ward, he saw a round lump arched on the bed with Wei Han\u2019s entire body wrapped up inside the quilt. Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows suddenly wrinkled: this fool, sleeping smothered so tightly, could he even breathe?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan walked over and pulled Wei Han\u2019s quilt. When he pulled it off, he saw a pair of big, jet-black eyes staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretending to sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026no, I just can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Wei Han quickly played innocent.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan apparently didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cAren\u2019t you the type to fall asleep in three seconds? You usually sleep like a lazy pig, so how can you not sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was hit with an inspiration, and he raised his lips and laughed, \u201cGood Trouble, great beauty, isn\u2019t it because bro misses you too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lord Wei just teased the beauty and his mood was suddenly a lot more pleasant. Qi Zhifan looked at the table and saw that a plate of fruit was added. He asked, \u201cSomeone came to visit you this morning? Who?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it was Little Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly displeased. Today was Chu Chuanyao. Yesterday was Leng Yan. The day before yesterday was Shao Yi. How come all these men he didn\u2019t want to see had to all come over? So annoying.</p><br/><p>When Chu Chuanyao was mentioned, Wei Han naturally thought of Ou Yizhe. \u201cOdd Trouble, in fact, this morning, I\u2026that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you stuttering? If you have something, just say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI met Ou Yizhe in the morning,\u201d Wei Han simply said it out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was suddenly stunned, the ward\u2019s warm atmosphere also changing instantaneously. He was silent for a good while before he faintly said, \u201cDon\u2019t see him later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. He wondered exactly what Qi Zhifan thought in his heart. Obviously, Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t want to say anymore now, so he wouldn\u2019t force Qi Zhifan either. Perhaps, Qi Zhifan still needed time to straighten it out.</p><br/><p>At dinner, Qi Zhifan hand-fed Wei Han. Suddenly, he reached out and pinched his face, discovering that with a light pinch, he was able to pinch out a lump of flesh. \u201cHey, are you eating then sleeping, sleeping and eating everyday now and being too comfortable? You\u2019ve gained a lot of weight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face instantly stiffened: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Fuck! Why would he get fat while being sick in the hospital?</p><br/><p>Now was the critical moment of the \u2018love rival\u2019 return! The moment he got out of the hospital, Wei Han vowed to control his diet, retrain his body, strengthen his physique and eliminate any possibility of gaining weight.</p><br/><p>But the next day, Mother Wei specially brought a pile of Wei Han\u2019s favorite sweets to come see him. He swallowed his saliva. Upholding the \u2018only his true love of gourmet food can\u2019t be betrayed\u2019 belief, Wei Han decided to eat his fill before losing weight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, it really scared me to death when you were unconscious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han hung his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom, I made you and Uncle Qi worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei shook her head, touching her son\u2019s head instead. \u201cAi, sometimes I\u2019m not strong enough. There are clearly already two policemen in this family, and I\u2019ve also been mentally prepared early on, but once an accident happened to you, I\u2019m still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han interrupted her, \u201cMom, don\u2019t say anymore. It\u2019s been hard for you. Don\u2019t worry, Uncle Qi and I will definitely protect ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mother Wei laughed softly. \u201cHan-han, I think Fan-fan still really likes you, this big brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Wei Han raised his brows. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know ah, when you didn\u2019t wake up, Fan-fan always meticulously took care of you. During that time, he became very silent, almost ignoring everyone else. Sometimes, he even became bad-tempered and flared up a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Han stared with wide eyes. The always calm and collected Qi Zhifan, he\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Your Uncle Qi also said that since his mother\u2019s death, he hadn\u2019t seen Fan-fan like this for many years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Finished listening, Wei Han fell silent. If it were him and the one unconscious was Qi Zhifan, he may also get out of control and not know what he would have done.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, I got sidetracked a bit. Why don\u2019t I tell you something fun.\u201d Mother Wei winked and laughed. \u201cHan-han, do you remember I mentioned once to you that Fan-fan went on a blind date?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom, this isn\u2019t fun for me at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterwards, I heard your Uncle Qi say that Fan-fan refused to go on a blind date again, and that he\u2019d told his grandfather he was already in love with someone. The Old Master was happy and always looking forward to him bringing that girl to come visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe\u2026really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. Aren\u2019t you curious? Anyway, I also really want to see what kind of girl she is.\u201d Mother Wei\u2019s eyes were bright. Said to here, she added, \u201cThen what about you, Han-han? Mom has always been waiting for a grandson ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han knew that Mother Wei had always liked little babies, so he hadn\u2019t dared to confess to her that he liked men.</p><br/><p>Wei Han tried to squeeze out a smile. \u201cNo rush.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Wei found that her son was a little strange, especially every time he heard Qi Zhifan, something would always flash in his eyes: now happy, now worried, this reaction\u2026</p><br/><p>Although Mother Wei was usually always confused, but sometimes, she also had a woman\u2019s intuition. She definitely wouldn\u2019t mention some things. For example, when Wei Han was in a coma, Qi Zhifan had tightly held Wei Han several times deep into the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, you\u2019ve promised me more than once that you would be a good older brother. You haven\u2019t forgotten, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Han answered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>His and Qi Zhifan\u2019s matter, wouldn\u2019t it certainly destroy this current family? Wei Han was suddenly a little scared.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Wei Han was discharged from the hospital.</p><br/><p>This weekend, Qi Zhifan had something to do and went out. Wei Han was cooking at home when he received a call from Shao Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Shao Yi, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi\u2019s voice was somewhat low and hoarse: \u201cWei Han, can you come out and meet me one time and just accompany me for a meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was afraid of angering Qi Zhifan and a little awkwardly said, \u201cUh\u2026is it an important matter? Can\u2019t you say it over the phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient, then forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait! Okay, what time and place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Shao Yi informed him and Wei Han nodded, preparing to tidy up, then go. Anyway, there was time today and Qi Zhifan wouldn\u2019t return until the evening.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Why did Odd Trouble look so small? He looked like he\u2019s only about ten years old?</p><br/><p>Not caring too much for the time being, Wei Han felt a bit uncomfortable and twisted his neck with difficulty. Little Qi Zhifan\u2019s whole body was pressing on him to sleep, his little arm resting on his belly and a leg also slung across his waist.</p><br/><p>Reaching out, Wei Han wanted to slightly push Qi Zhifan a little, but when he saw his hand (paw), a piece of white velvet, he incredulously blinked his eyes for a good while before he was certain that he was not mistaken. This was clearly\u30fc</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it\u2019s not an illusion! Your mom, this was was a dog\u2019s paw (\u2299o\u2299)!</p><br/><p>wtf! So now, he\u2019d become Odd Trouble\u2019s dog!</p><br/><p>Ah, ah, ah (\u2267\u2266) Wei Han simply became extremely frantic, but when he called out, his voice was a burst of \u2018<i>woof woof woo</i><em><span>f</span></em>\u2018 \u2026</p><br/><p>The barking woke little Qi Zhifan from his sleep. His brows wrinkled, and then he opened his eyes. His deep eyes had natural eyeliner\u30fcvery beautiful from an early age\u30fcbut at this moment, they were filled with resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Husky Egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the name of the silly husky? Fuck, couldn\u2019t he choose a more normal, cute dog name?</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan blinked his eyes again, always feeling that today\u2019s Husky Egg was unusually restless, but he was too lazy to think about it more and slowly got out of bed. Because he wanted to change his clothes, he began to take off his cartoon pajamas. With only two or three moves, he took off everything down to his undies.</p><br/><p>If this was changed to after Qi Zhifan was grown up, it would certainly have been shining white, fleshly temptation. But he was only ten years old, and after all, was a little boy. His figure was nothing to look at, but he was naturally born with long legs and his body proportion was quite good. As for the place between his legs that has not yet developed\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh god, it was improper to see. Wei Han turned his body away.</p><br/><p>So, little Qi Zhifan, who was only wearing a pair of underwear, saw his own dog, tail tilted high, faced his master with his chrysanthemum. <b><sup> [1]</sup></b></p><br/><p>A burst of discomfort in his heart, little Qi Zhifan immediately issued an order. \u201cHey, Husky Egg, help me drag my pants over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s dog face instantly turned white: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the rhythm of using his mouth to hold Odd Trouble\u2019s pants?! o__o</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t obey, I won\u2019t give you food today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan raised his chin and threatened. Wei Han was speechless, thinking that, at this time, little Odd Trouble was really a childish little devil ah.</p><br/><p>In the end, Wei Han compromised. As long as it wasn\u2019t undies, everything else could be negotiated. No matter if he was a man or a dog, big stomach king, foodie Wei Han would never wrong his own stomach. Food was the god of the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Little Qi Zhifan rubbed Wei Han\u2019s dog head with satisfaction, urging again, \u201cHusky Egg, lick your paws first. I\u2019ll prepare something delicious for you to eat later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Odd Trouble would give him something delicious to eat?</p><br/><p>Wei Han was looking forward to it a little, and the greedy tongue in his mouth shook.</p><br/><p>But what about this \u201cchanged into a dog\u201d matter? Did he eat something wrong, or drank something?</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought hard for a while, thinking about the three meals yesterday, he\u2019d made it himself, so how could he have harmed himself? So there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with what he ate. Then the problem was\u2026</p><br/><p>A divine light flashed in his brain, and it dawned on Wei Han!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Yesterday evening, Wei Han was humming a song and walking on his way home when he suddenly found out that there was a new tea shop that had opened in the neighborhood.</p><br/><p>He swore that he really was just happening to pass by, but the enthusiastic lady boss\u2019s shouts stopped him, continuously praising that he looked very handsome. The lady boss giggled and gave him a cup of pomelo tea for free.</p><br/><p>It was hard to decline great kindness. Although Wei Han was a bit embarrassed, but he also accepted. Later, \u201c<i>gulp gulp</i>\u201d for a moment and he finished. The taste was quite unique. It wasn\u2019t too good to drink, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant either, a \u2018not worth mentioning\u2019 kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>As a result, when he woke up, he became a husky that Little Odd Trouble hugged to his bosom\u2026 [manual goodbye]</p><br/><p>(\u30ce\uff40\u0414)\u30ce Your mom, this pit father\u2019s pomelo tea ah!</p><br/><p>Wash your hands before eating. Wei Han, who\u2019d inexplicably become a dog, didn\u2019t want to lick his paws! Standing on his hind legs and stretching his two forepaws out, Wei Han leaned over to wash his paws on the edge of the sink.</p><br/><p>After seeing his \u2018specialized in selling stupid for a hundred years\u2019 silly husky suddenly become smart and even able to \u201cwalk upright\u201d, Qi Zhifan, who was brushing his teeth, was shocked and with a \u201cpfff\u201d, sprayed Wei Han\u2019s face with mouthwash.</p><br/><p>\u201cHusky Egg, are you a spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han wiped his face with his dog paws and ignored him.</p><br/><p>After washing up, little Qi Zhifan nibbled on bread and threw a sausage to Wei Han. Wei Han casually took a few bites and quickly finished eating.</p><br/><p><i>\u201cWoof woof</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was dissatisfied. A sausage couldn\u2019t satisfy him.</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan peeled a banana.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Woof woof</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not pleased without meat ah, and why are you giving a dog bananas to eat ah, are you teasing a monkey or an orangutan?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan went to wash a cucumber.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026<i>Woof woof woof</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Why were they all vegetarian? Bro wants to eat meat ah!</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan\u2019s face sank and he directly stuffed a lollipop into Wei Han\u2019s dog mouth.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Odd Trouble ah, are you treating your family\u2019s silly husky as a dog?</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026wait a moment, sausages, bananas, cucumbers, and lollipops\u2026</p><br/><p>What did Odd Trouble usually feed his dog ah? (\u2299o\u2299)! Secretly thinking, he became extremely fearful. Wei Han wanted to go to the police, wanted to go to the Dog Protection Association to report him to not abuse this innocent and pure silly husky like this.</p><br/><p>Later, Wei Han saw the young Qi Hao, and also had the privilege of having his head rubbed by the sturdy, warm hand.</p><br/><p>Wei Han happily bounced around: Fuck, Uncle Qi was really handsome ah! If he was a woman, he\u2019d absolutely also want to marry this kind of man.</p><br/><p>Of course, at that time, Mother Qi was still there. She was indeed a beautiful and classy good mother. However, she suddenly took out some dog\u2019s clothes and wanted to help Wei Han cover up.</p><br/><p>Maybe a dog really didn\u2019t like to wear clothes, but Wei Han was a man. Now in the situation of only having fur and not wearing clothes, he felt like he was forever streaking, so he didn\u2019t mind putting on these clothes.</p><br/><p>But, why did these clothes\u2026not mentioning the urine yellow color, but it was also a small chrysanthemum brilliantly in full bloom?!</p><br/><p>Ai, the heart was so tired -_-|||</p><br/><p>What was this kind of familiar, rotten feeling? Wei Han had never imagined that such an elegant temperament mother, in some ways, was also quite like his own mother _(:3)\u2220)_</p><br/><p>After this, little Qi Zhifan discovered that his family\u2019s silly husky got weirder and weirder. One of the most unexpected points was that the silly husky even got rid of his bad habit of defecating everywhere, and became a dog that sat on the toilet.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan helped Wei Han to bathe, Wei Han refused again and again. He used his dog paws to cover his chest, and deliberately splashed water on little Qi Zhifan\u2019s body with his paws. The angry little Qi Zhifan grabbed Wei Han\u2019s dog tail, and his chrysanthemum in the rear was instantly exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you being shy? Tch, you\u2019re not a female.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s scared chrysanthemum tightened: \u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34Help! The owner is bullying ah!</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan was confronted by Wei Han\u2019s pair of dog eyes and seemed to detect the panic in them. After a moment of silence, he went out. Forget it, just let this dog foolishly toss around by himself.</p><br/><p>A while later, little Qi Zhifan was a bit uneasy and rushed in again. Who knew, he saw his family\u2019s silly husky blowing bubbles in the bathtub, mouth humming and swimming back and forth, simply enjoying himself.</p><br/><p>Little Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This dog was really a spirit. Didn\u2019t they say that after the founding of the country, animals couldn\u2019t cultivate to become a spirit?</p><br/><p>After this, others walked their dogs on leashes, while Qi Zhifan held Wei Han in his bosom every time and walked together with Wei Han. The passersby all deeply sighed: this owner was really in true love with his family\u2019s dog.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, Qi Zhifan only felt a sense of accomplishment for raising his silly husky to become a spirit. Later he grew up, and he gradually developed a sense of dependence on Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han really accompanied Qi Zhifan for many years. He was with him all the time, and was also not clear how many days and nights. He also witnessed many important events in Qi Zhifan\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>From Qi Zhifan knowing Ou Yizhe, to falling in love with him, and then to Ou Yizhe leaving him. That night, Qi Zhifan clung tightly to Wei Han. Although tears did not fall, but his face was sorrowful and his eyes were filled with despair that couldn\u2019t be brushed away.</p><br/><p>This was the second time Wei Han had seen him so brokenhearted and sad. The first time was when his mother died a few years ago. Only then, he was still a boy who held him and cried loudly.</p><br/><p>Not long after this incident, Wei Han also fell ill.</p><br/><p>As a dog, his lifespan was very limited. It was impossible to really accompany Qi Zhifan for a lifetime. When he was dying, Wei Han felt Qi Zhifan hugged him tightly, and then the fur on his body was gradually soaked with a warm liquid\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han slowly closed his eyes: Odd Trouble, good\u2026goodbye\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly \u201c<i>pa</i>\u201c, Wei Han jerked up from bed. He\u2019d finally come back and became human. he touched his cheek and found that he was crying.</p><br/><p>Hearing the movement, Qi Zhifan knocked on the door and then pushed in. He glanced at Wei Han and smiled. \u201cWei Han, you had a nightmare? Heh, actually scared to tears, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, let\u2019s raise another silly husky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was instantly stunned. The next second, he walked over and tightly held Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you must choose a cute dog name and must not in a million years call it \u201cHusky Egg\u201d again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>ps: Cough, everyone should just casually read this and don\u2019t take it too seriously ah. This was purely a product of the author\u2019s brain pit, that was driven out at the last moment _(:3)\u2220)_</p><br/><p>In addition, regarding the second couple, I also wanted to write \u3010When Little Jiang became Archie\u3011but temporarily don\u2019t have the time, haha~</p><br/><p>This small extra may be revised and improved later on. Then if there\u2019s an opportunity, I will discuss it again and later, change it in the main text~</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>I took the liberty of translating the nicknames. Silly Husky is \u201cEr Ha\u201d () and Husky Egg is \u201cHa Dan Dan\u201d (), literally Husky-Egg-Egg.</li><li><b>1. chrysanthemum: </b>euphemism for butthole</li></ul><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Ai, he\u2019d originally wanted to win the semester scholarship, but it seemed to be hopeless now.</p><br/><p>However, listening to what Jiang Chengrui said, Qi Zhifan had stayed with him for an afternoon so was also absent from the exams.</p><br/><p>Apart from being shocked, Wei Han also had to admit that he was touched. He began to feel that Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t only not troublesome, but gradually, also showed a good little brother\u2019s conscientiousness.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han spread out the Odd Trouble Grievances Record. Ever since the last fighting incident related to Lu Yan, and the two returning home in the rain, Wei Han hadn\u2019t known what to record. Some things seemed to be Qi Zhifan pitted against him, but in fact, Qi Zhifan was helping him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han suddenly touched his forehead, as if Qi Zhifan\u2019s big hand during the day was once again placed there. Wei Han couldn\u2019t ignore the good intentions of others. Thinking so, he turned to the back of the notebook and decided that, starting from the back page, he\u2019d write down the good things Qi Zhifan had done for him.</p><br/><p>Writing it down, Wei Han discovered that Qi Zhifan, this person sometimes really had a knife mouth but a tofu heart. If he didn\u2019t opposed him in the future and became an obedient little brother, and also didn\u2019t fight over Chu Chuanyao with him, then he wouldn\u2019t mind becoming a good older brother who loved his little brother.</p><br/><p>The next day at the dessert shop where Wei Han worked, with Jiang Chengrui\u2019s support, Wei Han was transferred to the back kitchen.</p><br/><p>Ever since Wei Han had visited the Jiang home, Jiang Chengrui highly recommended him whenever he saw the store manager, Song Bohao. Simply praising without stop and hyping up Wei Han, this made Wei Han feel somewhat embarrassed.</p><br/><p>After Song Bohao personally tasted Wei Han\u2019s craft, he was also pleasantly surprised. He very willingly changed Wei Han to work in the kitchen, and said that he must increase his wages.</p><br/><p>He changed shifts with the other pastry chefs, and occasionally, when it\u2019s idle, Wei Han would also go to the front to help with the deliveries.</p><br/><p>At 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Wei Han was collecting the dishes and cleaning up the table. Four girls were sitting at the table to one side, and at a glance, appeared to be students from the nearby college. They were chatting and laughing, talking about all kinds of gossip.</p><br/><p>A topic had just ended when the curly-haired girl with glasses changed to another one: \u201cHey, did you hear? Lu Yan from the Performance Faculty suddenly dropped out of school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pity. He\u2019s not only handsome, but also very approachable. Unlike some boys in our school, who are a little more good-looking, but are extremely pretentious.\u201d Short-haired sister finished and quite depressed, drank a mouthful of orange juice.</p><br/><p>As soon as these words drifted into Wei Han\u2019s ears, he paused wiping the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seemed to have been forced to go? There\u2019s something going on behind the scenes,\u201d another straight-haired girl lowered her voice and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan he be forced to leave? That\u2019s not right ah, I heard that Lu Yan has a backer. There\u2019s a cousin who seems to be part of the underworld and manages our area.\u201d Curly-haired girl was skeptical.</p><br/><p>Straight-haired girl waved her hand and immediately retorted, \u201cHow is it exaggerated? I have a distant uncle who works in the Public Security Bureau, and he said that a few days ago, the local police caught a group of people and brought them in, almost all of them from these small gangs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? That sounds so scary.\u201d Short-haired sister couldn\u2019t help but widened her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be faked. My uncle also said that this incident has alarmed some government officials. They really courted disaster, just like running up against the muzzle of a gun. It is estimated that they can\u2019t even stay in S city for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finding Wei Han staring blankly from not far away, the curly-haired girl used her elbow to lightly nudge the straight-haired girl, reminding her, \u201cOkay, okay, we can\u2019t talk nonsense about these kind of things. It\u2019s better if we don\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Straight-haired girl nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. In a few days, we have a major drama performance, and I\u2019ll be starring. You all have to remember to come and see ah.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll wait to see you make a fool of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, me too, I\u2019ll take pictures all the way through.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Chengyu college girls giggled and laughed, chatting about other things. Wei Han also didn\u2019t listen anymore and walked away.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stunned by the information he\u2019d obtained, roughly figuring out the cause and effects.</p><br/><p>The last time, Lu Yan\u2019s cousin specifically looked for people to come beat up Qi Zhifan. The result was, not only were they unsuccessful, but now that group of people were all cleaned up, and also affected the innocent Lu Yan.</p><br/><p>But what about the government officials\u2019 involvement? Qi Zhifan, even if he had more money, wouldn\u2019t have such a big influence. Wei Han suddenly thought of Pei Yuyang, the child of an official. Probably, Qi Zhifan told him to get involved.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Wei Han called Pei Yuyang. He wanted to plead for Lu Yan\u2019s situation, feeling that it was really not necessary to be so absolute.</p><br/><p>As soon as the call was answered, Wei Han had not yet had time to speak, when he heard the \u201coink oink\u201d of a pig\u2019s cry, and his face instantly filled with black lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, Wei Han, why did you call? My dear brother <i>daren </i><sup> [1]</sup>, I don\u2019t know what I can do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Pei Yuyang speaks, the tail-end always contained a smile, and was usually pleasant to listen to. However, now with the pig grunts, it really made the ears suffered.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han with a gloomy face, \u201cWho\u2019s your brother? Don\u2019t blindly call me. And can you make your family\u2019s pig a little quieter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>OK</em>, I also know that the average person, hearing Archie\u2019s grunting sounds, wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. I quite understand, so I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, the phone was quieter and Wei Han seriously asked, \u201cPei Yuyang, do you know Lu Yan\u2019s matter? Has he been driven out of S City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Wei Han would ask about his matter. Pei Yuyang silently murmured, \u201c\u2026Well, it should be. Originally, this matter was nothing. It\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened to Ah Fan, but this time, he seemed really angry. I also don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can you help Lu Yan? Isn\u2019t your dad the section chief?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang reluctantly sighed. \u201cAlas, my dad is the section chief, but Ah Fan\u2019s grandfather is the bureau chief ah. Although he\u2019s now retired at home, but his uncle is still in the Finance Bureau.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>This amount of information was a bit large. Wei Han blankly gaped, and it was quite a while before he recovered his spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Ah Fan never mentioned it to you? Actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>From Pei Yuyang\u2019s mouth, Wei Han learned about Qi Zhifan\u2019s real family background.</p><br/><p>Qi family\u2019s Old Master had always been the bureau chief of the city\u2019s Tax Bureau. Now he was in retirement, but his eldest son still worked in the Finance Bureau. The daughters either opened their own companies, or were married to company executives.</p><br/><p>Qi Hao was the second son of the Qi family\u2019s Old Master. When he was young, he was unwilling to inherit the family business and ran away from home in order to be a police officer. Later, because he wanted to marry Mom Qi from an ordinary family, he angered Old Master Qi even more, and caused him to severe their father-and-son relationship. However, he loved Qi Zhifan, this little grandson.</p><br/><p>All in all, Old Master Qi didn\u2019t recognize his son, and only recognized his grandson.</p><br/><p>After the phone call, Wei Han not only failed to help Lu Yan, but also further understood Qi Zhifan\u2019s terrible identity, and simply felt disenchanted.</p><br/><p>The love rival was so uproariously awesome, can he really abuse ah! So, Wei Han decided to peacefully get along with his brother.</p><br/><p>From the last time when Wei Han fainted from a fever and was carried by Qi Zhifan to the hospital, three days hadn\u2019t passed yet, and S Uni was rocked by the huge scandal frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Wei, are you tired? I\u2019ll hold these books for you. People really admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate Wei, why don\u2019t you go to school with the Male God Qi? Are you still shy? It\u2019s okay, we already know everything about you and him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m from the school press. Classmate Wei, I have a few questions here that I\u2019d like to ask you. When did you and Qi Zhifan get together? How long have you been together?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, do you still remember me? We\u2019re all from the Organization Department. I have something to ask Qi Zhifan to help with. Can you help me contact him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the school gate, Wei Han was surrounded by a lot of people. Fortunately, his eyes were swift and hands fast, and he drilled through a gap and hurriedly slip away.</p><br/><p>After finally escaping into the class, Wei Han had just sat down when a lot of rotten female sisters<sup> [2]</sup> encircled him. Their eyes lighted, all talking at once, asking a pile of face-blushing, heart-skipping, shameful questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, when did you meet Qi Zhifan and where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBetween you and Qi Zhifan, which side confessed first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere was the first date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, heh heh, when was your first time with Qi Zhifan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times a night do you do it with Male God Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think he\u2019s the most sensitive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you interested in SM?\u201d \u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, hey, this was clearly the rhythm of Husbands\u2019 Hundred Questions ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I urgently need to pee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han quickly ran away again, and couldn\u2019t help but feel like crying. It seemed like he can\u2019t stay in this class.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you have to remember to sit for the makeup exam next semester. Right, Qi Zhifan from the law and politics class actually also needs to\u2026I didn\u2019t know before that you both knew each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went to the counselor\u2019s office and even the teachers began to wonder. Wei Han didn\u2019t feel good at all.</p><br/><p>This time entering the school\u2019s BBS, there\u2019s no need to mention, almost all topics were centered on Wei Han and Qi Zhifan\u2019s scandal.</p><br/><p>With envy and jealousy, it was agreed that Wei Han\u2019s looks were ordinary and the taste of the male god couldn\u2019t be understood. There were even more people cursing the two people to separate quickly. The male god\u2019s heart absolutely must not stay because of Wei Han.</p><br/><p>There were all kinds of gossip and ridicule, such as researching how many people Qi Zhifan had dated before Wei Han. Even more, they brazenly guessed that it was the person who\u2019d broken the news before; that Fuck Buddy Lord 366 and Pastry Lord were the same person; and that they were most likely Wei Han himself.</p><br/><p>There were also a group of people who expressed their blessing, most of them, gay guys and rotten men and women, who were divided into the physical body association and true love association. CP fanfiction pictures and writing also began to circulate.</p><br/><p>They all felt that the romance came too quickly, just like a hurricane, and that Wei Han must have saved the world in his last life.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han suddenly felt that the world was full of malice. Could it really let people go happily to school ah?</p><br/><p>In his past life, clearly Qi Zhifan snatched away his daughter-in-law, and then he was accidentally choked to death, hehe\u2026</p><br/><p>After school at night, Wei Han was waiting for the bus. His heart had suffered an ordeal for a day, and now his face had completely seen the vicissitudes. He thought about how it was good that he didn\u2019t live on campus, or else he\u2019d be tossed and tormented again. Ai, he didn\u2019t want to come to school tomorrow. It\u2019d be better to request a leave of absence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wei Han, why are you in a daze?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the familiar voice again, Wei Han shuddered. Don\u2019t know when, Qi Zhifan had also reached the platform.</p><br/><p>He was the last person who should stand beside him, but this person didn\u2019t even know to avoid it.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi\u2026Qi Zhifan. I\u2019m begging you, please, can you stay away from me? The farther the better.\u201d Wei Han panicked and continually retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but frown. Wei Han really frequently had spasms. How come seeing him was like seeing a ghost? Was he that scary?</p><br/><p>Seeing from afar that the bus had already arrived, Qi Zhifan stepped forward and grabbed Wei Han, also too lazy to worry about his struggles, just pulled Wei Han into the bus together.</p><br/><p>The two people rode the bus home together. The next morning, this matter spread all over S Uni.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li>1. <b>daren:</b> general meaning \u2018great person\u2019</li><li>2. <b>rotten women: </b>same as the Japanese <i>fujoshi</i>, women who ship guys together</li></ul><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

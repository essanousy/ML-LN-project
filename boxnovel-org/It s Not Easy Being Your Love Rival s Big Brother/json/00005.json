On the other hand, Qi Zhifan to maintain his image, didn\u2019t take the initiative to speak about returning the pink panties to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>In the study today, Wei Han was discussing a major matter with Dad Qi and Mother Wei to decide where his life was headed, which would affect his entire future.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Han, have you really decided?\u201d Dad Qi looked seriously and asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. \u201d Wei Han nodded solemnly, his palms beginning to sweat.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei with a worried face said, \u201cHan-han, your mind has never been very bright. Do you really want to enter Fan-fan\u2019s university? Mom\u2019s so worried that you can\u2019t graduate. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom, do you have to look down on your own son this much?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what do you want to do in the future?\u201d Dad Qi asked.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s eyes fell on Dad Qi\u2019s police cap on the desk. He couldn\u2019t help but to be deeply awed, slowly and solemnly said, \u201cThe same as you, Uncle Qi, I want to become a police officer. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han?!\u201d Mother Wei was immediately stunned.</p><br/><p>Dad Qi thought for a moment, his wrinkled brows slowly straightening out and nodded, \u201cGood, I\u2019ll find someone to help you find a way and go through the relevant procedures, but S Uni is not easy to enter. This period of time, you should prepare for the exam. \u201d</p><br/><p>After coming out of the study, Wei Han felt relieved. His mother\u2019s reaction was what he\u2019d expected, just that he hadn\u2019t expected Uncle Qi to agree so quickly. He\u2019d originally thought he\u2019d have to expend more words and effort.</p><br/><p>At present, Qi Zhifan\u2019s S Uni was one of the city\u2019s best-known universities. Wei Han was clear that in the near future, Chu Chuanyao would also take the exam and become a student in the School of International Business Management.</p><br/><p>Today, Wei Han can\u2019t change the fact that the two were about to be in the same university, but he could change himself and let himself enter the university. Then, he can also create opportunities for him and Chu Chuanyao and cut off all possibilities of Chu Chuanyao and Qi Zhifan. This was taking preventive measures.</p><br/><p>As for the decision to give up the gourmet food industry to become a police officer\u2026</p><br/><p>He can say that although he was a foodie, but was this his childhood dream? Moreover, Uncle Qi was usually very handsome. Once he dressed in his police uniform, he was simply magnificent! Every time he\u2019d seen this in front of his eyes, he\u2019d been envious in his heart.</p><br/><p>For the next few weeks, due to the fact that the temporary transfer of school was too troublesome, it generally was impossible to have a back door. However, Qi Hao was still a second-level superintendent. He\u2019d step in and relied on his many relationships to get S Uni\u2019s president to reluctantly agree. However, the president also put forth his own conditions. He can make an exception to admit Wei Han, but Wei Han must pass the entrance exam score.</p><br/><p>Thus, Wei Han stayed at home everyday, cramming books until his entire body lost weight, brain cells quickly dying out, but this ugly person still has to study.</p><br/><p>This morning, slowly and leisurely eating bread and drinking milk, Qi Zhifan looked at the heavy, dark circles under his \u201cpanda older brother\u201d eyes. With two, three gulps, Wei Han finished the bowl of congee. Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyebrows arched. \u201cWei Han, would you die if you eat a bit slower?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, Dad Qi who was reading a magazine in the living room, had gradually discovered that Qi Zhifan had been eating more frequently at home, and his words seemed to have also increased.</p><br/><p>Big stomach Wei Han had picked up the second bowl of congee, and didn\u2019t even raise his eyelids. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Brother is very busy. I must read about tens of thousands of words every minute. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After living together for a month, Mother Wei summed up the difference between the two sons in terms of diet. For example, older brother Wei Han has a good appetite and eats three meals a day without being picky or partial to any food, with sweets being his true love, while the younger brother Qi Zhifan eats less food, focuses on ingesting food with high nutritional values, and could be described as smaller portions but more refined.</p><br/><p>Another example was the fact that the two brothers\u2019 table manners, one was in the elegant group, while the other was in the coarse and wild group. Of course, Wei Han belonged to the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to come to my school, but also want to be a police officer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan asked indifferently. He only thought the mouthful of bread was sweet and delicious, and that those sold outside couldn\u2019t compare to the ones Wei Han personally made.</p><br/><p>After living together for awhile, Qi Zhifan knew that Wei Han had a sweet tooth, so his Western-style desserts craft was first class. Of course, Wei Han also had no problem with Chinese-style meals, else how could even his simple congee be so delicious? It was so delicious that it made people have the urge to lick the bottom of the pot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you have an objection?\u201d Wei Han said in a bad mood. He\u2019d already clearly understood Qi Zhifan\u2019s frequent, poisonous tongue attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of resource if you don\u2019t become a chef,\u201d Qi Zhifan said with absolute confidence.</p><br/><p>Because of Qi Hao, Qi Zhifan really hated the police officer job. But from all the jobs, Wei Han unfortunately chose this job.</p><br/><p>What was so good about the police? Talk less to him about empty words and false truths, dreams were even more ridiculous. More went into the money-making industry.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Take his father for example. The usual work was very arduous, but also always on-duty, with no compensatory time off or paid on-duty expenses. Anyway, Qi Hao spent at least four months in a year sleeping in the duty room.</p><br/><p>Irregular overtime was a common occurrence. During the Chinese New Year holidays, it was often necessary to take up his post. There was danger at all times, and it was unknown which day he\u2019d lose his little life.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan always felt that his dad was crazy at the time, but who knew that now he\u2019d come across another foolish person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat until I become fat. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han seriously said. He didn\u2019t want to repeat the same mistakes. In this profession of making food, especially desserts, it was always unavoidable that he\u2019d get fat from eating.</p><br/><p>He had struggled in the food industry in his past life, and it had always been a rocky road. Even if he was gifted in the trade, he still couldn\u2019t win against the sinister people. Even if one day he really became a first-rate chef, but what about Chu Chuanyao? Would he lose him again?</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qi Zhifan instantly thought it made a bit of sense. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Your appetite\u2019s as big as a cow. Usually at home, you\u2019re like a living rice bucket. If you continue this trade later, according to how you eat, in the future you\u2019d definitely become cuddly. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cuddly! Your entire family is cuddly!\u201d Wei Han outraged, thoroughly bristled.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you my family now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han \u201cah ah\u201d blew up, with two swishes, he tossed the chopsticks and bowl on the dining table. He snatched Qi Zhifan not-yet-finished doughnut, and drank all of Qi Zhifan\u2019s remaining milk. He glared around, \u201cLater, don\u2019t you think about eating my home-cooked meals! I won\u2019t make them for you anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the domineering show of shouting out his grievances was done, Wei Han flung his arms and strode into his own room.</p><br/><p>No matter whether it was seven years ago or seven years later, the power of the \u201ccuddly\u201d word was still this great.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, Qi Zhifan was a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlop\u201d the magazine slipped from his hand. Dad Qi, who was sitting on the sofa in the living room was very surprised. Qi Zhifan turn his head to look at him. Father and son, the big one staring at the little one, looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>Dad Qi was a bit confused. Usually in the face of Qi Zhifan\u2019s poisonous tongue, good-tempered Wei Han would laugh and tolerate it. This time to be abnormally stirred up was an exception.</p><br/><p>Also, according to Qi Zhifan\u2019s temper, Qi Hao once thought that he wouldn\u2019t like Mother Wei and Wei Han, and at least for a short period of time, he\u2019d continue his \u201ccold war\u201d. Who knew\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fan, it seems like you really like this older brother, \u201d Dad Qi said a sentence.</p><br/><p>The tip of Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows jumped. Stiff-faced, he played it down, \u201cWrong. I only like eating what he makes. \u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>Mother Wei was visiting her friend today. Dad Qi had a temporary assignment at noon. Wei Han was still bored in his own room, and he settled his lunch with two buckets of instant noodles, not caring at all about his little brother Qi Zhifan\u2019s life and death.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Qi Zhifan calmly went out to a nearby restaurant for a turn. After returning home, his complexion became more filled with black clouds, flashing lightning and rolling thunder: what kind of things were they burning outside, how can they still not be shut down?</p><br/><p>After flipping through a pile of unread messages on his phone, Qi Zhifan found that the pack of rogues either came to invite him, or talked about the school department trifling matters. There was also Pei Yuyang vast number of constant narcissistic selfies\u2026</p><br/><p>The unhappy Great Qi chose to turn a blind eye and completely ignored them.</p><br/><p>Facing the computer, he played a game. There was always a group of dregs who wanted to hold his thigh, begging the great god to take them to power level, kneeling to request for a group to clear the boss. Qi Zhifan continued to ignore them. He was a VIP super member and top equipment <strong>RMB player.</strong> There was no pressure to solo clear the instances, and he did it completely without any pressure.</p><br/><p>After playing for a while, Qi Zhifan felt really bored, and considered that it was time to sell this account. Compared to other things, he really liked making money the most.</p><br/><p>At the time, the bored Qi Zhifan was hungry again. After all, half of his breakfast was suddenly robbed by Wei Han, and at lunch he just drank some soup and water outside.</p><br/><p>His mind in a tangle for a while, eventually Qi Zhifan still knocked on Wei Han\u2019s door. After knocking several times, still no one answered.</p><br/><p>The gloomy face Qi Zhifan thought that his older brother was really passionate about learning, studying to the state of selflessness, simply roaming in the sea of books, and directly buried in the sea of books.</p><br/><p>Without another way, Qi Zhifan had to use the spare key to open the door, but found that inside, there was a heavy object that seemed to be firmly braced against the door.</p><br/><p>Inside the door, Wei Han had indeed moved a table to brace against the door. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, he also used his back to desperately press against it, determined not to let Qi Zhifan come in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you come out. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t disturb this elder brother. I\u2019m reading a holy book to become a cultured man. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan has really endured enough. He used his foot to kick the door, \u201cIf you still don\u2019t come out, do you believe that I can make you never be able to enter S Uni?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Tch, so what? Wei Han stuck out his tongue. He didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cHumble me has already died. You can <strong>burn paper offerings</strong>. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then you wait and burn it for yourself,\u201d Qi Zhifan finished talking, and then made a phone call. He specifically put it on speakerphone to let Wei Han hear clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate Qi, it\u2019s you. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Through the door, Wei Han thought that this middle-aged uncle sounded a bit familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the new fine arts building over at the Dongcheng campus?\u201d Qi Zhifan mentioned casually. This was S Uni\u2019s eighth campus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, just a few days ago, I just asked, and it\u2019s basically completed. Speaking of which, it\u2019s still thanks to Classmate Qi\u2019s investment. Although you are the youngest among our S Uni\u2019s shareholders, but you\u2019ve contributed a lot to the university. Now, all the major campus facilities has gradually improved. \u201d The middle-aged uncle on the phone was clearly the president of S Uni.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, Qi Zhifan, you\u2019re so formidable. Does Uncle Qi know about this?</p><br/><p>\u201cBang\u201d Wei Han took the initiative and opened the door, just like a big bad wolf with tail upturned to the sky turning into a scared little rabbit.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan curled his lips. He was very satisfied with Wei Han\u2019s expression at the moment, \u201cDo you know the student \u2018Wei Han\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026isn\u2019t he your brother? A few days ago, in order to transfer to the school, your father also brought him to my office. Mr. Qi used his relationships and also sent money and gifts, but it was mainly because of you that I agreed\u2026\u201d The president paused and said carefully, \u201cBut you can rest assured: since I promised you that I\u2019d hide the fact that you are our school\u2019s shareholder, I wouldn\u2019t tell them. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, you should immediately\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan deliberately paused. Wei Han only felt at this moment that Qi Zhifan was enveloped in a halo of divine glory.</p><br/><p>With his hands clasped together and his eyes full of deep affection, Wei Han shook his head again and again, with a \u201ckneel to the great you\u201d posture. Good little brother\u2026no, older brother. You are my older brother, okay? You should be philanthropic. Grownups shouldn\u2019t settle accounts with lowly villains, please let me go!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s glance showed a smile and changed the topic, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Wait for him to pass the exam. There\u2019s no need for differential treatment. Just treat him like an ordinary student. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh,\u201d the president responded, and then both parties ended the call.</p><br/><p>Oh mother, Wei Han felt alive again. The light on Qi Zhifan was also extinguished, so his starry eyes also instantly became dead fish eyes. \u201cQi Zhifan, don\u2019t you just want me to cook for you everyday? Do you have to go so far?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d Qi Zhifan coldly raised his chin and said, \u201cWei Han, anyway, you only have this slightly useful point. Later on, you should obediently and willingly cook for me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201cHehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Get along with your \u201cwillingly\u201d! How did he really look so unpleasant.</p><br/><p>Thinking back to those years when Qi Zhifan, as Chu Chuanyao\u2019s friend, saw Wei Han for the first time, his attitude was arrogant and he even refused to shake his hand. He ridiculed Wei Han for being cuddly, definitely didn\u2019t have a girlfriend, bound to be lonely for a lifetime and so on\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan later stole away Chu Chuanyao, which became a great shadow to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>At night Wei Han, who always had an \u201caccount\u201d in his mind, specially prepared a new notebook to record the grudges between him and his \u201clove rival slag brother\u201d Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>The odd-numbered pages recorded the bad things that bastard Qi Zhifan did to him, and the even-numbered pages recorded his successful revenge.</p><br/><p>The first item on the first page: Qi Zhifan was my love rival in my past life!</p><br/><p>The second item on the second page: I\u2019m his older brother in this life!</p><br/><p>Then, Wei Han continued to write a lot of things: Qi Zhifan, who had been slaughtered by Mother Wei\u2019s dark vegetable soup; he\u2019d followed Qi Zhifan to the gay bar, and the bad things that happened; and the threatening incident that just happened this afternoon\u2026</p><br/><p>The more Wei Han wrote, the angrier he became. He saw the second page\u2019s list of events was far less than the first page\u2019s, and his mind became more unbalanced. Qi Zhifan was really troublesome, supremely odd and amazingly troublesome!</p><br/><p>Eh, Qi Zhifan? Odd Trouble (<strong>qi fanfan</strong>)?</p><br/><p>Wei Han had an instant vision in his head and immediately closed the book. On the outermost cover, he wrote \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record.\u201d</p><br/><p>After writing this, he admired these well-ordered, big Song font characters. After Wei Han thought about it, he realized that there strong scent of stupidity blowing in his face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What the hell was this name? <i>I must have been so angry that I became muddle-headed</i>. But for the time being, he was too lazy to care about it.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Wei Han pulled out his mobile phone and changed the name in the address book from Qi Zhifan to \u201cOdd Trouble\u201d.</p><br/><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li><strong>RMB player:</strong> RMB is renminbi, the Chinese currency.

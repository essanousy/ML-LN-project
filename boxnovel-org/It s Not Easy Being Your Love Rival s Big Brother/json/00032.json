It was late, and not far in front of the place, there was a figure squatting beside a fire in the middle of grilling something. The slightest scent slowly drifted over.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi wanted to stand up, but when he moved his feet, he suddenly felt a burst of tearing pain in his left ankle. He secretly cursed inside, pulled his voice out and shouted, \u201cHey! The blockhead in front\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The blockhead in front\u2026Wei Han, heard the sound and looked back, looking at Shao Yi rather gloomily.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong with this guy? Actually addressing his \u201csavior\u201d like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, this really is a blockhead.\u201d After seeing that it was Wei Han, Shao Yi muttered in a low voice out of the side of his mouth, and then beckoned to Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but knit his brows. No matter how he looked, why did he felt like Shao Yi was calling a dog ah?</p><br/><p>But he was a magnanimous adult and was too lazy to bicker with this lame person. Wei Han tolerated it, grabbed two skewers of grilled mushrooms and wild fruits and walked over, giving them to the mobility-impaired Shao Yi.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi wasn\u2019t polite at all. He took it, opened his mouth and bit. After eating a few mushrooms, he shook his head. \u201cNot hot enough! I want spicy food.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like he was an individual who wouldn\u2019t be pleased if it wasn\u2019t spicy. Wei Han laughed, \u201cHeheh, rest assured, I came prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Wei Han took out a pouch of hot sauce packets and ketchup packets.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No normal policeman wouldn\u2019t carry these kind of things, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat meat.\u201d Just eating some vegetarian things couldn\u2019t satisfy Shao Yi at all. These mushrooms and fruits in his belly would definitely be digested in a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t awake before, and I didn\u2019t dare to go far, so I couldn\u2019t get any meat ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen now that I\u2019m awake, you can go and get me some meat to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This man, why did he use this commanding tone and also looked like it was his right ah? Wei Han didn\u2019t owe him anything.</p><br/><p>A little angry, Wei Han really wanted to leave this arrogant and conceited guy without caring. But as soon as his gaze came to the injured left foot, he also became soft-hearted.</p><br/><p>After a while, Wei Han caught a few fish and came back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only fish. Don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t like to eat fish. If you like it, then eat it. If you don\u2019t, then forget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han said with a stiff face. He decided that if Shao Yi still used that kind of pompous attitude to order him around, he\u2019d really wash his hands and ignore him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi didn\u2019t utter a word, and bowed his head to deal with his own foot injury. Without bandages and splints, he had to find several thick branches to line together and tear his own clothes to tightly bind his ankle, temporarily fixing it in place.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw this and without saying anything further, went over to help. He\u2019d also learned a little of this kind of emergency measures before.</p><br/><p>After temporarily treating his left foot, Shao Yi slightly closed his eyes, leaning his against the big tree to rest for a bit. And Wei Han obediently crouched to one side to grill the fish. The fish fragrance rippled out. Shao Yi opened his eyes from time to time to look at Wei Han, his mood becoming more and more complicated.</p><br/><p><i>\u201ccough, cough\u2026</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>At night, the sleeping Shao Yi was awakened by the coughing sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>cough\u2026cough</i>, I\u2026I\u2019m sorry, for wake\u2026waking you\u2026<i>cough</i>, with my coughs, <i>cough</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Getting wet in the rain before, Wei Han had a little cold. Today, he was busy taking care of Shao Yi, and it seemed that his illness had worsened, starting to cough.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you know.\u201d Shao Yi was impatient on the surface when in fact, he still cared a bit in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Cough cough</i>\u2026then I\u2019ll go\u2026<i>cough</i>, over there to sleep\u2026\u201d Wei Han said, trying to get up. Shao Yi anxiously pulled him to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! In the middle of the night with only the two of us, if we don\u2019t sleep near to stay warm, then wouldn\u2019t we freeze to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, <i>cough cough</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded and couldn\u2019t help coughing twice.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi knitted his brows. This coughing sound really made him uncomfortable to hear. He took off his outer coat and covered Wei Han\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s pupils flashed, apparently startled. His black and bright eyes stared straight at Shao Yi. Shao Yi twitched his lips. Not knowing why, but unexpectedly, he somewhat didn\u2019t dare to look directly at his gaze. So he turned over his body to sleep.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>After Wei Han blanked for a few seconds, he suddenly felt that Shao Yi this person was really not bad and patted him. \u201cArrogant Shao, don\u2019t turn your back on me. Turn around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant Shao, why don\u2019t we shake hands?\u201d Wei Han earnestly said.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shao Yi also blanked for a moment, thought for a moment, then said, \u201cBefore this, can you properly call me by my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, o\u2026okay, Shao Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wei Han\u2019s voice just fell, Shao Yi turned over his body, his face changing from his previous unbridled arrogance, and now seemed to hide a little smile.</p><br/><p>Later, the two people began to slowly chat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Shao Yi, why have you always been targeting us before?\u201d This question had really been bothered Wei Han for a while.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi answered very frankly, \u201cAt first, it was because looking at you wasn\u2019t pleasing to the eye, and then I was a little envious of Jiang Chengrui. Later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi looked at Wei Han with profound meaning. \u201cI thought you were very interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little surprised. \u201cAh? Where am I interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe IQ is too low; it\u2019s very interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of weirdo reason was this ah!</p><br/><p>Fortunately it was now autumn and not winter season. Wrapped in Shao Yi\u2019s coat, Wei Han rested for a night, and the cough also eased a lot. During the day, Wei Han carried Shao Yi and just passed by a stream.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, quickly wash your face. It\u2019s so ugly that even your parents can\u2019t recognize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi suddenly opened his mouth and said. He\u2019d found out yesterday that Wei Han had a delicate and fair face. After being tossed around over the past few days, it had already been dirtied from early on.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face shook, and he put Shao Yi down. He immediately washed his face with water, and then cupped a handful of water and also helped Shao Yi to wipe his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Shao, we\u2019re both the same; you\u2019re not that much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi was startled, a little happy, and also a little unhappy.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Wei Han carried Shao Yi and didn\u2019t walk for long when Qi Zhifan and the others found them and hurried over. Following behind them were a few younger brothers who were searching for Shao Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second before, just hearing Qi Zhifan\u2019s impatient yell, Wei Han was foolishly in a daze and hadn\u2019t reacted yet, when this second, Qi Zhifan ran over in front of him.</p><br/><p>But once he saw Shao Yi on Wei Han\u2019s back, the anxiety in Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes instantly turned into cold displeasure.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was caught off guard by his glare and he quickly put down Shao Yi from his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Shao, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d It happened to be that pointy mouth, monkey-cheeked younger brother who gathered around at this time, and supported Shao Yi with another person.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi shook his head and said nothing. Sweeping the several people with a glance, he found that they were black and blue, clearly beaten up by someone. It was estimated that after the wild boars had scattered them, Qi Zhifan\u2019s group gave them a lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, are you okay? Were you hurt? We\u2019ve been looking for you all day and all night for fear that something had happened to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui also asked in concern. Only now did Wei Han found out that he was actually carried on Pei Yuyang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Little Jiang, instead you, this\u2026what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui only said a few words when he was interrupted by Pei Yuyang, \u201cAi, Curlie was bitten by a snake. Fortunately, the snake was not poisonous and it isn\u2019t serious for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui was a bit embarrassed and swatted Pei Yuyang. \u201cThis is nothing. You shouldn\u2019t make a fuss. Quickly put me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot putting, dead still won\u2019t put down! I just like carrying Curlie. It doesn\u2019t matter even if I carry you for a lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s whole body was immediately covered in goosebumps. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey hey, you\u2019re showing love in front of so many people. This kind of dog abuse, is it really good?</p><br/><p>Not yet finished with his rueful sigh, Wei Han was suddenly pulled aside by Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, you\u2026what\u2026what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Qi Zhifan suddenly hugged Wei Han with both arms wrapped tightly, burying his head in the hollow of Wei Han\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Feeling Qi Zhifan\u2019s warm breath on his neck, Wei Han couldn\u2019t stop trembling. This kind of deep emotion, extremely ambiguous hugging posture was all wrong ah!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p><i>ba-dump! </i></p><br/><p><i>ba-dump! ba-dump! ba-dump! </i></p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s little heart began to jump quickly.</p><br/><p>In the end, Qi Zhifan held Wei Han for half a day. Wei Han, blinking his eyes, waited half a day for him to speak, but Qi Zhifan stared blankly and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>The seven days of field survival training was over. Within these seven days, the thirty trainees, including the special cases of Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang, simply felt like a day dragged past like a year, but good or bad, they still passed.</p><br/><p>After that, Wei Han and the others had been in C City\u2019s training for almost three months. One day later, the instructor suddenly informed them of the good news: the general idea was that the participants in the field survival training could go home early to rest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone cheered.</p><br/><p>While Wei Han and the others were immersed in joy and preparing to pack their bags to go home, Shao Yi asked Qi Zhifan to come out alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, I really didn\u2019t expect Wei Han that blockhead would actually have such a younger brother like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t speak, regarded as tacitly agreeing.</p><br/><p>Previously, he\u2019d thought that Shao Yi dared to bully Wei Han and saw him as especially unlikable. Now, when he thought about how this man had actually stayed alone with Wei Han for a day and a night, he was even more incredibly annoyed and quite hated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stiff-faced. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not looking for you to fight this time. I just want you to help me thank him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, the light in Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils changed and he said lightly, \u201cThis kind of thing, you should personally tell him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi heard and laughed out loud, \u201cHaha, that\u2019s right, but I\u2019m afraid that once I see him, I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s he talking about? Qi Zhifan knitted his brows, and the light in his pupils became sharp, his mind also going on alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to know what happened to us in that one day and one night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan had asked Wei Han about this matter. Wei Han had laughed foolishly and hadn\u2019t said much, only saying that Shao Yi broke his foot and that they didn\u2019t fight, but shook hands.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan still silent, Shao Yi just went on, \u201cI broke my ankle and temporarily couldn\u2019t walk. That blockhead just carried me all the way. Not only that, but he also helped me treat my foot injury, grilled fish for me to eat, and even washed my face, haha.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, when we slept together at night, his coughs were noisy to death. It\u2019s estimated that the cold is not good yet. You go home and take good care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan tightly clenched his fists in anger. Fuck, he really didn\u2019t want to know these details!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family. I will take care of it, no need to trouble you, outsider,\u201d Qi Zhifan said coldly, a thread of displeasure rising in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOutsider?\u201d Shao Yi laughed in disagreement, \u201cHeh, that\u2019s true now, but maybe not later. I seemed to be a little bent by Wei Han.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Pop</i>! Qi Zhifan ferociously clenched his knuckles.</p><br/><p>In the future, Wei Han must not be allowed to step into C City again. Otherwise, there\u2019d be a chance of meeting this Shao Yi again.</p><br/><p>Upon returning home, he\u2019d make Wei Han take three baths and wash well, then eat well, and also take medicine, drink plenty of water and sleep. Grilled fish? Wait until Wei Han\u2019s recovered, then he\u2019d let Wei Han grill fish for him to eat, grill lots and lots of fish.</p><br/><p>What else? Washing his face? Hmph, later, he\u2019d let Wei Han wash his face, and if he was willing, they could also take a bath together.</p><br/><p>On the way home together afterwards, Wei Han had no idea that his little brother had these kind of thoughts. He only felt that Qi Zhifan was always staring at him, staring until he felt uncomfortable from head to foot.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Wei Han had to turn to look at the scenery outside the window, but the little heart \u201c<i>thump thump</i>\u201d jumped uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Returning to the long-lost home, the two brothers went back to their own rooms. They were separated by a wall, each with their own thoughts.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan laid in bed, weighing the sexy pink panties in his hand. He felt that after the field survival training, the time was ripe and couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He must take action once again.</p><br/><p>And Wei Han, holding a pen, was staring at the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d, lost in thought.</p><br/><p>From the last page of the notebook, the pages of \u201cgood\u201d things Odd Trouble had done for him had already exceeded the \u201cbad\u201d pages in front. Each item and each matter on paper suddenly became heavy. Was it because Odd Trouble had more weight in his heart?</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

After passing through piece after piece of green fields, they finally reached their destination.</p><br/><p>The entire leisure resort was built along a long and narrow blue water bay, where tourists can go rafting, boating, fishing, etc. In order to create a theme of \u2018return to nature\u2019 style, most of the surrounding view was of level terrain. There were also rolling hills that could be used for outdoor climbing, bungee jumping and other sports.</p><br/><p>Every holiday, there were a lot of tourists here. It was a full-service waterscape resort facility, and there were also many special village boarding houses, but also barbecue, picnic, leisure and sightseeing areas.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were also some places that had not been developed, such as farmhouses scattered among large fields of wheat with chickens and cattle, where the natural scenery was preserved.</p><br/><p>After selecting their hotel and eating lunch, the family had a little rest before they went fishing together.</p><br/><p>Speaking of those rotten parent-child outfits, Wei Han couldn\u2019t bear to look at it and put on a normal coat before he dared to go out. Looking back at Qi Zhifan, he also wore a coat, and his previous pale face slightly improved.</p><br/><p>Near the fishing area was a local tea garden, where they could faintly see women busy picking tea leaves. There were also old people chatting leisurely in the tea shop. Accompanied by soaring water mist and the fragrance of tea overflowing, it immediately made people feel comfortable.</p><br/><p>However, when Wei Han held the rod for a long time and couldn\u2019t catch a fish, he began to get frustrated.</p><br/><p>Looking to the side at Qi Zhifan, he saw that he wore sunglasses and had a fishing rod in hand. He leisurely sat on a small stool and looked just like that.</p><br/><p>But Wei Han carefully looked at the water. Qi Zhifan\u2019s float also had no movement for a long time. Then he looked at Dad Qi again: that was what was really called a professional. From Mother Wei\u2019s cheers, they had already caught several fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, never thought that this God of Study would be the same as me this time, and can\u2019t catch any fish.\u201d Is it because he\u2019s too clever and deceitful, but still unable to trick the fish into liking him? Wei Han had a rare chance to ridicule Qi Zhifan once.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s voice just fell when Qi Zhifan took off his sunglasses and looking coldly, said, \u201cAre you a pig? Fishing is not just about the brain, but also must be patient enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stifled, and secretly cursed. If he\u2019s a pig, then Odd Trouble was a pig\u2019s little brother, and also a pig, a stupid pig brother.</p><br/><p>Also, did this count as having discovered a small weakness of Qi Zhifan? Not good at fishing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Han, fishing is actually very challenging. Not only do you hold the fishing rod, but you also have to keep an eye on the float. Once there is a downward movement, you have to hurry to lift up the pole. There are several ways you can lift up the pole, like I usually turn the wrist quickly, or else if the speed is slow, the fish can use that opportunity to slip away. And patience is very important. Without patience, it\u2019s hard to make gains.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing both of his sons were empty-handed, the experienced Dad Qi slowly explained.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded, eyes bright, and listened carefully: didn\u2019t expect that a small thing like fishing, there were also so many things to learn. Uncle Qi wasn\u2019t only handsome, but he also had charisma.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei counted the fish in the bucket and smiled at Dad Qi, gently wiping the fine sweat off his forehead for him. They only communicated with their eyes, and they didn\u2019t have to say much to each other. She just quietly accompanied him, and indeed, the years will be good.</p><br/><p>Compared to his previous life where she was lying wan and sallow on the bed, eyes dim and spiritless, seeing the present Mother Wei\u2019s clear eyes overflowing with happiness and with a sweet smile on her face, Wei Han felt a kind of sweetness well up from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>So, no matter how horrid Qi Zhifan was, he would endure his temper and continue living with him in order to not destroy the warmth and harmony of this family, but also for his mother\u2019s happiness.</p><br/><p>At this moment, not only was Wei Han filled with many emotions, but even Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit moved.</p><br/><p>He had thought that when his stepmother brought his new older brother to their house, that he would be very resistant. However, the truth was that it wasn\u2019t the case. Somehow, he couldn\u2019t refuse Mother Wei\u2019s smile, the warmth in her smile always reminding him of his own mother, and had a hint of those cherished memories.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>What\u2019s more, because of the demands of his dad\u2019s police work, he was with his family less and away more, and could be in a life-threatening situation at any time. This woman didn\u2019t mind, and many times just lightly laughed, being even more understanding and tolerant.</p><br/><p>Looking at the edge of Qi Hao\u2019s lips slightly curved up, Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t feel like arguing about it anymore. Forget it, let that woman stay with his family\u2019s old man.</p><br/><p>Coming behind Wei Han and seeing he was still staring stupidly, Qi Zhifan pulled the corner of his mouth, \u201cHey, how long do you want to be a <b>light bulb</b>? We should go.\u201d (T/N: a third wheel)</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026oh, oh,\u201d Wei Han distractedly nodded. Seeing Qi Zhifan turned and walked away, he also hurried to follow up.</p><br/><p>In order to let Dad Qi and Mother Wei show their affections as much as they liked, the two sons walked away from the fishing area.</p><br/><p>After finding Qi Hao\u2019s car, Qi Zhifan directly opened the rear door, and then threw the car key in his hand to Wei Han. He lightly said, \u201cTake it. You drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he entered the car first to sit and didn\u2019t give Wei Han the slightest chance to refuse. His appearance was like a young master waiting to be served.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was really speechless. Forced to become young master Qi\u2019s chauffeur: \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWherever. You drive slowly to see the scenery also works.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chauffeur Wei Han, a bit resentful, started the car. For the time being, he didn\u2019t think of anywhere good to go, so only went deeper into the forest.</p><br/><p>Sitting in the backseat, Qi Zhifan took out his mobile phone and wanted to go online to see the ups and downs of his stocks. In the end, the car went out too far and there was no signal. Then he looked at some puzzle games on his mobile phone, but he also cleared the games early on. Bored, Qi Zhifan laid down and decided to rest for awhile.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked in the rearview mirror. Ah, Qi Zhifan was actually enjoying a nap, but made him drive the car for him without a clear destination, and made him endure a lot of pressure and confusion. Based on what ah!</p><br/><p>Wei Han grew even angrier, turned the direction toward the rugged terrain of the ecological natural area, and stepped on the gas pedal, angrily driving forward.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan in the backseat didn\u2019t have his seat belt fastened, and naturally, he couldn\u2019t sleep peacefully on the bumpy road.</p><br/><p>Body thrown up and down, Qi Zhifan felt that his heart and lungs had been bounced out. He narrowed his eyes, \u201cWei\u30fcHan\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was happy inside, but on the surface still pretended to be full of seriousness, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, good little brother? Also, can you stop yelling at me so emotionally? It\u2019s nauseating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s beautiful appearance was full of impassioned anger, \u201cWhere is this? Do you know that you\u2019re driving in no man\u2019s land?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this way, I also don\u2019t know where this is. Didn\u2019t you tell me to drive wherever? I\u2019m being very casual and thought about getting us closer to nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was angered speechless, and opened the window to get some fresh air.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the wheel hit a big rock with a big impact. Qi Zhifan was caught off guard and wasn\u2019t paying attention. The mobile phone in his hand with a \u201cwhoosh\u201d flew out, drawing a long parabolic arc in the air\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStop the car!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was furious, and the frightened Wei Han immediately stepped on the brake, resulting in Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead getting slammed with a \u201cthump\u201d.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long period of deathly stillness, the two people, with one green and one white complexion, got out of the car. Wei Han was ashamed in his heart and he was cringing with a pale face. As for Qi Zhifan, there\u2019s no need to think about it: his forehead had a red lump and the area between his eyebrows was also shrouded in an ashen haze.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was the first to gather himself and went past to take a look. It was very tragic. Qi Zhifan\u2019s mobile phone had unerringly fallen into a pile of cow dung, uh, reeking and hot.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s footsteps approached, also coming over. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han froze on the spot. He only felt the chill behind him, the temperature around him suddenly dropping over ten degrees. He didn\u2019t need to look back. He could also predict that Qi Zhifan\u2019s face must have turned from green to black, the purplish kind of black.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. This\u2026this really was an accident. I also didn\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trembling from the bottom of his heart, Wei Han also knew he\u2019d made a big mistake, and he waited for the speech from the great master Qi. Who knew that he waited for a long time, but Qi Zhifan behind him didn\u2019t speak. His chilly gaze was absolutely enough to drill a hole in Wei Han\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The footsteps sounded again, but gradually got further away. Wei Han, puzzled, looked back and found that Qi Zhifan had already sat in the driver\u2019s seat. He didn\u2019t even gave him one glance, planning to directly go and leave him there.</p><br/><p>Wei Han anxiously ran as though with a wind under his feet, and regardless of the consequences, blocked in front of Qi Zhifan\u2019s car. Fortunately, his eyes were sharp and hands swift, or else this heartless little brother would really abandon him to be lost here, cold and dismal, miserable and distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, isn\u2019t it just a cellphone? At worst, wait for me to collect enough money, and I\u2019d compensate you with another one.\u201d Now in the weak position, Wei Han smiled apologetically, \u201cLet me get in the car, okay? This time I\u2019ll obediently be your driver. Guaranteed before dark, we can return to mom and Uncle Qi safe and sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan disdained to pay heed, turned the key to start the car, and slowly closed the window. Wei Han felt even more panic and hurriedly extended his hand in, \u201cHey hey, even if we\u2019re not blood-related, but we\u2019ve been together for so long. In any case, I\u2019m still your brother. You can\u2019t abandon your older brother this way. It\u2019s inhuman.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was too busy to listen to Wei Han\u2019s babbling when Wei Han\u2019s wrist got caught. Qi Zhifan frowned, and then lowered the window. \u201cWei Han, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s words were suddenly interrupted because Wei Han took that opportunity to extend his arm and pull out the car key!</p><br/><p>Clenching his teeth, he threw it forcefully into the distance\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t go, then don\u2019t you think of going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Qi Zhifan held his head. Wei Han, this dolt, made his simple headache spread out until he wanted to die.</p><br/><p>In the evening, the eco-natural area near the resort, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, two people just wandered through the the natural scenery of the wheat fields that had been left untouched by human development and over-exploitation.</p><br/><p>Anger had clouded his mind before, but now calmed down, Wei Han squatted on the ridge and hugged his head in annoyance. Rambling to himself, he was feeling extremely painful and tangled in his heart.</p><br/><p>If they don\u2019t return before dark, mom and Uncle Qi would definitely be worried. It\u2019d be turning dark soon. There were no street lights here, and in the pitch darkness, they\u2019d get lost. How can they drive back then?</p><br/><p>The main point was that he didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d thrown the car key! When did his arm become so amazing? Could it be that they\u2019d have to sleep in the wilderness tonight? Still, being together with Qi Zhifan, ai, was the impulse of the devil\u2026</p><br/><p>Not feeling like minding the incomparably remorseful Wei Han, Qi Zhifan looked all around. According to the location of where the car was previously, he inferred the direction of where the car key might have fallen. After searching fruitlessly, he locked target on a farmhouse big yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, come here.\u201d Then Qi Zhifan led Wei Han and walked over.</p><br/><p>When the lost Wei Han saw the large yard, his hope immediately rekindled, and his eyes lit up. \u201cGreat, this must be where the farmers live. We can let them take us in for a night.\u201d</p><br/><p>But in the next second, Qi Zhifan poured cold water over him. \u201cDon\u2019t be happy too soon. I just tried to knock on the door. No one was there, but there were a lot of dog barking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI reckon the key fell behind this wall. You climb in and pick it up for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s finger pointed at Wei Han. Wei Han stared foolishly, and seemingly uncertain, asked, \u201d Are you sure you want me to go pick it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Qi Zhifan was very sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we have an agreement. Don\u2019t you change your mind halfway.\u201d Wei Han grinned and turned his eyes. \u201cThe wall is so high, you\u2019ve got to prop me up. Let me step on your shoulders to go up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan deeply felt that being together with Wei Han\u2019s foolishness for a long time, his IQ would be severely pulled down.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

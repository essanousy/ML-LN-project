People could breathe the fresh air, ride horses on the country roads, and feel the charm of nature. It was indeed a good place for people who lived in the city to relax.</p><br/><p>There was a 3,000-meter straight race track and a 1,000-meter cross-country race track, as well as an approximately 30,000-square-meter of lawn equestrian training and practice venue. During weekends in the spring and autumn, there would be the occasional horse racing events.</p><br/><p>The stables had first-class equipment, was spacious and tall, with good lighting and natural grazing combined with regular manual feeding. The horses grew well and could breed many European thoroughbred horses. Not only that, but the jockey club could also assist members in fostering, training and breeding horses. They also offer equestrian training courses taught by professional coaches.</p><br/><p>In addition, there was also a warm and comfortable indoor swimming pool, a fully-equipped gym, a quaint and elegant tea room as well as a coffee shop, a chess room and other recreational and entertainment facilities.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan was senior member here. He first took Wei Han to pick a horse and Wei Han chose a big brown horse, feeling that it was tall and mighty, eyes sparkling and spirited. With a glance, he could see it had a special spirit.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Wei Han rode a horse in his life. At the beginning, he was too embarrassed to tell Leng Yan because of his face. As a result, when he started riding, he immediately felt unbalanced. He hadn\u2019t gotten used to it yet when the uncle who was working made a <em>yo</em> sound and slapped its buttocks, giving the horse the command to set off.</p><br/><p>As soon as the horse began to walk, Wei Han\u2019s whole body jolted and swayed around, in danger of falling at any time. And not a few steps later, the ground had a wet mud pit. With the horse feet both dipping below and in the shallows, it was even worse for Wei Han who was sitting on the horse. His butt also didn\u2019t know how to sit, and the calves were always rubbed raw with waves of pain.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to make the horse stop, but he didn\u2019t know how to use the reins in his hands. Leng Yan on the side saw this and hurriedly helped Wei Han to pull the rope and then reached out to stroke the disobedient horse.</p><br/><p>The brown horse seemed to feel something. The horse\u2019s hooves stopped and it immediately lowered its head.</p><br/><p>After seeing the horse immediately lose its spirit, Wei Han looked at Leng Yan\u2019s cold and resolute face and his mouth pulled. He wryly smiled and said, \u201cSix Hot, it seems like you\u2019re really disliked by animals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan silently pulled his hand back, and only coldly <em>mm</em> a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst time riding?\u201d Leng Yan asked.</p><br/><p>Wei Han gave a hollow laugh. \u201cYeah, Six Hot, don\u2019t laugh at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan shook his head and then taught Wei Han some common sense of horseback riding. He told him that he only had to put the first half of the foot in the stirrups. When cantering or galloping, the calves, knees and thighs inside should be clamped firmly, and the butt didn\u2019t need to be stuck to the saddle. If he wanted to stop, tighten the reins; if he wanted to turn left, he needed to pull the left side of the reins; and if he wanted to turn right, then he need to pull on the right side.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded. According to Leng Yan\u2019s method, he lifted the reins with both hands and clamped the belly of the horse with his legs. Then he lightly called <em>jia</em> and the horse began to trot and then ran faster and faster, running farther and farther away.</p><br/><p>In the wake of the pounding of the hooves, Wei Han gradually mastered the essential of riding. The wind blowing in his hair, his heart also unconsciously became exhilarated. For the first time, he deeply felt what was called \u2018galloping in the wind\u2019.</p><br/><p>After a while, the horse may have tired as its speed gradually slowed down. The horse that had just lowered its head and charged in a spurt of energy was now leisurely throwing its head to look around. Wei Han released a hand to gently stroke it, feeling that it was both clever and very human.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan rode the horse over and then followed up, \u201cIs it fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I suddenly feel very handsome.\u201d Wei Han smiled happily.</p><br/><p>At the same time, although Wei Han had already notified Qi Zhifan in advance, but Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t trust Wei Han to meet Leng Yan alone and quietly followed him.</p><br/><p>When he was picking the horse, he happened to meet Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi\u2026Senior Qi! H\u2026hello!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not seeing Qi Zhifan for a long time, Chu Chuanyao was a bit nervous. Different from his relations with Wei Han, he was a bit afraid of Qi Zhifan. For various reasons, he\u2019d always seen Qi Zhifan\u2019s frowning and angry appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan said coldly. Whenever he saw Chu Chuanyao\u2019s face, Qi Zhifan always had a moment of being in a trance, but even more, he remembered the matter of Wei Han pursuing him before.</p><br/><p>Him, Leng Yan, and Shao Yi: why were there so many \u2018love rivals\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I haven\u2019t been riding for a long time and heard a friend said that here wasn\u2019t bad so I came to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao laughed and said. In fact, the reason why he came here was similar to Qi Zhifan\u2019s. Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t trust Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao was worried about Leng Yan.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you come here, Senior Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m about the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan fancied a black horse, while Chu Chuanyao picked a docile horse. He\u2019d ridden a few times as a child. It had been too long now and he\u2019d forgotten a bit, so he was less likely to be able to ride.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan saw his difficulties in a glance. \u201cTo avoid any accidents, just follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>On this side, Wei Han promised to help Chu Chuanyao to chase Leng Yan, so he couldn\u2019t only do horseback riding and forget about the business.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Six Hot, you\u2026what\u2019s your impression of Little Yao?\u201d Wei Han asked somewhat awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid,\u201d Leng Yan said straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s mouth pulled. This was too fucking direct.</p><br/><p>He wryly laughed twice and then asked, \u201cIs there anything else? For example, what do you think of his looks? What are some of the advantages?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan lowered his eyebrows and thought, also remaining silent.</p><br/><p>Was this a difficult question? Was it necessary to think that long? Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but ask with a thick face, \u201cThen what\u2019s your impression of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>cough cough</i>, Six Hot, why did you want to get to know me in the beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, he was distressed because of his love for Qi Zhifan. After sending a help post on the same-sex dating forum, he\u2019d received several private messages from Leng Yan the next day and he\u2019d said that he wanted to know him. At that time, Wei Han really thought he\u2019d met a mental case.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan lifted his eyes and looked at Wei Han with a meaningful look: \u201cSimilar IDs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Uh, Wei Han swore it was genuinely random. Because Qi Zhifan had nicknamed him \u2018Stomach Cold\u2019, it had made him a bit resentful, so he simply took <em>Stomach Very Hot Very Hot Ah</em>.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides this?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Leng Yan immediately pulled out the phone and quickly typed out\u3010I think your story was good, you can be novel material\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s mouth shook again and again. \u201cGreat Hot, then can you consider writing a HE in the next book?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan shook his head decisively, but his deep eyes suddenly shot forward, gazing far off into the distance. \u201cWei Han, actually, I\u2019ve always wanted to find someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing Leng Yan\u2019s earnestness and seriousness, Wei Han also straightened his face and no longer joked: \u201cWho are you looking for? You\u2019ve never found them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lifesaver when I was a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this situation? Wei Han almost fell off the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d In the next second, Leng Yan suddenly shouted, his voice suddenly rising. He saw a crazy horse with red eyes in front of him rushing straight toward them!</p><br/><p>Leng Yan hurriedly pulled the reins and was able to the control the panic of his horse. But Wei Han didn\u2019t have much experience. Both he and the horse were frightened, and then his horse suddenly turned around and bolted with Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Leng Yan hurried after him and saw that Wei Han was almost thrown off by a rough bump. He stretched out his right arm and held him in the desperate moment, pulling Wei Han into his arms and letting Wei Han sit steady on his horse.</p><br/><p>Then, several staff members emerged and quieted down the two horses.</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of Leng Yan, Wei Han patted his chest, still a little shaken. \u201cThank\u2026thank you, Six Hot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan shook his head and carefully reminded, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You have to pay attention next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Wei Han, with immense gratitude, smiled back at Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan and Chu Chuanyao appeared, they saw this intimate scene where Leng Yan was holding Wei Han and the two were riding on one horse.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan returned home, and seeing that Qi Zhifan always had a cold face, Wei Han had more and more of a headache, feeling that wherever he went, he could clearly smell the scent of an overturned jar of vinegar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Trouble, don\u2019t be angry. Being angry is bad for the body,\u201d Wei Han smiled ingratiatingly and leaned over to hammer and massage Qi Zhifan\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t always knit your brows. This doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han said while tracing Qi Zhifan\u2019s long eyebrows with his fingers. Facing the Great Beauty Qi\u2019s face made Wei Han a bit \u2018smitten\u2019. His family\u2019s Trouble was really a natural-born beauty, even when he was angry, he was still so good-looking. If he was willing to laugh, then there was no need to mention.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but sing: \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful in my heart, every smile makes me intoxicated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop singing, unpleasant to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Somehow, even though Wei Han singing was out of tune and sung randomly, Qi Zhifan\u2019s mouth scolded, but a hint of joy rose in his heart. He must absolutely be crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just want to sing\u2026<i>uh uhh\u2026</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>Words hadn\u2019t finished when Wei Han\u2019s mouth was blocked by Qi Zhifan\u2019s kiss, his entire person also caught in Qi Zhifan\u2019s arms, causing Wei Han to cling to his chest and feel his strong heartbeat.</p><br/><p>For a time, they kissed each other and were loathed to part. Qi Zhifan not only stole Wei Han\u2019s breath, but also used his tongue to stir, sometimes entangling Wei Han\u2019s little tongue, but also greedily sucking his pure and sweet, fragrant saliva. With the intentions to punish, he vowed to kiss Wei Han until his whole body went soft before he would be willing to give up.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Entangled for a while, this overbearing kiss went on until Wei Han was gasping for breath before it ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, I still need to punish you.\u201d The color of Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes were extremely dark, strongly pulsing with something.</p><br/><p>\u201cPunish\u2026what punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>At last able to breathe in fresh air, Wei Han\u2019s poor lips had been bitten red and swollen, and it was moistened and glistening seductively with bodily fluid.</p><br/><p>\u201cPunish you to help me quench the fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, Qi Zhifan pulled Wei Han\u2019s hand and dragged it slowly over his chest and lower abdomen, all the way down to explore his crotch and that prominently jutting bulge.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s hand stopped for a moment. Feeling Qi Zhifan\u2019s terrible size and heat, the heart in his chest cavity crazily jumped, and he hung his head, thinking of the many shameful postures in bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan said once again, his voice slowly becoming low and husky.</p><br/><p>Wei Han flushed with excitement and had to kneel down. He pulled Qi Zhifan\u2019s zipper down and lowered his head, using his mouth to suck Qi Zhifan\u2019s hard and fiery thing. Immediately, the strong taste that belonged exclusively to Qi Zhifan assaulted his senses, stimulating Wei Han\u2019s nostrils and making his lower abdomen also impatiently heat up.</p><br/><p>His small mouth was crammed full. The inexperienced Wei Han didn\u2019t know much techniques, and he could only slowly lick it and at the same time, use his hands to gently rub the two round sacks below.</p><br/><p>A burst of numbing currents came from below and dispersed all the way through his body. Enjoying the \u201cspecial service\u201d, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes became more still, that place also becoming even more enlarged and hard, further propping open Wei Han\u2019s mouth. He also deliberately thrust deep into Wei Han\u2019s throat, making Wei Han\u2019s eyes suddenly overflow with a bit of tears.</p><br/><p>Still feeling sorry for Wei Han, Qi Zhifan drew out a breath before he pulled out his fiery heat. However, he didn\u2019t intend to let Wei Han off like this. He saw that Wei Han seemed to be very happy when he was riding the horse today, why not\u2026</p><br/><p>Patting his thighs, Qi Zhifan gave Wei Han a meaningful glance: \u201cCome sit up here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared blankly for a moment. In fact just now, it had also raised his own fire below, so he obediently parted his legs, took a few deep breaths and then slowly and carefully, tentatively sat down.</p><br/><p>In a flash, there was a tearing pain. Wei Han only took in the first half of Qi Zhifan, and he felt that it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to completely take it all in.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good, re\u2026relax a little\u2026\u201d It was so tight that even Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t feeling better. He licked Wei Han\u2019s ears, one hand tenderly stroking the penis in front, soothing and encouraging him.</p><br/><p>Slowly, Wei Han\u2019s pain diminished and his sense of pleasure climbed up again. Seeing Qi Zhifan in front of him with his forehead clearly covered in a layer of fine sweat and surely must have endured very hard, Wei Han clenched his teeth and then firmly sank his waist down. In an instant, the pain of being torn and the feeling of being filled simultaneously rushed to Wei Han\u2019s brain.</p><br/><p>After that, Qi Zhifan\u2019s waist continued to rise up, ramming into the deeper places. With an intense sense of crushing, it almost felt like Wei Han\u2019s heart and lungs were almost bumped out, the inside unceasingly spread open by a foreign body. Wei Han only felt that the heat had already burned him from his head to his feet. His mouth cried out in a burst of broken sounds, and the front was also erect, ramrod straight and eager for release.</p><br/><p>Finally, when Wei Han\u2019s back was slammed by burst after burst of electric currents, even his toes couldn\u2019t help curling up, and a white liquid sprayed out. At the same time, another heat flow also poured into his body, heating Wei Han to tremble all over in confusion, also becoming sticky between his thighs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, both of their brains were blank, holding each other and gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>Arms around Qi Zhifan\u2019s neck, Wei Han whispered, somewhat shy to say: \u201cOdd Trouble, when you see Little Yao, would you think of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Would you think of your unsuccessful first love, think of Ou Yizhe?</p><br/><p>QI Zhifan immediately understood what he meant. \u201cYes, but I will remember even more that there was a fool who told me how much he liked Chu Chuanyao, but also vowed to that he must catch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled and could only helplessly force out two laughs, \u201cHaha, Odd Trouble, you have a good memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a good memory, especially for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words Qi Zhifan blurted out instantly caused Wei Han to blush. He burrowed into Qi Zhifan\u2019s bosom. \u201cOdd Trouble, I used to be a fool before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you quite self-aware?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han lowly hummed an agreement, making Qi Zhifan a little surprised. Unexpectedly, this fool actually didn\u2019t say a word to refute this time?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t sulk by yourself.\u201d Qi Zhifan patted him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, he\u2019d felt more than once that he was really unlucky to run into Qi Zhifan in his two lifetimes. But now, he found out how lucky he was.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

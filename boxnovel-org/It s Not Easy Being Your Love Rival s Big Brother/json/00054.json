He thought that this fool must be very moved at this time, so he was waiting for him to open his mouth and say a few nice words to him.</p><br/><p>Who knew that after they faced each other for a few seconds, Wei Han just closed his eyes and passed out.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, seeing that Wei Han had already fallen deeply asleep, Qi Zhifan carried him into the car and drove all the way back home.</p><br/><p>Back home, Qi Zhifan directly carried Wei Han into the bathroom. He let Wei Han sit on his lap and then with the head resting on his own shoulder, began to slowly take off Wei Han\u2019s clothes and scrub his naked body.</p><br/><p>Wiping and wiping, the color in Qi Zhifan\u2019s pupils gradually grew darker, and the movement of his hand also stopped. He unwittingly stuck to Wei Han\u2019s neck and deliberately blew there.</p><br/><p>This burst of hot air immediately touched Wei Han\u2019s sensitive nerves. Even in a daze, he couldn\u2019t help but tremble.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Zhifan intensified his \u2018mischief\u2019, extending his deft tongue and sliding it gently over Wei Han\u2019s cheek, the outer shell of his ear as well as his slender neck, suddenly and repeatedly teasing him. At the same time, he used one hand to rub and pinch the two small red dots on Wei Han\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Mn umph\u2026</i>\u201d when he received this kind of stimulation, Wei Han felt peculiar and lightly uttered a groan, his two brows also couldn\u2019t resist squeezing together. However, he didn\u2019t know that this excited Qi Zhifan even more. He nibbled at Wei Han\u2019s collarbone, kissing his smooth body. He went all the way down and then suddenly sucked the two beads on Wei Han\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qi Zhifan was holding Wei Han and buried his head in his chest, using his tongue to circle Wei Han\u2019s two little haw fruits, torturing these two poor little things to become increasingly red and erect.</p><br/><p>In the face of Qi Zhifan\u2019s biting and licking, Wei Han was both aching and itchy, his body gradually heating up. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and shook his head while trying to push Qi Zhifan away.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, you\u2026you bastard!\u201d the writhing Wei Han abruptly scolded.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan heard this and blanked for a moment. The next second, he ruthlessly bit the little red dot on Wei Han\u2019s left side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Wei Han was pained and immediately cried out. He grabbed Qi Zhifan\u2019s hair and pulled in retaliation. \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2026you threatening me at every turn, poisonous tongue, picky eater, money grubbing, and\u2026and afraid of ghosts, big bastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han angrily cursed out these words. Qi Zhifan suddenly realized that something was wrong and then he let go of the two poor little red dots and looked somewhat doubtful at Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s eyes were half open and his mouth was slightly pouting, still not completely sober. But he seemed to be very angry and started to beat on Qi Zhifan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>The powerless fists pounded, and suddenly, two tears fell from the corner of his eyes. \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re obviously so annoying, but I\u2026but I still like you so much, love you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart unexpectedly ached, suffering a big impact. Beside when they were doing those things in bed and Wei Han\u2019s eyes would often overflow with tears, this was the first time he saw Wei Han shed tears in the everyday life.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan gently wiped Wei Han\u2019s tears with the pad of his fingers. \u201cWei Han, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis afternoon, I saw\u2026saw you with Ou Yizhe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was startled, then he pinched Wei Han\u2019s face. \u201cYou idiot! Why didn\u2019t you say so earlier? How long were you planning to hold this in your heart? Almost getting sick from holding it in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han foolishly shook his head. \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t dare to ask. I was afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfraid of what? Afraid that I didn\u2019t want you anymore and turned around to find him?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked, more and more depressed. He really didn\u2019t know exactly what kind of person this fool really thought he was. \u201cWei Han, you\u2019re fucking pig-brained. No, even pigs are much smarter than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Ou Yizhe looked for Qi Zhifan because his uncle\u2019s company assets needed to be restructured. Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t tell Wei Han at the beginning because he was afraid that he\u2019d think of crazy things. He hadn\u2019t expected that Wei Han would accidentally see them.</p><br/><p>Now out from the pain of those years with even the memories fading away, he\u2019d long since been indifferent to Ou Yizhe this person. His feelings towards him had also become a kind of apathy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOu Yizhe, he\u2019s just one of my clients now who\u2019s paying me to do some work. And you\u2019re my only\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d Wei Han blinked his eyes. Qi Zhifan\u2019s words had always been able to touch the softest place in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! You figure it out yourself.\u201d Qi Zhifan turned his face away. Some words were really too embarrassing to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood Trouble, just say it. You also know that my brain is stupid, IQ is negative and simply can\u2019t figure it out ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook Qi Zhifan. In fact, he\u2019d already guessed the answer in his heart, but he just wanted to hear Qi Zhifan say it himself.</p><br/><p>Ordinarily, he didn\u2019t see Wei Han this sarcastic, and Qi Zhifan felt that he was inexplicably being molested for a spell, so he seized Wei Han and directly kissed him.</p><br/><p>His tongue drove straight in, and tonight\u2019s Qi Zhifan was particularly overbearing. Not only did he plunder Wei Han\u2019s breath, but he stirred and licked his tongue, desperately sucking and savoring his mouth. Over and over again, greedily and seemingly inexhaustible, he vowed to kiss until Wei Han\u2019s face was completely red, kiss until his whole body became weak before he was willing to stop.</p><br/><p>So, the two husbands took a particularly long time to wash, heavy breathing and passionate moans coming out from inside from time to time, the cries making people\u2019s face redden and pulse race, indulging in all kinds of fantasy.</p><br/><p>Late at night, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan were already laying in bed. Just finished with their strenuous exercise, they were holding each other, slightly gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, if\u2026if I don\u2019t cook well, will you still like me?\u201d Wei Han asked weakly.</p><br/><p>Compared to the returned Ou Yizhe, he\u2019d discovered that he was inferior in all aspects to the other, and that the only thing he could slightly hold an edge over him was his cooking.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan knocked on Wei Han\u2019s forehead. \u201cSpeaking nonsense again! There are so many men in the world who can cook well, and not just you. Don\u2019t tell me that I have to like them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was suddenly unable to respond: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan pressed closer to Wei Han, his fingers beginning to grow restless. He quietly plunged into Wei Han\u2019s rear. \u201cGive it to me again? Hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The entry of a foreign object immediately caused Wei Han discomfort. Wei Han was always quite sensitive after each release. \u201cYou\u2026you still want to do it? No\u2026no way\u2026<i>mmn uhh</i>\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan bit his ear and licked. \u201cReally? But you\u2019re clearly holding me so tightly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s\u2026ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a result, this bout of bed \u2018exercise\u2019 was done into the early hours of the morning.</p><br/><p>The next day, when Wei Han got up and looked in the mirror, he found that, starting from his neck to his chest, it was covered in red and swollen bite marks. The two small bumps on his chest were even more painful to the touch.</p><br/><p>Odd Trouble was definitely a dog! Wei Han was somewhat frantic. How could he happily go to work like this ah? Moreover, his waist was sore and his butt ached, ai.</p><br/><p>Calling Leader Lu, Wei Han wanted to ask for a day of sick leave, but that Sergeant Lu clearly detonated, \u201cFuck, how do you guys have so many fucking reasons to not come to work? Did you play until you went crazy last night? Obviously you know the bureau is very busy today, so you\u2019re doing this on purpose, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Colliding with this tone from Sergeant Lu really scared Wei Han. Shuddering, he said, \u201cNo\u2026no, no, Leader Lu, I really didn\u2019t do it on purpose ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen get the hell over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Helpless, Wei Han had to go to work.</p><br/><p>In the early summer, all members in the police station wore less clothes and took off their police uniform jackets, almost all wearing short sleeves. But today, both Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui came in dressed up tightly, the shirt collar inside raised high.</p><br/><p>When the other people were still puzzling over this, the bitterly and unspeakably suffering Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui gave each other a mutual look and understood each other\u2019s distress at once. Those who had the same misfortunes didn\u2019t need to meet once to be acquainted: they were all raising beasts at home who often let loose their wild nature.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>During the lunch break, the excessively consumed Jiang Chengrui laid on the table, seeming like he couldn\u2019t even take a big stride. Wei Han used his elbow to nudge Jiang Chengrui. \u201cLittle Jiang, did you stay at Pei Yuyang\u2019s place last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui raised his eyes with a \u2018you ask though you already know\u2019 expression, tacitly agreeing.</p><br/><p>Thinking of Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang, the two people had a while when they hadn\u2019t even seen each other, so they definitely hadn\u2019t done anything more intimate. Now the long drought met the sweet rain, he could imagine how intense it must have been.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, you still really like him and can\u2019t let go of him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui continued to default.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you have to show your sister your attitude and determination, and not blindly submit,\u201d Wei Han continued to encourage him. He knew that because of the shadow of his parents\u2019 death, Jiang Chengrui had always felt indebted to his family, so he didn\u2019t dare to be too disobedient to Jiang Chenghui.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui nodded. \u201cYeah, Silly Han, I\u2019ve thought it through.\u201d</p><br/><p>This day, Leng Yan said he had something to look for Wei Han and asked him out, also conveniently inviting him to eat a grand meal. The foodie Wei Han was always unable to resist the temptation of gourmet food and of course, readily agreed. But when he arrived at the appointed restaurant, he discovered that in addition to Leng Yan, Ou Yizhe was also sitting next to him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Wei Han was a little stupefied, Ou Yizhe took the initiative to smile and greet him, \u201cHi, Wei Han. I also know that Qi Zhifan won\u2019t let you see me, so I asked Michael to help me to ask you to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan also came over to Wei Han and greeted him, \u201cSorry, Cyril had some things he wanted to say to you alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I also want to hear what he wants to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Yan nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go out for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Leng Yan left, Ou Yizhe looked at Wei Han and couldn\u2019t help sighing, \u201cAi, there really is no medicine for regret in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you regretting leaving Qi Zhifan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d Ou Yizhe\u2019s smile dwindled, his eyes having an unspeakable kind of penetrating gaze. \u201cSometimes, people become a lowly kind of animal who are prone to making mistakes. When they\u2019re unable to extricate themselves from love, they become fools who think that love is everything. And once they\u2019ve been pitted by a slag, they\u2019d realize how silly they were, and also discover that they once had someone who\u2019d loved them so much and want to cherish it. But, no one would continue to always foolishly wait for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Wei Han heard this, he could hear the story behind Ou Yizhe. It seemed as if someone had once broken his heart and caused him to weep.</p><br/><p>Squeezing his palms, Wei Han said, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already tried to fight for Zhifan, but it seems to be useless. It\u2019s already come to this, so I just wanted to wish you good luck.\u201d After saying this, Ou Yizhe put his hands on Wei Han\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWish me luck?\u201d Wei Han puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. After all, sometimes reality beats love. I\u2019ve already experienced it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han specially opened up the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d. When he was hospitalized before, he\u2019d suspected that Qi Zhifan had already seen it. Now, he wanted to confirm this.</p><br/><p>Wei Han quickly flipped through it and suddenly saw some handwriting that didn\u2019t belong to him in the middle of a page. He recognized in a glance that it was Qi Zhifan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u3010towh\u3011Once Wei Han saw this, he understood it: \u2018wh\u2019 was the shorthand for his name. Qi Zhifan, who always disliked troublesome things, had this habit.</p><br/><p>Next was only one line of words. Qi Zhifan simply wrote a few words\u3010sweet-stewed,<b> shiny, dessert, cat</b>, T\u3011</p><br/><p>This concise inscription\u2026it was estimated that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to make sense of it, but Wei Han was the exception. His eyes were suddenly a little wet.</p><br/><p><b>T/N:</b> The bold words are in English in the raw.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

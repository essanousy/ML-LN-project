In front of everyone, the lead instructor said a lot of reasons: saying what S City\u2019s Criminal Investigation Brigade strongly recommended them to come over and study, to hone their perseverance and stamina, and to accumulate survival experience and the like.</p><br/><p>On the surface, it sounded good, but the discerning people all knew that these two people must have a background, and it was probably that the wealthy young masters were really bored and wanted to come over for a trip, treating it only as an \u201couting\u201d.</p><br/><p>Wei Han thought of Pei Yuyang\u2019s section chief dad, and then thought of Qi Zhifan\u2019s bureau chief grandfather, and immediately only wanted to sigh ruefully: Ai, the rich and powerful were really incomparably willful.</p><br/><p>After the instructor shouted \u201cdismiss\u201d, everyone was free to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie\u30fc\u201d Pei Yuyang flew toward Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui\u2019s face twitched. Actually, he really wanted to go hide, but he also very much didn\u2019t want to see the scene where Pei Yuyang chased after him at full speed. He simply stood still and was hugged full on by him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Jiang Chengrui obediently letting himself be embraced, Pei Yuyang \u2018given an inch, took a foot\u2019 and kept rubbing and rubbing. \u201cCurlie, one day without seeing is like being separated by three autumns, not to mention that it\u2019s already been more than two months, close to sixty-something days, where we\u2019ve not seen each other ah! Later, I will not leave you even if I die. Tonight, let\u2019s sleep together\u2026ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019d only said half of his words when Jiang Chengrui punched his stomach, panting with rage: \u201cDream on! Go home and hold your family\u2019s pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The second before, Qi Zhifan was still envious of Pei Yuyang. This second, he was very sympathetic toward him.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan walked straight in front of Wei Han. \u201cHave you discovered that I\u2019ve lost weight?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Wei Han gone, the quality of food at the Qi home was extremely worrying ah!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026ah?\u201d Not seeing the real Odd Trouble for many days and usually just seeing him in his dreams, Wei Han was a bit confused and unclear: was this reality? Or still a dream?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019ve lost weight? Where did you lose it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han foolishly sized up Qi Zhifan\u2019s face: still awfully good-looking. Suddenly, his eyes shifted downwards and he looked at Qi Zhifan\u2019s crotch: still very big and vigorous!</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing really thinned ah,\u201d Wei Han concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan pursed his lips, simply at a loss on how to have a pleasant exchange. They were not on the same frequency at all! Just now, where did that guy\u2019s eyes look at?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt turns out you guys are all gay? Hehe, that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, a cold and hateful voice came over. Shao Yi held his arms and his face was filled with disgust. Behind him were several equally horrid guys who all mockingly laughed \u201chahaha\u201d.</p><br/><p>Wei Han glared. Jiang Chengrui also immediately clenched his fists, ready to go forward. Unexpectedly, Qi Zhifan took the first step. The moment he came over, he used a shoulder throw on Shao Yi, immediately knocking him down.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Thump</i>!\u201d the sound of Shao Yi\u2019s heavy fall immediately caused a sensation. Not knowing what was going on, everyone quickly came over and increasing thought these two special students were really not simple.</p><br/><p>At this time, Jiang Chengrui and Pei Yuyang were whispering in low voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Qi Zhifan practiced before? I\u2019d like to have a match with him sometime ah.\u201d Jiang Chengrui revved up, his eyes shining. He really wanted to swap pointers with Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Fan\u2019s skills have always been good. After all, his father is a police officer.\u201d Pei Yuyang nodded, then thought better and shook his head. \u201cAi, fighting? No, Curlie, like a <i>meng meng </i>blue paper boy, you can\u2019t be so violent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnoying to death, you chatterbox.\u201d Jiang Chengrui casually rapped Pei Yuyang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Seeing Shao Yi so embarrassed, several of C Uni\u2019s Public Security Police School\u2019s younger brothers were suddenly silly. Among them, a pointy mouth, monkey-cheeked guy hurriedly lifted up Shao Yi and angrily cursed, \u201cYou\u2026you scoundrel newcomers! Go, let\u2019s go tell the instructor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t have the slightest intention to stop them. Pei Yuyang, still with a face of light wind and fresh clouds, lazily said, \u201cEven if you go to complain, Ah Fan and I wouldn\u2019t care anyway.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>With their backing, no one here could move them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Shao Yi snapped at the few bleak IQ younger brothers. The dark light at the bottom of his pupils was sparking. He was also clear that Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t small, and temporarily couldn\u2019t be provoked.</p><br/><p>In the end, Shao Yi turned around and angrily left. Before he left, he gave Wei Han a ferocious glare.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Zhifan, who was slyer than a fox, gleaned a clue. \u201cWei Han, did he bully you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026No.\u201d Wei Han shook his head and dryly explained, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. After these months, I\u2019ve also become stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying, Wei Han also pounded his chest. To be honest, he didn\u2019t want to let Qi Zhifan know of his many humiliating matters. His little brother was so awesome, as the older brother, he also couldn\u2019t be too much of a loser.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan stretched out his hand and pinched Wei Han\u2019s face, finding that his face had much less meat than before. \u201cI knew that you\u2019d become dark and thin, tsk, and a lot uglier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Odd Trouble really unable to sincerely praise him?</p><br/><p>In the evening, the \u2018tired for a day\u2019 Wei Han, Jiang Chengrui, and several other teammates went into the big tent together to sleep. To prevent the instructors from raiding in the middle of the night, they were too lazy to undress and casually laid down on the floor, soon falling asleep.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang were originally arranged to sleep in the tent with the instructors, but they both shook their heads and tacitly agreed to find Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>Once he entered the tent, Qi Zhifan smelled the stench of sweat, slightly frowned, and then he looked down. Wei Han was surprisingly squeezed between two or three big men to sleep, their arms and legs almost side by side!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows furrowed deeper, and his eyes let out an ominous glint.</p><br/><p>He strode over and kicked the men sleeping next to Wei Han with his feet. When Pei Yuyang who\u2019d come in with him saw this, he immediately protected Jiang Chengrui, who was sleeping on the left side of Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyo, Ah Fan, take it easy a bit ah. This is my family\u2019s Curlie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026manage your own family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan lightly said. Anyway, he was only managing his own family\u2019s idiot \u201cbrother\u201d. Finished saying, he simply laid down beside Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang also quite anxiously hugged Jiang Chengrui to sleep.</p><br/><p>In the first half of the night, Jiang Chengrui, who was being held too tightly and felt uncomfortable, even in his sleep, he would occasionally hit and kick Pei Yuyang. In contrast, Wei Han was well-behaved, probably because he was really tired. His entire body was held in Qi Zhifan\u2019s embrace, but there was no reaction.</p><br/><p>In the second half of the night, everyone else was soundly asleep. Only Qi Zhifan had his eyes open.</p><br/><p>Sleeping in the outdoors and sleeping at home could be quite different. Apart from the odor of sweat from the men, there was the rise and fall of snoring sounds\u30fcear-piercing, teeth-grinding sound\u30fcand also the very annoying mosquitoes buzzing.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Pa</i>!\u201d Qi Zhifan killed a mosquito. He hated mosquitoes the most!</p><br/><p>The ears always echoing with the \u201c<i>buzz buzz buzz</i>\u201d sound, Qi Zhifan was extremely jittery. His blood type wasn\u2019t the type to attract mosquitoes, so it seemed like the problem was with Wei Han in his bosom\u2026</p><br/><p>The next morning, Pei Yuyang pointed at the two big spots on Qi Zhifan\u2019s face and laughed until tears came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t think the mosquitoes here were so fierce, biting you to become like this. Ah Fan, congratulations ah, it\u2019s rare to see your appearance destroyed for once, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but \u201cpfft\u201d laugh out loud. In fact, it didn\u2019t so far as to called disfigured\u30fcafter all, Qi Zhifan\u2019s foundation was super good\u30fconly now his nose and right cheek had big spots and looked very funny.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was very uncomfortable. After giving them a cold look, he silently lowered the brim of his hat.</p><br/><p>Last night, it was more than just his face; Qi Zhifan\u2019s arms and legs were also bitten by mosquitoes. All of them, weren\u2019t they all to block the mosquitoes from Wei Han? Otherwise, Wei Han, that idiot, would surely be bitten awake.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Afterwards, when they were gnawing on the coarse grains, the picky eater Qi Zhifan only took a few bites and didn\u2019t eat anymore.</p><br/><p>Wei Han to one side patted Qi Zhifan and curiously said, \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2019re not enjoying it at home, but ran here to suffer, is it because Uncle Qi forced you to come over? Wanted to toughen you up ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Wei Han stared blankly. \u201cThen, is it Pei Yuyang? Did he pull you here? Anyway, he\u2019s coming to chase Little Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf right,\u201d Qi Zhifan lightly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then the other half\u2026\u201d Wei Han touched his chin, thought about it, and then confidently said, \u201cSurely it\u2019s because you\u2019re usually accustomed to living a good life, and you want to experience rough living.\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s all this mess? Did he look like such an idle person? Qi Zhifan was a little speechless and got right to the point, \u201cI did it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was silly.</p><br/><p>At this time, the whistle for assembling sounded again. Wei Han and Qi Zhifan who had different thoughts in their mind, didn\u2019t say anything more and hurried to line up.</p><br/><p>For the next two days, Wei Han and the others carried out the woodland search and beach chase training. On the fourth day, the instructor allowed them to form into teams of four or five people and gave them a new task. This was the biggest test in this field survival training.</p><br/><p>First of all, food was a big problem. It was stipulated before that for the seven days of field survival training, they were only allowed to bring three days of food. Now on the fourth day, most of the people\u2019s food was consumed.</p><br/><p>Originally hearing that this time they were going to train on an island, they thought that there must be many wild animals on the island. Many people thought that they could use this opportunity to experience the taste of game. But before the team set out, the instructor announced a new rule: to maintain the ecological balance on the island, it was forbidden to hunt wild animals during the training.</p><br/><p>They were suddenly disillusioned, ai.</p><br/><p>There were a number of such provisions, such as domestic garbage wasn\u2019t allowed to stay on the island, shooting training cartridges needed to be retrieved and so on. In short, this training arrangement was not only to improve their field survival skills, but also to enhance their environmental awareness.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui had been together before, and this time was no exception. Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang certainly also followed the two, and the four-man team was formed.</p><br/><p>They discussed among themselves: they should be able to eat small rabbits and pheasants once in a while; or they could go fishing in the sea for fish, shrimp and crabs; or if nothing else, they could reluctantly pick some mushrooms and wild fruits.</p><br/><p>After walking for a while, the four decided to take a rest.</p><br/><p>When living in the wild, apart from food, water was also extremely important. Jiang Chengrui saw several wild bananas growing around him. He quickly cut into the bottom of one with a knife. Suddenly, the clean liquid dripped from the stem. This plant core contained a lot of water.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang also helped out. The tender core of the wild banana was also edible. In the absence of food, it could be used to alleviate a bit of hunger.</p><br/><p>In the wild jungle, it was always easy to lose their bearing. Now, Qi Zhifan was sitting on a stone and quietly looking at a map. He looked at his watch while facing the wrist to point the hour hand on the dial at the sun and used that to determine their position.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a few drops of rain fell from the sky. Qi Zhifan was just about to put away the map when who knew in the next second, there was a hand on top of his head. When he looked up, Wei Han had come over to block the rain for him since who knows when.</p><br/><p>Wei Han foolishly grinned. \u201cHeheh, Odd Trouble, you continue to look at the map. This light rain, let me help block it for you. Bro\u2019s now spoiling you ah. Good little brother, are you feeling super happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart moved slightly and he quickly got up. There was suddenly a height difference between the two people, and he also reached out his hand and blocked the rain for Wei Han. \u201cMe spoiling you is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s little heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>Could it really be what Odd Trouble said: he really came here for him?</p><hr/><br/><p><strong>T/N:</strong> So, we\u2019re halfway through the story. Updates will now be daily until the end~</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

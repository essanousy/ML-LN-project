She had a sweet and sticky little voice, and with big, blinking eyes, was pink and delicate, pretty like a doll.</p><br/><p>Wei Han got a little confused at the situation, so he went to Mother Wei\u2019s side and asked, \u201cMom, who\u2019s this little loli ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Qi-qi, Fan-fan\u2019s super cute little cousin, and now, also yours. Also, aren\u2019t you on break these few days? It just happens that Qi-qi wants to play at our house. You have to take good care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom, doing laundry, cooking, and looking after children, you actually handed them all over to your son, is this really okay?</p><br/><p>After only one night, Wei Han discovered that this little cousin, Wu Yunqi\u2019s whole heart and whole eyes were only filled with Qi Zhifan alone. Every time she opened her mouth to speak, it\u2019s almost always to call for \u201cBrother Zhifan\u201d, and where Qi Zhifan went, she also stuck with him. Even more, she shouted out that she wanted to sleep together with Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>To Dad Qi and Mother Wei, the little girl would smile shyly, but she completely ignored this big living person! Wei Han, who\u2019d been neglected since the beginning, felt that his sense of existence was so low that he would soon become an invisible man.</p><br/><p>No! Wei Han pondered what he had to do to get this little cousin to realize that there was another good, hard-working older brother ah.</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han got up early and ran to the market to buy a lot of meat and vegetables, and also bought noodles, dumpling skins and so on, preparing to rely on gourmet food to capture the little cousin\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The breakfast was a lot more sumptuous than usual. It could be described as a \u201cChinese-Western combination\u201d: both noodles and dumplings, but also milk bread, sandwiches and so on that really made people\u2019s eyes shine. Smiling, Dad Qi praised Wei Han as \u201chardworking and capable\u201d, and Mother Wei, even more, grinned from ear to ear, and kept saying \u201cvirtuous\u201d this word, making Wei Han\u2019s lips flatten.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan also slightly hooked up his lips, looked at Wei Han a few more times, and ate with relish, also eating more than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Qi, how is it? Is it delicious?\u201d Wei Han smiled and asked, full of anticipation. Inside, there was a little villain smugly twirling around.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi, who was immersed in eating dumplings, raised her eyes, her expression cold and indifferent, said: \u201cSo-so, I don\u2019t care much about what I eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han suddenly felt a burst of defeat, and the inner little villain also squatted in the corner, silently drawing circles.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi quietly pinched her palm and tried to maintain her indifferent expression. She had to admit that the dumpling in her mouth was simply too delicious ah. When she took the first bite, she was somewhat unable to control herself and felt that she could eat three bowls.</p><br/><p>But she must not be so easily tempted.</p><br/><p>Before coming here, she was somewhat curious: what kind of person would the new big cousin be? The result was, completely didn\u2019t expect, it was actually a male foxy spirit, hmph! <b><sup> [1]</sup></b></p><br/><p>This Wei Han, dared to twist his waist and dance in front of Brother Zhifan. To flirt like this was already very shameful, but the mouth actually also yelled out \u201c<i>ow</i>\u201c, too lewd! So openly seducing Brother Zhifan, he simply can\u2019t be tolerated!</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Dad Qi and Mother Wei went to work, and Qi Zhifan also went to school. Although Wu Yunqi was reluctant to part, but thinking that two days after, it\u2019d be the weekend and Qi Zhifan would definitely have time to accompany her, she was also relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei foxy spirit! This miss wants to paint. You go prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After everyone else had left, Wu Yunqi also revealed her nature: with a disgusted look, she bossed Wei Han around.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? You just called me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s brain couldn\u2019t help but become stupid for a moment. The second before, the little cousin was still acting like a lady. How come she suddenly became an arrogant little princess?</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cWei, foxy, spirit!\u201d Wu Yunqi raised her chin with a haughty posture.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han foolishly blanked, \u201cWhere do I look like a fox ah?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This little loli definitely needed to go see the ophthalmologist.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi was very good at painting. Although she was only ten years old, but she\u2019d already won numerous awards, large and small. Because she was talented in this area since childhood, her parents also invited a lot of teachers to specially train her.</p><br/><p>Setting up the painting board, Wu Yunqi faced the several pots of succulent plants on the balcony and began today\u2019s gouache exercises. Wei Han sat quietly to the side, not daring to step forward to disturb her without her permission.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi also brought a number of works over this time. Most likely, they were specially brought for Qi Zhifan to appreciate and evaluate. Wei Han saw several of her oil paintings, and they were all landscape paintings. But when he browsed through her sketchbook, he discovered that all those used to practice portraiture were, without exception, all Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Wei Han carefully studied for a while, and couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. Wu Yunqi portrayed Qi Zhifan\u2019s features and outlined his face very well, but unfortunately, differed somewhat from his charm.</p><br/><p>Ai, his eyes were too tender, and the curvature of his mouth when he smiles was also obviously wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Qi, your drawings of Qi Zhifan\u2026\u201d Wei Han said, hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you have a problem with them?\u201d The brush dipped in the paint paused, and Wu Yunqi looked at him askance.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell the truth, it\u2019s actually a bit unalike. Some places need to be changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Yunqi was slightly stunned. In fact, she had already discovered this problem. Although those teachers praised her, and also all agreed that her cousin Qi Zhifan must be a gentle and good man, but she understood in her heart that it was not so.</p><br/><p>After all, there was a difference of eight years in age. Many times, she couldn\u2019t understand Qi Zhifan\u2019s expressions. The cousin that she drew on paper, most was her heart longing for that appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi asked, simply putting down the brush in her hand and walked to Wei Han\u2019s side, handing him a pencil and eraser.</p><br/><p>Wei Han touched his chin and brought up Qi Zhifan\u2019s appearance in his mind. He thought about it for a moment, then he changed the curvature of the eyebrows and the lips, and also darkened the eyes slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this almost looks like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wei Han finished, Wu Yunqi took a closer look, and her pupils couldn\u2019t help but shrink. It was a bit hard to believe: this Wei foxy spirit had only changed a few strokes, but it suddenly resembled him a lot more!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, I didn\u2019t expect that I had a little talent in drawing,\u201d Wei Han scratched his head and giggled twice.</p><br/><p>With this laugh, he immediately caused Wu Yunqi \u201cLittle Princess\u201d to be unhappy. She knitted her eyebrows and instantly closed the sketchbook, coldly saying, \u201cHmph, who asked you to change my drawings, really impolite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, she turned her back and ignored Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was speechless. This little cousin could really turn hostile with just a word and was so hard to please.</p><br/><p>At lunchtime, although there was only him and Wu Yunqi at home, but \u2018the one who comes is a guest\u2019, and Wei Han busied himself in the kitchen for a while, making seven or eight dishes. Who knew, Wu Yunqi took one bite and said she didn\u2019t like it, ate another bite and kept shaking her head, and then reluctantly drank a bowl of wax gourd and kelp soup.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also said that he knew of a good restaurant and wanted to take her out to eat, but she didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>Seeing her with this kind of nasty attitude, even if Wei Han was silly, he could see that she had complaints toward him. Only, why? He still hadn\u2019t grasped the reason. He clearly had a very pure and good face ah.</p><br/><p>The table full of food was finally all eaten up by the big stomach king Wei Han. On the one hand, he thought that it couldn\u2019t be wasted. On the other hand, he wanted to deliberately annoy Wu Yunqi.</p><br/><p>At about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, a \u201c<i>growl</i>\u201d came out. In the end, Wu Yunqi\u2019s belly very disappointingly called out. Her cute little face had become crumpled now, and the whole body was listless and paralyzed on the sofa.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han sighed and took out a bag of peach pastries and gave it to her.</p><br/><p>This time, Wu Yunqi, who was so hungry that she had her chest sticking to her back, could no longer refuse and directly grabbed the bag over. Later, she simply held it in her arms, nibbling while watching cartoon.</p><br/><p>Wei Han felt that it wasn\u2019t worth it to get angry at a little girl. He poured fruit juice for her and began to idly chat with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Qi, what do you want to be when you grow up? An artist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she\u2019d made a fuss at lunch, Wu Yunqi was too lazy to deliberately torment Wei Han anymore and lightly answered, \u201cThat\u2019s a must, but I also have other dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat dreams?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to marry Brother Zhifan,\u201d Wu Yunqi solemnly vowed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It really was a dream ah, and could only think about it in her dreams.</p><br/><p>After Qi Zhifan came back in the evening, Wu Yunqi immediately became clever and sensible again.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked gloomy on the side, and gave Qi Zhifan a look with profound meaning: Ai, how many men and women were deceived by Odd Trouble\u2019s face? Even his little cousin couldn\u2019t escape.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, of course, felt Wei Han\u2019s gaze and also looked back at him, thinking that Wei Han seemed to be watching him more. Was he finally attracted by his own charm?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was a little happy.</p><br/><p>On Saturday, Qi Zhifan and Wu Yunqi were walking hand-in-hand. The cousins were dressed very fashionably, like an exceedingly rich young master and young lady. In contrast, Wei Han had on casual sportswear, followed behind their butts, and was also forced to carry big bags and small bags, just like a male nanny.</p><br/><p>Originally, this drudgery hadn\u2019t fallen on Wei Han\u2019s head. Originally, he was planning to meet up with Chu Chuanyao this morning, but Qi Zhifan insisted on going with him and Dad Qi and Mother Wei also agreed. Just, Chu Chuanyao said he wanted to find Professor Dong. Wei Han was broken-hearted but helpless, also had to accompany them.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan brought Wu Yunqi to the amusement park.</p><br/><p>Although Wu Yunqi was a girl, but she\u2019d always liked to seek thrills. She pointed to the long, winding track in the air and smiled. \u201cBrother Zhifan, let\u2019s ride the rollercoaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could hear the burst of screams from time to time. Qi Zhifan looked down at Wu Yunqi, and smiled without smiling, \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan remembered that his aunt had previously disapproved of letting Wu Yunqi ride this, so this should be her first time sitting on one.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi disagreed, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. What\u2019s more, with Brother Zhifan next to me, there\u2019s nothing to fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded and looked at Wei Han. \u201cWei Han, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi once again interrupted and confidently said, \u201cBrother Zhifan, don\u2019t mind him. Brother Wei Han looks very timid. Just let him wait for us at the bottom.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of Qi Zhifan, pretending to be an obedient girl, Wu Yunqi had changed to calling him \u201cBrother Wei Han\u201d, but was obviously unwilling.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face was slightly strained, but he didn\u2019t pay any mind to these words. He was not timid. Because his nerves were thick, so basically, there\u2019s nothing that scared him, just sometimes, he gets a little frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have fun,\u201d Wei Han lazily said. It just so happen that he was uninterested in accompanying them, and instead, was happy to be idle.</p><br/><p>However, when Qi Zhifan and Wu Yunqi were preparing to get into the car, Qi Zhifan\u2019s cell phone rang unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan took a look and saw that it was a call from S Uni\u2019s president. He reckoned there were some matters to discuss, so Qi Zhifan decisively let Wei Han replace him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Wu Yunqi eyed each other, suddenly feeling that the other was a little hateful.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><b>1.

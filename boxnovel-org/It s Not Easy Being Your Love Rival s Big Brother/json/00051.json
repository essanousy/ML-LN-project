However, his hands still couldn\u2019t cover his current fat face.</p><br/><p>After seeing Wei Han\u2019s move, Chu Chuanyao looked distracted for a moment, and then smiled and said, \u201cBig Brother Wei, you don\u2019t need to feel embarrassed. I still want to introduce you and Zhifan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Wei Han slowly put his hands down and looked at Qi Zhifan who was not far away, trying to tell himself to calm down in his heart.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was drinking tea. When he sensed Wei Han\u2019s gaze, he also hurriedly shot him a glance. Then he got up and walked to Chu Chuanyao\u2019s side. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not interested in knowing this kind of person. Seeing his tonnage, he\u2019s doomed to a lonely life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Qi Zhifan still said the same words during their first meeting, and even his disdainful look and tone were exactly the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Wei Han shook his head, grabbing his hand and firmly holding it. \u201cI won\u2019t have a lonely life. I have you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan\u2019s face instantly turning green, Wei Han blinked his pair of innocent eyes and once again confirmed and firmly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSick!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Qi Zhifan looked at Wei Han with eyes filled with disgust. He quickly pulled out his hand and immediately turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han quickly chased him and called him to stop, \u201cWait, Odd Trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s steps stopped and he frowned. \u201cAre you calling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han was a little dumbfounded. In his anxiety, he\u2019d called out this \u2018Odd Trouble\u2019 nickname, forgetting that in this lifetime, Qi Zhifan simply didn\u2019t know what this was.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cHey, you should hurry up and go to the hospital to see the psychiatric department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Qi Zhifan left, the embarrassed Chu Chuanyao rushed forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Big Brother Wei. You shouldn\u2019t worry about those things that Zhifan said. He\u2019s really a good person, just his temper is a little\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little of a headache!\u201d Wei Han supported his forehead, really wanting to cry without tears. Now, Qi Zhifan in this lifetime was so hard to get along with, could he really start from scratch?</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao was stupefied for a moment and then forced out two laughs, \u201cBig Brother Wei, do you really feel uncomfortable today? How come you\u2019re so weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han spoke several sentences in a row, but Chu Chuanyao didn\u2019t understand them. Furthermore, his action to pull Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand and stop him\u2026what was going on? He couldn\u2019t comprehend.</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t want to explain too much and also didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush, so he straightforwardly asked, \u201cLittle Yao, do you like Qi Zhifan now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao\u2019s face suddenly turned red and he lowered his head, answering by default.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, although Little Yao had already been moved at this time, but the two hadn\u2019t officially dated yet. Having confirmed the current situation again, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists. \u201cThen Little Yao, I\u2019ll tell you clearly: I also like him, and I will definitely catch him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the days that followed, Wei Han was almost always looking for opportunities to meet Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was quite out of sorts. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han smiled with a thick face and said, \u201cHeheh, you\u2019ll get used to it the more you hear it. You can also call me \u2018Stomach Cold\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan had a burst of speechlessness. \u201cIn the future, remember to take your medicine before going out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was twenty-five and already had a lawyer\u2019s job. Before and after work everyday, he always \u201cran into\u201d Wei Han. After a week of continuous \u201crunning into,\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s patience finally reached its limit and he could no longer endure it.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cExactly what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s gloomy face looked very dreadful, but Wei Han still cheerfully opened his mouth and loudly said, \u201cOdd Trouble, I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026You\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Wei Han held roses in his hands and under Qi Zhifan\u2019s office, he pulled out his voice and belted out a love song. His lively \u2018singing\u2019 caused the crowd of onlookers to collapse. Finally, a pale-faced security guard drove him away.</p><br/><p>As a result, everyone knew that the perfect in all aspects Qi Zhifan was being pursued by a silly fat man with no shortage of sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t just see that I\u2019m fat now; I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll lose weight later. After all, every fat person has good prospects,\u201d Wei Han said with a sincere look.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan eyebrows were drawn out. \u201cEven if you slim down, you\u2019re also not the type that I like. In contrast, I\u2019m more interested in Chu Chuanyao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you interested in Little Yao because of his face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was inevitably surprised and said, \u201cYou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, for some reason, I know everything about you. Wouldn\u2019t it better if you find a person you really like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t speak, looked at Wei Han profoundly and then turned away.</p><br/><p>After that, Wei Han always brought his homemade food to see Qi Zhifan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, I know your taste is very picky, but I\u2019m very good at cooking and I can one hundred percent satisfy you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan seemed to believe and not believe, but when he ate the first bite, his attitude changed greatly. \u201cYou come to my house as a nanny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro doesn\u2019t want to be a nanny!\u201d</p><br/><p>This day, Wei Han specially prepared a large bag of candy for Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, look! This is all candy. Whatever you want, it\u2019s there. You have low blood sugar. It\u2019s best if you keep a few in your pocket everyday, just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan lowered his eyes and looked at him, the tip of his brows couldn\u2019t help shaking. This really was having everything you wanted: big white rabbit milk candy, Wangzai milk candy, Alps candy; and coconut candies, milk candies, peanut candies, peppermint candies and cotton candy\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Qi Zhifan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s good that you like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly stunned. Wrong! Facing this fool\u2019s silly smiling face, not know what demons and gods were at work, he actually nodded?!</p><br/><p>Another day, Qi Zhifan had a heavy workload and worked overtime late into the night. Once he walked out of the office door, he found Wei Han squatting in the doorway.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Odd Trouble, you\u2019re afraid of ghosts. I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t dare to walk on the road alone at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han forced out two <em>heheh</em> laughs. Sometimes, in order to find ways to create opportunities for him to get along with Qi Zhifan, he really had to use all kinds of reasons.</p><br/><p>Tonight, there were no stars in the sky and only a cold moon hung lonely in the night sky. Wei Han and Qi Zhifan walked side by side on the road. Walking and walking, Wei Han clenched his teeth and suddenly pulled Qi Zhifan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan became slightly sluggish, and then coldly said, \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let go!\u201d Wei Han resolutely shook his head, holding it tighter instead. \u201cQi Zhifan, I really like you. I want to always stay with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay with me?\u201d Qi Zhifan stopped and turned his face to meet Wei Han\u2019s eyes. \u201cLucky that you still remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Qi Zhifan looked deeply into Wei Han\u2019s eyes as if he wanted to see through him. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you hurry back and stay with the real me?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han was dumbstruck, but before he understood it, his hand was suddenly empty. In an instant, Qi Zhifan also disappeared before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, where are you? Where are you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to scream, but he suddenly couldn\u2019t make a sound. He reached out and wanted to grab it, but he couldn\u2019t grab anything.</p><br/><p>The endless darkness quickly swallowed everything. While Wei Han was in a daze, he was returned to the cold and boundless darkness. The heavy body uncontrollably sank down and kept sinking down. He was getting colder and colder, the fear in his heart gradually spreading to his whole body, wave after shivering wave.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han felt a hint of warmth. Relying on this feeling, he groped wildly in the dark and finally grasped a big, warm hand. Immediately, there was a force that pulled him forward, helping him slowly come out of the darkness towards the light\u2026</p><br/><p>The birds sang cheerfully outside the window, and the first rays of morning light shone on Wei Han\u2019s face. Suddenly, his fingertips moved and he abruptly opened his eyes. \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was dazed, touching Wei Han\u2019s face somewhat in disbelief. Then, the corners of his lips unconsciously lifted up in a wan smile. The smile was shallow, but was filled with endless tenderness and pampering, making Wei Han\u2019s heartstrings move when he saw it.</p><br/><p>Several years later, Wei Han could always recall this morning day and remember Qi Zhifan\u2019s warm smile. He felt that this was always the most beautiful scene he\u2019d ever seen in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a pig? Actually sleeping for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, I seem to have had a long, long dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas I in your dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the dream was all about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s still good enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>My little brother is becoming more and more narcissistic. What should I do?</p><br/><p>Wei Han woke up after many days. In addition to Dad Qi and Mother Wei, and also Qi Zhifan, who took turns to take care of him, many people also came to visit him.</p><br/><p>The already discharged Shao Yi came over. Jiang Chengrui often came over and sometimes, he also brought several colleagues from the bureau who had a good relationship with Wei Han. Leng Yan also visited several times.</p><br/><p>This day, Qi Zhifan was originally taking care of Wei Han when he received an important phone call at the last minute and said that he\u2019d have to go out for half an hour. Wei Han smiled. Feeling that he was already able to get out of bed on his own, he also urged him to hurry up and go.</p><br/><p>He also knew that Qi Zhifan had definitely delayed many important work because of his matter.</p><br/><p>While the nurse was taking Wei Han\u2019s temperature, a male doctor suddenly came in and smiled. \u201cIt seems that you\u2019ve recovered well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao?\u201d Wei Han looked up and then he was silly. \u201cNo, not right, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the male doctor\u2019s looks were similar to Chu Chuanyao, but he was clearly a mature, upgraded version of Little Yao!</p><br/><p>Not to mention the body mannerisms, but just looking at this pair of eyes, they weren\u2019t the same. The light in Chu Chuanyao\u2019s eyes were pure and limpid, but this person had obviously experienced a lot and his eyes were more slender, the bottom of his pupils also fainting revealing a mature and demonic charm.</p><br/><p>He\u2026he wouldn\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t dare to think about it. His eyelid was already twitching, feeling that something was wrong from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst time meeting. Hello, I\u2019m Ou Yizhe, Cyril.\u201d Ou Yizhe extended his hand toward Wei Han, the corner of his mouth holding in a smile. \u201cI think you should have heard of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he\u2019d already guessed it, Wei Han\u2019s heart still suffered a blow. \u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck! After he woke up from his injury, how did Ou Yizhe come back? In his dream, he had to fight over Qi Zhifan to grab him from Chu Chuanyao\u2019s hands. Don\u2019t tell him that he had to do it again in reality?</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

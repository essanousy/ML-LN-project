Recalling Qi Zhifan\u2019s extremely reluctant face, his heart was blissful, all the worries were all swept out in an instant, not to mention how happy he was.</p><br/><p>They said that utmost joy turns to sorrow. Wei Han didn\u2019t expect that when he jumped in, he\u2019d jumped into a chicken coop, and an unpleasant smell immediately stung his nostrils.</p><br/><p>Covering his mouth and nose, Wei Han glanced around. Fuck, the car key was incredibly inside the egg heap, surrounded by a group of roosters and hens.</p><br/><p>Probably the folk customs here were fierce: the chickens raised also had a domineering side that leaked out, especially the fiery red cockscomb of the powerful and ardent big rooster. Its fixed eyes stared at the \u2018no good\u2019 Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also didn\u2019t want to provoke them, but he was already in the chicken coop.</p><br/><p>The ferocious rooster let out a huge squawk and started chasing Wei Han while pecking at his butt non-stop, but couldn\u2019t catch up to him. The \u2018fat as a ball\u2019 hens were not a little surprised, and flapped their wings to fly. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t fly up and didn\u2019t even move. But the fanning made feathers flew everywhere, causing Wei Han to sneeze several times.</p><br/><p>After great difficulty, he picked up the car key, and Wei Han quickly fled the chicken coop.</p><br/><p>Covered in chicken feathers, he inevitably also stepped on some chicken excrement. The very embarrassed Wei Han hurriedly took off the smelly coat, and also forcibly shook his head filled with feathers to clear them out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who thought he was finally out of the abyss of suffering, just walked a few steps and didn\u2019t expect that a big yellow dog would be guarding the yard. It barked \u201cwoof woof woof\u201d viciously and fiercely.</p><br/><p>Wei Han patted his chest. Fortunately, the dog was tied up by an iron chain, or it would have surely rushed to bite him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoo-oo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Misfortune doesn\u2019t come singly. Wei Han\u2019s ears moved. He heard a bull calling. Was it a mistake?</p><br/><p>Looking not far away, a big black bull was preparing to rush over. Wei Han was stupefied and looked down at his Big Red Wolf T-shirt. For the first time, he found out that his body was in red, a dazzling kind of red.</p><br/><p>Fuck, help! He was not interested in being a matador!</p><br/><p>Waiting outside the iron gate of the yard, Qi Zhifan heard the chickens squawking and dog barking inside. Now even the bull\u2019s call was heard; the wind was a bit cluttered.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Zhifan heard the sound of the iron gate opening that he\u2019d been waiting for, and his mood, which had been immersed in the lowest point, finally also turned around. As soon as Wei Han came out, he hugged his head and continued to madly flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, are you sick, why are you running.\u201d Qi Zhifan pulled Wei Han back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re not sick, then can you run! If you\u2019re bitten by the mad cow behind you, you might get mad cow disease!\u201d Wei Han shouted, shook off Qi Zhifan, and continued to rush forward.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan heard these words, surprised, and looked back to see the mighty, black bull. It really was a bad thing, and he was immediately forced to run.</p><br/><p>As a result, in the lingering eco-natural wilderness, a big, black bull frantically chased two figures: a red Wei Han and a pink Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Running and looking at Wei Han who was running side by side with him, Qi Zhifan was angry till he almost passed out. \u201cFuck! You idiot, don\u2019t run in same direction as me! We have to separate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to!\u201d Wei Han refused with a big shout, \u201cWait for us to separate, it must chase me who\u2019s wearing red. In case I draw him away, you\u2019d definitely escape. Anyways, you never cared about my life and death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was slightly sluggish. He did not expect Wei Han to think so badly of him.</p><br/><p>Although he\u2019d previously thought to simply and directly leave Wei Han behind and drive himself back with the car, but the idea only flashed past. He had intended to frighten Wei Han, driving the car for not even ten minutes for his mood to slightly ease, and then he\u2019d turned back.</p><br/><p>After all, Wei Han\u2019s cooking was so delicious. He\u2019d also always thought that everyday, to let Wei Han be willing to cook for himself, he really could be \u201cwilling\u201d to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you listen to me well, I\u2026later on, I\u2026absolutely\u2026\u201d running a bit strained, Qi Zhifan gritted his teeth and said emphatically, \u201cWill, not, leave, you, behind, without, caring!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han heard this and became foolish. After a moment\u2019s pause, he quickly turned in another direction. Qi Zhifan relaxed momentarily and took a few breaths. But completely unexpectedly, this mad cow ran in Qi Zhifan\u2019s direction instead. Did it actually fall for Beautiful Sheep\u2019s pink?!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t be in a daze, hurry and run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, thanks to the timely emergence of the owner, this farce came to an end. Qi Zhifan, who ran for several laps, leaned on a tree, his body bowed and kept panting.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Watching Qi Zhifan\u2019s embarrassing appearance, Wei Han\u2019s mood was a bit complicated. After he felt the dark pleasure course through his heart, he was a bit remorseful.</p><br/><p>Wei Han slowly walked up, \u201cQi Zhifan, you\u2019re not angry, right? Isn\u2019t it just a few more laps of exercise? I say, you\u2019re a big man, why are you breathing so much, is it a heat stroke? Or kidney deficiency? Not acting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026cough cough!\u201d The stimulated Qi Zhifan suddenly looked up, his face bloodless and deathly white.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked at his about to collapse appearance, where would he be in the mood to still joke around. He hurried forward and supported him. \u201cYou face looks so bad. Do you really have kidney deficiency?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again fiercely glaring at Wei Han, Qi Zhifan eyes turned and he immediately lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>Wei Han held the fainted Qi Zhifan in his arms. Just awful, this time it seemed to be a big deal.</p><br/><p>Ten o\u2019clock in the evening, the hospital within the resort.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei watched over the not yet awake Qi Zhifan, and Dad Qi called Wei Han outside of the ward, wanting to clarify something with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, this matter except for me, Little Fan didn\u2019t want to let other people know. His self-esteem has always been very high, but the matter has come this far, I also can\u2019t conceal. As you can see, Little Fan has low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and can\u2019t exercise vigorously, otherwise it\u2019s easy to faint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to Qi Hao\u2019s words, Wei Han always had his head lowered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle Qi. I really didn\u2019t know, or else I also wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Dad Qi interrupted him, shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ask for him to be clever, I just want him to be healthy. In fact, you\u2019ll slowly discover that Little Fan is not perfect in all aspects. Because of his low blood sugar, he has always disliked sports.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll listen to what Uncle Qi say\u2026\u201d Hearing this, Wei Han also got to thinking.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan really seldom tired his body. He wouldn\u2019t use force to solve anything that he can do with his brain. It seemed like God was still quite fair. Out of the so-called \u201cmorality, intelligence, physical fitness and beauty\u201d total development, Qi Zhifan was only off the charts in \u201cintelligence\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d, and definitely not good at sports, so there was nothing great.</p><br/><p>From the start, not knowing what Wei Han was thinking in his own thoughts, Dad Qi urged with meaningful and heartfelt words, \u201cLittle Han, now that Little Fan has grown up, I can\u2019t always look after him. Later on, I will have to trouble you a lot to take care of him for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Uncle Qi. I will definitely take good care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The appearance of a good older brother on the surface, Wei Han was having a carnival inside. Haha, really hard work pays off. This time he really found a big weakness of his love rival.</p><br/><p>The next day, after Wei Han had slept, he found that the joy and excitement of finding out his love rival\u2019s weakness had faded away. As a good young man with moral principles and a lower limit, he thought that he must apologize to Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Hearing that Qi Zhifan was already awake, Wei Han quickly made a bowl of sweet-stewed snow pear to bring to him. When he walked to the ward door, he just happened to meet Mother Wei who was just coming out.</p><br/><p>Mother Wei was a bit surprised and smiling, said, \u201cHan-han, I just saw Fan-fan. His current state of mind is much better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll go in and see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is\u2026\u201d Mother Wei looked at the sweet-stewed snow pear in Wei Han\u2019s hands and smiled even brighter. \u201cHehe, my family\u2019s Han-han really is a \u2018virtuous wife and loving mother\u2019 type.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mom, I\u2019m a man.\u201d Wei Han frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh, then I\u2019ll change it. It\u2019s a \u2018virtuous husband and loving father\u2019 type.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mom, please stop talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon entering the ward, Wei Han didn\u2019t look at Qi Zhifan, lowered his head and put the bowl of sweet-stewed snow pear on the table. Then, somewhat embarrassed, turned his back to go. He also didn\u2019t wait for Qi Zhifan to say something before he started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026that, Qi Zhifan, I let you down. I caused you to be chase by the bull, and also fainted. But you also know the cause and effect of the whole situation, uh\u2026it\u2019s a bit complicated, but it can\u2019t all be blamed on me.</p><br/><p>A\u2026Also, as for your mobile phone, I know you are so rich, and it\u2019s certainly not rare for you, but I will still save up money to give you a new one. I don\u2019t want to owe you anything, to avoid giving you a handle on me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han roughly finished all his words. Seeing as Qi Zhifan had not yet responded, he turned around to look. Qi Zhifan was leaning on the hospital bed, his mouth taut and his face looked very bad.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cHey, I sincerely apologized to you. Why do you look like you want to vomit?\u201d Wei Han was furious.</p><br/><p>As a result in the next second, Qi Zhifan really lifted the quilt, got off the bed, and rushed to the toilet to vomit.</p><br/><p>When Mother Wei came to visit earlier, she seemed to have mixed up syrup and salt water, causing Qi Zhifan to drink a bowl of salt water.</p><br/><p>Looking at Qi Zhifan who was once again devastated by his muddle-headed mother, Wei Han patted his back, suddenly feeling a little sympathetic towards him.</p><br/><p>Offering up the sweet-stewed snow pear that he\u2019d made, Wei Han laughed \u201chehe\u201d and said, \u201cDrink well. This is what I specially made for you, and this time, it\u2019s really \u2018willingly\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had a profound look in his eyes as he looked at him. Unexpectedly, Wei Han\u2019s \u201cwillingly\u201d came for the first time.</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan still holding a skeptical wait-and-see attitude, Wei Han\u2019s mouth twitched, and he simply used the spoon to scoop a mouthful for him, \u201cOkay, in order to fully express my sincere apology, come and open your mouth. I will personally feed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart was moved, and then, remaining calm and collected, shifted his eyes away and slightly opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>Eating the mouthful of snow pear and tasting its sweetness, Qi Zhifan also felt the long-absent sweetness deep in his heart. He looked at Wei Han and suddenly felt that this older brother, after looking longer, was also very pleasing to the eye.</p><br/><p>Feeding him, Wei Han began to persuade him in earnest, \u201cQi Zhifan, since you\u2019re suffering from low blood sugar, you still dare to be a picky eater. Also, you don\u2019t love sports, but are also cold and eccentric, and spend too much time on the mobile phone and computer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this. People with low blood sugar should lead a regular life, so you usually have to develop the habit to exercise, diet should also be balanced, but also cultivate a cheerful personality and ensure you have adequate sleep.\u201d \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What to do, he\u2019s very annoying when he chatters.</p><br/><p>This time, Wei Han encountered a lot of bad things on this family trip. However, he also discovered a major weakness of Qi Zhifan, and immediately felt that the hardship he\u2019d suffered was worth it. Of course, he said these resentment and grudges related to Qi Zhifan, but also recorded them all in his \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d.</p><br/><p>At the Qi home across the wall, Wei Han buried his head in his room and wrote down the grudges of the past few days. On this side, Qi Zhifan opened the drawer of the bedside cabinet and looked thoughtfully at the dazzling, sexy pink thing inside.</p><br/><p>He thought about this time why he\u2019d had an accident and fainted. In addition to his own physical condition, it also can\u2019t be ruled out that Wei Han\u2019s silliness had angered him into fainting.</p><br/><p>And since then, every time Wei Han looked at him, it was with a strange look, mingled with sympathy and ridicule that he had never seen before. Ah, it seemed like he was being looked down on.</p><br/><p>Suddenly \u201cthump\u201d, Qi Zhifan pushed the drawer in again.</p><br/><p>The panties that Wei Han had lost a few months ago, the day when it\u2019d be returned back to its master\u2019s side seemed to be\u2026far in the future.</p><br/><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><br/><p><strong></strong><em>Sweet-stewed snow pear</em></p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

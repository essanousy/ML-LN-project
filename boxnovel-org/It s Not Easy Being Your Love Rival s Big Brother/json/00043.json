Not Suitable?</strong></p><br/><p>Since Shao Yi came over from C City, he began to be in frequent contact with Wei Han. Whether there was some matter or not, he\u2019d still take the opportunity to strike up a conversation with Wei Han. But Wei Han always wryly smiled and deliberately avoided him.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of outsiders who were not clear on the situation, it may only seem like Shao Yi wanted to make better friends with Wei Han and was hoping to change their coworker relationship to get along more harmoniously.</p><br/><p>But Jiang Chengrui saw this and just immediately shook his head, knowing that this was definitely hopeless.</p><br/><p>Regarding the real relationship between Wei Han and Qi Zhifan, he\u2019d been confused before. However, since he\u2019d accidentally bumped into a scene of their intimacy, plus Pei Yuyang had also explained it to him clearly, he\u2019d also understood everything. It\u2019s no wonder that Wei Han always made silly mistakes in front of Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, don\u2019t do these things anymore. It\u2019s useless. I already have a person that I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, didn\u2019t you also say that you had someone that you liked? Weren\u2019t you always unable to get them all along?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before? Wei Han thought a moment and was somewhat speechless. That was a matter from how long ago. At that time, he hadn\u2019t figured out his real intentions yet and had always thought that the person he\u2019d liked was Little Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is different from the past. We\u2019re together now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Shao Yi said unexpectedly. He looked at Wei Han and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han stuck his tongue out. \u201cBelieve it or not as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who are you with? Call him over someday and let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi raised his eyebrows. To tell the truth, Wei Han actually wasn\u2019t the type that he liked. He thought that his brain was broken, so he was interested in Wei Han. So in this world, how could there be a second man who\u2019d like this kind of blockhead?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was suddenly a little at a loss for words. Qi Zhifan and his relationship was somewhat complicated and special. Apart from Pei Yuyang and Jiang Chengrui who were very good to them, other people saw Qi Zhifan and his relationship as brothers.</p><br/><p>\u201cScared? It isn\u2019t good to lie.\u201d Shao Yi smiled.</p><br/><p>Wei Han glared at him, turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>This day, when Wei Han looked at his wallet, his eyes accidentally glimpsed something. <em>Ahh</em>?</p><br/><p>Wei Han was a little surprised. He suddenly realized that the photo inside had been switched. The original photo was his and his mother, and Qi Zhifan and Uncle Qi, a family of four people. Only, it was changed into a personal photo of Qi Zhifan alone, this\u2026</p><br/><p>It seemed like it should be when he was away, Qi Zhifan had secretly tucked his narcissistic picture inside.</p><br/><p>Recalling last night, Wei Han remembered that Qi Zhifan had also asked him for his photo. Wei Han rarely took pictures, and also thought Qi Zhifan had some proper business, so he\u2019d thrown his own inch-sized photo to him.</p><br/><p>If Qi Zhifan also put it into his wallet\u2026dang, this beautiful and ugly contrast, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but be a little intoxicated.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s finger poked at Qi Zhifan\u2019s face in the photo, his expression gradually changing. From the beginning\u2019s small surprise and helplessness, it became infatuated, the corners of his mouth also unwittingly turning up into a smile: tsk tsk tsk, their family\u2019s Trouble looked really good. Indeed, the more he looked, the better-looking he was, and no matter how much he looked, he wouldn\u2019t tire of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, quickly wipe your drool.\u201d At this moment, a voice unexpectedly emerged and Wei Han was suddenly startled.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of this momentary daze, Shao Yi immediately grabbed the wallet from Wei Han\u2019s hand. \u201cWei Han, you\u2019re not earnestly working, what are you looking at! What\u2019s so good to look at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han anxiously said, \u201cShao Yi, quickly give it back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han\u2019s pitiful appearance because of his teasing, Shao Yi inexplicably thought it was cute and jokingly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give it back to you. But before that, I have to see what you were looking at\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026this is Qi Zhifan?\u201d Shao Yi\u2019s face suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t answer, only taking the wallet back in his hand and hurriedly putting it inside his clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, it turns out that you like your brother.\u201d Shao Yi\u2019s look became more and more complex. \u201cCould it be that the person you said you were already together with two days ago was him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han didn\u2019t speak, tacitly agreeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, this is really\u2026\u201d Shao Yi couldn\u2019t help but laugh. For a moment, he didn\u2019t know what to say, and just waved his hand and left. But it was inevitable that there would be a thread of disappointment in his heart.</p><br/><p>When he finished work in the evening, Jiang Chengrui quickly called out a farewell to Wei Han and left first because there were some matters in the Jiang family. Wei Han had a lot of information to sort out today. He stayed in the office for a while longer, and when he was finally done, almost everyone was gone.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Just a few steps out from the police station, his wrist was suddenly held back. Wei Han looked up and saw that unexpectedly, Shao Yi hadn\u2019t left yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao\u2026Shao Yi? Is there still something?\u201d</p><br/><p>During the day, Shao Yi knew that he liked Qi Zhifan because of his wallet photo, and he hadn\u2019t talked to him anymore. When he was eating lunch, he also hadn\u2019t thick-skinned insisted on sitting together with him. Wei Han thought that Shao Yi had already been deterred, but in fact, it didn\u2019t seem to be the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, I want to say a few words to you.\u201d Shao Yi\u2019s face was very serious and he pulled Wei Han to his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, then say it.\u201d Wei Han nodded and quietly pulled back his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about your relationship with Qi Zhifan, and it should be difficult for your parents and elders. I\u2019ve also checked the status of the Qi family in S City: it\u2019s not small. I think that since Qi Zhifan eats both men and women, he should marry a woman to give a good account to the family.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd as I can see before, Qi Zhifan seems to hate the police. Maybe he still can\u2019t understand our line of work. What if you had to make some sacrifice later? Are you sure he will support it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was silent, somewhat unable to refute. He had to admit, these things that Shao Yi said were very reasonable.</p><br/><p>After choosing to be together with Qi Zhifan, he\u2019d gradually become concerned about various problems in the future. If they really wanted to keep going, then they had to face a lot. Only, sometimes he didn\u2019t dare thing about it, and was also unwilling to think about it more, preferring to be immersed in happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Wei Han, you and him are simply not suitable. I still have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very suitable in bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a sudden and familiar voice in his ears. The distressed Wei Han didn\u2019t have time to look back when he was suddenly embraced by Qi Zhifan from behind.</p><br/><p>In front of Shao Yi\u2019s face, Qi Zhifan tightly held Wei Han and raised his chin high. \u201cApologies, I will never give you any chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shao Yi immediately wrinkled his brows.</p><br/><p>On the way home afterwards, Qi Zhifan firmly gripped Wei Han\u2019s hand, not saying a word with a grave expression.</p><br/><p>Wei Han sensed that something was wrong with him. He tentatively asked in a low voice, \u201cOdd Trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, no matter what that guy said, don\u2019t listen to a word of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Qi Zhifan\u2019s rather dark eyes, Wei Han gently \u201coh\u201d a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, Shao Yi, that guy\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan hatefully scolded under his breath.</p><br/><p>A year ago, after he and Wei Han had returned from the C City\u2019s training base, he\u2019d vowed to never let Wei Han step in there and have the opportunity to meet Shao Yi. He hadn\u2019t expected that now, Shao Yi himself would run over to S City.</p><br/><p>Hmph! Sure enough, he\u2019d already had bad intentions since then. Maybe he should find a way to make Shao Yi roll back to C City. If he only said a word to his uncle\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, don\u2019t do anything unnecessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han heard that something was amiss in Qi Zhifan\u2019s tone. The Qi family was powerful and influential. It was estimated that Qi Zhifan would ask the head of the bureau to do something, and Wei Han really didn\u2019t like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnnecessary?\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes were cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi came over to this side by his own choice. We should respect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan examined Wei Han with sharp eyes for a long time. Seeing Wei Han biting his lower lip but still looking very stubborn, eventually he sighed lightly and pressed Wei Han\u2019s forehead with his finger. \u201cWei Han, I find that sometimes, you really need a spanking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who would dare to repeatedly provoke his anger and fury, probably was only this fool in front of him. But to actually want to hit him, Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t bear to.</p><br/><p>Wei Han touched his forehead and laughed foolishly at Qi Zhifan, \u201cHeheh, Trouble, you\u2019re really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to flatter me! Say it: how many times did Shao Yi hold your hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHolding hands? Not even once ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTouching hands also count.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026that\u2019s a bit difficult to count.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Well then, I\u2019ll make you slowly count it out clearly in bed tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>This afternoon, Wei Han had something to look for Leng Yan and had to coax Qi Zhifan in bed for a half a day before he finally got his permission. Only then did he dare to walk into Leng Yan\u2019s company.</p><br/><p>Because Leng Yan had previously given special instructions, the moment the front desk ladies saw Wei Han come, they immediately contacted Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Mr. Wei, you can go up.\u201d The receptionist smiled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, but didn\u2019t you say that Leng Yan was receiving other guests now? Isn\u2019t it not too good for me to suddenly barge in? It\u2019s okay, I can keep waiting here.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The young lady laughed twice into her sleeve. \u201cMr. Wei, please rest assured. Our President Leng said it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh, that\u2019s good, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Wei Han followed the secretary Little Wen and knocked on the door, he entered the room and was shocked by the situation.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao and Leng Yan were stand face-to-face. Chu Chuanyao was holding a bristling little white cat in his hand, and Leng Yan had a little snake of unknown breed, its entire body of emerald green, wrapped around his wrist. The little snake was flickering its tongue at random\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck me, what\u2019s this situation?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWei\u2026Big Brother Wei, why\u2026why are you here?!\u201d Chu Chuanyao looked back and saw Wei Han, jumping in fright.</p><br/><p>Wei Han waved at him and wryly smiled. \u201cI also want to ask you. Also, are you guys\u2026cat and snake fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Chu Chuanyao quickly shook his head and smiling, said, \u201cBig Brother Wei, you really can joke. It\u2019s like this. In the morning, the kind Mr. Leng picked up this stray cat whose foot was injured, but this cat seems to be very afraid of Mr. Leng. For the moment, he couldn\u2019t find someone to adopt it. It happened that I came to find him, and I really like this little guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, Chu Chuanyao gave the white cat in his arms a stroke. But because Leng Yan and the green snake was in front of it, the little guy was still very nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really troublesome because our President Leng is disliked by animals,\u201d Little Wen said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine ah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any trouble at all.\u201d Chu Chuanyao shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about this snake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was puzzled and pointed to the snake around Leng Yan\u2019s arm. Fortunately, they were all big men and weren\u2019t afraid of this kind of thing. If it was a little girl who\u2019d come in, she would have screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an exception. Not only isn\u2019t it the least bit afraid of President Leng, but it\u2019s also very arrogant.\u201d Little Wen\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t fallen when the little snake opened its mouth and bit Leng Yan. Fortunately, its two fangs had been pulled out in advance, and Leng Yan had also injected a serum more than once.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han, the two other people, and the cat looking quite unwell, the silent Leng Yan just said, \u201cLittle Wen, take Little Jade out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Little Wen bit the bullet and walked over with a special box.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Chu Chuanyao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Are you sure you want to call a poisonous snake that should be quite ferocious when it grows up, Little\u2026Little Jade?</p><br/><p>After that, Wei Han expressed his intention. Recently, a hotel boss was deliberately murdered. Because the hotel had a cooperation with the Leng Group, in order to do a more detailed investigation, Wei Han didn\u2019t want to let go of any aspects and also came to find Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan didn\u2019t say much and directly had someone give Wei Han a portfolio. He said that he\u2019d expected Wei Han would come, so he\u2019d already had the relevant information collected.</p><br/><p>Wei Han smiled and repeatedly thanked him. He felt more and more that Leng Yan was quite reliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d suspected before, but I didn\u2019t expect that your savior was really Leng Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leaving Leng Yan\u2019s company with Chu Chuanyao, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but ruefully say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, you\u2019re really amazing. How did you know such a great person? He\u2019s the president of the Leng Group ah. You don\u2019t know but when I was preparing to meet him, my heart kept jumping without stop. Before this, I only roughly remembered his stature. Today, when I saw the real person, I found out that he\u2019s super handsome ah! Just like the male lead in a TV show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026uh, it\u2019s a bit hard to explain in a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t ever say that it was caused by a high bulging crotch, right? And seeing Chu Chuanyao\u2019s eyes light up and admire Leng Yan\u2019s appearance, Wei Han didn\u2019t want to break Leng Yan\u2019s tall image in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. When you have the time, just slowly tell me. In short, he\u2019s definitely a good guy, and also so kind-hearted, haha.\u201d Chu Chuanyao smiled and teased the kitten in his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Mr. Leng also said that he really had an eye for me, and said that I really look like a friend he\u2019d met when studying abroad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s like that ah,\u201d Wei Han faintly answered, but thinking about it again, beside similarities in character, it could also be appearances ah. Then that person who looked similar to Chu Chuanyao and was also in a foreign country, he\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han\u2019s cell phone rang and he hurriedly picked it up. Shao Yi loudly said, \u201cWei Han, come quickly. There\u2019s an emergency operation!\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

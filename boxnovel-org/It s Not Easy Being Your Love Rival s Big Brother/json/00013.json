Since you\u2019ve come, don\u2019t think about leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captured Wei Han suffered a huge loss, and to summed up the experience: he knew that he couldn\u2019t resist at this time, that too much resistance would only lead to more suffering, and so had to follow Qi Zhifan\u2019s intention.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s lips wriggled a few times and squeezed out a smile: \u201cGood little brother, you can not let me go, but are you sure we\u2019re going to keep\u2026uh, this position until dawn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, who was pressing on Wei Han, not only didn\u2019t move away his body, but pressed closer, his warm breath puffed on Wei Han\u2019s face: \u201cWhat if I say \u2018yes\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was silly. Sometimes, he really couldn\u2019t guess Qi Zhifan\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>After twisting his neck and adjusting to a more comfortable posture, Wei Han simply let the broken jar fall and shatter: \u201cThen, I don\u2019t care anymore. Anyway, I have to go to school tomorrow. If I want to sleep, I\u2019m the type that can fall asleep in three seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was dubious and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>At this moment, if it was someone else, they definitely couldn\u2019t wait to be pressed down by Qi Zhifan, because that was the wet dream that they\u2019d daydreamed about everyday! If not, then wouldn\u2019t they still blush and be flustered, their small hearts jumping with a \u2018<em>thump thump</em>\u2018?</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the reaction that a normal person should have, Wei Han completely didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes, he\u2019d already fallen asleep. He felt that Qi Zhifan was no different than a big stone. If one absolutely must find a point of difference, then he talks more than a stone, was more dislikable than a stone, but was also hotter than the average stone.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s body temperature was indeed hotter than usual, no kidding, he was now pressing down on Wei Han!</p><br/><p>What the hell was this guy doing? Kept making a fool of himself and courting disaster, was he trying to get his attention? But it doesn\u2019t look too much like it.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s deep eyes were brewing with turbulent waves. Staring at Wei Han\u2019s sleeping face for a long time, his hand unwittingly reached up and pinched the face. Sure plump enough, very soft.</p><br/><p>Then is his lips also soft? Also gently tapping on Wei Han\u2019s lips with his fingertips, Qi Zhifan suddenly as though electrified, quickly withdrew his hand. But his face drew closer again. He wanted to try biting a mouthful.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han\u2019s snore blasted out!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can this person\u2019s nerves be any bit thicker?</p><br/><p>In this kind of situation, he actually didn\u2019t even have any sense of crisis! What if he did something to him?</p><br/><p>Did Wei Han really treat him as his own little brother, so trusted him so much? Or was he completely uninterested in him and regarded him as air?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s mood was very conflicted, now feeling happy, now choking on a bellyful of anger again.</p><br/><p>In the end, Qi Zhifan let go of Wei Han, covered him with a blanket, then rolled over and slept on the other side of the bed.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Qi Zhifan sported two big, dark circles and left the room. Not mentioning being disturbed by Wei Han\u2019s snoring all night, but halfway through the night, he was also kicked out of the bed once. That was enough!</p><br/><p>So when eating breakfast, Wei Han felt that Qi Zhifan had been using eye-daggers to viciously slice him countless times.</p><br/><p>Wei Han also knew he\u2019d been a bit unfair towards him, scratched his head, and prepared a seaweed roll to give to him for breakfast.</p><br/><p>Today, because Jiang Chengrui was going to go to his little brother\u2019s primary school for a parent-teacher conference, Wei Han took the initiative to help him deliver takeout to Chengyu Film Academy.</p><br/><p>On hearing the name of the school, Wei Han thought of Lu Yan, don\u2019t know, maybe he could run into him later?</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Wei Han rode a bicycle on Chengyu school campus and finished delivering the takeouts one by one. Then, he really did see Lu Yan from afar, as well as Qi Zhifan beside him.</p><br/><p>Ah, this was a coincidence: Qi Zhifan also came here to find his little boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two people walk into a certain art building, Wei Han, out of curiosity, also followed up and went to the music classroom before he stopped.</p><br/><p>Wei Han softly pushed the door ajar. Qi Zhifan was sitting in front of the piano, his long lashes sweeping a beautiful arc under his eyes, and a series of melodious notes also flowed from his fingertips.</p><br/><p>The sound of the piano was sometimes flowing and soothing, like the mountain streams flowing slowly; sometimes rushing like the water of the Yangtze River, powerful and magnificent. Each note jumped with its own dynamics: played to the sorrowful part, it left lingering emotions; played to the joyous part, it was warm and pleasing.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The sound of the piano tapered off, and the song ended.</p><br/><p>For a moment, both Wei Han and Qi Zhifan looked intoxicated, a bit wishing it\u2019d continue. After a good while, Lu Yan clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion. If he had a few of such awesome talents, there would certainly also be a bunch of people who\u2019d prostrate themselves under his jeans.</p><br/><p>But at this time, Qi Zhifan apparently found the dazed Wei Han in the doorway.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan stared at him quite uncomfortably, \u201cyou followed me again\u201d clearly written on his face.</p><br/><p>Wei Han unknowingly read and understood, hurriedly shook his head and explained in a rush, \u201cI didn\u2019t follow you. This time was really a chance encounter! I happened to be helping a classmate to deliver takeout, so I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice, Lu Yan looked back and also saw Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cDelivering takeout to a music classroom?\u201d Qi Zhifan cross-examined.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would also like to come in and play the piano, can\u2019t I? Or only you\u2019re allowed to play?\u201d These words, Wei Han mind hadn\u2019t filtered before his mouth first said it. Once said, he immediately wanted to thrash himself.</p><br/><p>The voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Qi Zhifan eyes flashed, a little not daring to believing.</p><br/><p>Lu Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly lighted up, pleasantly surprised, said, \u201cBrother Wei, turns out you also play the piano. Can you play a song for me? Greensleeves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s expression indicated that he\u2019d be able to play cotton, \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t really play classical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, popular also works. Like \u2018Marriage D\u2019Amour\u2019, \u2018Ballade pour Adeline\u2019, or \u2018Kiss The Rain\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Help! Spare him, it really was \u2018loose tongue causes trouble\u2019.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s scalp tingled, expression distorted: \u201c\u2026I, I can only play the very base.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he completely threw caution to the wind and played a song on the spot\u2026\u2026 \u2018Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u2019.</p><br/><p>After playing two verses, not waiting for Qi Zhifan and Lu Yan to react, Wei Han ran out and disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhifan, your older brother can really joke, haha.\u201d Lu Yan patted Qi Zhifan and forced out two laughs.</p><br/><p>Not knowing what demons and god were at work, Qi Zhifan touched the keys: \u201cVery good, quite special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Yan\u2019s three views suffered a blow once again.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan also regretted it himself the next second. Was he praising Wei Han?</p><br/><p>His brain must have short-circuited.</p><hr/><br/><p>On the weekend, the very busy Jiang Chengrui had a rare moment when he was free. Wei Han invited him to watch a movie, but Jiang Chengrui was temporarily delayed. Wei Han waited for him for a while, and in the end, Jiang Chengrui came with his little brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, <b>Silly Han<sup> [1]</sup></b>, I\u2019ve kept you waiting.\u201d Jiang Chengrui wore casual clothes and a casual hat. He personally liked wearing hats.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Wei Han smiled.</p><br/><p>Since the last mobilization meeting ended and after they came out from the auditorium, Jiang Chengrui had begun calling him \u201cSilly Han\u201d, and also looked at him quite strangely.</p><br/><p>Later, Jiang Chengrui kept calling him that, and Wei Han got used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because of this dead little demon pestering me, crying to come out with me,\u201d Jiang Chengrui complained, grabbing the little brother behind him and flicking his forehead.</p><br/><p>Wei Han finally saw clearly Jiang Chengyi, the naughty little brother who Jiang Chengrui kept mentioning all day long. Different from his older brother\u2019s naturally curly, yellow hair, Jiang Chengyi had black, orderly hair, bright and sparkling eyes, and looked very clever.</p><br/><p>Based on what Jiang Chengrui said, Jiang Chengyi was naughtier than any other children, always making trouble everyday. He climbed trees to scoop out bird nests, went to the fields to steal melons, pranked girls skirts in a mischievous manner, and partnered in group scuffles. Basically, he\u2019d done everything, but fortunately, the consequences weren\u2019t serious.</p><br/><p>In recent years, he\u2019d been more docile and far less naughty than before.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengyi didn\u2019t accept it and coldly snorted, \u201cHmph, I\u2019ve seen the calendar on your desk before. These two days, you made a note that it\u2019s your days off, so don\u2019t you think of abandoning me and going out to play alone. I won\u2019t obediently stay at home to do homework, either. I\u2019d immediately go look for Purple Sheep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare? Believe it or not, if you provoke me, then you go see him once, I\u2019ll beat you once.\u201d Saying this, Jiang Chengrui hit Jiang Chengyi\u2019s little bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201c<b>Wu-wu<sup> [2]</sup></b>, big brother, you\u2019re too bad and violent. I\u2019m going to tell big sister.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2019d be the one to complain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This bear child, really, seeing was believing.</p><br/><p>And what the hell was a purple sheep? How come he\u2019d never heard of it. It shouldn\u2019t be a creature from a cartoon sheep village, and it probably was children joking with each other and giving each other nicknames and so on.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, children naturally want to have fun, you also don\u2019t need to be so strict. Letting him play and make noise with other little partners is also not a big deal,\u201d Wei Han laughed and persuaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Sheep isn\u2019t a child, he\u2019s a dirty adult!\u201d Jiang Chengrui quickly corrected.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han suddenly choked, staring blankly, \u201cLittle Jiang, in the end, what is that purple sheep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui pinched his eyebrows, a helpless headache: \u201cAi, Pei Yuyang, that perverted gay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wow, Pei Yuyang, for his family\u2019s pig, was really giving his all, to be entangled for this long.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, you don\u2019t know. Several times recently, <strong>Purple Sheep<sup> [3]</sup></strong> was waiting at the school gate when I was let out of school. He\u2019s foolish and has lots of money, cheating him is fun.\u201d Jiang Chengyi\u2019s big eyes rolled around.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s preparing to start from you? Damn it, then have you done what I told you? I told you to ignore him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh, I was super cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Jiang Chengrui rubbed Little Yi\u2019s head with satisfaction. \u201cIn the future, you\u2019re not allowed to see him, and also not allowed to mention him in front of me, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh,\u201d Jiang Chengyi nodded his head while muttering softly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll just go behind your back. Anyway, big brother, you wouldn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Later, Wei Han discussed with Jiang Chengrui, and the two decided to accompany Little Yi to watch an animated movie, and then go to the nearby playground to play.</p><br/><p>There were always more people who came out to play on the weekends. Wei Han lined up to buy the tickets and let Jiang Chengrui take his little brother to find a restaurant and order food first. Then he\u2019d meet up with the two again, have lunch together, and be just in time to watch the movie.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was waiting in line when suddenly, Lu Yan\u2019s voice came from an adjacent line: \u201cHey, Brother Wei, it\u2019s you ah. How coincidental, we meet again today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han wryly smiled, yeah, he also wanted to know how it can be so coincidental? He hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the shadow of the last disgrace!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wei, what are you going to see? Romance, comedy or horror?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPl\u2026Pleasant Sheep and the Big Bad Wolf.\u201d Wei Han felt a little like crying without tears.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Yan was stupid for a moment and smiled reluctantly, \u201cUh, this is also quite good, proof that Brother Wei\u2019s childish heart hasn\u2019t vanished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, how come you\u2019re alone? What about Qi Zhifan?\u201d Wei Han quickly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>On hearing his sweetheart\u2019s name, Lu Yan appeared a lot more bashful and lightly laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for me elsewhere. I came to buy the tickets first. Aside from what he eats, Zhifan doesn\u2019t have any special requirements for these things. I plan to watch a romance movie with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t watch a romance movie, go watch a horror movie.\u201d Wei Han was hit with an inspiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Are you sure Zhifan likes it?\u201d Lu Yan was doubtful in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Sometimes I can\u2019t guess what he likes, but I want him to like you.\u201d Wei Han looked in Lu Yan\u2019s eyes and said quite sincerely.</p><br/><p>Lu Yan face turned red. \u201cBrother Wei, you\u2019re really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han waved his hand. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. In fact, it\u2019s also for myself. If you can both stay together for a long time, I\u2019d also be alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>For his Chu Chuanyao, Wei Han will certainly try to set them up.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><b>1.

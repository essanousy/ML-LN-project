Ou Yizhe? Before Rebirth?</strong></p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had not seen Wei Han for three days. Not only could he not see his silly and foolish appearance, but he could not hear his voice. He had been unable to contact Wei Han, so he could only wait for Wei Han to call.</p><br/><p>He wrinkled his brows and his face was overcast. He\u2019d looked at his cell phone every five minutes and he decided that if Wei Han called, he would fiercely scold that fool for a spell, actually leaving a green parrot to get by him!</p><br/><p>In the end, Qi Zhifan waited for another two days, and in this way, five days already passed.</p><br/><p>A week passed and Qi Zhifan still didn\u2019t received a call from Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Although midway through, Qi Zhifan suspected countless times that something had happened to Wei Han outside, but when he contacted the people that he knew in the police department, they hadn\u2019t received any news. They said that it was a normal phenomenon and that the assigned police officers must obey the sergeant in all matters. It was estimated that they were too busy and the signal wasn\u2019t good in some remote places in the country.</p><br/><p>\u201cHubby, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Listening to the green parrot\u2019s <i>mwah mwah~</i> everyday, Qi Zhifan\u2019s irritability and gloominess in the beginning had become a kind of deep yearning. Also, from telling Butler Sun to take this annoying green guy far away, he was now personally feeding it himself.</p><br/><p>Putting the green parrot in his palm, QI Zhifan stroked the little guy\u2019s feathers while teasing it, \u201cSay something a little nicer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t afraid that it would suddenly fly away because he already knew that this green guy had both a lazy and stupid, urine character. During this time, he also taught the parrot to say a lot, including narcissistic self-boasting, and also some special words of love for Wei Han that Qi Zhifan normally wouldn\u2019t say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHubby Trouble, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble Hubby, <i>mwah mwah~</i>\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, when the little guy opened its mouth, it always said the things Wei Han first taught it.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He would love to teach this stupid parrot so many sweet speeches and honeyed words, but it didn\u2019t even remember a single one!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t in the mood to work this afternoon. He was staring at the photo in his wallet that Wei Han had casually handed over to him, that one-inch photo of him that was stuffed in his wallet.</p><br/><p>Actually, Qi Zhifan still had many photos of Wei Han in his cell phone, such as Wei Han\u2019s earnest side when he was cooking, his quiet sleeping face; and Wei Han\u2019s solemn appearance when he wore his police uniform and hat, as well as when he was wearing a large T-shirt at home, leaning lazily on the sofa with the collar freely open\u2026</p><br/><p>Accustomed to those photos, Qi Zhifan felt that this one-inch portrait of Wei Han seemed to have a special \u201cflavor\u201d. Fortunately, he hadn\u2019t been impulsive and thrown it away at that time. Before, he\u2019d especially ignored this one-inch photo, but now he particularly cherished it.</p><br/><p>The cell phone rang suddenly. When he saw the screen displayed the three characters \u2018Stomach Cold\u2019 and Wei Han\u2019s silly smiling face, Qi Zhifan\u2019s fingertips stopped, fearing that it was his own delusion.</p><br/><p>The phone continued to ring, and Qi Zhifan, with rapt attention, connected through.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Odd Trouble, you haven\u2019t gotten off work yet? I\u2026I\u2019m not disturbing you?\u201d At his end of the line, Wei Han\u2019s voice was filled with emotion and obviously also apprehensive.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan found that the several days of anger that he\u2019d accumulated had suddenly disappeared when he heard Wei Han\u2019s familiar tone and voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can disturb me as much as you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled for a moment. He felt that although Qi Zhifan\u2019s words now weren\u2019t warm or hot, but they must be concealing a desire to murder inside, so he immediately took the initiative to admit his mistake, \u201cOdd Trouble, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s been so long before I called you, and you also didn\u2019t answer your phone so I know you must be very angry. In fact, I really miss you, but I\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan interrupted him. The \u2018I really miss you\u2019 in Wei Han\u2019s mouth instantly made Qi Zhifan feel much more at ease. Wei Han was a policeman, so he naturally also understood that he had his difficulties.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan still wanted to ask something, but he paused for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Odd Trouble, what do you want to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Qi Zhifan wanted to ask a lot: he wanted to ask Wei Han if he was living well outside. Did he eat well? Sleep well? Did someone else bully him? Did he protect himself? Did he stay farther away from that malicious Shao Yi guy?</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, will you always stay with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Qi Zhifan suddenly asked such headless and brainless words.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was slightly stunned, vaguely being able to feel something. The love that sprouted from the bottom of Qi Zhifan\u2019s heart\u2014beside the feelings he had for Ou Yizhe in his youth\u2014was now given to him. Was he afraid that he would leave him too?</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, of course I will always stay with you,\u201d Wei Han smiled and promised.</p><br/><p>This day, Qi Zhifan was tidying things up in Wei Han\u2019s room. In the room that he had carefully prepared for Wei Han, he usually didn\u2019t let the housekeeper aunts clean up. As long as he had the time, he would do it himself.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan found a very thick notebook. He felt that it was a little strange so he took a closer look. Carefully and neatly written on the cover was: \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s brows jumped. What kind of thing was this?</p><br/><p>If this was an ordinary notebook, Qi Zhifan wouldn\u2019t have bothered to look, but seeing the words \u2018Odd Trouble\u2019 in front, his curiosity was thoroughly aroused.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan opened the first page and the first line of words was\u3010Qi Zhifan was my love rival in my past life!\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Past life? Had this fool been with Leng Yan for so long that his brain hole had become big enough to write novels?</p><br/><p>Following that were dense words, all very trivial things: the meal when they first met, Qi Zhifan had a very good \u201ceye\u201d and drank Mother Wei\u2019s dark soup; Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t study but went to mix at a gay bar; Qi Zhifan was a picky eater with a poisonous mouth\u2026</p><br/><p>These item after item, he knew at a glance that when Wei Han recorded them, he must have hated him so much in his heart. Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but hook his lips up and smile, thinking it was very interesting. It turned out that Wei Han had cared about him so much at that time.</p><br/><p>His eyes swept back to the first line of the second page\u3010I\u2019m his older brother in this life!\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t understand it yet when Pei Yuyang\u2019s call came through.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Fan, I\u2019ll tell you something soon. You have to promise me first that you\u2019ll stay calm.\u201d Pei Yuyang\u2019s tone was seldom so solemn and serious. When Qi Zhifan heard it, he suddenly had a sense of foreboding.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it quickly,\u201d Qi Zhifan impatiently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurlie received an emergency notice. Wei Han, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was shot in the head, and a few hours later, he was rushed to S City\u2019s major hospital for surgery.</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan and Pei Yuyang hastily arrived, many people were already keeping watch outside the operating room. Dad Qi and Mother Wei, Jiang Chengrui, and also Leng Yan had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026what\u2019s going on? Han-han, he\u2026he has to be okay,\u201d Mother Wei, hugged to Qi Hao\u2019s bosom, had already broken down into tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. He\u2019d be able to get through this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Hao comforted her while holding her even tighter. Natural and man-made disasters, life was full of accidents and no one knew what would happen next. Even if he was used to seeing life and death, faced with his own family\u2019s, his heart was still painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I was by Silly Han\u2019s side during this mission, maybe this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Seeing Qi Zhifan had come, Jiang Chengrui also had a heavy expression.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head with almost no expression on his face. He only closely stared at the entrance to the operating room. When he saw that the red light was on, his heart had been seized and couldn\u2019t help but remember Wei Han\u2019s promise to him a few days ago.</p><br/><p>That fool, obviously he\u2019d promised to stay with him, obviously he\u2019d smiled and promised!</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured, Cyril is inside.\u201d At this time, the always silent Leng Yan also came over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui to the side heard this and hurriedly added, \u201cDr. Cyril is the brain surgeon who just got off a plane a few hours ago and rushed over here. He\u2019s also the friend that Mr. Leng specially invited back from the United States.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Qi Zhifan glanced at Leng Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Cyril here, Wei Han will be fine,\u201d Leng Yan said again.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked at Leng Yan again and pulled his lips: \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In general, Qi Zhifan seldom opened his golden mouth to say thanks, especially to his \u2018love rivals,\u2019 but there was an exception to everything.</p><br/><p>The operation was still ongoing and everyone outside the operating room stayed almost a day and a night. In the early morning, seeing that everyone was very tired, especially the older Dad Qi and Mother Wei, Jiang Chengrui planned to first go buy some breakfast and come back. Pei Yuyang saw this and also anxiously wanted to follow him.</p><br/><p>His face filled with a welcoming smile as always, it was hard for Jiang Chengrui to refuse. He lowered his head and also let Pei Yuyang go with him.</p><br/><p>Then, about fifteen minutes later, the red light at the entrance of the operating room finally turned off. The door was opened from the inside and the doctors and nurses immediately walked out one after the other.</p><br/><p>When the chief surgeon came out, Qi Zhifan originally was the first to come forward, but when he saw the doctor in the lead, his steps instantly faltered and he stood stiffly in place.</p><br/><p>This man, even if he was wearing a mask, but Qi Zhifan was still very familiar with those pair of slender and quick-witted brows and eyes. In those lush green years, he\u2019d always been obsessed with the owner of this pair of eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, how\u2019s my son?\u201d At this time, Qi Hao asked while supporting Mother Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bullet has been smoothly extracted and I\u2019ve done all that I could. The rest is up to his own willpower,\u201d the doctor said, taking off his mask.</p><br/><p>\u201cHard work, Cyril.\u201d Then, Leng Yan also stepped forward and patted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle thing. Michael. You rushed to get me back here overnight, so he should be a very important friend of yours?\u201d Dr. Cyril winked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>He faintly smiled again. \u201cSince he\u2019s your friend, then he\u2019s also mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Cyril\u2019s eyes swept a casual glance and coincidentally met Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>In a split second, two people\u2019s four eyes came into contact and both were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Ou\u2026Ou Yizhe?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just came back from buying breakfast, Pei Yuyang cried out in surprise. His astonished gaze rested on Cyril for a long time. The man he\u2019d seen several times in the photo was now standing live before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan\u2019s face also flashed with a hint of surprise. \u201cSo you all knew each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cyril nodded and slowly walked in front of Qi Zhifan. His eyes had always been staring at his face and his smile was clear and shallow. \u201cZhifan, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once, Qi Zhifan had thought many times that there would be a day in the future when Ou Yizhe would come back. Only now, he hadn\u2019t foreseen that this ruthless man would\u2014in this situation and this circumstances\u2014return to save Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Although the operation was over, Wei Han was still in a deep coma and couldn\u2019t awaken.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi, who was injured along with the comatose Wei Han, was also in the hospital. His injuries were far less severe than Wei Han\u2019s\u30fche was shot several times in the leg\u30fcso he was already awake.</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard that Wei Han was out of the operating room, Shao Yi disregarded that it was still inconvenient to walk and came to see him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Wei Han was shot when saving me.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the scouting process, Shao Yi had underestimated the fugitives too much and his momentary impulsive actions had ended up with his capture. Finally, he had to rely on Wei Han to sneak into the enemy camp to rescue him.</p><br/><p>The just awoken Shao Yi was very remorseful. He\u2019d clearly always suspected that Wei Han was stupid before, but in the end, it was he who\u2019d made a low level mistake and also implicated others.</p><br/><p>By Wei Han\u2019s bedside, Qi Zhifan tightly gripped his hands. He didn\u2019t lift his eyelids and coldly said, \u201cIt\u2019s useless to say these things now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan already issue the order to leave, Shao Yi didn\u2019t plan to seek another rebuff. He took a final look at the still comatose Wei Han and he clenched his fists, secretly making a vow in the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>During the days when Wei Han was in a coma, Qi Zhifan slowly comprehended the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d book. Starting from the front, the odd-numbered pages wrote about the bad things he\u2019d done to Wei Han. The even-numbered pages were things that Wei Han believed to be pay back. Later, Qi Zhifan discovered that from the last page, he also wrote a thick stack of sheets, recording all the good he\u2019d done for him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silly and lacking. When Wei Han was good to a person, he couldn\u2019t help but be fully devoted to them. But when he wanted to take revenge on someone, he was extraordinarily stupid and kept courting death. Was he naturally kindhearted?</p><br/><p>Tonight, Dad Qi and Mother Wei weren\u2019t there, and only Qi Zhifan was alone in the hospital with Wei Han. He also laid in the bed, just quietly holding Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, why is it only you?\u201d Suddenly, Qi Zhifan whispered in his ear.</p><br/><p>There were so many people in the world, so many beautiful and outstanding, more suitable men and woman than Wei Han. But why was it only him?</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go? Quickly get the hell back here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Blood blossomed and spattered. The moment the bullet penetrated his head: pain, unbearable pain! Immediately afterwards, the terrible darkness swept over him, surrounding and engulfing his critically wounded body.</p><br/><p>As a policeman, this way of dying seemed pretty good.</p><br/><p>Only\u2026only, Odd Trouble, what\u2026what should he do?</p><br/><p>This was the last thing he thought about in the second before he lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he felt a burst of exhaustion and his entire body continued to sink down into the endless thick darkness. At the same time, there were intermittent sounds in his ears, as if there were many people shouting at him, but he couldn\u2019t hear clearly and couldn\u2019t tell who it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, Big Brother Wei!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the voice gradually became clear and light slowly filtered into his eyes.</p><br/><p>Wei Han jerked open his eyes. Ahh? Why was the worried face of Little Yao in front of him?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei? What happened to you all of a sudden? Are you uncomfortable?\u201d Chu Chuanyao supported Wei Han up and asked with concern.</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help rubbing his temples. He also didn\u2019t understand what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cI reckon he\u2019s too fat and has all three highs.\u201d (T/N: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat)</p><br/><p>The ears immediately moved. Wei Han was particularly familiar with this cold voice and poisonous tongue attack. He looked up at the man sitting at a table not far away and his eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Wei, don\u2019t mind him. Zhifan has a bit of a bad mouth,\u201d Chu Chuanyao smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Wei Han deeply knitted his brows. Little Yao, why did you call \u2018Zhifan\u2019? \u2018Senior Qi\u2019 was still more pleasing.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! This time and place\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately looked around and looked down at his long-absent white chef clothes. Then, he pinched the flesh on his face and suddenly, he felt bad all over ah!</p><br/><p>Fuck, wasn\u2019t this before his rebirth, when Little Yao had first introduced him to Qi Zhifan!</p><br/><p>And now, he was still a dead fatty with a fat face whose facial features were crammed in and couldn\u2019t be seen!</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

When you go out, you don\u2019t even wear a scarf. And it\u2019s so late, you\u2019re still on the rooftop feeling the wind. Do you have a pit in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han took the scarf in a daze, and didn\u2019t open his mouth to refute anything. He knew that despite Qi Zhifan\u2019s bad tone, this was also out of concern.</p><br/><p>Rarely seeing Wei Han so obedient, Qi Zhifan\u2019s anger also suddenly left, and he went up to help wrap the scarf around his neck. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han shook his head. \u201cI still want to stay a while longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said \u2018I\u2019ll accompany you\u2019.\u201d Qi Zhifan stressed again, then he sniffed, \u201cTsk, your whole body reeks with alcohol. Did you drink until you became silly? Can\u2019t even understand human words. If you want to feel the wind, or look at the stars, I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Look at the stars? Reminded by Qi Zhifan, Wei Han looked up at the night sky. Sure enough, the sky was filled with stars, incomparably bright.</p><br/><p>Although the wind on the rooftop was a bit strong, but the horizon was wide, so the stars were very clear. This also let Wei Han\u2019s mood, which had been depressed because of Chu Chuanyao\u2019s matter, turn around a lot.</p><br/><p>From Qi Zhifan\u2019s point of view, Wei Han\u2019s eyes, reflecting the starlight, were shining and bright, more moving than all the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Suddenly, Wei Han said this sentence in dead earnest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you suddenly say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019?\u201d Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but feel that Wei Han was being silly again.</p><br/><p>Wei Han scratched his head and awkwardly said, \u201cUh, because when I first came to this house, I did a bunch of unpleasant things to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you fault alone,\u201d Qi Zhifan lightly said, implicitly admitting that he was also in the wrong. His initial attitude toward Wei Han was pretty bad.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was a little surprised again, and then laughed, \u201cHaha, Odd Trouble, I feel more and more that having you, this little brother, is also very good. Later on, I will be a good older brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, I don\u2019t need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Odd Trouble look, it\u2019s a shooting star!\u201d Qi Zhifan\u2019s words were interrupted by Wei Han\u2019s surprised voice. Wei Han excitedly pointed to the sky. \u201cQuick\u2026make a wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words finished, he closed his eyes and quietly made several wishes in his heart\u30fc</p><br/><p>First, I hope I can become a police officer;</p><br/><p>Second, together with Qi Zhifan, the two brothers can create a happy and harmonious family together;</p><br/><p>Third, I can with Little Yao\u2026</p><br/><p>But the shooting star flashed away and disappeared too quickly. Wei Han had no time to finish. \u201cAi, there was still the last one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t take any action, his eyes always remaining on Wei Han. He hadn\u2019t made a wish. He\u2019d never believed in this. As for Wei Han\u2019s wishes, he could guess that among them included becoming a police officer, as well as Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. We should go back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Qi Zhifan took Wei Han\u2019s hand and pulled him away.</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared blankly, shooting a glance at the their two hands held tightly together. He found that Qi Zhifan\u2019s gripping strength was a bit stronger, but he also didn\u2019t say anything, and just let Qi Zhifan pull him.</p><br/><p>The next year came, and the new semester began again in the spring season. This semester, because of the special nature of their profession, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui would go to C City for three months of training.</p><br/><p>This trip was three months long, so before leaving, Wei Han specially invited Chu Chuanyao out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yao, after three months, I will tell you something very important when I return.\u201d Wei Han had an earnest expression. He decided to wait until the training was over before he came back and confessed to Chu Chuanyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat important thing? Can\u2019t you say it now?\u201d Chu Chuanyao was a bit puzzled.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The timing wasn\u2019t right. It was estimated that Chu Chuanyao was still not over the pain of Teacher Dong\u2019s marriage, and Wei Han also needed to sort out his thoughts. Not knowing why, his attachment to Chu Chuanyao wasn\u2019t as strong as before, and gradually, he thought it was another kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>He really needed time to think about it. After thinking about it, would he boldly confess to Chu Chuanyao? Or something else? Wei Han felt he must settle this.</p><br/><p>In the end, Wei Han didn\u2019t explain too much and just patted Chu Chuanyao. \u201cLittle Yao, in short, you have to look after yourself well in the next few months, be at ease and wait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao nodded and smiled, \u201cBig Brother Wei, rest assured, I only attend class at school, what can happen? But you, you\u2019re going somewhere else for so long, it\u2019d definitely be hard. You have to put in extra effort ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, I will definitely work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han made a fist. Although he was a bit silly and a bit frightened, but he wasn\u2019t afraid of enduring hardship. In order to achieve his police dream, he felt that even if he was tired again, he would still clench his teeth to get through it.</p><br/><p>C City, training base.</p><br/><p>Because Wei Han and others had already been randomly assigned to teams with the other students from the Public Security Police Academy to train for a week in the last semester, so this semester was still according to the last semester\u2019s arrangements and they entered into the three months of closed training.</p><br/><p>In the same team, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui could cheerfully get along with the other two people. But in the face of Shao Yi and the several college guys from C Uni\u2019s Public Security that followed him, no matter how they looked, they weren\u2019t pleasing to the eye.</p><br/><p>In addition, during the last semester, Jiang Chengrui and Shao Yi practiced live ammunition shooting and started a feud, so they both loathed each other. Shao Yi and them almost always deliberately provoked them and tried to pick fault.</p><br/><p>In this training camp, the school specially invited several senior instructors from the city\u2019s Armed Police Squadron to teach the whole course. In addition to learning the laws, routines, and other police knowledge, the focus was on police strengthening body training, including formation training, arrest boxing, baton-shield operation and other basic skills, as well as training and assessment of professional skills such as escort, guard, court duty, and security inspections.</p><br/><p>Intense and regimented work and rest, training, and class began. In theory class, Jiang Chengrui was not as good as Shao Yi. In comparison, Wei Han still studied well. But once on the training ground, he was far behind Jiang Chengrui and Shao Yi, these two.</p><br/><p>Frog jumps, push ups, pull ups, and so on: these training were almost done daily. Wei Han often gritted his teeth to persevere and complete the tasks, always thinking of Qi Zhifan. These were once his \u201cpunishments\u201d for him.</p><br/><p>Ai, looking back now, perhaps he was doing him good.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, step forward!\u201d</p><br/><p>This afternoon, when training in arrest boxing, the instructor knew that every time Jiang Chengrui sparred with Wei Han, he\u2019d always go lenient on him. This time, he simply replaced Jiang Chengrui with Shao Yi.</p><br/><p>Face to face with Wei Han, Shao Yi\u2019s eyes were extremely unkind and his mouth was pulled into a cruel smile. Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but feel his scalp go numb and tightly clenched his fists.</p><br/><p>In the end, several sets of actions came down. Shao Yi was not sparring at all, but was unilaterally \u201cbeating\u201d Wei Han. Wei Han only felt that the bones in his body were quickly falling apart.</p><br/><p>The next day, he should have gotten up at five, but Wei Han, who was painfully uncomfortable, accidentally overslept. It wasn\u2019t until 5:30 that he hurriedly climbed out of bed, not having the chance to properly fold his quilt yet.</p><br/><p>Who knew that this day happened to be the day that the very fierce Instructor Liu would inspect the dorms. He inspected strictly, frowned, and then called Wei Han over to mercilessly scolded him a round. Of course, he would inevitably be punished.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Shao Yi, who was rejoicing in his misfortunes, came forward and proposed to punish Wei Han with heavy load running. In order to prevent Wei Han from being lazy, he also volunteered to keep his eyes on Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s face turned white instantly.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just that he\u2019d called him \u201cArrogant Shao\u201d before, and reminded him to be less arrogant? This person was so fucking vindictive ah!</p><br/><p>Then, under the scorching sun, other people were training, but the bitterly-forced Wei Han had to carry a weight of 10kg and run a full five kilometers. Not mentioning the sweat soaking his clothes, but midway through, he even vomited once.</p><br/><p>At lunch break, Jiang Chengrui came to see Wei Han. His entire body had fallen on his bed, and he was too tired to even think about moving his fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Silly Han, are you still alive?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die,\u201d Wei Han weakly said, \u201cThat Arrogant Shao, is too\u2026too damn cruel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui patted him comfortingly and his eyes turned. \u201cSilly Han, speaking of Shao Yi, have you found out a matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLast semester, he was only focused on me alone, and always set himself against me. But now, he seems to have transferred to you. He seems very interested in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, what was this called? A nickname triggered a murder? That surnamed Shao\u2019s heart was too small.</p><br/><p>In arduous training everyday, although the days dragged past like a year for Wei Han, but he also persisted for two more months. Sometimes, when he dreamed at night, he would miss his family and friends. He\u2019d thought that the person he\u2019d miss the most would be Chu Chuanyao, but actually it was Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Especially in the last few days, the times Wei Han dreamed of Qi Zhifan became more and more frequent.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s arrogance and rudeness to him in his past life. Also, when he first entered the family, Qi Zhifan\u2019s cold-hearted and grim, frequent attacks of his poisonous tongue. To later, when it slowly became Qi Zhifan\u2019s \u201cfilial piety\u201d.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s mind was almost all full of Qi Zhifan: his angry appearance, his gloomy and speechless expression, his amused smile, what he\u2019d said to him before; his figure, body temperature, and also, that thing residing in his crotch\u2026</p><br/><p>In the early hours of the morning, Wei Han absentmindedly woke up. Can it be that his dreams were completely held by Odd Trouble?</p><br/><p>During the training, the trainees not only exercised their bodies and gradually mastered the police\u2019s knowledge and skills, but also greatly strengthened their organization discipline, team spirit, and compliance.</p><br/><p>In the most recent inspection and review, the instructor selected thirty outstanding trainees based on the combined score in theory and skills, and prepared to conduct a one-week field survival training for them.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui, and also Shao Yi, were certainly among them.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Breet\u2026breet\u2026</i>\u201d the sky just dawned when a burst of urgent whistle sounds roused the fast asleep Wei Han and company. They tidied up their sleeping bags, packed their equipment, and set off with the team, taking a boat to a small island that was a distance away from the training base.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nibbled on the dry food he\u2019d taken with him for his breakfast, but he didn\u2019t dare to eat too much because the seven days of field survival training stipulated that they could only bring three days worth of food, but also had to carry guns, ammunition and survival supplies. En route, they also had to split up into teams and carry out advanced training in mountain and woodland searches, cliff climbing, beach chase, and other training.</p><br/><p>In the first three days, the instructors led the people in centralized training. The first evening when everyone was busy setting up tents, the lead instructor brought in two special students.</p><br/><p>When the whistle sounded, everyone hurried to gather again. Always feeling that the two guys wearing hats beside the instructor were familiar, Wei Han in the back ranks narrowed his eyes to carefully look\u30fc</p><br/><p>Fuck! How did Odd Trouble and Foolish Man-Sheep come here?!</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Below are pictures. (The pictures were of two people taking the bus together and going into the same building in a neighborhood district.)</p><br/><p>2nd post: Fuck! They have the rhythm of cohabitation?</p><br/><p>3rd post: Then it couldn\u2019t be that they\u2019ve already seen their parents, and came out of the closet?</p><br/><p>4th post: The two also started cohabiting when they\u2019re still in school. Is it possible that they have a childhood friendship, and pledged to be married from when they were little? No, this really pokes my <i>meng </i>point ah!</p><br/><p>5th post: Hahaha, before I stood firmly in the true love association ah, now I\u2019m prepared to whip together some money.</p><br/><p>6th post: Poster above, count me in. I\u2019m looking forward to their wedding!</p><br/><p>7th post: It so happens that in my next article, I will write about their married life. By the way, they\u2019ll adopt a boy and a girl, and the whole family will be joyous and harmonious.</p><br/><p>8th post: I\u2019m worthless with words, but I will try to draw it.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>When Wei Han clicked into it, his face turned pale after seeing it, and simply felt as if his head would explode. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore, feeling that he simply couldn\u2019t block the pit in their brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Zhifan, you didn\u2019t find recently in the school, that uh, there\u2019s a bit of trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back home, Wei Han mumbled, really wanting to ask Qi Zhifan to deal with this rotten-hearted scandal.</p><br/><p>He himself had already explained countless times and exhausted his speech, but everyone had always been skeptical. If Qi Zhifan could also come forward to clarify, then maybe it\u2019d be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly raised his eyebrows. He also saw that Wei Han always had a crying face these past few days, and still intentionally avoided him.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded, his face suddenly smiling, \u201cUh-huh, you\u2019re the study god and the vice president, and also S Uni\u2019s shareholder, help me out a little bit. I can make things for you to eat. You can choose whatever you want to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it feels so troublesome,\u201d Qi Zhifan said lazily, directly patted his butt and left.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ahh? Was food temptation useless? The flame of hope was suddenly extinguished.</p><br/><p>But strange to say, how come Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t care at all, like it had nothing to do with him? At present, the administrator in the BBS seemed to have vanished and hadn\u2019t deleted those posts at all. Was Qi Zhifan unaware of this matter?</p><br/><p>Ai, probably Qi Zhifan was holding several positions and usually very busy, so temporarily was too lazy to manage the gossip about himself.</p><br/><p>In the dessert shop, these days were very unusual. In addition to classes, Wei Han stayed here almost all of the time. In the evening, he also ate his dinner before returning home. He wanted to get through this period of time first, and when everyone finds out that there was nothing between Qi Zhifan and him, or a new topic turns up, then the scandal crisis would settle and naturally be forgotten.</p><br/><p>The store manager, Song Bohao, was a bit unable to understand. Why did Wei Han, who was still a student, insist on working the night shift? Jiang Chengrui was well aware of what was going on and patted Wei Han\u2019s shoulder, expressing his deep sympathy.</p><br/><p>Because Wei Home came home late, so Mother Wei had to cook. This also led to a significant drop in the quality of Qi Zhifan and Dad Qi\u2019s meals. It could be said that heaven and earth, the gap was too great.</p><br/><p>So, Qi Zhifan came to the dessert shop where Wei Han worked.</p><br/><p>There were some S Uni students in the shop. The sudden appearance of Male God Qi caught their attention, and especially the girls in Wei Han\u2019s class were even more excited. They knew that Wei Han worked here. Now that Qi Zhifan had also come, wasn\u2019t this specially coming to see his sweetheart?</p><br/><p>For Qi Zhifan to suddenly visit, but also specially request Wei Han\u2019s service, he simply scared Wei Han out of his wits. He hid in the back kitchen and simply didn\u2019t dare to come out.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Song Bohao was a bit unclear on what was going on. Jiang Chengrui saw that for Wei Han to keep hiding wasn\u2019t a solution, and he wanted to help him come up with a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, yours and Qi Zhifan\u2019s scandal, does he know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han with a bitter expression, shook his head. \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s constantly involved in scandals previously, and it\u2019s estimated he\u2019s also too lazy to manage it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you just tell him?\u201d Jiang Chengrui asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t say it,\u201d Wei Han said, embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Did he want him to personally say to Qi Zhifan that they were mistaken as a couple, and that this older brother was also the <i>shou </i>being pressed underneath!</p><br/><p>Usually, Wei Han\u2019s face wasn\u2019t so thin, but when the other was Qi Zhifan, he was a little unable to let go of his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t I say it for you? Anyway, Qi Zhifan is waiting outside.\u201d Jiang Chengrui rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Wei Han quickly stopped him. \u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t, Little Jiang, I don\u2019t want to bother you. I have to make it clear to Qi Zhifan myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. You have to let everyone know that you are his older brother and nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, Wei Han carried the plate of food, hesitated, and eventually came before Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Legs tilted, Qi Zhifan, who had been waiting for half a day, looked up. \u201cHow is it so slow? You can really dawdle inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s lips twitched, didn\u2019t speak, and put the cake tray down and also gave him ice cream. When walking, Wei Han only felt as if there were tips of blades on his back as countless pairs of eyes stared at his every move.</p><br/><p>Adam\u2019s apple moving, Wei Han\u2019s voice tore out, \u201cQi Zhifan, I\u2019m your brother, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words were astonishing. The crowd of students were suddenly stunned silly.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan also stopped moving his hand and looked at Wei Han with a ruminating face: \u201c\u2026What, do you want put on your older brother\u2019s airs to pressure me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPressure what ah! Very busy person, trouble you in your spare time, to go look at the BBS to see what our relationship has become. Good, Bye!\u201d Wei Han shouted, with the last two words especially forcefully bitten out.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han\u2019s back, the corners of Qi Zhifan\u2019s lips raised in an imperceptible arc\u2026</p><br/><p>This matter, he\u2019d just known a few days ago. Previously seeing Wei Han\u2019s distressed appearance, he\u2019d asked around a little and realized that they\u2019d been turned into a scandal. Strangely, Qi Zhifan wasn\u2019t angry this time. Instead, he was looking forward to how Wei Han would resolve it.</p><br/><p>Within his expectations, Wei Han couldn\u2019t stand it, and still blurted out their real relationship in front of him.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the \u201cbrothers\u201d relationship between Wei Han and Qi Zhifan was made known to everyone in S Uni.</p><br/><p>However, because Wei Han and Qi Zhifan had no blood relationship, some rotten sisters opened wide their brain pit. After confirming the brother setup, they followed the crowd, and a big pile of brothers text appeared\u30fc</p><br/><p>Something like \u201cOverbearing Younger Brother Fell in Love with Me,\u201d \u201cOutrageous Younger Brother Don\u2019t Provoke Me,\u201d and \u201cHigh Society Young Master\u2019s Private Pet Brother,\u201d \u201cLoving Older Brother Excessively,\u201d as well as \u201cBlack-Bellied Younger Brother\u2019s Pit the Brother Plan,\u201d \u201cMaster Qi\u2019s Only Pampered <i>Meng </i>Brother\u201d \u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han almost sprayed a mouthful of blood on the phone screen!</p><br/><p>Fuck, why did it changed to brotherly taboo love, and most of them were president style text ah! Fuck, in the end, this group of people had no lower limit ah!</p><br/><p>Wei Han shed tears of remorse in his heart: at that time, it would have been better to not explain. This time, it only made matters worse. How come it seemed inevitable that Odd Trouble and he would be involved together.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>On the weekend, Pei Yuyang went to play tennis with Qi Zhifan. After playing for a while, Qi Zhifan felt bored and sat down to rest.</p><br/><p>If it was before, Pei Yuyang would surely cling to Qi Zhifan to accompany him for a few more sets. But since knowing Qi Zhifan had low blood sugar, he didn\u2019t dare to let him get tired and also let him go.</p><br/><p>After finding other people to accompany him, Pei Yuyang got bored because the other side\u2019s skills weren\u2019t great. So he also retired from the court and walked over to Qi Zhifan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had always been staring at his phone, looking at something with great interest.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was somewhat curious. As far as he knew, under normal circumstances, Qi Zhifan usually read financial and business books, and also detective murder mysteries. However, he read books in hard copy. Because he was proficient in multiple languages, so he basically didn\u2019t have to read the original work through a translator, and very rarely viewed e-books on his phone.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang took a closer look and was shocked when he glimpsed the words \u201cOverbearing Younger Brother Fell in Love with Me\u201d at the top of the screen\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Fan, you\u2026you\u2019re actually looking at this again\u2026You listen to my advice ah, these type of novels, the more you read, the more likely it\u2019d affect your IQ.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan gave him a glare and turned to go elsewhere.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang quickly chased after him and said, \u201cGood Ah Fan, don\u2019t you believe it? I\u2019m really sincere. When your IQ drops, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re noisy. Don\u2019t bother me.\u201d The first time Qi Zhifan came into contact with this type of novel, he\u2019d expressed great interest and needed to do some research.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What should he do? Did Ah Fan take the wrong medicine today?</p><br/><p>The scandal had persisted until summer vacation and couldn\u2019t be stopped.</p><br/><p>Wei Han saw that Qi Zhifan seemed to not want to say anything at all and also took pleasure in it. He had an attitude of watching a joke, and Wei Han knew he couldn\u2019t be counted on. He believed that by the next semester, things should be better.</p><br/><p>In the next semester with Chu Chuanyao\u2019s arrival, everyone would have a new focus and this matter would truly pass.</p><br/><p>Today was first day to report to school. At the entrance of S Uni, Wei Han was welcoming the new students.</p><br/><p>Last night he had a sleepless night, so Wei Han had been waiting from early on. The time\u30fcone minute, one second\u30fcpassed. His heart became more and more worried: he\u2019d soon see Chu Chuanyao, his \u201cLittle Yao\u201d ah!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his cell phone rang and Wei Han connected: \u201cHey mom, why did you call?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, you\u2026quickly come! Fan-fan, he\u2026he was hit by a car!\u201d Mother Wei said anxiously, almost crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Which hospital is he in? I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Mother Wei informed him of the hospital address, and Wei Han hurriedly took a car and went straight to the destination. After getting in the car, he looked back at the school gate. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t see Chu Chuanyao today, but he\u2019d been waiting for so long, waiting for another day was nothing\u2026</p><br/><p>At the hospital when Wei Han arrived, he saw that the operating room light was still on and the anxiety in his heart suddenly intensified.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, Qi Zhifan, he\u2026\u201d Dad Qi calmly leaned against the wall, and Wei Han directly went in front of Mother Wei. His question had not finished yet, when Mother Wei\u2019s tears flowed down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Her voice also shaking: \u201cHan-han, Fan-fan, he\u2026his head here\u2026had a lot of blood, right now he\u2019s\u2026being saved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heart \u201c<em>ba-dump</em>\u201d a sound. Although his face was also white, he still patted Mother Wei\u2019s back and whispered, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry, I believe Qi Zhifan will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s because he saved me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was the sound of a low voice by his side. Wei Han\u2019s heart knocked with a \u2018<em>thump</em>\u2018. This big boy still had the same appearance and voice from his memories.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

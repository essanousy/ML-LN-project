Who\u2019s defending him?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Sister Yao shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize him. It\u2019s a new lawyer surnamed Qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I already know of this matter. I thought that he\u2019s such a big official, but the one he requested wasn\u2019t a famous lawyer, but a newcomer. At that time, I was really happy! Fancy that I thought he\u2019d lose this time to the point of not being able to turn his body. But who\u2019d have thought, ai\u2026\u201d Little Yang sighed and also joined the gathering.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefending a sacked official isn\u2019t simple. The case is big and the energy invested is really great. I have read some people\u2019s comments and it\u2019s said that the rookie lawyer surnamed Qi did quite well,\u201d Sister Yao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, which side are you trying to help? We had a hard time arresting Zhao Yong. That also took a lot of effort, okay?\u201d Brother Zhang ground his teeth and hatefully said.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Sister Yao nudged up her glasses and said nothing.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in the same office. The sound of their discussion certainly spread to Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui on this side.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui patted Wei Han\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cSilly Han, Brother Zhang and them, the rookie lawyer they\u2019re talking about wouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask, it must be.\u201d Sitting next to the two people, Shao Yi also came over and put his head together.</p><br/><p>Wei Han pursed his lips, took his cell phone and stood up. \u201cLittle Jiang, I\u2019m going outside to make a call. Help me watch it here for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guessing eighty percent that Wei Han wanted to give Qi Zhifan a call, Jiang Chengrui nodded. \u201cYeah. Silly Han, if you have something, don\u2019t stifle it in your heart. Just ask him clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although knowing that the rookie lawyer was surnamed Qi and should be Qi Zhifan, Wei Han still wanted to call and confirm. When the call was answered, Wei Han went straight to the topic and explained the situation briefly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d At that end, Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice was somewhat indifferent, but even more exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, why did you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was still a pile of work on hand. Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t listen any further and directly interrupted Wei Han, \u201cBefore sentencing, he\u2019s only a criminal suspect. Therefore, he also has the rights granted by law. When he is sentenced, then he\u2019s a criminal. It\u2019s also justice for me to defend the officials and to ensure that the legal rights conferred by the law are safeguarded. I think you should also know that this is my work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was suddenly somewhat unable to respond. They both came from S Uni\u2019s Law Department. Wei Han also roughly understood some of the work of lawyers.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s professional level and political quality were quite excellent, so the scope of practice was also very wide. There were companies and enterprises\u2019 investment financing, restructuring of assets and other businesses, but also property management, engineering reduction, and other fields. Of course, his focus was still on defending criminal cases, especially cases related to abuse of political power.</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, the case of corrupt officials were often more complex. On one side, there was the boiling public opinion, and on the other, there was the need to abide by professional ethics. It was easy for him to be put in an awkward situation. Once he took such a case, Qi Zhifan must eliminate all interference and strive to manage it well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you\u2019ve always hoped that I can understand your police work a little more. Now, I hope you can understand me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan once again interrupted Wei Han\u2019s words, a little irritated, \u201cWell, I\u2019m busy right now. If there\u2019s something, let\u2019s wait until we\u2019re home to discuss it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sighed and listlessly returned to the office.</p><br/><p>At lunchtime, seeing Wei Han\u2019s mood was very depressed, Shao Yi came over again and sat together with Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui.</p><br/><p>He wanted to tell a few jokes to tease Wei Han to feel better, but to no avail: they were all corny jokes and Wei Han almost had no reaction. Only Jiang Chengrui rather speechlessly \u201chehe\u201d two sounds.</p><br/><p>Knowing Wei Han\u2019s heart was tied up with Qi Zhifan, Shao Yi softly sighed, also giving birth to some feelings. \u201cAi, speaking of yours and Qi Zhifan\u2019s work\u2026tsk, it\u2019s also really complicated. One is a police officer and the other is a lawyer. It looks like both are for fairness and justice, but they can often be opposed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was silent, not uttering a word.</p><br/><p>What Shao Yi said was right. From the macro industry perspective, he and Qi Zhifan were legal workers, and the purpose of their work was to maintain the authority of the law and to achieve social fairness and justice.</p><br/><p>However, when it came to criminal cases, the police and lawyers were opposed in terms of work. He had to do everything possible to collect all kinds of evidence to prove that the suspect was guilty; and Qi Zhifan would rack his brains to prove that his client was not guilty or should receive a lighter sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cShao Yi, why do you insist on touching on the sore point? Will you die if you say two words less?\u201d Jiang Chengrui glared at him.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi curled his lips. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>As soon as he got off work, Wei Han received a call from Mother Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, do you want to go on a blind date?\u201d</p><br/><p>This first sentence scared Wei Han a lot. He wiped his sweat. \u201cUh, mom, you\u2019re being too anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan-han, I remember that around this time last year, you were heartbroken, and then you\u2019d shaven yourself bald. Now after so long, your hair has also grown out and looks black and shiny. You\u2019re also a lot handsomer so why don\u2019t you think about finding another girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a mess! Mom, don\u2019t mention that year\u2019s \u201cbald head\u201d and we can still be good mother and son.</p><br/><p>From that time last year to now, Wei Han had realized that he only liked their family\u2019s Trouble, just this one man. His mood\u2019s ups and downs were also because of him being hot and cold, ai.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to work hard now. Mom, you don\u2019t have to worry so much,\u201d Wei Han stressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh.\u201d Mother Wei was obviously a little bit at a loss. \u201cFan-fan is going on a blind date this afternoon. I\u2019m also feeling anxious for you as the older brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han\u2019s face changed greatly. \u201cWhat?! Mom, say that again. Qi Zhifan, he\u2026he\u2019s going to do what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA blind date. I heard that it\u2019s also a boss\u2019s daughter who just returned from France. This girl is a mixed and looks very pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Afterwards, whatever Mother Wei said, Wei Han didn\u2019t hear at all. He just nodded perfunctorily and soon hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019d called Qi Zhifan before, he\u2019d said that he was very busy. How could he have time to go on a blind date in the afternoon? Clearly, he was deceiving him.</p><br/><p>When it was time to get off work, Jiang Chengrui said farewell to Wei Han and hurriedly left.</p><br/><p>Recently, because his sister Jiang Chenghui had been busy with work, working overtime all day and working hard, her body was always uncomfortable. And his little brother, Little Yi, was also busy with exams this week. He\u2019d discussed it with Pei Yuyang and decided to go home to take care of his family\u2019s sister and brother.</p><br/><p>After a while, everyone was almost all gone. Shao Yi saw that Wei Han was still in a daze, and finding it strange, he said, \u201cWei Han, I remember that you\u2019re not on duty tonight. Why don\u2019t you go back home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wei Han wanted to say something but hesitated, then suddenly, he wryly smiled. \u201cShao Yi, can you come drink with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi\u2019s eyes lighted up. \u201cOK, of course I\u2019m happy to keep you company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Past 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, at a bar on the Southeast Road.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was already a little drunk. He shook his head, and his mouth disjointedly mumbled a lot of words, \u201cShao Yi, you\u2026you don\u2019t know, at first\u2026I and Qi Zhifan\u2026I and him ah, looked at each other\u2026not\u2026not very agreeably, but later\u2026also don\u2019t know how, just so\u2026love each other so much, heheh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yi listened and inexplicably, was somewhat sad. \u201cThen since you\u2019re living with him now, you should be happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han immediately nodded and laughed foolishly. \u201cHap\u2026happy, but sometimes\u2026happiness\u2026happiness makes me want to numb myself, and not dare\u2026not dare to think about our future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>After grabbing Wei Han\u2019s glass, Shao Yi tried to reach out to pat Wei Han\u2019s back, but was suddenly cut off by a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind them, Qi Zhifan gnashed his teeth and yelled, his eyes extremely fierce.</p><br/><p>What time was it? Wei Han still hadn\u2019t returned home, so Qi Zhifan had called him and his phone was actually turned off! When he\u2019d momentarily been unable to find him, Qi Zhifan had thought that this fool was leaving home.</p><br/><p>After searching the streets near the police station for half a day, he\u2019d quickly become anxious to death, even having the urge to call the police. He hadn\u2019t expected that Wei Han was leisurely drinking with Shao Yi!</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan pulled his tie and, face filled with anger, walked over and suddenly picked up Wei Han. \u201cFuck! Didn\u2019t I tell you to quit drinking? How dare you still drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Wei Han drunkenly hiccuped. His head was reeling, his feet were also somewhat unsteady, and his body swayed.</p><br/><p>Shao Yi to his side couldn\u2019t stand seeing this. \u201cQi Zhifan, stop. Don\u2019t be so fierce to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m managing my wife. It\u2019s none of your business, you outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan sneered and continued to stare at Wei Han. He patted the burning hot face twice with his hand, trying to sober him up a bit.</p><br/><p>The slight sting indeed stimulated Wei Han a little. He opened his eyes and saw that the man in front of him was Qi Zhifan. He immediately punched Qi Zhifan\u2019s chest ruthlessly. \u201cOdd Trouble, you lied to me. This afternoon\u2026why did you go\u2026go on a blind date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d This statement surprised both Qi Zhifan and Shao Yi. It turned out that Wei Han was hiding this grievance in his heart.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was startled for a moment and then held Wei Han\u2019s clenched fist. \u201cThat was arranged by my grandfather. There\u2019s nothing I could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han decisively took out his hand and smiled disapprovingly, \u201cHeh, before you\u2026didn\u2019t you say that your grandfather was abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan heard this and was shocked. He didn\u2019t explaining more. \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss. Come home with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I hate liars!\u201d Wei Han shouted, turning and pulling Shao Yi. \u201cShao Yi, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll go be a guest at your house tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han! If you dare go, believe it or not, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Qi Zhifan to finish, Shao Yi supported the stumbling Wei Han and left.</p><br/><p>The next day in Shao Yi\u2019s rented apartment.</p><br/><p>Wei Han woke up with a hangover. He recalled what happened last night at the bar and immediately turned pale with fright, the whole person suddenly becoming incomparably sober.</p><br/><p>They said that wine makes people daring. He thought that it\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d used that kind of attitude and tone of voice to talk with Qi Zhifan; they had such a large dispute last night; and he also went back home with Shao Yi in a fit of pique, so Qi Zhifan must have already blown his top off ah!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>After scratching his head, Wei Han found his mobile phone and discovered that Qi Zhifan hadn\u2019t even called him after he\u2019d gone with Shao Yi last night. There wasn\u2019t even a single text message.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was both disappointed and angry. It turned out that Qi Zhifan hadn\u2019t cared that much about him, and didn\u2019t even feel like explaining the misunderstanding?</p><br/><p>Waiting for a day, Qi Zhifan still hadn\u2019t taken the initiative to contact him. Several times, he\u2019d wanted to call to ask clearly, but each time, he\u2019d endured and held back. Maybe they both needed time to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, why don\u2019t you come back with me and stay at my house for the time being?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui said. He saw that Wei Han had a falling out with Qi Zhifan, and definitely wouldn\u2019t go back to Qi Zhifan\u2019s villa. He also didn\u2019t dare to return to the home in the district for fear that Uncle Qi and Mother Wei would worry. Temporarily a little \u201chomeless\u201d, it was quite pitiful.</p><br/><p>Wei Han waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. Besides, doesn\u2019t your sister not welcome outsiders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Jiang Chengrui scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019ll try to plead with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better to forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, why don\u2019t you stay with me. You\u2019ve already slept one night anyway,\u201d Shao Yi said while smiling ingratiatingly.</p><br/><p>Wei Han gave two hollow laughs, \u201cHehe, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Wei Han still stayed outside in a hotel. The \u201ccold war\u201d between him and Qi Zhifan erupted.</p><br/><p>The two people had kept up the \u201ccold war\u201d for three days. On the fourth day, because Wei Han was always perturbed, he\u2019d charged his mobile phone in the bureau today and forgotten to unplug it and left. Jiang Chengrui happened to discover this by chance.</p><br/><p>This day, Jiang Chengrui had promised Pei Yuyang that he\u2019d go back and stay with him for one night. When Pei Yuyang drove in to pick up Jiang Chengrui, he saw Wei Han\u2019s fallen phone, and immediately, his playful heart jumped up. \u201cCurlie, this is a magical object ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What idea are you playing at again?\u201d Looking at the mischievous smile on his face, Jiang Chengrui could see that he was up to something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush to give it back to Wei Han. We can use it to tease Ah Fan first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui heard this and rolled his eyes, but also smiled and nodded. \u201cYeah, we must reconcile them as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>At 8 o\u2019clock in the evening, Qi Zhifan was still working.</p><br/><p>In recent days, Wei Han wasn\u2019t home. It didn\u2019t make any sense for him to return to an empty house. He\u2019d be better off working overtime here.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his mobile phone vibrated. Irritated, Qi Zhifan glanced at it in a bad mood, only to have his pupils dilate in an instant.</p><br/><p>What appeared on the phone\u2019s screen was actually \u201cStomach Cold\u201d? Wasn\u2019t this his family\u2019s brain-dead fool of a wife!</p><br/><p>With a <i>bang</i>, Qi Zhifan\u2019s trembling hand accidentally overturned the teacup, but at this moment, he couldn\u2019t attend to anything else. Qi Zhifan clenched his phone and for the first time, felt that his phone had become very heavy. Separated for so many days, what would Wei Han say to him?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan somewhat nervously swiped it open to see\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u3010Trouble, I miss you\u3011</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rolled and he stared blankly for a long time. Then, he immediately put on his coat and threw working overtime and everything to the back of his mind, driving all the way back home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Qi?! Didn\u2019t you say you weren\u2019t coming back tonight?\u201d Butler Sun was a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t answer and searched everywhere in his house, both inside and outside, but he didn\u2019t even find a shadow of Wei Han. All of a sudden, the ignited fire of hope was extinguished, and the sense of loss was even heavier.</p><br/><p>Fancy that he\u2019d still thought Wei Han finally couldn\u2019t bear the loneliness, knew that he was good and also had thoroughly figured it out, and was obediently waiting for him at home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Qi, since you\u2019re back, then you should rest early.\u201d Butler Sun could also see his disappointment and immediately consoled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Pei Yuyang repeatedly shook his head at the message Jiang Chengrui had sent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlas, Curlie is still very pure ah! Facing Ah Fan, that kind of extreme pride and arrogance, sending this kind of message won\u2019t do. We still need to give another dose of fierce medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui patted himself, his entire body filled with goosebumps and frowned. \u201cI think that this is already very sappy ah. Then what do you want to send?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh, watch me.\u201d Pei Yuyang raised his eyebrows, a smile flowing from his peach blossom eyes.</p><br/><p>At night, Qi Zhifan was depressed and had already laid down to sleep. However, he was sleeping in Wei Han\u2019s room. Looking at the various kinds of Doraemon and lying in Wei Han\u2019s bed, he smelled his scent but was unable to hold Wei Han. It simply was hard for him to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the cell phone vibrated again, and it was sent by Wei Han\u30fc</p><br/><p>\u3010Hubby, I really want you\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan, as if struck by lightning, completely couldn\u2019t remain calm and collected!</p><br/><p>With a roll, he climbed out of bed. Qi Zhifan took several recipes that he\u2019d bought a long time ago and hurriedly went downstairs. He also had Butler Sun prepare a bunch of ingredients, then he rolled up his sleeves and <em>bang bang bang</em> started cutting up the vegetables in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Butler Sun glanced at the clock on the wall: 11PM.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Qi, it\u2019s better to let me do it,\u201d Butler Sun wryly smiled and said. Where would their family\u2019s young master learn to cook? After all, did he receive some stimulation in the middle of the night?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I can do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan earnestly said. He\u2019d long thought that his first cooking must be specially made for Wei Han.</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

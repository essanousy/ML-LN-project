Wei Han softly murmured and was ready to lean in to kiss. Unexpectedly, Qi Zhifan abruptly opened his eyes, and also suddenly seized Wei Han\u2019s hand, flipping him over and pressing Wei Han down under his body.</p><br/><p>In a matter of seconds, the two sides reversed their position. Wei Han was in a bit of a daze. He stared blankly at Qi Zhifan and found that in his eyes, dangerous and dark tips of hidden, restless desire were constantly flitting through.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, you\u30fc\u201d</p><br/><p>Baffled, Wei Han\u2019s lips twitched twice. Before he had time to speak, Qi Zhifan mercilessly sealed his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>Uh nn</em>\u2026\u201d a sound of dejected protest immediately escaped from Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Prying open Wei Han\u2019s lips, Qi Zhifan\u2019s long tongue explored the hot and humid inside of his mouth. In Wei Han\u2019s mouth, there was a sweet taste that exclusively belonged to him. Immersed in the midst of this wonder, Qi Zhifan unknowingly slowed down the rhythm, using the tip of his tongue to take liberties with Wei Han\u2019s trembling tongue.</p><br/><p>The two people fitted closely together and their tongues were intimately entwined for a good while before Qi Zhifan let Wei Han go.</p><br/><p>At this time, Wei Han was like a fish just out of the water, his mouth open and gasping. His semi-swollen lips were still moist with bodily fluids and he peered at Qi Zhifan with his hazy, little eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan saw this rare docile and lovable appearance, and his lower abdomen tightened. He moved in and kissed once again.</p><br/><p>This time, the kiss went deeper, the tip of his tongue directly and gently caressing and stroking the deep part of Wei Han\u2019s tongue. While sucking and kissing hard, Qi Zhifan\u2019s palm slowly moved down, sliding down over Wei Han\u2019s flat stomach, taking off Wei Han\u2019s pants and squeezing his ass.</p><br/><p>Why was the mood\u2026a little bit wrong?</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s face reddened a lot. He twisted his body and subconsciously moved back, wanting to break free. Qi Zhifan actually increased his strength and firmly suppressed him.</p><br/><p>The temperature in the room was getting higher and higher. Qi Zhifan\u2019s forehead was already glistening with a thin layer of hot sweat. He parted Wei Han\u2019s legs and with his fiery heat below, pressed up, unable to resist rubbing lightly.</p><br/><p>Wait\u2026wait a minute! This rhythm was obviously wrong ah!</p><br/><p>Wei Han stared with rounded eyes, the two feet repeatedly kicking, but they weren\u2019t able to budge Qi Zhifan\u2019s body in the slightest. Wei Han simply wanted to cry ah: his brother was too capable of pressing people down!</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, behave yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s voice was a bit hoarse, his fingers lingering on Wei Han\u2019s rear. Enduring for too long, he was already at his limit.</p><br/><p>Burst after burst on his neck, Qi Zhifan\u2019s hot breaths made Wei Han shudder. \u201cOdd\u2026Odd Trouble, wait\u2026wait a minute, I\u2026I\u2019m the top\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Voice not yet fallen, there was a sudden sense of discomfort inside his body. Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but knit his brows and groan. This time, it was already too late\u2026</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes were closed, still deeply asleep. Wei Han had already woken up, and he cautiously crept down out of bed.</p><br/><p>Oh god, as soon as he moved, Wei Han felt like his whole body was falling apart, especially his waist, simply almost tossed to breaking.</p><br/><p>As soon as he stood up, a hot and thick, shameful liquid flowed out between his thighs. Wei Han blushed and immediately rushed into the bathroom to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Hurriedly putting on his clothes, Wei Han was too embarrassed to look at Qi Zhifan. While he hadn\u2019t awoken yet, Wei Han, with tail between his legs, fled without delay.</p><br/><p>His legs still trembled slightly while walking, so Wei Han was forced to hail a taxi and slipped back to his apartment.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Last night, Jiang Chengrui had followed Sergeant Lu to carry out the assignment. At this moment, it\u2019s estimated that he was still handling things at the bureau so hadn\u2019t returned yet.</p><br/><p>Wei Han opened his phone and countless missed calls and unread messages quickly popped up, almost all of them from Little Jiang and Leader Lu. Wei Han felt a burst of scalp numbness. Panicking in his heart, he temporarily didn\u2019t dare to reply. Last night, he also knew that he was wrong, momentarily forgetting loyalty when chasing love. But as a result, he ended up losing his own chrysanthemum.</p><br/><p>In the dating forum, there were also a private message sent by Six Hot last night.</p><br/><p>Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot Hot\u3010Stomach Hot, according to what I say, soon after, you\u2019ll be able to grow out your hair, counterattack your little brother, but also enact \u2018hero saves the beauty\u2019. Then, you\u2019d be overpowered underneath by your little brother, and pleasured almost to death!\u3011</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Your mom! Six Hot was definitely the most yellow, cruel, and vulgar prophecy emperor.</p><br/><p>But this sentence couldn\u2019t help but make Wei Han recall those experiences last night. His legs sandwiching Qi Zhifan\u2019s waist and his body swinging in and out with Qi Zhifan. The entire night, over and over, was this uninterrupted shaking and colliding, violent motion. It had been too intense, making his whole body slide back and forth on the bed sheets.</p><br/><p>Oh god, really the more he thought, the more ashamed he was. Wei Han shook his head. Last night, the mouth that had unceasingly cried out was definitely not his!</p><br/><p>Obviously, what he\u2019d always wanted to see before\u2026was Qi Zhifan having such an expression. He looked so \u201cbeautiful\u201d that thinking about it was exciting. And if Wei Han could overpower him, he\u2019d also feel a sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>When Wei Han was depressed by all of these kinds of confusion, his eyes carelessly swept across Jiang Chengrui\u2019s \u201cmurder weapons\u201d placed by the bedside\u30fca fruit knife, clothesline, and a box of cold medicine.</p><br/><p>Wei Han still remembered that soon after moving to this apartment, one day, Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t return overnight. The next day, Jiang Chengrui came back home, supporting his waist and panting with rage. Wei Han was silly. Seeing his strange walking posture, he understood in an instant. Apparently, he and Pei Yuyang had already\u2026</p><br/><p>The furious Jiang Chengrui immediately prepared three kinds of \u201cmurder weapon\u201d and wondered when Pei Yuyang would appear again. He could use the fruit knife to stab the perverted person to death. He could also use the clothesline to strangle him, and even more, he could force him to keep taking the medicine. Every medicine had its side effects and definitely could poison him to death.</p><br/><p>As a result, when Pei Yuyang came, smiling ingratiatingly, he casually coaxed Jiang Chengrui with a few words, and coaxed Jiang Chengrui till his face turned red with anger. With the ambiguous atmosphere at that time, Wei Han thought that if he hadn\u2019t been nearby, they must have<i> pa pa pa </i>on the spot.</p><br/><p>Somehow, Wei Han suddenly became interested and went over. He directly ignored the box of cold medicine, shook his head at the thin clothesline, and instead, picked up the fruit knife.</p><br/><p>Wei Han wanted to see: was this knife sharp? He slashed the table, but there was no reaction. Unexpectedly, it couldn\u2019t even cut open paper. He was instantly dumbfounded: dang, he\u2019d never seen such a blunt knife ah, absolutely without any sharpness. Little Jiang really loves that Foolish Man-Sheep ah!</p><br/><p>That little knife was basically useless and certainly couldn\u2019t scratch the skin. Thinking so, Wei Han tried it on his wrist\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, put the knife down!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Qi Zhifan rushed in the next moment, he happened to see Wei Han holding a knife and \u201ccutting his wrist\u201d.</p><br/><p>Immediately throwing away the knife in Wei Han\u2019s hand, Qi Zhifan suddenly clung to Wei Han, anxious and angry: \u201cYou fool, I just accidentally slept with you. Do you need to threaten me with your death?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Blinking his eyes, Wei Han roused his spirit and patted Qi Zhifan, wanting to throw him off. \u201cOdd Trouble\u2026I didn\u2019t ah. You\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t care about Wei Han\u2019s struggles and continued to hold him tightly. \u201cThere\u2019s also a rope to hang yourself over there, and sleeping pills? Wei Han, how old are you? You\u2019ve lived for so long and yet your IQ hasn\u2019t grown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Uh, Odd Trouble, you\u2019re really overthinking it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, there was a sudden movement behind him. Wei Han saw that even Pei Yuyang had suddenly come in.</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dang, how did each and everyone of you come in? Did you secretly make a spare copy of our house key?</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang said with a face full of smiles, \u201c<i>Sorry</i>, I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. I\u2019ll pack some things. Don\u2019t mind me. You can continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026wait a minute, Pei Yuyang, what are you packing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, it\u2019s Curlie\u2019s clothes, nothing more. Haha, I\u2019m really looking forward to Curlie living in my home soon. This way, my side will be surrounded by the adorable Curlie and Archie every day, simply ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han imagined Jiang Chengrui with his off-the-charts martial prowess with that big black pig. If one man and one pig cohabited with this perverted shaking M in one room, uh, that picture was a little too beautiful.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han shook his head again. \u201cNo, how could Little Jiang agree with you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must immediately go with Ah Fan, so I can\u2019t let Curlie live alone here. Otherwise, he\u2019d absolutely be so lonely and cold all by his lonesome self. When I think of this, I just grieve and lament. I simply can\u2019t swallow when I eat and get uneasy when I lie down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s entire body was suddenly covered in goosebumps, dumbfounded said, \u201cHey hey, who said I want to go with him? I have no plans to move out for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already called and told dad and aunt that we\u2019re both living together. They were very happy, so they\u2019re going to come over to my place and have dinner with us tonight,\u201d Qi Zhifan spoke up at this time.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silly when he heard. \u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long since they\u2019ve tasted your craft. I\u2019ve already had Butler Sun buy the ingredients, and it\u2019s just waiting for you to go back. Just pack your things and come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han knitted his brows. \u201cOdd Trouble, you\u2026you\u2019re clearly \u2018acting first and reporting later\u2019. You\u2019d definitely eat me, so are you sure I\u2019d go over? What if I won\u2019t agree no matter what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan raised his chin and confidently said, \u201cNo \u2018what if\u2019s. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m going to eat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han\u2019s ears were a bit red. How did he suddenly find Odd Trouble\u2019s face had become thicker?</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, I will take responsibility for you. Come back with me.\u201d Qi Zhifan looked at Wei Han earnestly, the corners of his mouth hooking up in a wisp of a shallow smile.</p><br/><p>This slight smile of the \u201cGreat Beauty Qi\u201d was indeed a smile that caused Wei Han to lose his three immortal souls and fall into human desires. Not knowing what demons and gods were at work, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Forget it, who let him, as if charmed by the devil, to so like this guy.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><br/><p><i>pa pa pa</i>: in threes, generally stands for the sound of having sex, but I\u2019m not sure if they were going to have sex, Jiang Chengrui was going to beat up Pei Yuyang, or both.</p><br/><p><b>T/N: </b>I\u2019ll be erring on the safe side with the advisories.

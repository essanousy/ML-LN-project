Wu Yunqi was a bit disappointed and pouted, \u201cClimbs like a snail. What\u2019s so scary about it? I really don\u2019t understand why they screamed before.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening to this tone, Wei Han guessed that the little cousin was riding this for the first time and couldn\u2019t help but sigh, glancing at her rather sympathetically. \u201cIn a moment, you\u2019ll also want to cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the rollercoaster reached the highest point, and then suddenly rushed downwards. Wei Han suddenly felt his butt left the seat, the whole body flew up, and seemed like it could fall at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah! Ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Wu Yunqi\u2019s heart-tearing and lung-splitting shouts reached Wei Han\u2019s ears. The poor little loli was so scared that even tears flew out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han listened to this especially suffering sound, and reached out his big hand to hold Wu Yunqi\u2019s small hand, wanting to try and comfort her. But who knew, Wu Yunqi immediately pulled it out and instead, slapped down on Wei Han\u2019s thigh and suddenly pinched.</p><br/><p>Fuck! Wei Han almost shouted out.</p><br/><p>Then, the rollercoaster rode at lightning speed, now climbing, now diving, and repeatedly tossed up and down. Wu Yunqi\u2019s small heart also followed to rise and fall, shrieking each time and then inevitably, mercilessly pinched Wei Han\u2019s thigh.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, brows tightly furrowed, Wei Han carried down Wu Yunqi, whose hands and feet had gone soft. He reckoned that there were several places on his thigh which were pinched black and blue by her.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi had a slackened expression, but once she saw Qi Zhifan, her spirit returned. She immediately jumped down from Wei Han\u2019s body and smilingly stuck to him.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan saw that the two people\u2019s complexions were not very good, and didn\u2019t say anything, only laughing in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan, next, let\u2019s go to the haunted house to play. This time, you must go with me,\u201d The not fearing death Wu Yunqi said. Hearing this, Wei Han and Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help but stare blankly.</p><br/><p>Wei Han looked at Qi Zhifan. He smiled and felt some schadenfreude. He didn\u2019t care himself, but wasn\u2019t Odd Trouble afraid of ghosts? Haha.</p><br/><p>The haunted house was a major feature of the amusement park. It was divided into five areas of terror, each region having a different supernatural theme. The sound effects and spooky atmosphere were created quite well. From the entrance, there were many crooked, narrow paths. Because people could choose different paths, so the original line of people would also disperse.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Qi Zhifan took Wu Yunqi, and the three were always together. The path that they took was full of Japanese traditional lattice windows on both sides. Apart from the dead branches and spider webs, a bloody hand also suddenly burst out of the window, scaring Wu Yunqi, who\u2019d been tightly clinging to Qi Zhifan since the beginning.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who was walking up front, had no reaction at all. He looked back at Qi Zhifan, but also couldn\u2019t make out his expression in the dark, dim light.</p><br/><p>After walking for a while, Wu Yunqi suddenly stepped on a raised spot and activated a switch. From the coffin next to her, a female ghost in white immediately popped up. The female ghost issued a mournful wail, but also slowly climbed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Wu Yunqi was instantly scared and cried. The female ghost unexpectedly still chased them.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han picked up the crying Wu Yunqi, and seeing Qi Zhifan also frozen, simply took his hand and ran forward.</p><br/><p>Wei Han knew that once they passed this section of the path, the one behind them who was disguised as a ghost to scare people, would also stop chasing.</p><br/><p>His own cold hands suddenly held by Wei Han, Qi Zhifan was really shocked.</p><br/><p>Clearly it was just a simple holding hands action, but the already vague memory of this kind of rush of excitement suddenly came back.</p><br/><p>Later, the trio went to another horror zone, \u201cMidnight Bell\u201d<sup> [1]</sup>. Because Wu Yunqi was scared to death, from beginning to end, she encircled Wei Han\u2019s neck and feebly refused to come down.</p><br/><p>Midway though, the unlucky Wei Han happened to have a scary prop dropped on top of his head, and the frightened Wu Yunqi burst out crying and screaming again.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Moreover, this \u201clittle princess\u201d, not knowing if it was intentional or not, but when she got stirred up, she would forcibly pull on Wei Han\u2019s cheek. Cheek pulled several times, Wei Han felt that his face would soon be torn by her.</p><br/><p>Hey hey, don\u2019t bully an honest person like this ah!</p><br/><p>The day of suffering finally passed. Wei Han\u2019s countless streams of sorrows had turned into a river, feeling tired and unloved.</p><br/><p>On Sunday, Wei Han woke up and found that his waist was hurting again. Ai, it definitely must not have completely healed before, and these few days of strain were also added on. When he looked in the mirror, it was even more tragic: his face was swollen too.</p><br/><p>This day, Wu Yunqi unexpectedly calmed down a lot. The swollen-faced Wei Han continued to be responsible for cooking. After Qi Zhifan taught Wu Yunqi and finished the calligraphy exercises, he began to perform magic tricks for her.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan first made his little cousin\u2019s favorite y appear, and then chocolates, and then he turned out a folded paper flower, extremely romantic. Wu Yunqi, as his enthusiastic fan, kept clapping and cheering.</p><br/><p>Wei Han rubbed his swollen face on the side, and could only admire and envy. He couldn\u2019t help but think of the book on love he\u2019d bought last time. According to what was written, Qi Zhifan\u2019s pickup girl skills were already completely full ah!</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Qi Zhifan was going to go attend a concert. Of course, Wu Yunqi eagerly followed along, and Wei Han, this male nanny, was also forcibly dragged to accompany them.</p><br/><p>As a result, the master\u2019s performance had only just begun when on Qi Zhifan\u2019s right and left shoulders, each had a head resting on it. Listening to the \u201clullaby\u201d, Wei Han and Wu Yunqi listened too well and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan looked to his left shoulder at the crooked neck, soundly asleep Wei Han. His chubby face was slightly swollen, and his mouth was open wide. Inexplicably, Qi Zhifan found that his sleeping posture was even more childlike than Wu Yunqi\u2019s, silly cute.</p><br/><p>The concert finished, and Wei Han and Wu Yunqi were awakened by the other people\u2019s applause, and hastily clapped along.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, quickly wipe the saliva on your mouth, disgusting to death,\u201d Wu Yunqi remind him with a dismissive look.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had just woken up and was startled. He was about to raise his hand to wipe it away when Qi Zhifan stepped forward and gently wiped it for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan, you\u2026\u201d Wu Yunqi was silly for a few seconds, and then her face changed, \u201cQuickly go wash your hand and disinfect it ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, Wu Yunqi acted spoiled again and made Qi Zhifan play the piano for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to hear?\u201d Qi Zhifan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever you like. As long as it\u2019s played by Brother Zhifan, I\u2019ll like it,\u201d Wu Yunqi giggled, voice sweet and soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Qi Zhifan nodded, but hooked his finger at Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han felt a little strange. \u201cQi Zhifan, are you calling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sit down and play with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Wu Yunqi received a fright again. Wei Han was also silly and thought he\u2019d heard wrong. \u201cDon\u2019t joke around! Except for \u2018Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u2019, I can\u2019t play anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen play this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Wu Yunqi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the evening, Wei Han stayed alone in his room.</p><br/><p>Using a hot towel to cover his face, his ears reverberated with the \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d tune, and his head was also filled with Qi Zhifan. Playing the piano with another man, it was the first time he\u2019d experienced this in his life.</p><br/><p>In this moment, Qi Zhifan knocked on the door and entered, holding a plaster in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLie down on the bed,\u201d Qi Zhifan ordered.</p><br/><p>Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous. \u201cWhat\u2026what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelping you rub your waist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speech finished, Qi Zhifan was too lazy to care about whether Wei Han was willing, and just grasped his wrist and forcibly dragged the person to the bedside, and then pressed him down on the bed.</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stupefied, blinking at Qi Zhifan with bewildered eyes. Because of his waist pain, he didn\u2019t put up too much resistance.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qi Zhifan lifted his top, and his fingers lingered around Wei Han\u2019s waist. The light in his pupils became a bit deeper. \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>His cold fingers made Wei Han slightly shiver, but then he thought it over again. It was rare that Qi Zhifan showed his filial piety, and as his big brother, it wouldn\u2019t be good to refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Wei Han turned his body and poked at where it hurt.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan touched it again and stuck the plaster on it. After sticking it on, his big hand remained on Wei Han\u2019s waist, lightly kneading, and somewhat not wanting to go.</p><br/><p>Without meaning to, his gaze shifted down and Qi Zhifan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple couldn\u2019t help moving, now staring at Wei Han\u2019s butt. The last time he\u2019d made Wei Han dance, he\u2019d found out that this butt looked superb, both big and perky. Feeling it would surely be comfortable.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan reached out to touch, but was suddenly interrupted by Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, do you have any medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other illness do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han sat up and touched his thigh. \u201cMy thighs are purple and blue. But I won\u2019t bother you this time. I can apply it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Wei Han also really wanted to let Qi Zhifan serve him, but he couldn\u2019t take off his pants and only face him in his underwear. In many cases, men also shouldn\u2019t have intimate contact. <b><sup> [2]</sup></b></p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you get it?\u201d Qi Zhifan knitted his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, I accidentally bumped myself,\u201d Wei Han casually said. He wasn\u2019t planning to complain in front of Qi Zhifan about Wu Yunqi\u2019s \u201cevil deeds\u201d.</p><br/><p>Who knew, Qi Zhifan saw through it with a glance. \u201cWas it Yunqi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han slightly froze, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Qi Zhifan also didn\u2019t continue to pursue and left.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qi Zhifan walked out of Wei Han\u2019s room, Wu Yunqi greeted him again and asked Qi Zhifan to help wash her hair. Of course, Qi Zhifan also agreed.</p><br/><p>After helping Wu Yunqi wash her hair and blow-dry it, Qi Zhifan also plaited her hair into pigtails.</p><br/><p>As a child, when Mother Qi was still there, Wu Yunqi often came to his home to play. Therefore, Qi Zhifan had always been very good at taking care of this little sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cYunqi, you should treat Wei Han a little better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silent for a long time, once Qi Zhifan opened his mouth, he went straight to the point. In these few days, Wu Yunqi\u2019s deliberate mischief, how could he not see them?</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi immediately pouted her small mouth and asked, \u201cBrother Zhifan, do you like that Wei Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was stunned. He thought that Wei Han was more pleasing to the eye, and also always wanted to tease him, touch him, and even wanted to\u2026fuck him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was right, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan tacitly agreed, Wu Yunqi was increasingly sad. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about him ah? He looks stupid and foolish. Isn\u2019t it just that his cooking is a little more delicious, his courage is a bit bigger, and also, he\u2019s very tolerant of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan raised his eyes and looked at her meaningfully.</p><br/><p>The look made her feel uncomfortable, and Wu Yunqi\u2019s face turned slightly red. Somewhat ashamed, she bowed her head. \u201cOkay, I promise, Brother Zhifan. I won\u2019t deliberately make things difficult for him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days flashed past. Before Wu Yunqi left, she specially went to find Wei Han.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wei Han, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not mincing her words at all, Wu Yunqi sloppily shouted it out.</p><br/><p>Wei Han blanked for a moment and then smiled. But in the next second, Wu Yunqi tiptoed up, pulled down Wei Han\u2019s ear and fiercely warned, \u201cWei Han, if you dare be bad to Brother Zhifan later on, you\u2019re toast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the meaning of this? A girl\u2019s mind was really complicated.</p><br/><p><b>Notes</b></p><ul><li><strong>1.

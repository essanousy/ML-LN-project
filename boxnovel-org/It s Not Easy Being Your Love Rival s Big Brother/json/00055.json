Little Cousin's Surprise Attack!</strong></p><br/><p>\u3010towh:</p><br/><p>sweet-stewed, shiny dessert, cat, T\u3011</p><br/><p>On top of the notebook, Qi Zhifan wrote a few strokes and recorded the things that had left the deepest impression between him and Wei Han.</p><br/><p>A bowl of sweet-stewed snow pear that they both had personally made for each other;</p><br/><p>Not turning his back on Wei Han, the piano expert Qi Zhifan played the shiny \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d song together with Wei Han;</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan knew that Wei Han loved desserts the most; he hoped that there would always be a Doraemon cat beside him, with a magical hundred treasures pouch that could help him realize his wishes;</p><br/><p>Due to a misunderstanding, Wei Han first made a stupid mistake and couldn\u2019t help but pull down Qi Zhifan\u2019s face, and then Qi Zhifan continued to keep the sexy pink, T-shaped thong. Over time, Qi Zhifan looked at it and thought of its owner everyday. Finally, one day, he personally helped Wei Han put it on\u2026</p><br/><p>These things, Wei Han understood them all. He used the notebook to record down many things, but Qi Zhifan deeply noted them in his heart instead. Closing the \u201cOdd Trouble Grievances Record\u201d, Wei Han went downstairs.</p><br/><p>In the kitchen on the first floor, Qi Zhifan was cooking for him. The rare times when Young Master Qi cooked, it was always for Wei Han. Who told Wei Han a few days ago to make himself feel uncomfortable because of Ou Yizhe, but also to foolishly suppress his grievances all in his heart.</p><br/><p>Wei Han hugged Qi Zhifan from behind. \u201cTrouble, how are you so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was a bit distracted and then the corner of his lips quirked up.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t know who was drunk the day before yesterday and continuously listed out his shortcomings and kept scolding him \u2018bastard\u2019? Even earlier, this fool always called him \u2018slag <i>gong\u2019</i> over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a good person.\u201d Qi Zhifan turned around and shook his head at Wei Han. \u201cYou used to scold me before, did you forget? In fact, everything you said was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Wei Han was foolish, and suddenly remembered that Qi Zhifan\u2019s memory was amazing and he could only force a laugh and say, \u201cGood Trouble, don\u2019t hold grudges.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan hooked his lips and smiled with an unknown meaning. He reached out and touched Wei Han\u2019s face. \u201cI want to remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Qi Zhifan also admitted that sometimes he was selfish and still considered money above all else. He never wasted time and energy on other insignificant people, but he wanted to set aside all his goodness for Wei Han.</p><br/><p>In the evening, the sky suddenly clouded over and it soon began to rain heavily.</p><br/><p>Across the bedroom at the French windows, Wei Han stared out of the window, an uneasiness rising up from the bottom of his heart, becoming heavier and heavier. The storm tonight seemed to herald something.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han suddenly with a worried frown, Qi Zhifan came to cling to his waist and also held his hand. \u201cPei Yuyang went to Jiang Chengrui\u2019s home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Wei Han jumped in fright. \u201cAh? Then now, he wouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan nodded. \u201cDo you know what Pei Yuyang told me? He said that his father had always known that he liked men, so he didn\u2019t count on him. He has lived for more than twenty years, and this was the first time he has liked someone so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wei Han was silent for a moment before slowly saying, \u201cThey will definitely pass through this difficult time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Qi Zhifan responded. His fingers laced between Wei Han\u2019s fingers, slowly interlocking their ten fingers. \u201cWei Han, in a few days, go with me to see grandpa.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s heart shuddered and he further tightened his hands around Qi Zhifan\u2019s. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, Jiang Chengrui didn\u2019t appear at the bureau. Wei Han vaguely guessed that something happened and gave him a call to ask. Sure enough, the problem came from his sister, Jiang Chenghui\u2019s body again. Last night, Jiang Chenghui vomited blood and was rushed to the hospital.</p><br/><p>After work, Wei Han hurried to the hospital to see Jiang Chengrui. Since Jiang Chenghui didn\u2019t want to see Jiang Chengrui at that time, he could only stay outside the ward. When Wei Han saw him, Jiang Chengrui was leaning against the wall and looking up at the ceiling with barely any focus in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Jiang, you and Pei Yuyang last night\u2026\u201d Wei Han didn\u2019t know how to start talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast night\u2026\u201d Jiang Chengrui said faintly and then slowly narrated it for Wei Han.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Pei Yuyang was downstairs from Jiang Chengrui\u2019s house, but Jiang Chenghui wouldn\u2019t allow him to come up no matter what they said. Pei Yuyang had knelt in the heavy rain and pleaded for Jiang Chenghui to hand over her brother. Seeing this, Jiang Chengrui also knelt down and Little Yi kept crying by the side. The five Chihuahuas in their family were restless and howled non-stop.</p><br/><p>Because the activity was too noisy, it also alarmed the neighbors upstairs and downstairs, and they came out to watch.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chenghui was so angry her face turned green. She pointed at her brother and sneered, \u201cHeh, do you remember? It was raining like this when you killed our parents. Now you want to anger me to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! But I really like him.\u201d Jiang Chengrui squeezed his palms and the head that had been hanging low before suddenly lifted up. \u201cSister, tell me: what\u2019s wrong with liking someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jiang Chenghui\u2019s words and thoughts were stifled, her body trembling with anger. In the next second, she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Then, as the people\u2019s faces changed greatly, they hurriedly sent her to the hospital that very night.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly Han, the doctor told me that if my sister\u2019s mood still continues to fluctuate like this, it will affect her physical condition and it\u2019s likely to become stomach cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han eyes instantly widened. \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui helplessly nodded. \u201cMy sister has abdominal pain from time to time now. She has no appetite, and if she\u2019s stimulated, she\u2019d vomit blood. Silly Han, I really don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Jiang Chengrui lose his former vitality even more, his eyes flowing with wisps of sorrow and his face filled with exhaustion, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but feel distressed.</p><br/><p>He was thinking of comforting him when Pei Yuyang came up from behind. \u201cCurlie, don\u2019t be afraid. There\u2019s still me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui looked up and found that he was followed by another man they hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui, in a daze: \u201cPei Yuyang, he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Pei Yuyang to speak, the man came forward two steps and smiled at Jiang Chengrui. \u201cLittle Rui, could it be that you don\u2019t remember me? I\u2019m your sister\u2019s college classmate, Pan Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Pan Xin?!\u201d Jiang Chengrui jumped in fright. \u201cYou\u2026didn\u2019t you go abroad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m back now. I want to go in and see Little Hui, can I?\u201d Pan Xin said, his worried eyes looking inside.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui stared blankly and then nodded. \u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Pan Xin knocked on the door and entered, Wei Han moved closer to Jiang Chengrui and quietly asked, \u201cHey, Little Jiang, this college classmate of your sister, he\u2026he wouldn\u2019t be your sister\u2019s ex-boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably should be.\u201d Jiang Chengrui pursed his lips. When his parents were still there, he was always having fun and didn\u2019t take too much interest in his sister Jiang Chenghui\u2019s matters. He only vaguely remembered that Pan Xin often went to cram school with his sister. Later, when he graduated and went abroad, Jiang Chenghui seemed to be sad for a while.</p><br/><p>Now that Pan Xin had reappeared, perhaps his sister\u2019s feelings would have a turning point. Then his and Pei Yuyang\u2019s matter maybe would also\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Pei Yuyang really had a way. Exactly how had he gotten him to come back?</p><br/><p>\u201cPei Yuyang, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuyang interrupted him. Tightly holding Jiang Chengrui\u2019s hands, he snuggled close to his cheek with a face smiling tenderly. \u201cCurlie, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this, Pan Xin came to see Jiang Chenghui almost everyday, and Pei Yuyang would also come, both of them meticulously taking care of Jiang Chenghui. The ice-cold Jiang Chenghui drove them out repeatedly, but it seemed to be useless. The next day, they would grin thick-skinned and run over. After all, this was a lasting psychological war.</p><br/><p>Over time, Jiang Chenghui was also too lazy to drive them out. She also understood her own physical condition and had to restrain her anger as much as possible, so she let them \u2018serve\u2019 her.</p><br/><p>On Sunday morning, Qi Zhifan went out to buy Wei Han\u2019s favorite egg-filling cake. And Wei Han, who was ruthlessly \u2018loved\u2019 last night, was lying softly in bed.</p><br/><p><i>thump thump thump</i>! Suddenly, a burst of eager footsteps sounded. Wei Han heard that it didn\u2019t belong to Qi Zhifan and was puzzling over it when a joyous cry came over, \u201cBrother Zhifan, Brother Zhifan~\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Fuck! Wei Han was suddenly scared and sat up. Wasn\u2019t this Wu Yunqi? Why did this little princess suddenly come over? Making a \u2018surprise attack\u2019 ah!</p><br/><p>So when Wu Yunqi excitedly ran up to the second floor, she ran through the rooms but didn\u2019t see Qi Zhifan. Instead, she saw Wei Han, who\u2019d just dressed but hadn\u2019t had the time to fold the quilt yet.</p><br/><p>The joy on her face suddenly disappeared without a trace. Pouting her little mouth, she said, \u201cWei Foxy Spirit, where\u2019s Brother Zhifan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han hurriedly grabbed his messy hair. \u201cOh, he went out. Maybe he\u2019d be back in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi looked disgusted. \u201cWei Foxy Spirit, the sun\u2019s already shining on your butt, how come you\u2019re still not up? You\u2019re really too lazy and should learn from the hard-working Brother Zhifan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He would get up so late, the main culprit was Qi Zhifan ah!</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi\u2019s eyes looked in again, looking up and down at the room where Wei Han was in. Finding that everything was Doraemon blue, she tightly knitted her brows. \u201cWei Foxy Spirit, this is your room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Wu Yunqi despised him even more. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that you\u2019re such a big man, but you\u2019re actually even more childish than me. If I was Brother Zhifan, I must be ashamed to have such a big brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>cough cough</i>\u2026\u201d Wei Han dryly coughed twice, raising his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this childish room was decorated by your dear Brother Zhifan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi stared blankly for three seconds and then her eyes immediately lighted up. \u201cMy Brother Zhifan really has a \u2018childish heart that hasn\u2019t vanish\u2019, so cute ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Qi Zhifan came back. When he saw his little cousin Wu Yunqi, he was also surprised. \u201cYunqi, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi\u2019s face burst into a sweet smile. \u201cHehe, I haven\u2019t seen Brother Zhifan for a long time and I miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan touched her head with his hand and shot a glance out of the corner of his eye at Wei Han on the side. He found that Wei Han didn\u2019t care too much, instead happily munching on the egg-filling cake that he\u2019d just bought back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mom has already agreed to let me come here and stay for a night.\u201d Wu Yunqi smiled happily. At the end, she specially stressed a sentence, \u201d So Brother Zhifan, you will sleep with me tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan was startled for a moment and originally wanted to refuse. In the end, Wei Han immediately received the words and continuously nodded, \u201cGood, good, good, your Brother Zhifan is certainly willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Qi Zhifan accompanied his little cousin tonight, then he could escape his evil clutches and let his poor chrysanthemum avoid the ravage.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wei Han had this kind of attitude, Qi Zhifan was a little displeased. If he accompanied others to sleep, Wei Han this guy wouldn\u2019t be jealous?</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, Wei Han, this Wei fool wouldn\u2019t be jealous of a little girl, but he still cared a bit in his heart. At night, unlike as usual, Wei Han was lying alone in a big, empty bed. Without Qi Zhifan\u2019s hot body fitting snugly against him, he was a bit unaccustomed to it.</p><br/><p>When he got up to go to the bathroom, he passed by Qi Zhifan\u2019s room and found that Qi Zhifan and Wu Yunqi were still awake and could vaguely hear their voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan, do you still like Wei Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan didn\u2019t speak, agreeing by default.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d The little cousin pouted her mouth sadly. \u201cThen do you like me better or him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are two kinds of like and can\u2019t be confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t care! You have to answer me. If you don\u2019t choose one, I will suffer from insomnia and can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han,\u201d Qi Zhifan said without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Wu Yunqi: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Do you have to answer so quickly ah? Seeing Qi Zhifan had this kind of reaction, she immediately felt that she didn\u2019t even have a wee bit of a chance left.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, as soon as he heard his name, Wei Han\u2019s face flushed red, a bit embarrassed, but there was a taste of sweetness in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zhifan, grandpa has always loved you so much. You know\u2026you know he\u2019d be furious if he knows. Then Wei Han and grandpa: who are you going to choose?\u201d</p><hr/><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

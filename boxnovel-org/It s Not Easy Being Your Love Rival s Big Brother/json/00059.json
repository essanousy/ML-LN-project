In the car, Wei Han and Zhao Xi were sitting in the backseat.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xi was a bit nervous, putting her hands on her knees and sitting upright. There\u2019s nothing to be done: she was a newcomer and had officially entered the police for less than a year. But Wei Han seemed to be very optimistic about her and always took her to carry out some tasks.</p><br/><p>In contrast, now that there was no Sergeant Lu staring at him from the side, Wei Han was a lot more casually lazy. He cocked his legs, and held his chin with one hand while looking at the scenery outside the car window.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Wei Han\u2019s eyes relaxed completely. Zhao Xi from the side glanced at him and also didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>The world was impermanent. Many things could happen over two years, especially in their police force. Lu Pengda, Sergeant Lu, was seriously injured and became a vegetative person. He was still lying in the hospital.</p><br/><p>Also as a police officer, Qi Hao had gone out on a task. Unfortunately, his leg was ruined and now he walked with a limp. The whole family was upset for a while. Afterwards, Mother Wei cheered herself up and no longer helped at her friend\u2019s work. She became interested in flowers and opened up her own flower shop.</p><br/><p>Of course, in addition to these unhappy things, there were certainly good things happening around Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chengrui repeatedly made meritorious deeds, and he was promoted, his salary also increasing. He was transferred to the adjacent Z City Criminal Police Brigade, where he broke several large cases. His impatient \u2018wife\u2019 Pei Yuyang also eagerly scampered after him. Relying on the Pei family\u2019s backing and his own efforts, he was now the general manager of a local jewelry company.</p><br/><p>Chu Chuanyao dated with his university classmate for two years. Although they weren\u2019t always together in the period in between, but they still had a good ending. They\u2019d just gone to register their marriage last month. Wei Han estimated that the couple were on their honeymoon in Paris.</p><br/><p>Leng Yan said that he\u2019d found his childhood savior and ran to zoo twice every three days.</p><br/><p>Soon, Wei Han arrived at the city detention center. The high walls of the detention center, the towering surveillance towers, and the gates with heavily-armed guards were a solemn spectacle.</p><br/><p>Wei Han took Zhao Xi into the interrogation room. Then, a fierce, bald-headed man was brought into the interrogation room by a prison guard and sat down in a dedicated chair.</p><br/><p>This man on death row was Huang Chengming. Previously, he\u2019d tried to shoot Wei Han in the process of resisting arrest. Fortunately, at the critical juncture, the bullet got jammed and he was arrested. At the time of the preliminary trial, Huang Chengming had refused to answer any questions, and refused to confess to the extent that the average interrogator was driven to their wits\u2019 end.</p><br/><p>At this moment, facing Wei Han who he\u2019d only seen three days ago, Huang Chengming\u2019s indifferent expression and attitude seemed indistinguishable from before. He simply wanted to ignore everyone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xi slightly knitted her brows. Seeing Huang Chengming\u2019s eyes lifted up, his gaze fixed on a certain aimless place, it seemed as though his thoughts had floated out of this 10-square meter interrogation room.</p><br/><p>Having long anticipated that he would have such an attitude, Wei Han calmly asked, \u201cHuang Chengming, I gave you three days to consider. Have you thought it through?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Huang Chengming, keeping with the previous routine, blindly chose silence.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had a slightly provocative smile. \u201cAt that time, our two guns were pointed at each other\u2019s heads, and you weren\u2019t afraid. But how have you become like a coward at this moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Chengming took back his gaze and looked straight into Wei Han\u2019s eyes, tone still calm: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, it\u2019s superfluous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201cSuperfluous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Chengming pulled a hint of a sneer and leisurely said, \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t escape death whether I say anything or not. There\u2019s no difference between dying once and dying ten times. But if I don\u2019t say anything, not only would I not betray my brothers, but I also get to see your painful and helpless funny appearances, haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018You!\u201d Zhao Xi shouted indignantly, thinking that this was a pervert with bad taste.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, don\u2019t try to preach any big sermon to me. It\u2019s useless to goad.\u201d Huang Chengming smiled disdainfully.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han calmly said, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. There\u2019s really no difference between dying once and dying ten times. Similarly, the operation of the law disregards those with one or more death penalties. We actually don\u2019t need to listen to you. So, it\u2019s not in your hands to decide your point of satisfaction and loss.\u201d (<strong>T/N:</strong> I don\u2019t know how Chinese law works so this was my best guess ^^;;)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Huang Chengming\u2019s facial expression changed, the light in his eyes turning gloomy and cold.</p><br/><p>Seeing his face become ugly, Zhao Xi proudly laughed. \u201cYes, we don\u2019t deny that your confession has referential value for the investigation, but the operation of the legal machine isn\u2019t conditional on your confession, especially in this case. In fact, whether you say it or not, there\u2019s no importance for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you still seeing me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Chengming suddenly roared. Because his hands were locked in the special chair and he couldn\u2019t move, he could only use his feet to constantly kick forward. The two or three prison guards rushed in to suppress him.</p><br/><p>The conversation didn\u2019t go on, and Wei Han and Zhao Xi walked out of the interrogation room.</p><br/><p>Facing a man on death row for the first time, Zhao Xi seemed intimidated. Wei Han patted her and comforted, \u201cLittle Xi, you\u2019re fine. Don\u2019t worry, you did well just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s praise made her taut nerves loosen. Zhao Xi nodded. \u201cYeah, Brother Wei, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wei, did you insist on persuading him because of his sister\u2019s request?\u201d Zhao Xi asked. She knew that Huang Chengming had a younger sister who had always come to beseech Wei Han the last two days.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not just that. This is also one of our jobs.\u201d Wei Han nodded, his face suddenly regaining its strength. \u201cIt\u2019s quite different to die unrepentant and to die knowing they were wrong, dying with dignity. This is what Leader Lu taught me before.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening, Zhao Xi couldn\u2019t help but fall silent.</p><br/><p>Since she\u2019d met Wei Han, Wei Han had always mentioned Sergeant Lu more than once. She had also gone to offer her condolences, but Sergeant Lu was still lying in the hospital and hadn\u2019t woken up. It was said that in the case a year and a half ago, in addition to Wei Han, Sergeant Lu was seriously injured and three police officers were also killed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xi looked down again and saw the ring on Wei Han\u2019s hand. At first, she wasn\u2019t familiar with Wei Han and she hadn\u2019t dared to ask more. Now, she\u2019d become more and more curious. \u201cBrother Wei, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, she could also guess Wei Han\u2019s age. Now asking about his age, she mainly wanted to ask about the ring.</p><br/><p>Wei Han froze and laughed, \u201cOh, I\u2019m twenty-eight, going on thirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this is\u2026\u201d Zhao Xi\u2019s eyes cast on Wei Han\u2019s ring and asked, somewhat embarrassed.</p><br/><p>After noticing her downward glance, Wei Han raised his hands and without any awkwardness, gently rubbed the ring on his finger. \u201cLittle Xi, I won\u2019t hide it from you: I\u2019ve been married for two years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xi couldn\u2019t help but be taken aback. Completely collecting back the remaining thoughts in her heart, she smiled gently. \u201cThat sister-in-law is really blessed. You must be very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to someone bring up that one in his home, Wei Han scratched his head, a brilliance immediately entering his eyes. \u201cHaha, I\u2019m the blessed one. He\u2019s a great beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day, October 26, was Qi Zhifan\u2019s birthday.</p><br/><p>Taking a half day of leave, Qi Zhifan returned home early. And at this time, Wei Han was already busy working in the kitchen for him.</p><br/><p>For almost two years, Wei Han had disliked that it was too childish, pure and tender, so he usually was unwilling to wear the Doraemon apron when he was cooking. But today, he was especially obedient and wore it on his body.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan had a happy heart and clung to Wei Han from behind. He also conveniently buried his head in the hollow of his neck. \u201cIs there some new twist in the delicious things you\u2019re making me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han didn\u2019t startle. He\u2019d long since been accustomed to him, and faintly said a word.</p><br/><p>Because from time to time, the hot air from Qi Zhifan\u2019s breath made him itchy, Wei Han couldn\u2019t bear it and slanted his neck to the side, wanting to push him away. \u201cOdd Trouble, if you\u2019re not helping, then don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan slightly knitted his brows. He found that Wei Han was more and more unafraid of him, rarely listened to him obediently, and his mouth followed to become poisonous. In the past few years, this fool\u2019s frightened little appearance was also barely seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, you used to think of ways to give me a surprise. Are you too lazy to do it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan\u2019s tone carried a lingering bitterness. It was said that married women would become tigresses, and married men were similar. Although Wei Han wasn\u2019t likely to reach the level of a tiger, but the rabbit had become more and more resistant, IQ also improving.</p><br/><p>Wei Han nodded his head as if it was for granted, \u201cWell, I\u2019m lazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qi Zhifan was a little at a loss, and slowly released his hands which were clasped around Wei Han\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of Qi Zhifan\u2019s moment of inattention, Wei Han grinned and suddenly turned around and counterattacked. Faster than words could tell, he took out the handcuffs from his pant pocket and immediately handcuffed Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, does this count as a surprise?\u201d the proud police officer Wei narrowed his eyes and smirked.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>During Qi Zhifan\u2019s birthday in the past two years, the silly Wei Han had carefully prepared various things to win a beauty\u2019s smile. However, the results were all the same: it was the rhythm of not being able to get out of bed the next day.</p><br/><p>After getting married, Qi Zhifan had gradually developed a bit of an S attribute, playing with all kinds of props, and simply wanting to play Wei Han to death ah.</p><br/><p>He remembered that the most excessive time was when they\u2019d gone out to soak in the hot springs. Qi Zhifan had tied him up and also blindfolded him, making Wei Han shoot again and again, his tears running dry, throat going hoarse, and finally passing out.</p><br/><p>Often recalling this unbearable black history, Wei Han blushed and at the same time, became so angry that his teeth ached. Especially as he grew older, his desire to conquer the Great Beauty Qi also grew stronger.</p><br/><p>Lifting up Qi Zhifan\u2019s chin, Wei Han fully appreciated the surprise and astonishment that flashed across Great Beauty Qi\u2019s face. In a rather fine mood: \u201cGood Trouble, bro has always wanted you under me. Why don\u2019t you obediently satisfy me once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished saying this, Wei Han licked Qi Zhifan\u2019s fair and slender neck. Then, tearing off his tie, he pried apart his collar and nipped at Qi Zhifan\u2019s delicate collar bone.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan kneed Wei Han. Wei Han ate pain and didn\u2019t have time to react when Qi Zhifan used his body to press him heavily down to the ground.</p><br/><p>The wrists were shackled, but Qi Zhifan\u2019s hands could still move. Within a few short minutes, he actually took out a key and unlocked himself, handcuffing Wei Han instead and reversing the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Han, you\u2019ve become more and more proficient these past two years. It wouldn\u2019t do if I didn\u2019t guard against you a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Qi Zhifan\u2019s turn to smile this time. The key to Wei Han\u2019s handcuffs, not only does he have it, but Qi Zhifan had long since made a copy.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Wei Han was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Hearing some big movements, Butler Sun thought that something had happened. But when he saw this scene in the kitchen, his face immediately turned red, and he conscientiously retreated, also quietly closed the the rear court door.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan took off Wei Han\u2019s outer pants. Exposing the little white thong inside, he smiled in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Speaking on the topic of thongs, he had been so aroused by the sexy pink thong of those years, that it had gotten out of hand by now. Qi Zhifan had bought twenty-something thongs in various colors for Wei Han, and forced him to wear them everyday.</p><br/><p>Feeling a coolness on his ass, Wei Han\u2019s cells began to issue a warning all over. He quickly laughed apologetically. \u201cGood Trouble, the cake isn\u2019t done yet. Why don\u2019t you let me go first, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t mind. I can slowly do it in your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finger covered with cheese, Qi Zhifan reached into Wei Han\u2019s ass and tried to rotate and grind a few times. Wei Han, whose body had already been trained to be very sensitive, immediately had a reaction. He unconsciously writhed, limply itchy and empty, eagerly craving for something. The little thing in front of him clearly hadn\u2019t been stroked yet, but it also lifted its head slightly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Zhifan covered the entire entrance with his soft lips and sucked hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d the strong stimulus without warning made Wei Han spasm.</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s reaction excited Qi Zhifan even more. His long tongue was as flexible as a snake. He slowly licked open the folds, brushing Wei Han\u2019s contracting inner wall again and again.</p><br/><p>The moist, warm feeling and unbearable sweet taste made him deeply degenerate. Wei Han could only feel his blood flow backwards, even his breath had to stop. \u201c<i>Mn ah ahh </i>deep\u2026<i>mm nhh </i>deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s wanton indulgence gave Qi Zhifan great encouragement. He continued to delve deeper into the interior, slowly finding that most prominent point and stimulating it with the soft tip of his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd, Odd Trouble, I-I can\u2019t, I\u2019m almost, going to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wei Han cried out, his inner thigh tensed for a moment, and the accumulated heat flowed and spurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo fast again. This next time still needs to be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice hadn\u2019t fallen when Qi Zhifan replaced it with his already swollen and hard weapon and immediately pushed in.</p><br/><p>Finally fully receiving Qi Zhifan, gradually, the discomfort of just being entered was also transformed into a deeper desire. The wonderful taste whipped Wei Han in the most intimate place inside his body along with the intense, completely outrageous impact. The feeling of the fierce, hard object ruthlessly crushing him, whether it was entering or pulling out, was extremely vivid and could clearly be pictured in his mind.</p><br/><p>Chasing the joy, Wei Han felt that his bones were quickly hit soft by Qi Zhifan. His waist was limp and painful, but his interior was still tightly clamped. Then, Qi Zhifan pounded into him in unbroken succession until Wei Han sobbed, groaning out an impassioned cry, \u201cOdd, Odd Trouble, I, I want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, Wei Han\u2019s brain crashed, feeling as if he was floating high in the clouds. Both of them exploded, the richly-scented liquid covering both Wei Han and Qi Zhifan\u2019s skin, sweat drenching their skin and the couch.</p><br/><p>As a result, Wei Han\u2019s counterattack this time ended in failure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your hospitality. I\u2019m looking forward to my birthday next year.\u201d Qi Zhifan kissed Wei Han, his look expressing that he\u2019d \u2018eaten\u2019 to his satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Unable to counterattack, but also tormented for a spell, Wei Han was a bit resentful and took a bite on Qi Zhifan\u2019s shoulder, little knowing that this stimulated him even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you still want to?\u201d Qi Zhifan said, the fierce thing under his body beginning to crazily open up the territory again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOdd Trouble, <i>mh ahh</i>, you-you\u2019re assaulting a police officer ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, then you can come sue me, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The invincible great lawyer Qi smiled and said, expressing that he\u2019d never had to defend himself before, but he could try it once.</p><br/><p>In the latter half of the night, gently pushing aside his hair and looking at Wei Han\u2019s quietly sleeping face, Qi Zhifan couldn\u2019t help holding him tightly.</p><br/><p>After experiencing several life-and-death situations, Wei Han had once held Qi Zhifan and cried several times. But later on, his brokenhearted and sad expressions had become less and less, gradually concealing them behind his smiling face.</p><br/><p>Many times, Qi Zhifan had seen this and been very distressed. But this was the route that Wei Han had chosen, and he also always respected his decision.</p><br/><p>Wei Han had indeed changed, but Qi Zhifan thought that Wei Han was still Wei Han. In his eyes, Wei Han would always be the fool who was always doing stupid things and courting death in those years.</p><br/><p>With this in mind, Qi Zhifan whispered in Wei Han\u2019s ear, \u201cFool, you can talk to me about anything. Don\u2019t just shut it in all by yourself. Don\u2019t be unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d The dreaming Wei Han didn\u2019t respond, but he subconsciously arched into Qi Zhifan\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>A cycle later on Wei Han\u2019s birthday, Sergeant Lu, who\u2019d been sleeping for a year and a half, miraculously woke up. At the same time, Qi Zhifan returned home with a husky.</p><br/><p>Looking at the silly dog with its tongue lolling out and shaking its head at him, Wei Han was in a daze. \u201cOdd Trouble, this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan rubbed the dog\u2019s head. \u201cHusky Egg, your birthday present.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy-my birthday present?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han was stunned silly. Wait a minute, what the hell was this silly husky\u2019s name ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to choose such a rotten name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Wei Han\u2019s brows were drawn. Couldn\u2019t they choose a more normal, <i>meng meng</i> dog name?</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan: \u201cWell, it matches you, both stupid and silly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p><span></span></p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Wei Han\u2019s hair was very supple and soft, his eyes very black and bright, his lips red, his teeth white, and his soft, plump face should be able to pinch out flesh with a slight twist, holding would also not press painfully against a person\u2026if his countenance was a little less stubborn, a bit more docile, then that would be better.</p><br/><p>As though bewitched, Qi Zhifan\u2019s eyes became deeper and deeper. He began to feel thirsty, and his own lower body also became unbearably hot.</p><br/><p>Fuck, blame it all on Wei Han for twisting under his body before, what twisting!</p><br/><p>Unable to hold back, Qi Zhifan decisively went to the bathroom and rushed to take a cold shower.</p><br/><p>Returning to his room again, the phone just started to ring. Qi Zhifan saw that it was a call from Lu Yan. He paused and immediately hung up. He was still a little irritated.</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, Lu Yan sent a text message, but Qi Zhifan was too lazy to open it. His attention shifted to the \u201cStomach Cold\u201d call record above.</p><br/><p>Easily pulling out the bedside cabinet drawer, Qi Zhifan saw the pink panties in front of his eyes and began to \u2018see the object, miss the owner\u2019, but this thing was still too\u2026</p><br/><p>Next door in Wei Han\u2019s room, the inexplicably \u201cbullied\u201d for a round Wei Han, tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.</p><br/><p>Constantly thinking about Qi Zhifan\u2019s taunts toward him, Wei Han gnashed his teeth and vowed to exercise himself. When he becomes a police officer, he\u2019d later catch a lot of gangsters and criminals to prove his strength to Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>So, Wei Han\u2019s goals in life, following the fourth item to abuse his love rival, was another item: to become a qualified police officer!</p><hr/><br/><p>In order to increase the freshman\u2019s sense of urgency to review, and to further achieve the desired results in all aspects, the Department of Law organized a pre-exam mobilization meeting and invited some school leaders, instructors, lecturers, and outstanding student representatives from various professions to come.</p><br/><p>After the moderator announced the start of the event, the first to speak would be the leader, followed by the outstanding lecturer representatives, then the outstanding student representatives, and finally, a freshman open question session.</p><br/><p>Among the outstanding student representatives, Qi Zhifan inevitably would be sent out.</p><br/><p>Everyone had no interest in the platitudes of the leading teachers. Ninety percent of the men and women present were there to see Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui sat in the back row in the middle of the auditorium. At the front were the invited leaders and teachers, Qi Zhifan and the other outstanding student representatives, and the graduate students and department heads, who sat in the front row on the far right.</p><br/><p>Finally persisted until Qi Zhifan came up on stage, the drowsy students suddenly became vigorous, their eyes bright. Unlike most people, Wei Han and Jiang Chengrui were still playing on their mobile phones. Jiang Chengrui was intently playing a game, while Wei Han entered into S Uni\u2019s BBS again.</p><br/><p>After the words Wei Han had left last time, the topic was covered by several posts.</p><br/><p>366 post (Wei Han): Qi Zhifan has a lot of shortcomings! Picky eater, grumpy, poisonous tongue\u2026and he certainly must have unknown failings, not yet unearthed!</p><br/><p>367 post: Picky eater? I know that Male God Qi really rarely goes to the school cafeteria.</p><br/><p>368 post: It seems like Qi Zhifan\u2019s elegant and calm appearance hid the nature of his cold, poisonous tongue.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Wei Han nodded and continued looking down.</p><br/><p>369 post: 366 post Great God, kneeling down to beg you for Male God Qi\u2019s cellphone number, QQ number, WeChat ID!</p><br/><p>370 post: Same as the above. In addition, HD uncensored nude photos, have them?</p><br/><p>371 post: I heard that Qi Zhifan is bi? Can you break out pictures of his successive boyfriends and girlfriends?</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Wei Han\u2019s brows trembled and shook: Ah hey, did these people really have no moral integrity? Why did they take him to be some kind of great god!</p><br/><p>372 post: Say, is 366 poster really divine?</p><br/><p>373 post: Heh heh, apparently close to Male God Qi? Can\u2019t help but tell secrets oh.</p><br/><p>374 post: Is it possible that it\u2019s an ex-boy (girl) friend? Or is it an XX friend?</p><br/><p>375 post: Fuck buddies possibly? For example, after a one night stand, fell deeply in love with Qi Zhifan, but Qi Zhifan was heartless, resulting in love becoming hate, now trying to find ways to take revenge\u2026</p><br/><p>376 post: Wow! Suddenly the mind filled out 10,000 words\u2026</p><br/><p>377 post: +1, inexplicably vivid and somewhat reasonable.</p><br/><p>378 post: +2, suddenly train of thought gushed out, want to write fanfiction ah!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Already can\u2019t stand to look anymore, Wei Han\u2019s entire face was colored like pig liver.</p><br/><p>In a short moment, Wei Han\u2019s facial expression repeatedly switched through \u201chappiness, anger, sorrow, and joy\u201d. This really caught Jiang Chengrui\u2019s attention, and he couldn\u2019t help but frequently look askance.</p><br/><p>Ma-Ma, this person seems a little strange.</p><br/><p>Wei Han glanced up at Qi Zhifan who was still speaking on the stage, buzzing in his brain about Qi Zhifan\u2019s own successful experience to guide the students in high efficiency and high quality learning. He didn\u2019t even listen to it. At the bottom of his heart, he repeatedly tried to figure out and decided to once again send out a scoop.</p><br/><p>[Exposing the unknown secrets behind Qi Zhifan]</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan has low blood sugar! Has low blood sugar! ! Has low blood sugar! ! !</p><br/><p>The important thing said three times.</p><br/><p>Not long after the post was sent out, Wei Han refreshed, and there were several replies.</p><br/><p>1st post: <em>Nani</em>? ! You said that he has low blood pressure, I believe it when I get up. Hehe.</p><br/><p>2nd post: Poster, no picture no proof, lying people can swallow a thousand needles ah!</p><br/><p>3rd post: Original poster, are you sure you\u2019re not kidding me? Dare to take Qi Zhifan out to joke, really living courageously!</p><br/><p>Wei Han was startled, then his anger fired up again, and made a statement in the 4th post: I didn\u2019t lie. This is a fact, an ironclad truth! Afterwards, you can confront him face to face, or find a way to read his medical examination form.</p><br/><p>5th post: Original poster, I believe you!</p><br/><p>6th post: With my sixth sense, I think that the original poster is the previous post, the 366 scoop poster!</p><br/><p>7th post: Listening to what the above said, I also\u2026</p><br/><p>8th post: Ao-ao-ao, it\u2019s the legendary \u2018Fuck Buddy Lord 366\u2019?!</p><br/><p>Wei Han: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These people were so formidable that they had so quickly exposed him.</p><br/><p>However, when did he admit to being Qi Zhifan\u2019s fuck buddy? Why does it seem like everyone has already tacitly agreed on this fact ah!</p><br/><p>\u201c366\u201d is what kind of ghost! This alternative name was too casually taken!</p><br/><p>With tingling scalp, Wei Han couldn\u2019t help but reply: Everybody, I\u2019m really not what fuck buddy lord. I am a male. You can call me \u201cPastry Lord\u201d. The brother is happy, there\u2019s a big handful of hot news material.</p><br/><p>10th post: Pastry Lord, I love you!</p><br/><p>11th post: Pastry Lord, you are the coolest and brightest in the world!</p><br/><p>12th post: Pastry Lord, I want to give you a monkey!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Han was silent again.</p><br/><p>Brushing behind the large variety of expressions of love, he suddenly felt that the heavenly people\u2019s curiosity was really strong.</p><br/><p>After looking up at the freely speaking, bearing of a scholar, Qi Zhifan, Wei Han\u2019s mind was filled with only the two words \u201cshow off\u201d. Then he looked around and many people were all looking down at their mobile phone. Wei Han simply played to his bad intentions, and with big explosions, put his exaggeration techniques to full use.</p><br/><p>20th post: Qi Zhifan suffers from low blood sugar. If he doesn\u2019t drink sugar water, doesn\u2019t eat candy for a day, will die on this planet;</p><br/><p>Cannot do strenuous exercise, hand can\u2019t be lifted, shoulder can\u2019t be picked, back can\u2019t be pushed, sickly, delicate prince disease;</p><br/><p>Lacking patience, so not good at fishing;</p><br/><p>Eat men and women! Absolutely a \u2018like the new, hate the old\u2019 slag gong, the frequency of changing boyfriends is quite high; indicated that his attitude is to marry woman and have children.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Here, we urge the majority of male compatriots to recognize his true colors as soon as possible. Don\u2019t jump into the fire pit again, and don\u2019t side with the enemy! Additionally, he likes smart women, so the <b>double Q </b>not high younger sisters, you\u2019re basically out of luck. (T/N: IQ and EQ)</p><br/><p>After such a large pile of words, Wei Han tilted his legs and waited for everyone\u2019s reaction in the BBS. As a result, many messages came out every few minutes. There was shock; there were sighs; there were also younger sisters crying to the heaven, rolling on the earth\u2026incredulously, all sorts of replies blew up the sky.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wei Han now grimacing, now making threatening gestures, performing a series of deranged expressions and actions, Jiang Chengrui became more and more uncomfortable, subconsciously moving his butt to try and get further away from Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Ma-Ma, this person is really strange ah.</p><br/><p>The questioning session had already begun. After the top students in front finished asking for guidance on the top questions related to studying, the mobilization meeting was about to end. Who knew that a ponytail girl would suddenly stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi\u2026Qi Senior. I have something to ask you. Please, you must\u2026honestly\u2026answer me,\u201d the ponytail girl asked in a trembling voice, quite nervous.</p><br/><p>In this situation, to suddenly ask a question, Wei Han seemed to understand why. Heh heh, this would be a good show.</p><br/><p>Unaware of what was going on, Qi Zhifan nodded: \u201cWell, then ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, do you have low blood sugar?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s words were astonishing, throwing out a question that had nothing to do with studying. The audience instantly became quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qi Zhifan was also slightly startled. His eyes narrowed and eyes sharp like knives quickly swept the group and suddenly locked on Wei Han.</p><br/><p>Wei Han, who was waiting to see a joke, was suddenly caught off guard and quivered. With a thief\u2019s guilty conscience, he didn\u2019t dare look at Qi Zhifan face to face, and had to pretend to look around at the scenery.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease\u2026please be sure to answer me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Zhifan had not spoken yet, the ponytail girl added another sentence.</p><br/><p>Many of those who\u2019d seen the scoop also held their breath, quietly waiting for Qi Zhifan.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Zhifan lightly nodded his head, and the people present saw it clearly.</p><br/><p>The event ended in an uproar. The teachers and students who had come had basically all left. There were still some students from the student union department who were tidying up the venue. Qi Zhifan also hadn\u2019t left yet, a person standing silently by the window, his whole body shrouded in a \u2018stranger do not approach\u2019 aura.</p><br/><p>Department Head Liu of the Learning Department stared at him for a moment, still carried a paper cup and forcing a laugh, handed him the cup of water.</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan conveniently took a sip, and his facial expression suddenly changed: \u201cWhat did you give me to drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sugar water, don\u2019t you need to drink it everyday?\u201d Department Head Liu asked, and feeling very sorry for him, patted Qi Zhifan, \u201cYou\u2019ve just worked hard. One person talking for so long, you must be thirsty. In fact, I\u2019m mainly concerned that you\u2019re really tired out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Zhifan tried to explain, but was interrupted by Department Head Liu. He waved his hand, not minding him. \u201cAi, Zhifan, it hasn\u2019t been easy for you, hiding your low blood sugar for so long. Isn\u2019t it just having an illness? It\u2019s alright, alright. Nowadays, everyone more or less all have some small ailments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, like I am a typical OCD patient,\u201d Department Head Zhang of the Organization Department joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have procrastination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere\u2019s amnesia, and then eye cancer, hand cancer, terminal lazy cancer, incurable.\u201d</p><br/><p>I am red-green colorblind, plus indirect depression.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>Pop</em>!\u201d Qi Zhifan squeezed flat the paper cup in his hand.</p><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}
